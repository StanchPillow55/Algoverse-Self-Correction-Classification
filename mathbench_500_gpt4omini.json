For example, we could find the prime factorization of 240. Here\u2019s how we would do that:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe want to find the prime factorization of the number 240. Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of its prime numbers.\n\n### Step 2: Dividing by the Smallest Prime Number\nWe start by dividing 240 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n\n\\[\n240 \\div 2 = 120\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Continuing to Divide by 2\nWe continue dividing by 2 since 120 is also even.\n\n\\[\n120 \\div 2 = 60\n\\]\n\n\\[\n60 \\div 2 = 30\n\\]\n\n\\[\n30 \\div 2 = 15\n\\]\n\nAt this point, 15 is not divisible by 2 anymore, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.\n\n### Step 4: Dividing by 3\nNow we divide 15 by 3.\n\n\\[\n15 \\div 3 = 5\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Identifying the Last Prime Number\nNow we have reached 5, which is a prime number itself. \n\n### Step 6: Writing the Prime Factorization\nNow we can write the prime factorization of 240. We have divided 240 as follows:\n\n\\[\n240 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 5\n\\]\n\nThis can also be expressed using exponents for repeated factors:\n\n\\[\n240 = 2^4 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe prime factorization of 240 is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2^4 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1}\n\\]\n\nIf you meant a different type of math problem involving the number 240, please provide more details, and I would be happy to assist further!",

However, I will assume you want me to demonstrate how to solve a math problem that could be related to the number 360. \n\nLet's consider a common type of problem involving the number 360: finding the prime factorization of 360.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Prime Factorization\nPrime factorization is the process of expressing a number as the product of its prime factors. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.\n\n### Step 2: Start with the Number\nWe start with the number 360.\n\n### Step 3: Divide by the Smallest Prime Number\nThe smallest prime number is 2. We check if 360 is divisible by 2:\n\n\\[\n360 \\div 2 = 180\n\\]\n\nSince 360 is even, we can divide by 2 again:\n\n\\[\n180 \\div 2 = 90\n\\]\n\nWe can divide by 2 one more time:\n\n\\[\n90 \\div 2 = 45\n\\]\n\nNow, 45 is not even, so we move to the next prime number, which is 3.\n\n### Step 4: Divide by 3\nWe check if 45 is divisible by 3:\n\n\\[\n45 \\div 3 = 15\n\\]\n\nWe can divide by 3 again:\n\n\\[\n15 \\div 3 = 5\n\\]\n\nNow we are left with 5, which is a prime number.\n\n### Step 5: Compile the Prime Factors\nNow we can compile all the prime factors we have found:\n\n- From the divisions by 2: \\(2^3\\) (since we divided by 2 three times)\n- From the divisions by 3: \\(3^2\\) (since we divided by 3 two times)\n- The last factor is 5, which is \\(5^1\\).\n\n### Step 6: Write the Prime Factorization\nPutting it all together, the prime factorization of 360 is:\n\n\\[\n360 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe prime factorization of 360 is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5}\n\\] \n\nThis concludes the problem-solving process for the prime factorization of 360. If you have a different math problem in mind, please provide more details, and I would be happy to assist!",

However, I can demonstrate how to solve a sample math problem involving the number 420. \n\nLet's consider a problem where we need to find the prime factorization of 420.\n\n### Step 1: Start with the number 420\nWe want to break down 420 into its prime factors.\n\n### Step 2: Divide by the smallest prime number\nThe smallest prime number is 2. We check if 420 is divisible by 2:\n- 420 is even, so it is divisible by 2.\n\nNow, we divide:\n\\[ \n420 \\div 2 = 210 \n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Continue factoring\nNext, we take 210 and check if it is divisible by 2:\n- 210 is also even, so we divide by 2 again.\n\n\\[ \n210 \\div 2 = 105 \n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Check the next smallest prime number\nNow we have 105. It is not even, so we check the next smallest prime number, which is 3:\n- To check divisibility by 3, we can sum the digits of 105: \\(1 + 0 + 5 = 6\\), which is divisible by 3.\n\nNow, we divide:\n\\[ \n105 \\div 3 = 35 \n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Factor 35\nNext, we take 35 and check for divisibility by the next smallest prime number, which is 5:\n- 35 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.\n\nNow, we divide:\n\\[ \n35 \\div 5 = 7 \n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Identify the last factor\nNow we have 7, which is a prime number itself.\n\n### Step 7: Compile the prime factors\nPutting it all together, we have:\n- From 420, we divided by 2 twice, then by 3, then by 5, and finally we reached 7.\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 420 is:\n\\[ \n420 = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1 \n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe prime factorization of 420 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1}\n\\] \n\nIf you have a specific math problem in mind related to the number 420, please provide more details, and I would be happy to help!",
