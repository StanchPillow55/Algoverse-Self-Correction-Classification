--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): The problem doesn't provide any specific question or operation to be performed on the number 225. However, if we are to find the square root of 225, here's how we can proceed:

The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. 

To find the square root of 225, we can use the method of prime factorization.

First, let's find the prime factors of 225:

225 = 5 x 45
    = 5 x 5 x 9
    = 5 x 5 x 3 x 3

So, the prime factorizat...
