Final Answer: It seems like the question is a bit vague as it only states "Sample math problem 450" without providing any specific details or context. To assist you effectively, I will create a sample math problem that could be labeled as "450" and solve it step by step.

### Sample Math Problem:
**Problem 450:** Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

### Step 1: Understand the Formula
The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

### Step 2: Identify the Values
From the problem, we have:
- Base \( b = 10 \) units
- Height \( h = 5 \) units

### Step 3: Substitute the Values into the Formula
Now, we will substitute the values of the base and height into the area formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
\]

### Step 4: Perform the Calculations
First, calculate the product of the base and height:
\[
10 \times 5 = 50
\]
Next, multiply by \( \frac{1}{2} \):
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
\]

### Final Answer
The area of the triangle is:
\[
\boxed{25} \text{ square units}
\]
