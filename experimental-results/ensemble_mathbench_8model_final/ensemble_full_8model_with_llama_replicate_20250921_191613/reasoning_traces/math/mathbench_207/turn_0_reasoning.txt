Sample Math Problem 207:

Given information:
- There are 12 apples in a basket.
- 3 apples are taken out of the basket.
- The remaining apples are divided equally among 4 people.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many apples each person gets.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apples remaining in the basket after 3 apples are taken out.
Number of apples remaining = 12 - 3 = 9 apples...
