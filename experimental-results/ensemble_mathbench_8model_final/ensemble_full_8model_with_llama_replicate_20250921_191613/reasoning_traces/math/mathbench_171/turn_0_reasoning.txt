Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's work through this math problem step-by-step.

Sample Math Problem 171:

Given information:
- The sum of three consecutive integers is 171.

To solve this problem, we need to find the three consecutive integers.

Let's represent the first integer as x.
Then, the second integer would be x + 1, and the third integer would be x + 2.

The sum of the three consecutive integers is 171, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 171

Si...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): Without a specific problem related to the number 171, I'll assume you want to factorize it.

To factorize a number, we need to find the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number. 

Step 1: Start by dividing the number by the smallest prime number, which is 2. If the number is not divisible by 2 (which is the case for 171), move to the next prime number, which is 3.

Step 2: Divide 171 by 3. The result is 57. So, 3 is a factor of 171.

Step 3: Now, w...
