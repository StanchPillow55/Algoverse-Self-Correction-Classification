--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): Without a specific problem provided, I'll create one using the number 35.

Problem: If a car travels at a constant speed of 35 miles per hour, how far will it travel in 5 hours?

Solution:

This problem involves the formula for distance, which is speed multiplied by time.

Given:
Speed = 35 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

We need to find the distance. So, we substitute the given values into the formula:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 35 miles/hour * 5 hours

The "hours" u...
