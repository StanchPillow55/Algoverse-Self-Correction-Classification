=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: It seems like the question is a bit vague, as "Sample math problem 360" does not specify what kind of math problem we are dealing with. However, I can create a sample math problem involving the number 360 and solve it step by step. 

Let's consider a problem involving the number 360 in the context of finding its prime factorization.

### Problem: Find the prime factorization of 360.

**Step 1: Start with the number 360.**

We will divide 360 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

**Step 2: Divide by 2.**

\[
360 \div 2 = 180
\]

So, we can write:

\[
360 = 2 \times 180
\]

**Step 3: Continue factoring 180.**

Now, we take 180 and divide it by 2 again:

\[
180 \div 2 = 90
\]

So, we can update our factorization:

\[
360 = 2 \times 2 \times 90 = 2^2 \times 90
\]

**Step 4: Factor 90.**

Next, we factor 90. We can divide it by 2 once more:

\[
90 \div 2 = 45
\]

Now we have:

\[
360 = 2^2 \times 2 \times 45 = 2^3 \times 45
\]

**Step 5: Factor 45.**

Now we factor 45. The smallest prime number that divides 45 is 3:

\[
45 \div 3 = 15
\]

So we can write:

\[
360 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 15
\]

**Step 6: Factor 15.**

Next, we factor 15. The smallest prime number that divides 15 is again 3:

\[
15 \div 3 = 5
\]

So we can update our factorization:

\[
360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5
\]

**Step 7: Combine all factors.**

Now we have completely factored 360 into its prime factors:

\[
360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^1
\]

### Final Answer:

The prime factorization of 360 is:

\[
\boxed{2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5}
\] 

This concludes the step-by-step solution to the problem involving the number 360.
