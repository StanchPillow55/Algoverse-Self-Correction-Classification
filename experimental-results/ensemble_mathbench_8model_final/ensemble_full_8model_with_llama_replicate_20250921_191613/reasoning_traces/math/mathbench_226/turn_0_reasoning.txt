Sample Math Problem 226:

Given information:
- There are 12 apples in a basket.
- 4 apples are red and the rest are green.
- How many green apples are in the basket?

Step 1: Determine the total number of apples in the basket.
Total apples = 12

Step 2: Determine the number of green apples in the basket.
Number of green apples = Total apples - Number of red apples
Number of green apples = 12 - ...

--- Model 8 Response ---
Model 8 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): I'm happy to help solve this math problem! Let's break it down step-by-step. Here is sample math problem 226:

Mia is twice as old as Liam. Three years from now, the sum of their ages will be 42. How old is Liam now?

To solve this, let's first define variables for their current ages:
Let m = Mia's current age
Let l = Liam's current age  

The problem gives us two key pieces of information:
1. Mia is twice as old as Liam. This can be expressed as: m = ...
