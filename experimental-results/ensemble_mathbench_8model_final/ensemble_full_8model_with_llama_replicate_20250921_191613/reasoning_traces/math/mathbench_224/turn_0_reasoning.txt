--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): Without a specific problem provided, I'll create a problem using the number 224.

Problem: Divide 224 by 8.

Step 1: Identify the dividend and the divisor. In this case, 224 is the dividend (the number to be divided) and 8 is the divisor (the number we are dividing by).

Step 2: Divide 224 by 8. 

To do this, we can break down 224 into a number that can be easily divided by 8. 

We know that 8 times 10 is 80, and 8 times 20 is 160. Adding these together, we get 240, which...
