--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): Without a specific math problem related to the number 112, I'll create a problem for demonstration purposes. 

Problem: Divide 112 by 4.

Step 1: Identify the dividend and the divisor. In this case, 112 is the dividend (the number to be divided) and 4 is the divisor (the number we are dividing by).

Step 2: Divide the dividend by the divisor. 

112 รท 4 = 28

So, 112 divided by 4 equals 28. 

Final Answer: 28
