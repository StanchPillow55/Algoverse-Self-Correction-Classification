Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's work through this math problem step-by-step.

Sample Math Problem 20:
A bakery sells 3 types of cookies: chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, and peanut butter. Each type of cookie costs $2.50 per dozen. If a customer buys 2 dozen chocolate chip cookies, 3 dozen oatmeal raisin cookies, and 1 dozen peanut butter cookies, how much will the customer pay in total?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each type of cookie and then...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 20" refers to.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): Without a specific problem provided, I'll create one for demonstration.

Problem: Solve for x in the equation 3x - 7 = 2x + 5.

Step 1: The first step is to isolate the variable x. To do this, we subtract 2x from both sides of the equation to get rid of the 2x on the right side. 

3x - 2x - 7 = 2x - 2x + 5

This simplifies to:

x - 7 = 5

Step 2: Next, we add 7 to both sides of the equation to isolate x.

x - 7 + 7 = 5 + 7

This simplifies to:

x = 12

So, the solution to...
