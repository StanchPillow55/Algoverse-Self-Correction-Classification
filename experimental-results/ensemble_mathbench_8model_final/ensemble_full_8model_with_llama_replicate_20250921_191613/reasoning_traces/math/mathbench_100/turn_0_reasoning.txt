--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 100" means. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves basic arithmetic or algebra, given the context of "100" in the problem statement. Let's consider a few possibilities and solve them:

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem
Let's assume the problem is simply to calculate the value of 100.

**Solution:**
- The number 100 is already in its simplest form.
- Therefor...
