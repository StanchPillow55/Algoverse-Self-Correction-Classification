--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): Without a specific math problem provided, I'll create one using the number 52.

Problem: If a train travels at a constant speed of 52 miles per hour, how far does it travel in 3.5 hours?

Solution:

This is a problem of distance, speed, and time. The formula to calculate distance is:

Distance = Speed x Time

We know the speed of the train is 52 miles per hour and the time is 3.5 hours. 

So, we substitute these values into the formula:

Distance = 52 miles/hour x 3.5 hou...
