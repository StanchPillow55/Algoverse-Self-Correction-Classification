=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: It seems like the question is asking for a solution to a math problem labeled "240," but it does not specify what the problem is. To provide a complete and thorough response, I will assume that you want to solve a math problem related to the number 240. 

Let's consider a few potential problems involving the number 240, and I will solve one of them step by step.

### Problem: Factor the number 240

**Step 1: Find the prime factorization of 240.**

To find the prime factorization, we can divide 240 by the smallest prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. Start with 240. The smallest prime number is 2.
   \[
   240 \div 2 = 120
   \]
2. Divide 120 by 2 again.
   \[
   120 \div 2 = 60
   \]
3. Divide 60 by 2 again.
   \[
   60 \div 2 = 30
   \]
4. Divide 30 by 2 again.
   \[
   30 \div 2 = 15
   \]
5. Now, 15 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next prime number, which is 3.
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
6. Finally, 5 is a prime number.

So, we can express 240 as:
\[
240 = 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 5^1
\]

**Step 2: Verify the factorization.**

To verify, we can multiply the prime factors back together:
\[
2^4 = 16, \quad 3^1 = 3, \quad 5^1 = 5
\]
Now multiply:
\[
16 \times 3 = 48
\]
\[
48 \times 5 = 240
\]
This confirms that our factorization is correct.

### Final Answer

The prime factorization of 240 is:
\[
\boxed{2^4 \times 3^1 \times 5^1}
\]
