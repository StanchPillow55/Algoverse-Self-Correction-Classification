--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): Without a specific math problem provided, I'll create a problem using the number 56 and solve it.

Problem: If a car travels at a speed of 56 miles per hour, how far will it travel in 3.5 hours?

Solution:

The distance a vehicle travels is calculated by multiplying the speed of the vehicle by the time it travels. This is based on the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

In this case, the speed of the car is 56 miles per hour and the time is 3.5 hours. So, we substitute the...
