--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): Without a specific math problem provided, I'll create one for demonstration purposes.

Problem: Solve for x in the equation 3x + 5 = 20.

Step 1: The first step is to isolate the term with the variable x. To do this, we need to get rid of the "+5" on the left side of the equation. We can do this by performing the inverse operation, which is subtraction. We subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to keep it balanced.

3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5

This simplifies to:

3x = 15
