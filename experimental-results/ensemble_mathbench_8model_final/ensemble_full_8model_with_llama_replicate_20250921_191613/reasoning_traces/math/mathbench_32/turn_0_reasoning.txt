--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): Without a specific problem provided, I'll create a problem related to the number 32.

Problem: If a car travels at a constant speed of 32 miles per hour, how far will it travel in 2.5 hours?

Solution:

This problem involves the basic concept of speed, which is distance over time. The formula for this is:

Speed = Distance / Time

We can rearrange this formula to solve for distance:

Distance = Speed * Time

We know the speed is 32 miles per hour and the time is 2.5 hours...
