=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: It seems like your question is a bit vague, as "Sample math problem 480" does not specify a particular math problem to solve. However, I can demonstrate how to solve a sample math problem step by step. 

Let's create a sample math problem involving basic arithmetic and algebra. 

**Sample Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step 1: Isolate the variable term.**
To isolate \( 3x \), we need to eliminate the constant on the left side. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.

\[
3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x = 15
\]

**Step 2: Solve for \( x \).**
Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.

\[
\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 5
\]

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
