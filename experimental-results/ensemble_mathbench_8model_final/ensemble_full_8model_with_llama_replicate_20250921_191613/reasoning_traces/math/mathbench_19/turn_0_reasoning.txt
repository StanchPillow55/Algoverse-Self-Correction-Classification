--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): Without a specific problem provided, I'll create a problem to solve.

Problem: Solve for x in the equation 3x - 7 = 2x + 5.

Step 1: The first step is to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 2x from both sides of the equation to get:

3x - 2x = 7 + 5

This simplifies to:

x = 7 + 5

Step 2: Now, we just need to solve for x by adding 7 and 5 together:

x = 12

So, the solution to the equation 3x - 7 = 2x + 5 is x = 12.
