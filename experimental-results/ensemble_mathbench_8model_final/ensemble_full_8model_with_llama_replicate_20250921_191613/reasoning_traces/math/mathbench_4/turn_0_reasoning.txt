--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): Without a specific math problem provided, I'll create one for demonstration purposes.

Problem: Solve for x in the equation 3x - 7 = 20.

Step 1: Identify the problem
The problem is asking us to solve for x in the equation 3x - 7 = 20.

Step 2: Isolate the variable
To isolate the variable x, we need to get rid of the -7 on the left side of the equation. We do this by adding 7 to both sides of the equation. This gives us:

3x - 7 + 7 = 20 + 7
3x = 27

Step 3: Solve for x
