=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 441," we first need to clarify what the specific problem is. Since the problem statement is not provided, I will assume it is a mathematical problem involving the number 441. 

Let's explore a few mathematical aspects related to the number 441 and solve a problem involving it.

### Step 1: Factorization of 441
First, we can find the prime factorization of 441.

1. **Check divisibility by small prime numbers:**
   - 441 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - Sum of digits of 441: \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\) (which is divisible by 3), so we check for divisibility by 3.
   - Dividing 441 by 3:
     \[
     441 \div 3 = 147
     \]
   - Now, we factor 147:
     - Sum of digits of 147: \(1 + 4 + 7 = 12\) (also divisible by 3).
     - Dividing 147 by 3:
     \[
     147 \div 3 = 49
     \]
   - Now, we factor 49:
     - \(49 = 7 \times 7\) or \(7^2\).

2. **Putting it all together:**
   - Thus, the prime factorization of 441 is:
   \[
   441 = 3^2 \times 7^2
   \]

### Step 2: Finding the Square Root of 441
Next, we can find the square root of 441.

1. **Using the prime factorization:**
   - Since \(441 = 3^2 \times 7^2\), we can find the square root:
   \[
   \sqrt{441} = \sqrt{3^2 \times 7^2} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

### Step 3: Verifying the Square Root
To verify, we can square 21:
\[
21^2 = 441
\]
This confirms that our square root calculation is correct.

### Final Answer
The prime factorization of 441 is \(3^2 \times 7^2\), and the square root of 441 is \(21\).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{The square root of 441 is } 21.
\]
