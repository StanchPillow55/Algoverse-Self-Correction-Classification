Final Answer: It seems like the question you provided is a bit vague, as "Sample math problem 400" does not specify a particular math problem or equation to solve. To assist you effectively, I will create a sample math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's consider the following problem:

**Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step 1: Understand the formula for the area of a triangle.**
The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

**Step 2: Identify the values for the base and height.**
From the problem, we have:
- Base = 10 units
- Height = 5 units

**Step 3: Substitute the values into the formula.**
Now we will substitute the values of the base and height into the area formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
\]

**Step 4: Perform the calculations.**
First, calculate \( 10 \times 5 \):
\[
10 \times 5 = 50
\]
Now, substitute this back into the area formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50
\]
Next, calculate \( \frac{1}{2} \times 50 \):
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
\]

**Step 5: State the final answer.**
The area of the triangle is:
\[
\boxed{25} \text{ square units}
\]

If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it step by step!
