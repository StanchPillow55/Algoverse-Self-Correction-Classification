--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): Without a specific problem to solve, I'll create one using the number 210.

Problem: Divide 210 by 7.

Step 1: Identify the dividend and the divisor. In this case, 210 is the dividend (the number being divided) and 7 is the divisor (the number we are dividing by).

Step 2: Divide 210 by 7. 

210 รท 7 = 30

So, the answer to the problem "Divide 210 by 7" is 30.
