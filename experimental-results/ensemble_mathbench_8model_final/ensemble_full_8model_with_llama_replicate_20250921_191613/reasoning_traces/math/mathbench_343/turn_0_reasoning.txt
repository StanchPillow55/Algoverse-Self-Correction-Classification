--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): The problem "Sample math problem 343" is not clear. It does not provide any context or details about what needs to be solved. 

If 343 is the problem itself and we are asked to find the cube root, then the solution would be as follows:

The cube root of a number is a value that, when cubed (multiplied by itself twice), gives the original number. 

So, we need to find a number that, when cubed, gives 343. 

By knowing our cubes, we can identify that 7 cubed (7*7*7) equals ...
