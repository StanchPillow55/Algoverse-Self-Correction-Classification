--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): The problem statement "Sample math problem 144" is not clear. It does not provide a specific question or problem to solve. 

If you're asking for the square root of 144, here's how you would solve it:

The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. 

So, we're looking for a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 144.

The square root of 144 is 12 because 12 * 12 = 144.

So, the square root of 144 is 12.
