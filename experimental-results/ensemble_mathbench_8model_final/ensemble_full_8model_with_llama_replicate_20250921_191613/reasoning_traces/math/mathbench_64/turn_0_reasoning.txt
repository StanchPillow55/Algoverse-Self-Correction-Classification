--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the sample math problem "64," we need to first interpret what the problem is asking. Since "64" is just a number, let's consider a few different mathematical contexts where "64" might be relevant and solve accordingly.

### Context 1: Square Root
If the problem is asking for the square root of 64, we proceed as follows:

1. **Understanding the Square Root**: The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).
2. **Calculate the Squar...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): Without any context or specific problem, I'm assuming you're asking for the square root of 64.

The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. 

In this case, we're looking for the square root of 64. 

We know that 8 * 8 = 64. 

So, the square root of 64 is 8. 

Final Answer: The square root of 64 is 8.

--- Model 8 Response ---
Model 8 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): I apologize, but I don't have a specific "Sample math problem 64" in my knowledge base. Could you please provide the actual math problem you would like me to solve? I'd be happy to work through it step-by-step, show all calculations, explain my reasoning, and provide the final answer once I have the problem details. Just let me know what the problem is, and I'll do my best to assist you.
