--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): The problem doesn't specify what needs to be done with the number 361. However, since 361 is a perfect square, I'll demonstrate how to find its square root.

The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. In this case, we're looking for the square root of 361.

To find the square root of 361, you could use long division method, prime factorization, or a calculator. However, if you know your multiplication tables well, yo...
