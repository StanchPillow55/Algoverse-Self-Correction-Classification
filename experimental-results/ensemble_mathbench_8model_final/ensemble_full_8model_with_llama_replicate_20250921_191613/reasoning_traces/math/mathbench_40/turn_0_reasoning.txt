--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): Without a specific problem provided, I'll create a problem related to the number 40 and solve it.

Problem: If a car travels at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour, how far will it travel in 2.5 hours?

Solution:

This is a problem of distance, speed, and time. The relationship between these three quantities is given by the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

We know the speed of the car is 40 miles per hour and the time is 2.5 hours. We can substitute these values into ...
