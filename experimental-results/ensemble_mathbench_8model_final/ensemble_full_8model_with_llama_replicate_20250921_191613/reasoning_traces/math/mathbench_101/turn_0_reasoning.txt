--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): Without a specific math problem provided, I'll create one for the purpose of this demonstration.

Problem: Solve for x in the equation 3x + 5 = 20.

Step 1: The first step is to isolate the term with the variable. In this case, we want to get '3x' by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we subtract '5' from both sides of the equation. 

3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5

This simplifies to:

3x = 15

Step 2: Now, we want to solve for 'x'. To do this, we divide both sides of ...
