=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: It seems like you haven't provided a specific math problem to solve. However, I can guide you through a generic example of a math problem, showing all the steps and reasoning involved. 

Let's consider a sample problem:

**Problem: Solve for x in the equation: 2x + 5 = 15.**

### Step 1: Understand the equation
We have a linear equation where we need to isolate the variable \( x \). The equation is:

\[ 2x + 5 = 15 \]

### Step 2: Isolate the term with x
To isolate the term with \( x \), we first need to eliminate the constant on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides.

\[ 2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2x = 10 \]

### Step 3: Solve for x
Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.

\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{10}{2} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = 5 \]

### Step 4: Verify the solution
To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

\[ 2(5) + 5 = 15 \]

Calculating the left side:

\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer
Thus, the solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is:

\[ x = 5 \]

If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide it, and I will work through it step by step!
