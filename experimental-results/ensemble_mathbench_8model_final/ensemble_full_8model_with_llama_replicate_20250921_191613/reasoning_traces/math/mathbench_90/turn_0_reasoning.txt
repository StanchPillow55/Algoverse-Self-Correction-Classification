=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: It seems like your request is a bit vague, as "Sample math problem 90" does not specify a particular math problem to solve. However, I can demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. 

Let’s create a sample math problem and solve it. 

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step 1: Identify the formula for the area of a triangle.**
The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

**Step 2: Substitute the given values into the formula.**
Here, the base is 10 units and the height is 5 units. Plugging these values into the formula gives:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
\]

**Step 3: Perform the multiplication.**
First, calculate \( 10 \times 5 \):
\[
10 \times 5 = 50
\]
Now, substitute this back into the area formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the final area.**
Now, divide 50 by 2:
\[
A = 25
\]

**Final Answer:**
The area of the triangle is \( 25 \) square units.

If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it step by step!

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): Without a specific problem provided, I'll create a problem related to the number 90.

Problem: A group of 90 students went on a field trip. If 2/3 of the students are girls, how many boys went on the field trip?

Solution:

First, we need to find out how many girls went on the field trip. We know that 2/3 of the students are girls. 

To find 2/3 of 90, we multiply:

2/3 * 90 = 60

So, there are 60 girls who went on the field trip.

Next, we need to find out how many boys ...
