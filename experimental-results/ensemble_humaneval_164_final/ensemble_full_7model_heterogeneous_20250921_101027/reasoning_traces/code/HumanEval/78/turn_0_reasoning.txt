=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of counting the number of prime hexadecimal digits in a given hexadecimal string, we can break down the task into several clear steps:

1. **Understanding Hexadecimal Digits**: Hexadecimal digits range from '0' to '9' and 'A' to 'F'. In decimal, these correspond to:
   - '0' = 0
   - '1' = 1
   - '2' = 2
   - '3' = 3
   - '4' = 4
   - '5' = 5
   - '6' = 6
   - '7' = 7
   - '8' = 8
   - '9' = 9
   - 'A' = 10
   - 'B' = 11
   - 'C' = 12
   - 'D' = 13
   - 'E' = 14
   - 'F' = 15

2. **Identifying Prime Hexadecimal Digits**: The prime numbers that correspond to hexadecimal digits are:
   - '2' (2 in decimal)
   - '3' (3 in decimal)
   - '5' (5 in decimal)
   - '7' (7 in decimal)
   - 'B' (11 in decimal)
   - 'D' (13 in decimal)

3. **Input Handling**: The function will accept a string input that represents a hexadecimal number. We need to handle the case where the input might be an empty string.

4. **Counting Primes**: We will iterate through each character in the input string, check if it is one of the prime hexadecimal digits, and maintain a count of how many such digits we encounter.

5. **Return the Count**: Finally, we will return the count of prime hexadecimal digits.

Now, let's implement this logic in the `hex_key` function.

```python
def hex_key(num):
    """Count the number of prime hexadecimal digits in the given hexadecimal string."""
    
    # Define the set of prime hexadecimal digits
    prime_hex_digits = {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}
    
    # Initialize a counter for prime digits
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in num:
        # Check if the character is in the set of prime hexadecimal digits
        if char in prime_hex_digits:
            count += 1
            
    return count
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:
- We define a set `prime_hex_digits` containing the prime hexadecimal digits for quick lookup.
- We initialize a counter `count` to zero.
- We loop through each character in the input string `num`.
- For each character, we check if it is in the `prime_hex_digits` set. If it is, we increment our counter.
- Finally, we return the count of prime hexadecimal digits.

### Testing the Function:
You can test the function with the provided examples to ensure it works correctly:

```python
print(hex_key("AB"))        # Output: 1
print(hex_key("1077E"))     # Output: 2
print(hex_key("ABED1A33"))  # Output: 4
print(hex_key("123456789ABCDEF0"))  # Output: 6
print(hex_key("2020"))      # Output: 2
```

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, leveraging a set for O(1) average-time complexity lookups for prime digits.
