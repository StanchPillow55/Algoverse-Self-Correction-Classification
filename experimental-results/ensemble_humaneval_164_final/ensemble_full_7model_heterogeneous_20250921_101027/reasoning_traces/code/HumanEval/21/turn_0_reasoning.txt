=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of rescaling a list of numbers to a unit range [0, 1], we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps involved:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to transform a list of numbers such that the smallest number in the list becomes 0 and the largest number becomes 1. 
   - This is a linear transformation that can be expressed mathematically.

2. **Mathematical Transformation**:
   - Given a number \( x \) in the list, we can rescale it using the formula:
     \[
     \text{rescaled}(x) = \frac{x - \text{min}}{\text{max} - \text{min}}
     \]
   - Here, `min` is the smallest number in the list and `max` is the largest number.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - First, we need to find the minimum and maximum values in the list.
   - Then, we will apply the transformation to each number in the list using a list comprehension.
   - Finally, we will return the new list of rescaled numbers.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem states that the list will have at least two elements, so we do not need to handle cases with fewer elements.
   - We should also consider cases where all numbers are the same, but since the problem guarantees at least two elements, this will not cause an issue in our implementation.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function `rescale_to_unit` based on the reasoning above.

```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.
    
    >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
    [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
    """
    # Step 1: Find the minimum and maximum values in the list
    min_value = min(numbers)
    max_value = max(numbers)
    
    # Step 2: Apply the rescaling formula to each number
    rescaled_numbers = [(x - min_value) / (max_value - min_value) for x in numbers]
    
    return rescaled_numbers
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We import `List` from `typing` to specify the type of the input parameter.
- The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of floats as input.
- We calculate the minimum and maximum values using the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions.
- We use a list comprehension to apply the rescaling formula to each element in the list.
- Finally, we return the new list of rescaled numbers.

### Testing the Function
To ensure that our function works correctly, we can run the provided example and additional test cases:

```python
print(rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]))  # Expected: [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
print(rescale_to_unit([10.0, 20.0, 30.0]))          # Expected: [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]
print(rescale_to_unit([-5.0, 0.0, 5.0]))            # Expected: [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]
print(rescale_to_unit([100.0, 200.0, 300.0, 400.0])) # Expected: [0.0, 0.333..., 0.666..., 1.0]
```

This implementation should work correctly for the given problem statement and any valid input as specified.
