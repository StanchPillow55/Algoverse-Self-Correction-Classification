=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of converting GPAs to letter grades based on the provided grading scale, we can break down the task into a series of logical steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Input and Output
- **Input**: A list of GPAs (floating-point numbers).
- **Output**: A list of corresponding letter grades (strings) based on the GPA grading scale provided.

### Step 2: Define the Grading Scale
We need to create a mapping from GPA ranges to letter grades. The grading scale provided is as follows:
- 4.0 -> 'A+'
- > 3.7 -> 'A'
- > 3.3 -> 'A-'
- > 3.0 -> 'B+'
- > 2.7 -> 'B'
- > 2.3 -> 'B-'
- > 2.0 -> 'C+'
- > 1.7 -> 'C'
- > 1.3 -> 'C-'
- > 1.0 -> 'D+'
- > 0.7 -> 'D'
- > 0.0 -> 'D-'
- 0.0 -> 'E'

### Step 3: Implement the Logic
We will iterate through each GPA in the input list and determine the corresponding letter grade using conditional statements. We can use a series of `if-elif` statements to check the GPA against the thresholds defined in the grading scale.

### Step 4: Create the Function
We will define the function `numerical_letter_grade(grades)` that takes a list of GPAs and returns a list of letter grades.

### Step 5: Implementation
Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above.

```python
def numerical_letter_grade(grades):
    """Convert a list of GPAs to letter grades based on a specific grading scale."""
    letter_grades = []
    
    for gpa in grades:
        if gpa == 4.0:
            letter_grades.append('A+')
        elif gpa > 3.7:
            letter_grades.append('A')
        elif gpa > 3.3:
            letter_grades.append('A-')
        elif gpa > 3.0:
            letter_grades.append('B+')
        elif gpa > 2.7:
            letter_grades.append('B')
        elif gpa > 2.3:
            letter_grades.append('B-')
        elif gpa > 2.0:
            letter_grades.append('C+')
        elif gpa > 1.7:
            letter_grades.append('C')
        elif gpa > 1.3:
            letter_grades.append('C-')
        elif gpa > 1.0:
            letter_grades.append('D+')
        elif gpa > 0.7:
            letter_grades.append('D')
        elif gpa > 0.0:
            letter_grades.append('D-')
        elif gpa == 0.0:
            letter_grades.append('E')
    
    return letter_grades

# Example usage:
print(numerical_letter_grade([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]))  # Output: ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']
```

### Explanation of the Code
- We define an empty list `letter_grades` to store the results.
- We loop through each GPA in the input list `grades`.
- For each GPA, we check it against the grading scale using `if-elif` statements.
- Depending on the GPA value, we append the corresponding letter grade to the `letter_grades` list.
- Finally, we return the list of letter grades.

This implementation is straightforward and efficiently maps GPAs to letter grades according to the specified criteria.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem is asking to convert a list of numerical grades (GPA) into letter grades based on a given grading scale. 

Here is my approach to solve this problem:

1. I will iterate over the list of numerical grades.
2. For each numerical grade, I will check which range it falls into according to the grading scale.
3. I will then assign the corresponding letter grade to that numerical grade.
4. I will append the letter grade to a new list.
5. Finally, I will return the lis...
