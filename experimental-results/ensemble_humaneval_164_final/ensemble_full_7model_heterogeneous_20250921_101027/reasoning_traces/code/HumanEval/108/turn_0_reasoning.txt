=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of counting the number of integers in an array whose sum of digits is greater than zero, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here’s how I will break down the problem:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input is an array of integers, which can include both positive and negative numbers.
   - The output should be an integer representing the count of numbers whose sum of digits is greater than zero.

2. **Defining the Sum of Digits**:
   - For a positive integer, the sum of digits is straightforward (e.g., for `123`, the sum is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`).
   - For a negative integer, we need to consider the first digit as negative. For instance, for `-123`, the signed digits would be `-1`, `2`, and `3`, leading to a sum of `-1 + 2 + 3 = 4`.

3. **Iterating Through the Array**:
   - We will iterate through each integer in the input array.
   - For each integer, we will calculate the sum of its digits using the rules defined above.

4. **Counting Valid Numbers**:
   - We will maintain a count of how many integers have a sum of digits greater than zero.

5. **Implementation**:
   - We will define a helper function to calculate the sum of digits for a given integer.
   - We will then use this helper function in our main function to count the valid integers.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on our reasoning.

```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    """Helper function to calculate the sum of digits of an integer n."""
    # Convert the number to a string to iterate through digits
    str_n = str(abs(n))  # Use absolute value for digit extraction
    digit_sum = 0
    
    # If n is negative, we subtract the first digit
    if n < 0:
        digit_sum -= int(str_n[0])  # First digit is negative
    
    # Add the rest of the digits
    for digit in str_n[1:]:
        digit_sum += int(digit)
    
    return digit_sum

def count_nums(arr):
    """
    Count the number of elements in arr whose sum of digits > 0.
    """
    count = 0
    for num in arr:
        if sum_of_digits(num) > 0:
            count += 1
    return count

# Example test cases
print(count_nums([]))  # Expected output: 0
print(count_nums([-1, 11, -11]))  # Expected output: 1
print(count_nums([1, 1, 2]))  # Expected output: 3
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **`sum_of_digits(n)`**:
   - This helper function calculates the sum of digits for a given integer `n`.
   - It first converts `n` to its absolute value to handle digit extraction.
   - If `n` is negative, it subtracts the first digit from the sum.
   - It then iterates through the remaining digits and adds them to the total sum.

2. **`count_nums(arr)`**:
   - This function initializes a count to zero.
   - It iterates through each number in the input array and uses the `sum_of_digits` function to check if the sum is greater than zero.
   - If it is, it increments the count.
   - Finally, it returns the count.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem requirements.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem is asking to return the count of numbers in the given list where the sum of the digits of the number is greater than 0. If the number is negative, the first digit should be considered as negative. 

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- Initialize a counter to 0
- Iterate through the given list
- For each number, convert it to a string to easily access each digit
- Initialize a sum to 0
- Iterate through each character in the string representat...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each number in the input array, calculate the sum of its digits, and count the numbers whose digit sum is greater than 0. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0. This variable will keep track of the count of numbers whose digit sum is greater than 0.

2. Iterate through each number `num` in the input array `arr`:
