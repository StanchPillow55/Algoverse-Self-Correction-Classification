Final Answer: To solve the problem of sorting an array based on the sum of its first and last elements, we can break down the task into a series of logical steps:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - We are given an array of non-negative integers.
   - We need to return a new sorted array based on the sum of the first and last elements of the input array.
   - If the sum is odd, we sort the array in ascending order.
   - If the sum is even, we sort the array in descending order.
   - The original array should remain unchanged.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - An empty array should return an empty array.
   - An array with a single element should return that element in a new array.

3. **Sorting Logic**:
   - We can use Python's built-in sorting capabilities. The `sorted()` function allows us to sort in ascending order by default. To sort in descending order, we can use the `reverse=True` parameter.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - First, check if the array is empty. If it is, return an empty list.
   - If the array has one element, return a list containing that element.
   - Calculate the sum of the first and last elements.
   - Determine if the sum is odd or even.
   - Sort the array accordingly using the `sorted()` function.
   - Return the sorted array.

Now, let's implement the `sort_array` function based on this reasoning:

```python
def sort_array(array):
    """
    Given an array of non-negative integers, return a copy of the given array after sorting,
    you will sort the given array in ascending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is odd,
    or sort it in descending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is even.

    Note:
    * don't change the given array.

    Examples:
    * sort_array([]) => []
    * sort_array([5]) => [5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]) => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6]) => [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
    """
    
    # Handle the empty array case
    if not array:
        return []
    
    # Handle the single element case
    if len(array) == 1:
        return [array[0]]
    
    # Calculate the sum of the first and last elements
    first_element = array[0]
    last_element = array[-1]
    total_sum = first_element + last_element
    
    # Determine the sorting order based on the sum
    if total_sum % 2 == 0:
        # Even sum: sort in descending order
        return sorted(array, reverse=True)
    else:
        # Odd sum: sort in ascending order
        return sorted(array)

# Example usage:
print(sort_array([]))  # Output: []
print(sort_array([5]))  # Output: [5]
print(sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]))  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6]))  # Output: [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function starts by checking if the input array is empty or has a single element, handling these cases directly.
- It calculates the sum of the first and last elements to determine the sorting order.
- Depending on whether the sum is odd or even, it sorts the array in the appropriate order using the `sorted()` function and returns the result. 

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for sorting while ensuring that the original array remains unchanged.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return a sorted array based on the sum of the first and last index of the given array. If the sum is odd, we need to sort the array in ascending order. If the sum is even, we need to sort the array in descending order.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- First, I will check if the given array is empty or has only one element. If it is, I will return the array as it is because there is no need to sort it.
- Then, I wi...
