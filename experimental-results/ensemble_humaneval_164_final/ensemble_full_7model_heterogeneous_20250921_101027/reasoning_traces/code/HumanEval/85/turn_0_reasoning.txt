=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of adding even elements that are located at odd indices in a given list of integers, we can break down the task into a series of logical steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input**: We are given a non-empty list of integers. The list can contain both even and odd integers.

2. **Identifying Indices**: In Python, list indices start from 0. Therefore, the odd indices in a list are 1, 3, 5, etc. 

3. **Identifying Even Elements**: An integer is considered even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., `number % 2 == 0`).

4. **Iterating Through the List**: We need to iterate through the list and check each element:
   - If the index of the element is odd.
   - If the element itself is even.

5. **Summing the Valid Elements**: We will maintain a running total of the even elements found at odd indices.

6. **Returning the Result**: Finally, we will return the computed sum.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the solution based on the above reasoning. We will define the function `add(lst)` that performs the required operations.

```python
def add(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers lst, add the even elements that are at odd indices."""
    total = 0  # Initialize a variable to hold the sum of even elements at odd indices
    
    # Iterate through the list using enumerate to get both index and value
    for index, value in enumerate(lst):
        # Check if the index is odd and the value is even
        if index % 2 == 1 and value % 2 == 0:
            total += value  # Add the value to total if both conditions are met
    
    return total  # Return the final sum

# Example usage:
print(add([4, 2, 6, 7]))  # Output should be 2
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing a variable `total` to 0, which will hold the sum of the even elements at odd indices.

2. **Looping through the List**: We use `enumerate(lst)` to get both the index and the value of each element in the list. This allows us to easily check the index.

3. **Condition Checking**: Inside the loop, we check if the index is odd (`index % 2 == 1`) and if the value is even (`value % 2 == 0`). If both conditions are satisfied, we add the value to `total`.

4. **Returning the Result**: After the loop completes, we return the accumulated `total`.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem's requirements.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Reasoning:

Given a list of integers, we are to determine the sum of all even elements at odd indices. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps: 
- Initialize a variable `total` to keep track of the sum of all even elements at odd indices
- Iterate through the entire list
- On each iteration, check if the index of the current element is odd and if the element at the current index is even. If it is, add the element to the `total` variable
- Retur...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Certainly! Let's think through the problem step by step and then implement the solution.

Problem Analysis:
- The function `add` takes a non-empty list of integers `lst` as input.
- The goal is to add the even elements that are at odd indices in the list.
- The indices in a list start from 0, so the odd indices are 1, 3, 5, and so on.

Approach:
1. Initialize a variable `sum` to keep track of the sum of even elements at odd indices.
2. Iterate through ...
