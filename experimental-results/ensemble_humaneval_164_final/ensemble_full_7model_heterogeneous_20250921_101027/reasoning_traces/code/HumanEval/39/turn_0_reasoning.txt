Final Answer: To solve the problem of finding the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime, we need to break down the task into manageable steps. Here’s how I would approach it:

### Step 1: Understand Fibonacci Numbers
Fibonacci numbers are generated by the recurrence relation:
- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

The first few Fibonacci numbers are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

### Step 2: Understand Prime Numbers
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. The first few prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, ...

### Step 3: Identify the Requirements
We need to find Fibonacci numbers and check if they are prime. We will continue this process until we find the n-th Fibonacci prime.

### Step 4: Implement Helper Functions
1. **Fibonacci Generator**: A function to generate Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Prime Checker**: A function to check if a number is prime.

### Step 5: Combine the Logic
We will generate Fibonacci numbers, check if they are prime, and keep a count of how many prime Fibonacci numbers we have found. Once we reach the n-th prime Fibonacci number, we will return it.

### Step 6: Implementation
Now, let's implement the solution in Python.

```python
def is_prime(num: int) -> bool:
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def fibonacci_generator():
    """Generate Fibonacci numbers indefinitely."""
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield b
        a, b = b, a + b

def prime_fib(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime.
    """
    count = 0
    for fib in fibonacci_generator():
        if is_prime(fib):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return fib

# Test cases
print(prime_fib(1))  # 2
print(prime_fib(2))  # 3
print(prime_fib(3))  # 5
print(prime_fib(4))  # 13
print(prime_fib(5))  # 89
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **is_prime Function**: This function checks if a number is prime using trial division up to the square root of the number.
2. **fibonacci_generator Function**: This is a generator that yields Fibonacci numbers indefinitely.
3. **prime_fib Function**: This function uses the Fibonacci generator to find Fibonacci numbers, checks if they are prime, and counts how many prime Fibonacci numbers have been found until it reaches the n-th one.

### Conclusion
The implementation efficiently generates Fibonacci numbers and checks for primality, ensuring that we can find the n-th prime Fibonacci number as required. The use of a generator allows us to handle potentially large Fibonacci numbers without precomputing them all at once.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Certainly! Let's break down the problem and think through the solution step by step.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The function `prime_fib` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`-th number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number.

2. **Identifying the Key Components**: To solve this problem, we need to:
   - Generate Fibonacci numbers
   - Check if each Fibonacci number is prime
   - Keep track of the cou...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of finding the n-th number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number, we need to break down the task into smaller steps:

1. **Generate Fibonacci Numbers**: We need a function to generate Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. We can generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively.

2. **Check for Primality**: We need a function to check if a number is prime. A p...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem is asking to return the nth number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number. 

To solve this problem, we need to generate Fibonacci numbers and check if they are prime. We continue this process until we find the nth prime Fibonacci number.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Define a function to check if a number is prime. A number is prime if it is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself. We can check this by trying to d...
