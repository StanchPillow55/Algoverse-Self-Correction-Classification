=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of finding the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array in a given list of integers, we can follow a systematic approach. Here's how we can think through the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
We need to find a contiguous sub-array within the given array `nums` such that the sum of the elements in that sub-array is minimized. A sub-array is defined as a contiguous segment of the array.

### Step 2: Identifying Edge Cases
Before we dive into the algorithm, we should consider some edge cases:
- If the input array is empty, we should handle that gracefully (though the problem states that the array will be non-empty).
- If all numbers are positive, the minimum sub-array will be the smallest single element.
- If all numbers are negative, the minimum sub-array will be the sum of all elements.

### Step 3: Choosing an Algorithm
A straightforward approach would be to use a nested loop to check all possible sub-arrays and calculate their sums. However, this would be inefficient with a time complexity of O(n^2).

Instead, we can use a more efficient approach known as Kadane's algorithm, which is typically used to find the maximum sub-array sum. We can adapt it to find the minimum sub-array sum by modifying how we track the current sum.

### Step 4: Implementing the Solution
1. Initialize two variables: `current_min` to track the minimum sum of the current sub-array and `global_min` to track the overall minimum found so far.
2. Iterate through each number in the array:
   - Update `current_min` to be the minimum of the current number or the sum of `current_min` and the current number. This step decides whether to start a new sub-array or to continue the existing one.
   - Update `global_min` if `current_min` is less than `global_min`.
3. Return `global_min` at the end.

### Implementation
Now, let's implement the solution based on the reasoning above.

```python
def minSubArraySum(nums):
    """
    Given an array of integers nums, find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array
    of nums.
    """
    # Initialize current_min and global_min with the first element
    current_min = global_min = nums[0]
    
    # Iterate through the array starting from the second element
    for num in nums[1:]:
        # Update current_min to be the minimum of the current number or the sum of current_min and the current number
        current_min = min(num, current_min + num)
        
        # Update global_min if current_min is less than global_min
        global_min = min(global_min, current_min)
    
    return global_min

# Example usage:
print(minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]))  # Output: 1
print(minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]))         # Output: -6
```

### Explanation of the Code
- We start by initializing `current_min` and `global_min` with the first element of the array.
- We loop through the rest of the elements, updating `current_min` to either the current element (starting a new sub-array) or the sum of `current_min` and the current element (continuing the existing sub-array).
- We continuously check if the `current_min` is less than `global_min` and update it accordingly.
- Finally, we return `global_min`, which holds the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array.

This implementation runs in O(n) time complexity, making it efficient for larger arrays.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Reasoning:

The problem is asking to find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array. A sub-array is a contiguous part of an array. The minimum sum of a sub-array can be a single element if it is the smallest. 

For example, in the array [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4], the minimum sum of any sub-array is 1, which is a single element sub-array. 

In the array [-1, -2, -3], the minimum sum of any sub-array is -6, which is the sum of the entire array.

So, the approach to solve this pro...
