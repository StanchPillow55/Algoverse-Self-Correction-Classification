=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of counting the even and odd digits in a given integer, we can break down the task into several clear steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function should accept an integer, which can be positive, negative, or zero. We need to consider the absolute value of the number since the sign does not affect the digit count.

2. **Convert to String**: To easily iterate through each digit, we can convert the absolute value of the integer to a string. This allows us to access each digit individually.

3. **Initialize Counters**: We will maintain two counters: one for even digits and another for odd digits. We can initialize both counters to zero.

4. **Iterate Through Digits**: For each character in the string representation of the number:
   - Convert the character back to an integer.
   - Check if the digit is even or odd:
     - A digit is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., `digit % 2 == 0`).
     - A digit is odd if it is not even (i.e., `digit % 2 != 0`).
   - Increment the respective counter based on whether the digit is even or odd.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd digits.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def even_odd_count(num):
    """Given an integer, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.
    
    Example:
        even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)
        even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)
    """
    # Step 1: Take the absolute value of the number
    num_str = str(abs(num))
    
    # Step 2: Initialize counters for even and odd digits
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through each character in the string representation of the number
    for char in num_str:
        digit = int(char)  # Convert character back to integer
        if digit % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1  # Increment even counter
        else:
            odd_count += 1   # Increment odd counter
    
    # Step 4: Return the counts as a tuple
    return (even_count, odd_count)

# Example usage:
print(even_odd_count(-12))  # Output: (1, 1)
print(even_odd_count(123))   # Output: (1, 2)
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We first convert the input number to its absolute value and then to a string to facilitate digit-wise iteration.
- We initialize two counters, `even_count` and `odd_count`, to zero.
- We loop through each character in the string, convert it to an integer, and check if it is even or odd, updating the respective counters accordingly.
- Finally, we return the counts as a tuple.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, handling both positive and negative integers correctly.
