=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of extracting the decimal part of a positive floating-point number, we need to break down the task into clear steps. Here's my thought process:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input is a positive floating-point number (e.g., `3.5`).
   - The output should be the decimal part of that number (e.g., for `3.5`, the output should be `0.5`).

2. **Decomposing the Number**:
   - A floating-point number can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{number} = \text{integer part} + \text{decimal part}
     \]
   - The integer part can be obtained using the `int()` function, which truncates the decimal portion of the number.
   - The decimal part can be calculated by subtracting the integer part from the original number:
     \[
     \text{decimal part} = \text{number} - \text{integer part}
     \]

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Define the function `truncate_number` that takes a single argument `number`.
   - Use the `int()` function to get the integer part of the number.
   - Subtract the integer part from the original number to get the decimal part.
   - Return the decimal part.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Since the problem specifies that the input will always be a positive floating-point number, we don't need to handle negative numbers or non-numeric inputs.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    an integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    0.5
    >>> truncate_number(5.0)
    0.0
    >>> truncate_number(2.75)
    0.75
    """
    # Step 1: Get the integer part
    integer_part = int(number)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the decimal part
    decimal_part = number - integer_part
    
    # Step 3: Return the decimal part
    return decimal_part
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `truncate_number` takes a float `number` as input.
- It calculates the integer part using `int(number)`.
- It then computes the decimal part by subtracting the integer part from the original number.
- Finally, it returns the decimal part.

### Testing the Function:
The provided docstring includes examples that can be used to test the function. You can run the function with different inputs to ensure it behaves as expected. 

For example:
```python
print(truncate_number(3.5))  # Output: 0.5
print(truncate_number(5.0))  # Output: 0.0
print(truncate_number(2.75))  # Output: 0.75
```

This implementation is straightforward and efficiently extracts the decimal part of a positive floating-point number.
