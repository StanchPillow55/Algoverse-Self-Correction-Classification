=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of summing numbers from 1 to \( n \), we can approach it in a few different ways. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
The function `sum_to_n(n: int)` is supposed to compute the sum of all integers from 1 to \( n \). The examples provided in the docstring give us a clear idea of what the expected output should be for various inputs.

### Step 2: Mathematical Insight
The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}
\]
This formula is derived from pairing numbers in the series. For example, if \( n = 5 \):
- The pairs are (1, 5), (2, 4), and the middle number 3.
- Each pair sums to 6, and there are \( \frac{5}{2} \) pairs, leading to the formula.

### Step 3: Implementation Options
1. **Using the Formula**: This is the most efficient way since it computes the result in constant time \( O(1) \).
2. **Using a Loop**: We could iterate from 1 to \( n \) and accumulate the sum, which would take linear time \( O(n) \).
3. **Using Recursion**: We could define a recursive function, but this would also be less efficient and could lead to stack overflow for large \( n \).

Given the efficiency and simplicity of the formula, I will choose to implement the solution using the mathematical formula.

### Step 4: Edge Cases
- If \( n \) is 0 or negative, the sum should logically be 0 since there are no positive integers to sum. We should handle this case explicitly.

### Step 5: Implementation
Now, let's implement the function using the formula and handle the edge case.

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int) -> int:
    """sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
    
    >>> sum_to_n(30)
    465
    >>> sum_to_n(100)
    5050
    >>> sum_to_n(5)
    15
    >>> sum_to_n(10)
    55
    >>> sum_to_n(1)
    1
    >>> sum_to_n(0)
    0
    >>> sum_to_n(-5)
    0
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    return n * (n + 1) // 2
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Function Definition**: The function `sum_to_n` takes an integer \( n \).
2. **Edge Case Handling**: If \( n \) is less than or equal to 0, we return 0.
3. **Sum Calculation**: We use the formula \( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \) to compute the sum and return the result.
4. **Integer Division**: We use `//` to ensure the result is an integer.

### Conclusion
This implementation is efficient and handles edge cases appropriately. The use of the mathematical formula allows for quick computation, making it suitable even for large values of \( n \).
