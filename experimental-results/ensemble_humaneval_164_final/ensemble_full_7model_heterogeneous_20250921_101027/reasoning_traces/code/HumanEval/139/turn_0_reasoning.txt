Final Answer: To solve the problem of calculating the "Brazilian factorial" (which we will refer to as `special_factorial`), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understanding the Definition**: The Brazilian factorial for a given integer \( n \) is defined as the product of the factorials of all integers from \( n \) down to \( 1 \). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{special\_factorial}(n) = n! \times (n-1)! \times (n-2)! \times \ldots \times 1!
   \]

2. **Factorial Calculation**: The factorial of a number \( k \) (denoted as \( k! \)) is the product of all positive integers up to \( k \). For example:
   - \( 4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24 \)
   - \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \)
   - \( 2! = 2 \times 1 = 2 \)
   - \( 1! = 1 \)

3. **Iterative Calculation**: To compute the Brazilian factorial, we can use a loop to calculate the factorial for each integer from \( n \) down to \( 1 \) and multiply these values together.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Initialize a variable to hold the result (starting with 1 since we are multiplying).
   - Loop from \( n \) down to \( 1 \):
     - For each integer \( i \), compute \( i! \) and multiply it to the result.
   - Return the final result.

5. **Edge Cases**: The problem states that \( n > 0 \), so we don't need to handle cases where \( n \) is less than or equal to zero.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning.

```python
def factorial(k):
    """Helper function to calculate the factorial of k."""
    if k == 0 or k == 1:
        return 1
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, k + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

def special_factorial(n):
    """Calculate the Brazilian factorial of n."""
    result = 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        result *= factorial(i)
    return result

# Example usage
print(special_factorial(4))  # Output: 288
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:
- We defined a helper function `factorial(k)` that computes the factorial of \( k \) using a simple loop.
- In the `special_factorial(n)` function, we initialize `result` to 1 and iterate from \( n \) down to 1. For each \( i \), we compute \( i! \) using the `factorial` function and multiply it to `result`.
- Finally, we return the computed `result`.

This implementation is efficient for reasonable values of \( n \) and correctly computes the Brazilian factorial as defined in the problem statement.
