=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of computing the n-th element of the Fib4 number sequence, we need to understand the sequence's definition and how to compute it efficiently without using recursion.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Sequence**:
   - The Fib4 sequence is defined as follows:
     - fib4(0) = 0
     - fib4(1) = 0
     - fib4(2) = 2
     - fib4(3) = 0
     - For n >= 4: fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)
   - This means that each term after the 3rd term is the sum of the previous four terms.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - We have specific values for the first four terms:
     - fib4(0) = 0
     - fib4(1) = 0
     - fib4(2) = 2
     - fib4(3) = 0

3. **Iterative Approach**:
   - Since the problem specifies not to use recursion, we will use an iterative approach.
   - We can maintain a list (or an array) to store the computed values of the sequence up to n.
   - For each n from 4 to the desired value, we will compute fib4(n) using the previously computed values.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The iterative approach will compute each term in O(1) time after the initial setup, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n).
   - The space complexity will also be O(n) if we store all computed values, but we can optimize it to O(1) by only keeping track of the last four computed values.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def fib4(n: int) -> int:
    """Compute the n-th element of the Fib4 number sequence."""
    # Base cases
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize the first four values
    fib_values = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    
    # Compute values from 4 to n
    for i in range(4, n + 1):
        next_value = fib_values[0] + fib_values[1] + fib_values[2] + fib_values[3]
        # Update the list to keep only the last four values
        fib_values[0] = fib_values[1]
        fib_values[1] = fib_values[2]
        fib_values[2] = fib_values[3]
        fib_values[3] = next_value
    
    return fib_values[3]

# Example usage:
print(fib4(5))  # Output: 4
print(fib4(6))  # Output: 8
print(fib4(7))  # Output: 14
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first handle the base cases directly.
- We initialize a list `fib_values` to store the last four computed values of the sequence.
- We then iterate from 4 to n, calculating the next value as the sum of the last four values.
- After computing the next value, we update the list to reflect the last four values.
- Finally, we return the last computed value, which corresponds to fib4(n).

This implementation is efficient and adheres to the constraints of the problem.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem is asking to implement a function that calculates the nth number in a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence. The sequence is defined as follows:

- fib4(0) -> 0

- fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Instead of using recursion, we can store the previously calculated values in an array and use them to calculate the next values. This will help us avoid redundant calculations and make the function more efficient.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Create an array `fib` of size `n+1` to store the calculated values of fib4 sequence.
2. Initialize the base cases:
   - `fib[0] = 0`
