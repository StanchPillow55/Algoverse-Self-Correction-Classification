=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine whether a given number \( n \) is prime, we need to understand the definition of a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Basic Cases**:
   - If \( n \leq 1 \), it is not prime. This includes 0, 1, and negative numbers.
   - The smallest prime number is 2, which is also the only even prime number.

2. **Even Numbers**:
   - Any even number greater than 2 cannot be prime because it is divisible by 2.

3. **Checking for Divisibility**:
   - For odd numbers greater than 2, we need to check for factors. A number \( n \) can only be prime if it is not divisible by any integer from 3 up to \( \sqrt{n} \). This is because if \( n \) has a factor larger than its square root, the corresponding factor must be smaller than the square root.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - Instead of checking all numbers up to \( n-1 \), we only check up to \( \sqrt{n} \). This significantly reduces the number of checks we need to perform, especially for larger numbers.

5. **Iterating through Potential Factors**:
   - We can iterate through all odd numbers starting from 3 up to \( \sqrt{n} \) (inclusive). If \( n \) is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function `is_prime` based on the reasoning above.

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.
    >>> is_prime(6)
    False
    >>> is_prime(101)
    True
    >>> is_prime(11)
    True
    >>> is_prime(13441)
    True
    >>> is_prime(61)
    True
    >>> is_prime(4)
    False
    >>> is_prime(1)
    False
    """
    # Check for numbers less than or equal to 1
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    # Check for the number 2
    if n == 2:
        return True
    # Check for even numbers greater than 2
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    
    # Check for factors from 3 to sqrt(n)
    limit = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(3, limit, 2):  # Check only odd numbers
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
            
    return True
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first handle the basic cases for numbers less than or equal to 1, and specifically check for the number 2.
- We then check if \( n \) is even and greater than 2, returning `False` if it is.
- We calculate the square root of \( n \) and iterate through all odd numbers from 3 up to this limit.
- If we find any number that divides \( n \) evenly, we return `False`.
- If no divisors are found, we return `True`, indicating that \( n \) is prime.

This implementation is efficient and covers all edge cases as outlined in the reasoning.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem is to write a function `is_prime(n)` that takes a number `n` as input and returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine if a number \( n \) is prime, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. Here's the step-by-step thought process to solve this problem:

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦}.

To check if a number is prime, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. We can do this by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number (inclusive). If the number is divisible by any of these values, it is not prime. If we reach the end of the loop without finding any divisors, the number...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): To determine if a given number is prime, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. Here's the step-by-step reasoning and thought process:

1. First, we should consider the edge cases:
   - If the number is less than 2, it is not prime. This is because 1 is not considered a prime number, and negative numbers cannot be prime.

2. Next, we can check if the number is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of the number:...
