=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of finding the two closest elements in a list of numbers, we can break down the solution into a series of logical steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - We are given a list of floating-point numbers with a minimum length of 2.
   - Our goal is to find two numbers in this list that are closest to each other and return them as a tuple in ascending order.

2. **Identifying the Closest Elements**:
   - The closest elements can be identified by calculating the absolute difference between every pair of numbers in the list.
   - We need to keep track of the minimum difference encountered and the corresponding pair of numbers.

3. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - We can use a nested loop to compare each number with every other number in the list. This will allow us to compute the differences.
   - For each pair, if the difference is smaller than the previously recorded minimum difference, we update our minimum difference and store the current pair.

4. **Sorting the Result**:
   - Once we have identified the closest pair, we need to ensure that they are returned in ascending order.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Since the problem guarantees that the list has at least two elements, we don't need to handle cases where the list is too short.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    # Initialize variables to track the minimum difference and the closest pair
    min_diff = float('inf')  # Start with a very large number
    closest_pair = (0.0, 0.0)  # Placeholder for the closest pair

    # Iterate through each pair of numbers in the list
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            # Calculate the absolute difference between the two numbers
            diff = abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j])
            # If this difference is smaller than the current minimum, update
            if diff < min_diff:
                min_diff = diff
                closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[j])

    # Return the closest pair in sorted order
    return tuple(sorted(closest_pair))

# Example usage
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.2)
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.0)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We initialize `min_diff` to infinity to ensure that any actual difference we calculate will be smaller.
- We use two nested loops to compare each element with every other element that comes after it in the list.
- For each pair, we calculate the absolute difference and check if it's the smallest we've encountered.
- If it is, we update `min_diff` and store the current pair of numbers.
- Finally, we return the closest pair in sorted order using the `sorted()` function, which ensures the smaller number comes first.

This implementation efficiently finds the closest pair of numbers with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is acceptable given the problem constraints.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Reasoning:

Given a list of numbers, we are to determine the two numbers that are closest to each other. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:

1. First, we would sort the list of numbers in ascending order. This would allow us to compare adjacent numbers in the list.

2. Next, we would initialize two variables, `min_diff` to infinity and `result` to an empty tuple. `min_diff` would be used to keep track of the minimum difference between two...
