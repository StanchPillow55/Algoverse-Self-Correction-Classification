=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers \( a \) and \( b \), we can use the well-known Euclidean algorithm. This algorithm is efficient and works based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding GCD**: The GCD of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. For example, the GCD of 25 and 15 is 5, as 5 is the largest number that divides both.

2. **Euclidean Algorithm**: The algorithm works as follows:
   - If \( b = 0 \), then \( \text{gcd}(a, b) = |a| \) (the absolute value of \( a \)).
   - Otherwise, we recursively call the function with \( b \) and \( a \mod b \) (the remainder of \( a \) divided by \( b \)).
   - This process continues until \( b \) becomes 0.

3. **Base Cases**: We need to handle cases where either \( a \) or \( b \) is zero:
   - If \( a = 0 \) and \( b \neq 0 \), then the GCD is \( |b| \).
   - If \( b = 0 \) and \( a \neq 0 \), then the GCD is \( |a| \).
   - If both are zero, the GCD is typically defined as 0, but we can return 0 or raise an exception based on the context.

4. **Implementation**: We will implement the function using recursion based on the Euclidean algorithm. We will also ensure to handle negative numbers by taking their absolute values.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the `greatest_common_divisor` function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """ Return the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b.
    
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
    1
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
    5
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(0, 5)
    5
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(5, 0)
    5
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(0, 0)
    0
    """
    # Handle the case where both numbers are zero
    if a == 0 and b == 0:
        return 0  # or raise an exception based on the context
    
    # Use absolute values to handle negative inputs
    a, b = abs(a), abs(b)
    
    # Implementing the Euclidean algorithm
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    
    return a

# Example usage
print(greatest_common_divisor(25, 15))  # Output: 5
print(greatest_common_divisor(3, 5))    # Output: 1
print(greatest_common_divisor(0, 5))     # Output: 5
print(greatest_common_divisor(5, 0))     # Output: 5
print(greatest_common_divisor(0, 0))     # Output: 0
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function first checks if both inputs are zero and returns 0.
- It then takes the absolute values of \( a \) and \( b \) to ensure that the GCD is always a non-negative integer.
- The while loop implements the Euclidean algorithm, repeatedly updating \( a \) and \( b \) until \( b \) becomes zero.
- Finally, it returns \( a \), which at that point contains the GCD of the original inputs.

This implementation is efficient and handles various edge cases, including negative numbers and zeros.
