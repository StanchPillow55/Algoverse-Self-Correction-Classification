Final Answer: To solve the problem of finding the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer in a list, we can break down the solution into several clear steps:

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: We need to return a tuple `(a, b)` where:
   - `a` is the largest negative integer from the list.
   - `b` is the smallest positive integer from the list.
   - If there are no negative integers, `a` should be `None`.
   - If there are no positive integers, `b` should be `None`.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: We need to consider various edge cases:
   - An empty list should return `(None, None)`.
   - A list with only zeros should also return `(None, None)`.
   - A list with only negative integers should return `(largest_negative, None)`.
   - A list with only positive integers should return `(None, smallest_positive)`.

3. **Iterating Through the List**: We will iterate through the list and keep track of:
   - The largest negative integer found so far.
   - The smallest positive integer found so far.

4. **Initialization**: We can initialize two variables:
   - `largest_negative` to `None` (to track the largest negative integer).
   - `smallest_positive` to `None` (to track the smallest positive integer).

5. **Updating Values**: As we iterate through the list:
   - If we encounter a negative integer, we check if it is larger than the current `largest_negative` and update it accordingly.
   - If we encounter a positive integer, we check if it is smaller than the current `smallest_positive` and update it accordingly.

6. **Returning the Result**: After processing the entire list, we return the tuple `(largest_negative, smallest_positive)`.

Now, let's implement this logic in the function `largest_smallest_integers`.

```python
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    '''
    Create a function that returns a tuple (a, b), where 'a' is
    the largest of negative integers, and 'b' is the smallest
    of positive integers in a list.
    If there is no negative or positive integers, return them as None.
    '''

    largest_negative = None
    smallest_positive = None

    for num in lst:
        if num < 0:  # Check for negative integers
            if largest_negative is None or num > largest_negative:
                largest_negative = num
        elif num > 0:  # Check for positive integers
            if smallest_positive is None or num < smallest_positive:
                smallest_positive = num

    return (largest_negative, smallest_positive)

# Example test cases
print(largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]))  # Output: (None, 1)
print(largest_smallest_integers([]))                   # Output: (None, None)
print(largest_smallest_integers([0]))                  # Output: (None, None)
print(largest_smallest_integers([-1, -2, -3, 1, 2]))  # Output: (-1, 1)
print(largest_smallest_integers([-5, -3, -1, 0]))      # Output: (-1, None)
print(largest_smallest_integers([5, 3, 1, 0]))         # Output: (None, 1)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define the function `largest_smallest_integers` that takes a list `lst` as input.
- We initialize `largest_negative` and `smallest_positive` to `None`.
- We loop through each number in the list:
  - If the number is negative, we check if it's larger than the current `largest_negative` and update it if necessary.
  - If the number is positive, we check if it's smaller than the current `smallest_positive` and update it if necessary.
- Finally, we return the tuple containing the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer. 

This approach efficiently finds the required values in a single pass through the list, making it O(n) in time complexity, where n is the length of the list.
