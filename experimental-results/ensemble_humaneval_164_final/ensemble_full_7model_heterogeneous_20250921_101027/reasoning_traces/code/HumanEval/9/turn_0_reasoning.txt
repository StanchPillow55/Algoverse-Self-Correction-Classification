=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of generating a list of rolling maximums from a given list of integers, we need to understand what a rolling maximum is. The rolling maximum at each position in the list is the maximum value encountered from the start of the list up to that position.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - Input: A list of integers, e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]`.
   - Output: A list of integers where each element at index `i` is the maximum value from the start of the list up to index `i`.

2. **Example Walkthrough**:
   - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]`:
     - At index 0, the maximum is `1`.
     - At index 1, the maximum is `max(1, 2) = 2`.
     - At index 2, the maximum is `max(1, 2, 3) = 3`.
     - At index 3, the maximum remains `3` (since `2` is not greater than `3`).
     - At index 4, the maximum remains `3` (since `3` is equal to `3`).
     - At index 5, the maximum is `max(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4) = 4`.
     - At index 6, the maximum remains `4` (since `2` is not greater than `4`).
   - Therefore, the output should be `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]`.

3. **Approach**:
   - We can iterate through the list while keeping track of the maximum value encountered so far.
   - For each element, we compare it with the current maximum and update the maximum if the current element is greater.
   - We will store the rolling maximums in a new list which we will return at the end.

4. **Implementation**:
   - We will define a function `rolling_max` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of rolling maximums.
   - We will initialize a variable to keep track of the current maximum and an empty list to store the results.

Hereâ€™s the complete implementation:

```python
from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
    in the sequence.
    
    >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """
    if not numbers:  # Handle the case of an empty list
        return []
    
    rolling_max_list = []
    current_max = numbers[0]  # Start with the first element as the current maximum
    
    for number in numbers:
        current_max = max(current_max, number)  # Update the current maximum
        rolling_max_list.append(current_max)  # Append the current maximum to the result list
    
    return rolling_max_list
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first check if the input list is empty and return an empty list if it is.
- We initialize `rolling_max_list` to store the results and `current_max` to track the maximum value seen so far, starting with the first element of the list.
- We iterate through each number in the input list, updating `current_max` as necessary and appending it to `rolling_max_list`.
- Finally, we return the `rolling_max_list` which contains the rolling maximums.

This implementation is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list, as we only make a single pass through the list.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem is asking to generate a list of maximum elements found until the given moment in the sequence. This is also known as a rolling maximum.

The rolling maximum at a given index i is the maximum value in the list from the start of the list up to index i.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple approach:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the rolling maximums.
2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the current maximum.
3. Iterate over the input list. For ...
