=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of factorizing an integer into its prime factors, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps involved in creating the `factorize` function.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding Prime Factorization**:
   - Prime factorization involves breaking down a number into its prime components. For example, the number 28 can be expressed as \(2^2 \times 7\), which means its prime factors are [2, 2, 7].

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The function takes a single integer `n` as input and returns a list of integers, which are the prime factors of `n`, repeated according to their multiplicity.

3. **Finding Prime Factors**:
   - We can find the prime factors by:
     - Starting from the smallest prime number, which is 2.
     - Dividing `n` by the current prime factor as long as it is divisible.
     - If `n` is no longer divisible by the current prime factor, we move to the next integer.
     - We continue this process until `n` becomes 1.

4. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - We only need to check for factors up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is not reduced to 1 after checking all numbers up to its square root, then `n` itself is a prime factor.

5. **Implementation**:
   - We will implement a loop to check for factors starting from 2 and going upwards.
   - For each factor, we will check if it divides `n` and keep dividing until it no longer can.
   - We will collect these factors in a list and return them.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the `factorize` function based on the reasoning above.

```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    """
    factors = []
    # Start checking for factors from 2
    divisor = 2
    
    # Check for factors up to the square root of n
    while divisor * divisor <= n:
        while n % divisor == 0:
            factors.append(divisor)
            n //= divisor  # Reduce n by the factor
        divisor += 1  # Move to the next potential factor
    
    # If n is still greater than 1, then it is a prime number
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    
    return factors

# Example usage
print(factorize(8))   # Output: [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25))  # Output: [5, 5]
print(factorize(70))  # Output: [2, 5, 7]
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We initialize an empty list `factors` to store the prime factors.
- We start with the smallest prime number (2) and check if it divides `n`.
- If it does, we keep dividing `n` by this factor and appending the factor to our list until `n` is no longer divisible by it.
- We then increment the divisor and repeat the process.
- If after all possible divisions `n` is still greater than 1, it means `n` itself is a prime factor, and we add it to the list.
- Finally, we return the list of factors.

This implementation efficiently finds and lists the prime factors of the given integer.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of finding the prime factors of a given integer `n`, we need to break down the number into its constituent prime numbers. The prime factors should be returned in a list, sorted from smallest to largest, and each prime factor should appear as many times as it divides the number.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can approach this problem:

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem is asking to return a list of prime factors of a given integer. The factors should be listed in ascending order and each factor should be listed the number of times it appears in the factorization.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps:
- Initialize an empty list to store the factors.
- Start a loop from 2 (the smallest prime number) to the input number.
- In each iteration, check if the number is divisible by the current loop variable. If it is...

Reasoning:
1. To find the prime factors of a given integer, we need to divide the number by the smallest prime factor possible repeatedly until the number becomes 1.

2. We can start dividing the number by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and keep dividing as long as the number is divisible by 2. If the number is not divisible by 2, we move on to the next pr...
