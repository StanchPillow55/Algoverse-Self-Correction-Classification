Final Answer: To solve the problem of generating a sorted list of odd numbers from the Collatz sequence of a given positive integer \( n \), we can break down the task into several clear steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Collatz Sequence
The Collatz sequence is generated by the following rules:
- If the current number is even, the next number is half of the current number.
- If the current number is odd, the next number is \( 3 \times \text{current number} + 1 \).
- This process continues until we reach the number 1.

### Step 2: Generate the Collatz Sequence
We need to create a function that generates the Collatz sequence starting from \( n \) until we reach 1. We will store each number in a list.

### Step 3: Filter for Odd Numbers
As we generate the sequence, we will check each number to see if it is odd. If it is, we will add it to a separate list of odd numbers.

### Step 4: Sort the List of Odd Numbers
Once we have collected all the odd numbers from the sequence, we will sort this list in increasing order before returning it.

### Step 5: Implement the Function
Now, we can implement the function `get_odd_collatz` based on the above steps.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

    Note: 
        1. Collatz(1) is [1].
        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

    For example:
    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.
    """
    # Initialize the list to store the odd numbers
    odd_numbers = []
    
    # Start with the given number n
    current = n
    
    # Generate the Collatz sequence
    while current != 1:
        # Check if the current number is odd
        if current % 2 == 1:
            odd_numbers.append(current)
        # Apply the Collatz rules
        if current % 2 == 0:
            current //= 2  # If even, divide by 2
        else:
            current = 3 * current + 1  # If odd, apply 3n + 1
    
    # Don't forget to add 1 to the list, as it is part of the sequence
    odd_numbers.append(1)
    
    # Sort the list of odd numbers
    odd_numbers.sort()
    
    return odd_numbers
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. We initialize an empty list `odd_numbers` to store the odd numbers from the Collatz sequence.
2. We use a while loop to generate the sequence until we reach 1.
3. Inside the loop, we check if the current number is odd and, if so, append it to the `odd_numbers` list.
4. We then apply the Collatz rules to determine the next number in the sequence.
5. After the loop, we append 1 to the list since it is always part of the sequence.
6. Finally, we sort the list of odd numbers and return it.

### Testing the Function
You can test the function with various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected:

```python
print(get_odd_collatz(5))  # Output: [1, 5]
print(get_odd_collatz(10)) # Output: [1, 5, 9]
print(get_odd_collatz(1))  # Output: [1]
``` 

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem requirements.
