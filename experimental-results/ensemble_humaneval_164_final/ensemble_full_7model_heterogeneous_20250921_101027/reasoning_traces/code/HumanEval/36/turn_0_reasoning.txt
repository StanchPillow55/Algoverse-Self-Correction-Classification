Final Answer: To solve the problem of counting how many times the digit '7' appears in integers less than `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13, we can break down the solution into several clear steps:

1. **Understand the Requirements**: We need to find all integers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13. For each of these integers, we will check how many times the digit '7' appears in their decimal representation.

2. **Iterate through Numbers**: We will loop through all integers from 0 to `n-1` (since we want numbers less than `n`).

3. **Check Divisibility**: For each integer in our loop, we will check if it is divisible by 11 or 13.

4. **Count the Digit '7'**: If the integer is divisible by 11 or 13, we will convert it to a string and count how many times '7' appears in that string.

5. **Accumulate the Count**: We will maintain a running total of the counts of '7's for all qualifying integers.

6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the total count.

Now, let's implement this logic in the `fizz_buzz` function.

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
    
    >>> fizz_buzz(50)
    0
    >>> fizz_buzz(78)
    2
    >>> fizz_buzz(79)
    3
    """
    count_of_sevens = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            count_of_sevens += str(i).count('7')
    
    return count_of_sevens
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define the function `fizz_buzz` which takes an integer `n` as input.
- We initialize a variable `count_of_sevens` to zero, which will keep track of the total occurrences of the digit '7'.
- We use a `for` loop to iterate through all integers from 0 to `n-1`.
- Inside the loop, we check if the current integer `i` is divisible by 11 or 13 using the modulus operator (`%`).
- If it is divisible, we convert `i` to a string and use the `count` method to find how many times '7' appears in that string representation. We add this count to `count_of_sevens`.
- After the loop completes, we return the total count of '7's found.

### Testing the Function:
The provided examples in the docstring can be tested to ensure the function behaves as expected. The function should return:
- `0` for `fizz_buzz(50)` since there are no numbers less than 50 that are divisible by 11 or 13 containing '7'.
- `2` for `fizz_buzz(78)` since the numbers 77 and 26 are the only ones that contribute to the count.
- `3` for `fizz_buzz(79)` since the numbers 77, 26, and 37 contribute to the count.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem requirements.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to iterate over the range of numbers from 1 to n (exclusive), and for each number, check if it is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, we need to check if the digit 7 appears in the number. We will keep a count of the number of times the digit 7 appears in such numbers. 

To check if a number is divisible by 11 or 13, we can use the modulus operator (%). If a number x is divisible by another number y, then x % y equals 0.
