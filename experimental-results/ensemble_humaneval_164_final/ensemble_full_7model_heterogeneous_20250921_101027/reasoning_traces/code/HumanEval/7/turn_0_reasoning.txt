=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of filtering a list of strings based on whether they contain a specified substring, we can break down the task into a series of logical steps:

1. **Understand the Input and Output**:
   - Input: A list of strings (`strings`) and a substring (`substring`).
   - Output: A new list containing only those strings from the input list that include the specified substring.

2. **Identify Edge Cases**:
   - If the input list is empty, the output should also be an empty list.
   - If the substring is an empty string, all strings in the list should be included since every string contains an empty substring.

3. **Iterate Through the List**:
   - We need to check each string in the input list to see if it contains the specified substring. This can be done using the `in` keyword in Python, which checks for the presence of a substring within a string.

4. **Collect Results**:
   - We will create a new list to store the strings that meet the criteria (i.e., those that contain the substring).

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, we will return the new list.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings only for ones that contain given substring
    >>> filter_by_substring([], 'a')
    []
    >>> filter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
    ['abc', 'bacd', 'array']
    """
    # Initialize an empty list to hold the filtered results
    filtered_strings = []
    
    # Iterate through each string in the input list
    for string in strings:
        # Check if the substring is in the current string
        if substring in string:
            # If it is, add the string to the filtered list
            filtered_strings.append(string)
    
    # Return the list of filtered strings
    return filtered_strings
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:
- We start by importing the `List` type from the `typing` module for type hinting.
- The function `filter_by_substring` takes two parameters: `strings` (a list of strings) and `substring` (the substring to search for).
- We initialize an empty list called `filtered_strings` to store the results.
- We loop through each string in the `strings` list. For each string, we check if the `substring` is present using the `in` operator.
- If the substring is found in the string, we append that string to the `filtered_strings` list.
- After the loop completes, we return the `filtered_strings` list, which contains only those strings that include the specified substring.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the requirements of the problem statement.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to write a function `filter_by_substring` that takes a list of strings `strings` and a substring `substring` as input, and returns a new list containing only the strings from the input list that contain the given substring.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can use a simple loop ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of filtering a list of strings based on whether they contain a given substring, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the thought process and implementation:

### Problem Understanding

We have a list of strings and a substring. Our task is to return a new list that contains only those strings from the original list that include the specified substring.

### Approach

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem is asking to return a list of strings that contain a given substring from a list of strings. 

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- Initialize an empty list to store the strings that contain the given substring
- Iterate through the list of strings
- For each string, I will check if the given substring is in the string
- If the substring is in the string, I will add the string to the list
- Finally return the list

Now I will implement this in...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): To solve this problem, we need to filter the input list of strings and return only the strings that contain the given substring. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the filtered strings.
2. Iterate through each string in the input list of strings.
3. For each string, check if the given substring is present in the string.
   - If the substring is present, append the string to the filtered list.
   - If the substring i...
