=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of calculating the n-th Fibonacci number, we first need to understand what the Fibonacci sequence is. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

- The first two Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1.
- Each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

The sequence starts like this:
- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(2) = F(0) + F(1) = 0 + 1 = 1
- F(3) = F(1) + F(2) = 1 + 1 = 2
- F(4) = F(2) + F(3) = 1 + 2 = 3
- F(5) = F(3) + F(4) = 2 + 3 = 5
- F(6) = F(4) + F(5) = 3 + 5 = 8
- F(7) = F(5) + F(6) = 5 + 8 = 13
- F(8) = F(6) + F(7) = 8 + 13 = 21
- F(9) = F(7) + F(8) = 13 + 21 = 34
- F(10) = F(8) + F(9) = 21 + 34 = 55

From the problem statement, we need to return the n-th Fibonacci number, where n is a non-negative integer. The examples provided in the docstring indicate that the Fibonacci sequence starts with F(1) = 1, which is a common convention in some contexts.

### Approach

1. **Base Cases**: We need to handle the base cases explicitly:
   - If n is 1, return 1.
   - If n is 2, return 1 (since F(2) = 1).
   
2. **Iterative Calculation**: For n greater than 2, we can use an iterative approach to calculate the Fibonacci number. This is efficient in terms of both time and space:
   - Initialize two variables to hold the last two Fibonacci numbers.
   - Use a loop to calculate the Fibonacci numbers up to n, updating the two variables at each step.

3. **Return the Result**: After the loop, the last computed Fibonacci number will be the n-th Fibonacci number.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above.

```python
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    """Return n-th Fibonacci number.
    >>> fib(10)
    55
    >>> fib(1)
    1
    >>> fib(8)
    21
    """
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
    a, b = 1, 1
    
    # Calculate Fibonacci numbers iteratively
    for _ in range(3, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b  # Update to the next Fibonacci number
    
    return b  # b is now the n-th Fibonacci number

# Example usage
print(fib(10))  # Output: 55
print(fib(1))   # Output: 1
print(fib(8))   # Output: 21
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We start by checking if n is 1 or 2, in which case we return 1 directly.
- We initialize two variables `a` and `b` to represent the two most recent Fibonacci numbers (both starting at 1).
- We then loop from 3 to n, updating `a` and `b` to reflect the next Fibonacci number in each iteration.
- Finally, we return `b`, which holds the n-th Fibonacci number after the loop completes.

This implementation is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it suitable for calculating Fibonacci numbers even for relatively large values of n.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem is to write a function `fib(n)` that returns the n-th Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The first few Fibonacci numbers are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, and so on.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of finding the n-th Fibonacci number, let's first understand the Fibonacci sequence. The sequence is defined as follows:

- The first Fibonacci number is 0 (F(0) = 0).
- The second Fibonacci number is 1 (F(1) = 1).
- For any n > 1, the n-th Fibonacci number is the sum of the two preceding ones: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).

Given this definition, the Fibonacci sequence starts as: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...

The problem is asking to return the n-th Fibonacci number. 

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of recursion. Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
