=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of counting distinct characters in a string regardless of their case, we can break down the task into a series of logical steps:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input is a string that may contain both uppercase and lowercase letters.
   - The output should be an integer representing the number of distinct characters in the string, treating 'A' and 'a' as the same character.

2. **Normalization**:
   - Since we need to treat characters case-insensitively, we can convert the entire string to either lowercase or uppercase. This will help us to unify the representation of characters.

3. **Using a Set**:
   - A set is a data structure that inherently only stores unique elements. By converting our normalized string into a set, we can automatically filter out duplicate characters.

4. **Counting Distinct Characters**:
   - The size of the set (i.e., the number of elements in it) will give us the count of distinct characters.

5. **Implementation**:
   - We will define the function `count_distinct_characters` that takes a string as input, normalizes it, converts it to a set, and returns the length of that set.

Now, let's implement the solution based on the reasoning above.

```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """ Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of
    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
    3
    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
    4
    """
    # Normalize the string to lowercase
    normalized_string = string.lower()
    
    # Create a set of characters from the normalized string
    distinct_characters = set(normalized_string)
    
    # Return the number of distinct characters
    return len(distinct_characters)

# Example usage
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))    # Output: 4
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Normalization**: We convert the input string to lowercase using `string.lower()`.
2. **Set Creation**: We create a set from the normalized string, which automatically removes duplicates.
3. **Count Distinct Characters**: We use `len()` to get the number of unique characters in the set and return that value.

### Testing:
The provided examples in the docstring serve as basic tests. We can further test the function with additional cases, such as:
- An empty string (should return 0).
- A string with all identical characters (should return 1).
- A string with special characters and digits (should also count them as distinct).

This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's built-in data structures to achieve the desired result with minimal code.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of counting distinct characters in a string, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the Problem Requirements:**
   - We are given a string and need to determine how many distinct characters it contains.
   - The problem specifies that the character count should be case-insensitive. This means 'A' and 'a' should be considered the same character.

2. **Plan the Solution:**
   - Convert the entire string to lowercase to ensure case in...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we can use the built-in Python data structure called a set. A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. This means that if we add the same element multiple times to a set, it will only be stored once. This property is very useful for our problem, because we want to count the number of distinct characters in a string.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. Convert the string to lowercase. This is because the problem statement sa...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): To solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct characters in the given string, regardless of their case. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Convert the string to lowercase to ignore case sensitivity.
2. Create an empty set to store the distinct characters.
3. Iterate through each character in the lowercase string.
4. Add each character to the set. Since a set only allows unique elements, duplicate characters will be automatically ign...
