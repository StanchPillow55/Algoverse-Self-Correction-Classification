=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of sorting a space-delimited string of numerals represented by their English words (from "zero" to "nine"), we can break down the solution into a series of logical steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Input and Output**:
   - The input is a string containing words that represent numbers from zero to nine, separated by spaces.
   - The output should be a string of these words sorted in ascending order based on their numerical values.

2. **Mapping Words to Numbers**:
   - We need a way to convert the words into their corresponding numerical values. This can be achieved using a dictionary where the keys are the words and the values are their respective integer representations.

3. **Splitting the Input String**:
   - We will split the input string into a list of words using the `split()` method, which will give us a list of the numeral words.

4. **Sorting the Words**:
   - We will sort the list of words based on their numerical values. To do this, we can use the `sorted()` function with a custom key that maps each word to its corresponding number using our dictionary.

5. **Joining the Sorted Words**:
   - After sorting, we will join the sorted list back into a single string with spaces in between the words.

6. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, we will return the resulting string.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the solution based on the reasoning above.

```python
from typing import List

def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    """ Input is a space-delimited string of numerals from 'zero' to 'nine'.
    Valid choices are 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight' and 'nine'.
    Return the string with numbers sorted from smallest to largest
    >>> sort_numbers('three one five')
    'one three five'
    """
    
    # Step 1: Create a mapping from words to their corresponding integer values
    word_to_number = {
        'zero': 0,
        'one': 1,
        'two': 2,
        'three': 3,
        'four': 4,
        'five': 5,
        'six': 6,
        'seven': 7,
        'eight': 8,
        'nine': 9
    }
    
    # Step 2: Split the input string into a list of words
    words = numbers.split()
    
    # Step 3: Sort the words based on their numerical values using the mapping
    sorted_words = sorted(words, key=lambda word: word_to_number[word])
    
    # Step 4: Join the sorted words back into a single string
    result = ' '.join(sorted_words)
    
    # Step 5: Return the result
    return result

# Example usage
print(sort_numbers('three one five'))  # Output: 'one three five'
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a dictionary `word_to_number` that maps each numeral word to its corresponding integer.
- We split the input string into a list of words using `split()`.
- We sort the list of words using `sorted()`, providing a lambda function as the key that retrieves the numerical value for each word from the dictionary.
- Finally, we join the sorted list into a single string with spaces and return it.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the requirements of the problem statement.
