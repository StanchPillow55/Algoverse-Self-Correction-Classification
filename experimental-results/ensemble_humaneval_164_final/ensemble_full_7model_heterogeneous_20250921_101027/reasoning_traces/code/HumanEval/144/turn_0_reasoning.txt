=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of determining whether the product of two fractions \( x \) and \( n \) results in a whole number, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understanding the Input Format**: Both \( x \) and \( n \) are given as strings in the format "numerator/denominator". We need to extract the numerator and denominator from each string.

2. **Calculating the Product of the Fractions**: The product of two fractions \( \frac{a}{b} \) and \( \frac{c}{d} \) is given by:
   \[
   \frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d}
   \]
   This means we need to multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.

3. **Checking for Whole Number**: A fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \) is a whole number if \( p \) is divisible by \( q \) (i.e., \( p \mod q = 0 \)). Therefore, after calculating the product's numerator and denominator, we need to check if the numerator is divisible by the denominator.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Parse the input strings to extract the numerators and denominators.
   - Calculate the product's numerator and denominator.
   - Check if the product's numerator is divisible by the product's denominator.
   - Return `True` if it is divisible (indicating a whole number), and `False` otherwise.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
def simplify(x, n):
    """Check if the product of two fractions x and n is a whole number."""
    
    # Split the fractions into numerator and denominator
    x_numerator, x_denominator = map(int, x.split('/'))
    n_numerator, n_denominator = map(int, n.split('/'))
    
    # Calculate the product's numerator and denominator
    product_numerator = x_numerator * n_numerator
    product_denominator = x_denominator * n_denominator
    
    # Check if the product is a whole number
    return product_numerator % product_denominator == 0

# Test cases
print(simplify("1/5", "5/1"))  # True
print(simplify("1/6", "2/1"))  # False
print(simplify("7/10", "10/2"))  # False
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We use `split('/')` to separate the numerator and denominator of each fraction.
- We convert these string values to integers using `map(int, ...)`.
- We compute the product's numerator and denominator using simple multiplication.
- Finally, we check if the product's numerator is divisible by the product's denominator using the modulus operator `%`. If the result is zero, it indicates that the product is a whole number, and we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem's requirements.
