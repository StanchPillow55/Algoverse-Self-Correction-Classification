=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of removing duplicates from a list of integers while preserving the order of the remaining elements, we can break down the task into a series of logical steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - We are given a list of integers (`numbers`).
   - We need to return a new list that contains only those integers that appear exactly once in the original list.
   - The order of the integers in the output list should match their first appearance in the input list.

2. **Identifying Duplicates**:
   - To determine which integers are duplicates, we can use a counting mechanism. A dictionary (or a `Counter` from the `collections` module) can be useful for this purpose, as it allows us to count occurrences of each integer efficiently.

3. **Building the Result List**:
   - After counting the occurrences, we can iterate through the original list again and select only those integers that have a count of 1 (i.e., they are not duplicates).

4. **Implementation Considerations**:
   - We need to ensure that our solution is efficient. Counting the occurrences will take O(n) time, and creating the result list will also take O(n), leading to an overall time complexity of O(n).
   - We should also consider edge cases, such as an empty list or a list where all elements are duplicates.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the solution based on the reasoning above.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.
    
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """
    # Step 1: Count occurrences of each number
    count = Counter(numbers)
    
    # Step 2: Create a result list with numbers that occur exactly once
    result = [num for num in numbers if count[num] == 1]
    
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Importing Required Modules**:
   - We import `List` from `typing` for type hinting and `Counter` from `collections` to facilitate counting occurrences.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - We create a `Counter` object called `count` that will hold the frequency of each integer in the input list.

3. **Building the Result List**:
   - We use a list comprehension to iterate through the original list `numbers`. For each number, we check if its count is equal to 1. If it is, we include it in the `result` list.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, we return the `result` list, which contains only the integers that appeared exactly once in the original list.

### Testing the Function:
The provided docstring includes a test case. We can run this test case to verify that our implementation works as expected. Additionally, we can test other cases to ensure robustness. 

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the requirements of the problem statement.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Reasoning:

Given a list of integers, we are to determine the list of integers that occur only once in the list. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps: 

- Initialize an empty list `result` to keep track of the unique elements in the list
- Initialize an empty dictionary `count` to keep track of the frequency of each element in the list
- Iterate through all the elements in the list. On each iteration, we would check if the current element ex...

Reasoning:
1. We are given a list of integers as input, and we need to remove all elements that occur more than once in the list.
2. The order of the remaining elements should be the same as in the input list.
3. To remove duplicates while preserving the order, we can iterate through the list and keep track of the elements we have seen so far.
4. We can use a set ...
