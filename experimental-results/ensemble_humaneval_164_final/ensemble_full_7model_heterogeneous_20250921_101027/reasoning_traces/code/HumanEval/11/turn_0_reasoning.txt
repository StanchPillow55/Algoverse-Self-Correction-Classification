=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of performing a binary XOR operation on two strings consisting of '0's and '1's, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps involved:

### Step 1: Understanding XOR Operation
The XOR (exclusive OR) operation works as follows:
- If both bits are the same (0 XOR 0 = 0, 1 XOR 1 = 0), the result is 0.
- If the bits are different (0 XOR 1 = 1, 1 XOR 0 = 1), the result is 1.

### Step 2: Input Constraints
The inputs are two strings `a` and `b` that consist only of '0's and '1's. We need to ensure that both strings are of the same length for the XOR operation to be valid. If they are not, we should handle this case appropriately.

### Step 3: Implementation Plan
1. **Check Lengths**: Verify that both strings are of equal length. If not, we can raise an error or return an empty string.
2. **Iterate through Characters**: Loop through each character of both strings simultaneously.
3. **Perform XOR**: For each pair of characters, apply the XOR logic and build the result string.
4. **Return Result**: Finally, return the resultant string.

### Step 4: Implementation
Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Input are two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    Perform binary XOR on these inputs and return result also as a string.
    
    >>> string_xor('010', '110')
    '100'
    """
    # Step 1: Check if the lengths of the strings are equal
    if len(a) != len(b):
        raise ValueError("Input strings must be of the same length.")
    
    # Step 2: Initialize an empty result string
    result = []
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through both strings
    for char_a, char_b in zip(a, b):
        # Step 4: Perform XOR operation
        if char_a == char_b:
            result.append('0')
        else:
            result.append('1')
    
    # Step 5: Join the list into a string and return
    return ''.join(result)

# Example usage
print(string_xor('010', '110'))  # Output: '100'
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first check if the lengths of the two input strings are equal. If they are not, we raise a `ValueError`.
- We initialize an empty list `result` to store the results of the XOR operation.
- We use `zip` to iterate through both strings simultaneously, allowing us to access corresponding characters from both strings.
- For each pair of characters, we check if they are the same or different and append the appropriate result ('0' or '1') to the `result` list.
- Finally, we join the list into a single string and return it.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem requirements.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Reasoning:

The XOR operation is a binary operation that takes two bits, performs the exclusive OR operation on them and returns the result. The XOR operation is defined as follows:

- 0 XOR 0 = 0
- 0 XOR 1 = 1
- 1 XOR 0 = 1
- 1 XOR 1 = 0

In other words, the XOR operation returns 1 if the two bits are different, and 0 if they are the same.

Given two strings of 1s and 0s, we can perform the XOR operation on them by iterating through the strings one character at a time, p...
