=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of computing the n-th element of the FibFib sequence, we need to understand the sequence's definition and how it differs from the Fibonacci sequence.

### Understanding the FibFib Sequence

The FibFib sequence is defined as follows:
- fibfib(0) = 0
- fibfib(1) = 0
- fibfib(2) = 1
- For n >= 3, fibfib(n) = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3)

This means that each term in the sequence (starting from the third term) is the sum of the three preceding terms.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Base Cases**: We need to handle the base cases directly:
   - If `n` is 0, return 0.
   - If `n` is 1, return 0.
   - If `n` is 2, return 1.

2. **Recursive Relation**: For `n >= 3`, we will compute the value using the recursive relation:
   - fibfib(n) = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3)

3. **Efficiency Consideration**: A naive recursive implementation would lead to a lot of repeated calculations, which is inefficient. Instead, we can use an iterative approach or memoization to store previously computed values.

4. **Iterative Approach**: We can maintain a list (or an array) to store the computed values of the FibFib sequence up to `n`. This way, we can build the sequence iteratively.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def fibfib(n: int) -> int:
    """Compute the n-th element of the FibFib number sequence."""
    # Handle base cases
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize a list to store the FibFib numbers
    fibfib_numbers = [0] * (n + 1)
    fibfib_numbers[0] = 0
    fibfib_numbers[1] = 0
    fibfib_numbers[2] = 1
    
    # Fill the list using the recursive relation
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        fibfib_numbers[i] = fibfib_numbers[i - 1] + fibfib_numbers[i - 2] + fibfib_numbers[i - 3]
    
    # Return the n-th FibFib number
    return fibfib_numbers[n]

# Example usage
print(fibfib(1))  # Output: 0
print(fibfib(5))  # Output: 4
print(fibfib(8))  # Output: 24
```

### Explanation of the Implementation

- We first handle the base cases directly.
- We create a list `fibfib_numbers` to store the computed values of the sequence.
- We initialize the first three values based on the definition.
- We then use a loop to compute each subsequent value using the previously computed values.
- Finally, we return the n-th value from our list.

This implementation is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), making it suitable for reasonably large values of `n`.
