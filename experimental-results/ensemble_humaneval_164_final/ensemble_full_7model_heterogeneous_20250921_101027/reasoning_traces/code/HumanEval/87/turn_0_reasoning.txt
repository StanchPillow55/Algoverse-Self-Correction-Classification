=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of finding the coordinates of a specific integer `x` in a 2D list (or nested list), we need to follow a systematic approach. Here's how we can break down the problem:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input is a 2D list (a list of lists) where each inner list can have a different length.
   - We also have an integer `x` that we need to search for in this 2D list.
   - The output should be a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the coordinates (row index, column index) of occurrences of `x` in the 2D list.

2. **Coordinate System**:
   - The coordinates are zero-indexed, meaning the first row and the first column are both indexed as 0.

3. **Searching for `x`**:
   - We need to iterate through each row of the 2D list.
   - For each row, we will check each element to see if it matches `x`.
   - If a match is found, we will record the row and column indices.

4. **Sorting the Results**:
   - After collecting all the coordinates, we need to sort them:
     - First, by the row index in ascending order.
     - Then, by the column index in descending order within each row.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the input list is empty, we should return an empty list.
   - If `x` is not found in the list, we should also return an empty list.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def get_row(lst, x):
    """
    Given a 2D list (nested lists) and an integer x, find all occurrences of x
    and return a list of tuples representing their coordinates (row, column).
    The coordinates are sorted by row in ascending order and by column in descending order.
    """
    coordinates = []
    
    # Iterate through each row in the list
    for row_index, row in enumerate(lst):
        # Iterate through each element in the row
        for col_index, value in enumerate(row):
            # Check if the current value matches x
            if value == x:
                # If it matches, append the coordinate (row_index, col_index) to the list
                coordinates.append((row_index, col_index))
    
    # Sort the coordinates first by row (ascending) and then by column (descending)
    coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
    
    return coordinates
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We initialize an empty list `coordinates` to store the found coordinates.
- We use `enumerate` to loop through each row and its index. For each row, we again use `enumerate` to loop through its elements.
- If an element matches `x`, we append its coordinates as a tuple to the `coordinates` list.
- Finally, we sort the `coordinates` list using a custom sorting key:
  - The first part of the key is the row index (ascending).
  - The second part is the negative column index (to achieve descending order).
- The sorted list of coordinates is returned.

### Testing the Function

We can test the function with the provided examples to ensure it works correctly:

```python
print(get_row([
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6],
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
], 1))  # Expected: [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]

print(get_row([], 1))  # Expected: []

print(get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3))  # Expected: [(2, 2)]
```

This implementation should work correctly for the given problem statement and handle the specified edge cases.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Reasoning:

Given a 2-dimensional list and an integer, we are to determine the coordinates of the integer in the list. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize an empty list `coordinates` to store the coordinates of the integer in the list.
2. Iterate through all the elements in the list. On each iteration, we would check if the integer exists in the current list. If it does, we would find the index of the integer in the list and ...

2. For each row, iterate through each element in the row.
3. If the element matches the given integer x, add its coordinate (row, column) to a result list.
