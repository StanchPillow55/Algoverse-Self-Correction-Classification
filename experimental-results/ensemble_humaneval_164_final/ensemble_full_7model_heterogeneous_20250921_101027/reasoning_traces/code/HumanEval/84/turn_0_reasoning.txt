=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of calculating the sum of the digits of a given integer \( N \) and returning that sum in binary format, we can break down the solution into a series of clear steps:

1. **Extract the Digits**: We need to extract each digit from the integer \( N \). This can be done by converting the integer to a string and iterating through each character, converting it back to an integer.

2. **Sum the Digits**: Once we have the individual digits, we can sum them up using Python's built-in `sum()` function.

3. **Convert to Binary**: After obtaining the sum of the digits, we need to convert this sum into its binary representation. Python provides a built-in function `bin()` that converts an integer to its binary string representation prefixed with '0b'. We will need to strip off the '0b' prefix to get the pure binary string.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the binary string representation of the sum.

Now, let's implement this step-by-step in the function `solve(N)`.

### Implementation

```python
def solve(N):
    """Given a positive integer N, return the total sum of its digits in binary."""
    
    # Step 1: Extract digits and sum them
    digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(N))
    
    # Step 2: Convert the sum to binary
    binary_sum = bin(digit_sum)[2:]  # [2:] to remove the '0b' prefix
    
    return binary_sum

# Example usage:
print(solve(1000))  # Output: "1"
print(solve(150))   # Output: "110"
print(solve(147))   # Output: "1100"
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Extracting and Summing Digits**:
   - We convert \( N \) to a string to iterate over each character.
   - For each character (which represents a digit), we convert it back to an integer and sum them using a generator expression inside the `sum()` function.

2. **Binary Conversion**:
   - We use `bin(digit_sum)` to convert the sum to binary. The result includes a '0b' prefix, which we remove by slicing the string with `[2:]`.

3. **Returning the Result**:
   - The function returns the binary string representation of the sum of the digits.

### Testing the Function:
The provided examples in the problem statement can be tested to ensure the function works correctly. The expected outputs match the results from the function, confirming its correctness. 

This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's capabilities for string manipulation and number conversion.
