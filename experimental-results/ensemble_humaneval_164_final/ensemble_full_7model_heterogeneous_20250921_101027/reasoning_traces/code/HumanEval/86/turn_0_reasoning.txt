=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of creating an "anti-shuffle" function, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the requirements and the steps we need to take to implement the solution.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Input and Output**:
   - Input: A string `s` that may contain words separated by spaces and punctuation.
   - Output: A new string where each word's characters are sorted in ascending order based on their ASCII values, while maintaining the original order of words and spaces.

2. **Understanding Words**:
   - A word is defined as a sequence of characters separated by spaces.
   - We need to identify these words and sort the characters within each word.

3. **Handling Spaces**:
   - Spaces should be preserved in their original positions. This means we need to ensure that when we split the string into words, we also account for the spaces.

4. **Sorting Characters**:
   - For each word, we will sort the characters. This can be done using Python's built-in `sorted()` function.

5. **Reconstructing the String**:
   - After sorting the characters of each word, we need to join them back together with spaces in their original positions.

### Steps to Implement the Solution

1. **Split the String**: Use the `split()` method to separate the words and keep track of spaces.
2. **Sort Each Word**: For each word, sort its characters.
3. **Reconstruct the String**: Join the sorted words back together, ensuring that spaces are preserved.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the outlined steps:

```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.
    """
    # Split the input string into words while preserving spaces
    words = s.split(' ')
    
    # Sort the characters in each word
    sorted_words = [''.join(sorted(word)) for word in words]
    
    # Join the sorted words back with spaces
    result = ' '.join(sorted_words)
    
    return result

# Test cases
print(anti_shuffle('Hi'))  # Expected: 'Hi'
print(anti_shuffle('hello'))  # Expected: 'ehllo'
print(anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!'))  # Expected: 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Splitting the String**: We use `s.split(' ')` to split the string into words based on spaces. This preserves the spaces in the output.
2. **Sorting Characters**: We use a list comprehension to iterate over each word, sort its characters using `sorted(word)`, and then join them back into a string using `''.join()`.
3. **Joining Words**: Finally, we join the sorted words back together with spaces using `' '.join(sorted_words)`.

### Conclusion

The function `anti_shuffle` effectively sorts the characters of each word while maintaining the original structure of the string, including spaces. The implementation is straightforward and leverages Python's built-in capabilities for string manipulation and sorting.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to write a function called `anti_shuffle` that takes a string as input and returns an "ordered version" of the string. The ordered version of the string means that all the words (separated by spaces) are replaced by a new word where all the characters are arranged in ascending order based ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of creating an "ordered version" of a string, we need to focus on sorting the characters within each word while maintaining the original order of words and spaces in the sentence. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**
   - We are given a string that may contain multiple words separated by spaces.
   - Each word needs to be transformed such that its characters...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem is asking to return a new string where each word in the input string is sorted based on the ASCII value of its characters. The order of the words and spaces in the sentence should remain the same.

To solve this problem, I will use the following steps:
- Split the input string into words.
- For each word, convert it into a list of characters, sort the list, and then join the characters back into a string.
- Join the sorted words back into a sentence.

Here is ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Split the input string into words using the space character as the delimiter. This will give us a list of words.

2. For each word in the list:
   - Convert the word to a list of characters.
   - Sort the characters in ascending order based on their ASCII value.
   - Join the sorted characters back into a word.

3. Join the sorted words back into a string using space as the separator.

4. Return the...
