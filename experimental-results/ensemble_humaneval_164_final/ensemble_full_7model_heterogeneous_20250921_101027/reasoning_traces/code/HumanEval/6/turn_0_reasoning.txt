=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of determining the maximum depth of nested parentheses for each group of parentheses in a given string, we can break down the task into a series of logical steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: We need to split the input string into separate groups of parentheses. Each group is separated by spaces.

2. **Depth Calculation**: For each group of parentheses, we will calculate the maximum depth of nesting. This can be done by iterating through each character in the string:
   - Use a counter to keep track of the current depth of nesting.
   - Increment the counter when encountering an opening parenthesis `(`.
   - Decrement the counter when encountering a closing parenthesis `)`.
   - Keep track of the maximum value of the counter during this process.

3. **Output**: After calculating the maximum depth for each group, we will store these values in a list and return it.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """ Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.
    For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
    E.g. (()()) has maximum two levels of nesting while ((())) has three.

    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
    [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """
    # Split the input string into groups based on spaces
    groups = paren_string.split()
    depths = []

    for group in groups:
        max_depth = 0
        current_depth = 0
        
        for char in group:
            if char == '(':
                current_depth += 1
                max_depth = max(max_depth, current_depth)
            elif char == ')':
                current_depth -= 1
        
        # Append the maximum depth found for this group
        depths.append(max_depth)

    return depths
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Input Handling**: The input string is split into groups using `split()`, which handles multiple spaces and returns a list of groups.
  
- **Depth Calculation**:
  - We initialize `max_depth` to track the maximum depth encountered and `current_depth` to track the current level of nesting as we iterate through each character in the group.
  - For each `(`, we increment `current_depth` and update `max_depth` if `current_depth` exceeds it.
  - For each `)`, we decrement `current_depth`. Note that we assume the input is well-formed (balanced parentheses), so we do not handle errors for mismatched parentheses.

- **Output Construction**: After processing each group, we append the maximum depth found to the `depths` list, which is returned at the end.

### Testing the Function:

We can test the function using the provided example:

```python
print(parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'))  # Expected output: [2, 3, 1, 3]
```

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, correctly calculating the maximum depth of nested parentheses for each group in the input string.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Reasoning:

The problem is asking to find the maximum depth of nested parentheses for each group in the given string. We can solve this problem by using a stack data structure. 

Here is the step by step approach to solve this problem:

1. Split the input string by spaces to get the individual groups of parentheses.

2. For each group, initialize a stack and a variable 'max_depth' to 0.

3. Iterate over each character in the group. If the character is '(', push it to the ...
