=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of "strange sorting" a list of integers, we need to follow a specific pattern: we will alternate between selecting the minimum and maximum values from the remaining integers in the list until all integers have been selected.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input is a list of integers, which can include duplicates and can be empty.
   - The output should be a new list that follows the "strange order" as described.

2. **Identifying the Pattern**:
   - We start with the smallest integer (minimum).
   - Next, we take the largest integer (maximum) from the remaining integers.
   - We repeat this process, alternating between the minimum and maximum until we have processed all integers.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the input list is empty, the output should also be an empty list.
   - If all integers are the same, the output should simply be the same list.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Sort the input list to easily access the minimum and maximum values.
   - Use two pointers or indices: one starting from the beginning (for minimum) and one from the end (for maximum).
   - Create a new list to store the result.
   - Use a loop to alternate between adding the minimum and maximum values to the result list until all elements are processed.

5. **Final Considerations**:
   - We need to ensure that we do not add the same element twice if the list has duplicates.
   - We will keep track of which elements have been added to avoid repetition.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above.

```python
def strange_sort_list(lst):
    '''
    Given list of integers, return list in strange order.
    Strange sorting, is when you start with the minimum value,
    then maximum of the remaining integers, then minimum and so on.
    '''
    # Edge case: if the list is empty
    if not lst:
        return []
    
    # Sort the list to easily access min and max
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    
    result = []
    left = 0  # Pointer for the minimum
    right = len(sorted_lst) - 1  # Pointer for the maximum
    
    # Alternate between minimum and maximum
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:  # If both pointers meet, add that element once
            result.append(sorted_lst[left])
        else:
            result.append(sorted_lst[left])  # Add minimum
            result.append(sorted_lst[right])  # Add maximum
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    
    return result

# Test cases
print(strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected: [1, 4, 2, 3]
print(strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]))  # Expected: [5, 5, 5, 5]
print(strange_sort_list([]))             # Expected: []
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first check if the list is empty and return an empty list if it is.
- We sort the input list to facilitate easy access to the minimum and maximum values.
- We use two pointers (`left` for the minimum and `right` for the maximum) to traverse the sorted list.
- In each iteration of the while loop, we check if the two pointers have met. If they have, we add that element once to the result. Otherwise, we add the elements pointed to by `left` and `right` to the result list.
- Finally, we return the constructed result list. 

This implementation efficiently constructs the desired output while adhering to the specified "strange sorting" order.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem statement asks us to implement a function called `strange_sort_list` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list in a "strange order". The strange order is defined as starting with the minimum value, then the maximum of the remaining integers, then the minimum and so on.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of sorting a list in a "strange" order, we need to alternate between selecting the minimum and maximum values from the list until all elements are used. Let's break down the problem and develop a solution step by step.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a list of integers.
   - We need to sort the list such that we start with the minimum value, then the maximum of the remaining values, then the next mini...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem is asking to return a list of integers in a specific order. The order starts with the smallest integer, then the largest of the remaining integers, then the smallest of the remaining integers, and so on.

To solve this problem, I will use the following steps:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the sorted integers.
2. While the input list is not empty, repeat the following steps:
   a. Find the minimum value in the list, append it to the sorted list, and rem...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): To solve the problem of strange sorting a list, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if the input list is empty. If it is, return an empty list since there's nothing to sort.

2. Initialize two pointers, one pointing to the start of the list (min_index) and another pointing to the end of the list (max_index).

3. Create a new list to store the strangely sorted elements.

4. Iterate while min_index is less than or equal to max_index:
   - Append the ele...
