Final Answer: To solve the problem of determining whether the length of the intersection of two closed intervals is a prime number, we can break down the solution into several clear steps:

### Step 1: Understanding Intervals
Each interval is represented as a tuple `(start, end)`, where:
- `start` is the beginning of the interval.
- `end` is the end of the interval.
- The intervals are closed, meaning both endpoints are included.

### Step 2: Finding the Intersection
To find the intersection of two intervals `(start1, end1)` and `(start2, end2)`, we can calculate:
- The start of the intersection: `max(start1, start2)`
- The end of the intersection: `min(end1, end2)`

The intersection is valid if the start of the intersection is less than or equal to the end of the intersection.

### Step 3: Calculating the Length of the Intersection
If the intersection is valid, the length of the intersection can be calculated as:
- `length = end_of_intersection - start_of_intersection`

### Step 4: Checking for Primality
To determine if the length is a prime number, we need a helper function that checks if a number is prime:
- A prime number is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
- We can check for primality by testing divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.

### Step 5: Putting It All Together
We will implement the main function `intersection` that follows the steps outlined above and returns "YES" if the length of the intersection is a prime number, otherwise "NO".

### Implementation
Now, let's implement the solution in Python:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    """Determine if the length of the intersection of two intervals is a prime number."""
    start1, end1 = interval1
    start2, end2 = interval2
    
    # Calculate the intersection
    start_intersection = max(start1, start2)
    end_intersection = min(end1, end2)
    
    # Check if the intervals intersect
    if start_intersection > end_intersection:
        return "NO"  # No intersection
    
    # Calculate the length of the intersection
    length = end_intersection - start_intersection
    
    # Check if the length is a prime number
    if is_prime(length):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"

# Example test cases
print(intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)))  # Output: "NO"
print(intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)))  # Output: "NO"
print(intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)))  # Output: "YES"
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **is_prime function**: This function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility.
2. **intersection function**: This function calculates the intersection of the two intervals, checks if they intersect, computes the length of the intersection, and checks if that length is prime.
3. **Test cases**: We included some test cases to validate the implementation.

This structured approach ensures that the solution is clear, efficient, and easy to understand.
