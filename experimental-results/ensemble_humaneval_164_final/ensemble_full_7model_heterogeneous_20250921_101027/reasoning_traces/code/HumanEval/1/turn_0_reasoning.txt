=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of separating groups of nested parentheses from a given string, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps involved:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input is a string that contains multiple groups of parentheses, which may include spaces.
   - The output should be a list of strings, each representing a separate group of balanced parentheses.

2. **Identifying Groups**:
   - We need to traverse the input string and identify where each group of parentheses starts and ends.
   - A group starts with an opening parenthesis `(` and ends with a closing parenthesis `)`.
   - We need to ensure that we correctly handle nested parentheses, but since the problem states that groups are not nested within each other, we can assume that once we find a complete group, we can extract it.

3. **Ignoring Spaces**:
   - We should ignore any spaces in the input string while processing.

4. **Using a Stack**:
   - A stack can be useful for tracking the balance of parentheses. Each time we encounter an opening parenthesis, we push it onto the stack, and for each closing parenthesis, we pop from the stack.
   - When the stack is empty after processing a closing parenthesis, it indicates that we have a complete group.

5. **Building the Result**:
   - As we identify complete groups, we can store them in a list to return at the end.

### Implementation

Now that we have a clear understanding of the problem, let's implement the function `separate_paren_groups`.

```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    """Separate groups of nested parentheses into a list of strings."""
    
    # Remove spaces from the input string
    paren_string = paren_string.replace(" ", "")
    
    result = []
    stack = []
    current_group = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            # Start of a new group
            if not stack:  # If the stack is empty, we are starting a new group
                current_group = []  # Reset current group
            stack.append(char)
            current_group.append(char)  # Add to current group
        elif char == ')':
            if stack:
                stack.pop()  # Pop from stack
                current_group.append(char)  # Add to current group
                if not stack:  # If stack is empty, we have a complete group
                    result.append(''.join(current_group))  # Join current group and add to result
                    current_group = []  # Reset current group for the next group
    
    return result

# Example usage
print(separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))'))  # Output: ['()', '(())', '(()())']
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Removing Spaces**: We first remove all spaces from the input string to simplify processing.
2. **Initialization**: We initialize an empty list `result` to store the final groups, a `stack` to keep track of the parentheses, and `current_group` to build the current group of parentheses.
3. **Iterating Through Characters**: We loop through each character in the cleaned string:
   - If we encounter `(`, we check if the stack is empty (indicating the start of a new group), and we reset `current_group`. We then push `(` onto the stack and add it to `current_group`.
   - If we encounter `)`, we pop from the stack and add `)` to `current_group`. If the stack is empty after popping, it means we have a complete group, so we join `current_group` into a string and add it to `result`.
4. **Returning the Result**: Finally, we return the list of separated groups.

This implementation effectively separates the groups of parentheses as required by the problem statement.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Reasoning:

The problem is asking to separate the groups of parentheses from the given string. The groups of parentheses are balanced and not nested within each other. We need to ignore any spaces in the input string.

To solve this problem, I will use a stack data structure. The stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure, which means the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. This property of stack makes it ideal for this problem.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): To solve this problem, we need to separate the groups of parentheses into individual strings and return them as a list. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize an empty list called `result` to store the separated groups of parentheses.
2. Initialize an empty string called `current_group` to store the current group of parentheses being processed.
3. Initialize a variable called `balance` to keep track of the balance of opening and closing paren...
