=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to create a function `any_int(x, y, z)` that checks two main conditions:

1. **Integer Check**: All three inputs (`x`, `y`, `z`) must be integers.
2. **Sum Condition**: One of the numbers must be equal to the sum of the other two.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Check for Integers**: We can use the `isinstance()` function to check if each of the inputs is an integer. This will ensure that we only proceed with the calculations if all inputs are integers.

2. **Check the Sum Condition**: We need to check three possible conditions:
   - If `x` is equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x == y + z`)
   - If `y` is equal to the sum of `x` and `z` (i.e., `y == x + z`)
   - If `z` is equal to the sum of `x` and `y` (i.e., `z == x + y`)

3. **Return the Result**: If both conditions (integer check and sum condition) are satisfied, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def any_int(x, y, z):
    '''
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    
    Examples
    any_int(5, 2, 7) ➞ True
    any_int(3, 2, 2) ➞ False
    any_int(3, -2, 1) ➞ True
    any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2) ➞ False
    '''
    
    # Check if all inputs are integers
    if isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int) and isinstance(z, int):
        # Check the sum condition
        if x == y + z or y == x + z or z == x + y:
            return True
    # If any condition fails, return False
    return False
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- The function starts by checking if `x`, `y`, and `z` are all integers using `isinstance()`.
- If they are integers, it then checks the three possible conditions where one number equals the sum of the other two.
- If any of these conditions are met, it returns `True`.
- If any of the checks fail (either not all are integers or the sum condition is not met), it returns `False`.

### Testing the Function:

We can test the function with the provided examples to ensure it behaves as expected.

```python
print(any_int(5, 2, 7))    # True
print(any_int(3, 2, 2))    # False
print(any_int(3, -2, 1))   # True
print(any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2)) # False
```

This implementation should correctly handle the requirements of the problem statement.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to create a function called `any_int` that takes three numbers as input and returns `True` if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all the numbers are integers. Otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Identifying the Inputs and Outputs**: The function takes three...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to create a function `any_int(x, y, z)` that checks if any one of the three numbers is equal to the sum of the other two numbers, and all numbers must be integers. If these conditions are met, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to approach this problem:

1. **Check if all inputs are integers**: 
   - The first step is to ensure that all three inputs are integers. If...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers. If not, return false.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- First, I will check if all the given numbers are integers. If not, return false.
- Then, I will check if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two. If yes, return true.
- If none of the above conditions are met, return false.

Implementation:

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps and think through the logic:

1. We need to check if any of the three numbers is equal to the sum of the other two.
   - We can compare x with y + z
   - We can compare y with x + z
   - We can compare z with x + y

2. We also need to ensure that all three numbers are integers.
   - We can use the isinstance() function to check if each number is an instance of the int class.

3. If any of th...
