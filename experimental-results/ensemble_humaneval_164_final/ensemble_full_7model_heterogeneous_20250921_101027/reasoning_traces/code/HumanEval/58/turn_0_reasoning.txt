=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of finding the sorted unique common elements between two lists, we can break down the task into several clear steps:

1. **Identify Common Elements**: We need to find elements that are present in both lists. This can be efficiently done using set operations, as sets inherently handle uniqueness and provide fast membership testing.

2. **Sort the Common Elements**: Once we have the common elements, we need to sort them in ascending order.

3. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the sorted list of common elements.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Convert Lists to Sets**: Convert both input lists to sets. This will allow us to easily find the intersection (common elements) and also ensure that all elements are unique.

2. **Find Intersection**: Use the intersection operation on the two sets to get the common elements.

3. **Sort the Result**: Convert the resulting set of common elements back to a list and sort it.

4. **Return the Sorted List**: Finally, return the sorted list of common elements.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above.

```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.
    
    >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
    [1, 5, 653]
    >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
    [2, 3]
    """
    # Convert lists to sets to find unique elements
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)
    
    # Find the intersection of both sets
    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)
    
    # Sort the common elements and return as a list
    return sorted(common_elements)

# Example usage
print(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]))  # Output: [1, 5, 653]
print(common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2]))  # Output: [2, 3]
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We define the function `common` that takes two lists as input.
- Inside the function, we convert both lists to sets (`set1` and `set2`).
- We then find the intersection of these two sets using the `intersection` method, which gives us a set of common elements.
- Finally, we sort the resulting set and return it as a list.

### Testing:

The provided docstring includes examples that serve as tests. We can run these examples to verify that our implementation works correctly. The expected outputs match the results produced by the function, confirming its correctness.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem is asking to return a sorted list of unique common elements between two input lists. 

To solve this problem, I will use the following steps:

1. Convert both input lists to sets. This will automatically remove any duplicate elements from each list, and also allow us to easily find the common elements between the two lists.

2. Use the intersection method of the set data type to find the common elements between the two sets. This will return another set that c...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): To find the common elements between two lists and return them as a sorted list of unique elements, we can follow these steps:

1. Create an empty result list to store the common elements.
2. Iterate through each element in the first list.
3. For each element, check if it exists in the second list.
4. If the element is present in the second list and not already in the result list, append it to the result list.
5. After iterating through all elements in ...
