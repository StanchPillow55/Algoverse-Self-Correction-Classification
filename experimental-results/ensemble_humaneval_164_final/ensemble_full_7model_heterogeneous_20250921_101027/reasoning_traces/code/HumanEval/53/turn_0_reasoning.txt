=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of implementing the `add` function, we need to follow a structured approach. Here’s how I would think through the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Requirements
The function `add` is supposed to take two integers, `x` and `y`, as input and return their sum. The function should also include a docstring that describes its purpose and provides examples of how it works.

### Step 2: Analyze the Docstring
The provided docstring includes two examples:
- `add(2, 3)` should return `5`
- `add(5, 7)` should return `12`

These examples clarify that the function should perform a simple addition operation.

### Step 3: Define the Function
The function will:
1. Accept two parameters, `x` and `y`, both of type `int`.
2. Return the sum of `x` and `y`.

### Step 4: Implement the Function
Now, I will implement the function based on the understanding from the previous steps. The implementation will be straightforward since Python has built-in support for addition of integers.

### Step 5: Write the Code
Here’s the complete function definition:

```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers x and y.
    
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `add` is defined with two parameters `x` and `y`, both annotated as integers (`int`).
- The return type is also specified as `int`, indicating that the function will return an integer.
- Inside the function, the expression `x + y` computes the sum of the two input integers.
- The result of the addition is returned to the caller.

### Step 6: Testing the Function
To ensure that the function works as expected, we can run the provided examples in a Python environment. The examples in the docstring can be tested using a Python interactive shell or a testing framework that supports doctests.

### Conclusion
The function is now complete and should work correctly for any integer inputs. The implementation is simple and efficient, adhering to the requirements outlined in the problem statement.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Certainly! Let's think through the problem step by step and implement the solution.

Problem:
The problem is to create a function called `add` that takes two integer parameters `x` and `y` and returns their sum. The function should be able to add any two integers correctly.

Reasoning:
To add two numbers, we need to perform the addition operation on the input parameters `x` and `y`. In Python, we can use the `+` operator to add two integers.
