Final Answer: To solve the problem of finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers \( a \) and \( b \), we can use the well-known Euclidean algorithm. This algorithm is efficient and works based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.

Final Answer: To solve the problem of finding the sorted unique common elements between two lists, we can break down the task into several clear steps:
1. **Identify Common Elements**: We need to find elements that are present in both lists. This can be efficiently done using set operations, as sets inherently handle uniqueness and provide fast membership testing.

Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to create a function `will_it_fly(q, w)` that checks two conditions for the list `q`:
1. **Balanced Condition**: The list `q` must be a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, `[1, 2, 1]` is a palindrome, while `[1, 2, 3]` is not.

Final Answer: To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of changes required to make an array palindromic, we need to understand the properties of a palindrome. A palindromic array reads the same forwards and backwards, which means that for an array `arr`, the following condition must hold true:
- `arr[i]` must equal `arr[n-1-i]` for all valid indices `i`, where `n` is the length of the array.

Final Answer: To solve the problem of counting the number of sentences that start with the word ""I"" in a given string, we can break down the task into several clear steps:
1. **Identify Sentence Delimiters**: We need to recognize that sentences are separated by '.', '?', or '!'. This means we will split the input string based on these characters.

Final Answer: To solve the problem of encoding a message according to the specified rules, we need to break down the requirements step by step:
1. **Swap Case**: For each character in the message, if it's lowercase, we need to convert it to uppercase and vice versa. This can be easily achieved using Python's string method `.swapcase()`.

Final Answer: To determine if three given lengths can form a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. According to this theorem, for a triangle with sides of lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(c\) is the longest side), the following condition must hold true:

Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to create a function that processes a string according to specific rules regarding character case and string reversal. Let's break down the requirements step-by-step:
1. **Character Case Reversal**:
