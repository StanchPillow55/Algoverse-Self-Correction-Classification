=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the cost per serving of the apple pie that Hannah is making, we need to calculate the total cost of all the ingredients and then divide that total by the number of servings.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the ingredients

1. **Cost of apples**:
   - Hannah needs 2 pounds of apples.
   - The cost per pound is $2.00.
   - Total cost for apples = 2 pounds × $2.00/pound = $4.00.

2. **Cost of pie crust**:
   - The pre-made pie crust costs $2.00.
   - Total cost for pie crust = $2.00.

3. **Cost of lemon**:
   - The lemon costs $0.50.
   - Total cost for lemon = $0.50.

4. **Cost of butter**:
   - The butter costs $1.50.
   - Total cost for butter = $1.50.

### Step 2: Add up all the costs

Now, we will sum up all the costs calculated above:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of apples} + \text{Cost of pie crust} + \text{Cost of lemon} + \text{Cost of butter}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 4.00 + 2.00 + 0.50 + 1.50
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

- First, add the cost of apples and pie crust:
  \[
  4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00
  \]

- Next, add the cost of the lemon:
  \[
  6.00 + 0.50 = 6.50
  \]

- Finally, add the cost of the butter:
  \[
  6.50 + 1.50 = 8.00
  \]

So, the total cost of all the ingredients is **$8.00**.

### Step 3: Calculate the cost per serving

Hannah's pie serves 8 people. To find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[
\text{Cost per serving} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of servings}} = \frac{8.00}{8}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Cost per serving} = 1.00
\]

### Final Answer

The cost per serving of the pie is **$1.00**.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine the cost per serving of Hannah's apple pie, we need to calculate the total cost of all the ingredients and then divide that total by the number of servings.

Let's break down the costs of each ingredient:

1. **Apples**: Hannah needs 2 pounds of apples, and they cost $2.00 per pound.  
   \[
   \text{Cost of apples} = 2 \, \text{pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$4.00
   \]

2. **Pie crust**: The pre-made pie crust costs $2.00.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients needed to make the apple pie. 

The cost of the apples is 2 pounds times $2.00 per pound, which equals $4.00. 

The cost of the pre-made pie crust is $2.00. 

The cost of the lemon is $0.50. 

The cost of the butter is $1.50. 

Adding all these costs together, we get the total cost of the ingredients:

$4.00 (apples) + $2.00 (pie crust) + $0.50 (lemon) + $1.50 (butter) = $8.00

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given information:
- The apple pie serves 8 people.
- Hannah needs 2 pounds of apples at $2.00 per pound.
- The pre-made pie crust costs $2.00.
- The lemon costs $0.50.
- The butter costs $1.50.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the apples.
Cost of apples = Price per pound × Number of pounds
Cost of apples = $2.00 × 2 = $4.00

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the ingredients.
Total cost = C...
