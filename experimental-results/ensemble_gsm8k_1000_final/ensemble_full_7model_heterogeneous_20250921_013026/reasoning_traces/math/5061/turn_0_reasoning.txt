=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many hours per week Ruth spends in math class, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total hours Ruth spends at school per week**:
   - Ruth goes to school for 8 hours a day.
   - She attends school 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total hours spent at school per week can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total hours per week} = \text{Hours per day} \times \text{Days per week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total hours per week} = 8 \, \text{hours/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{hours/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate the hours spent in math class**:
   - Ruth spends 25% of her total school time in math class.
   - To find the number of hours she spends in math class, we need to calculate 25% of the total hours spent at school per week.

   \[
   \text{Hours in math class} = 25\% \times \text{Total hours per week}
   \]
   - We can convert 25% into a decimal for calculation:

   \[
   25\% = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   - Now we can calculate the hours in math class:

   \[
   \text{Hours in math class} = 0.25 \times 40 \, \text{hours/week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Hours in math class} = 10 \, \text{hours/week}
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Ruth spends **10 hours per week** in math class.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of hours Ruth spends in school per week and then calculate the number of hours she spends in math class.

Given information:
- Ruth goes to school 8 hours a day and 5 days a week.
- She is in math class 25% of this time.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Ruth spends in school per week.
Total hours per week = Hours per day × Days per week
Total hours per week = 8 hours × 5 days = 40 hou...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how many hours per week Ruth spends in math class, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours Ruth spends at school per week.**

   Ruth goes to school 8 hours a day and 5 days a week. Therefore, the total number of hours she spends at school per week is calculated by multiplying the number of hours per day by the number of days per week:

   \[
   \text{Total hours per week} = 8 \, \text{hours/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how many hours Ruth spends at school per week. 

She goes to school 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so we multiply these two numbers together:

8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week

Next, we need to find out how much time she spends in math class. We know this is 25% of her total school time. 

To find 25% of a number, we multiply that number by 0.25. 

So, we multiply the total hours she spends at school per week (40 hours) by 0.25:

40 ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Ruth goes to school for 8 hours a day.
   * She attends school 5 days a week.
   * She spends 25% of her school time in math class.

2. Calculate the total number of hours Ruth spends in school per week:
   * Hours per day = 8
   * Days per week = 5
   * Total hours per week = Hours per day × Days per week
   * Total hours per week = 8 × 5 = 40 hours

3. Calculate the ...
