=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pieces of macarons were eaten by Emma's guests at the party. We will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of macarons Emma bought.**
   - Emma bought 3 dozens of macarons. 
   - Since 1 dozen equals 12 pieces, we calculate the number of macarons in 3 dozens:
     \[
     3 \text{ dozens} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ pieces}
     \]

2. **Add the additional macarons Emma already had.**
   - Emma also had 10 pieces of macarons. 
   - Therefore, the total number of macarons Emma had is:
     \[
     \text{Total macarons} = 36 + 10 = 46 \text{ pieces}
     \]

3. **Determine how many macarons are left over after the party.**
   - According to the problem, there are 15 pieces of macarons left over after the party.

4. **Calculate how many macarons were eaten.**
   - To find out how many macarons were eaten, we subtract the number of macarons left over from the total number of macarons:
     \[
     \text{Macarons eaten} = \text{Total macarons} - \text{Macarons left over}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Macarons eaten} = 46 - 15 = 31 \text{ pieces}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that **31 pieces of macarons were eaten.**

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Emma bought 3 dozens of macarons.
- Emma also bought 10 pieces of macarons.
- 15 pieces of macarons were left over.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of macarons Emma bought.
1 dozen = 12 pieces
3 dozens = 3 × 12 = 36 pieces
Total macarons bought = 36 + 10 = 46 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of macarons that were eaten.
Total macarons bought - Macarons left over = Macarons...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many macarons were eaten at the party. We will do this by calculating the total number of macarons Emma had initially and then subtracting the number of macarons that were left over after the party.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of macarons Emma had initially:**

   - Emma bought 3 dozens of macarons. Since 1 dozen equals 12 pieces, 3 dozens would be:
     \[
     3 \times 12 =...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to convert the dozens of macarons Emma bought into pieces. Since 1 dozen equals 12 pieces, 3 dozens would be 3 * 12 = 36 pieces.

Next, we add the 36 pieces of macarons Emma bought to the 10 pieces she already had. This gives us 36 + 10 = 46 pieces of macarons in total.

If there were 15 pieces left over after the party, we subtract this from the total number of macarons to find out how many were eaten. So, 46 - 15 = 31 pieces of macarons were eaten.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- Emma bought 3 dozens of macarons.
- She already had 10 pieces of macarons.
- After the party, 15 pieces of macarons were left over.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of macarons Emma had before the party.
- 1 dozen = 12 pieces
- 3 dozens = 3 × 12 = 36 pieces
- Emma bought 36 pieces of macarons.
- She already had 10 pieces of macarons.
Total macarons before the party = Macarons bought + Macarons s...
