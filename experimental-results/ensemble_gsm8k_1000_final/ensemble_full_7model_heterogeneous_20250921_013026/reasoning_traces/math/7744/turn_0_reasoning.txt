Final Answer: To find the total number of windows in John's two houses, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of bedrooms in both houses:**
   - John has 2 houses.
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of bedrooms is:
     \[
     \text{Total bedrooms} = \text{Number of houses} \times \text{Bedrooms per house} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ bedrooms}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:**
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the total number of windows in all bedrooms is:
     \[
     \text{Total bedroom windows} = \text{Total bedrooms} \times \text{Windows per bedroom} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ windows}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of additional windows in each house:**
   - Each house has 4 additional windows that are not connected to bedrooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of additional windows in both houses is:
     \[
     \text{Total additional windows} = \text{Number of houses} \times \text{Additional windows per house} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ windows}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of windows in both houses:**
   - To find the total number of windows, we add the total number of bedroom windows to the total number of additional windows:
     \[
     \text{Total windows} = \text{Total bedroom windows} + \text{Total additional windows} = 12 + 8 = 20 \text{ windows}
     \]

Thus, the total number of windows between the two houses is \( \boxed{20} \).

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms. 

John has 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each, so that's 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 bedrooms in total. 

Each bedroom has 2 windows, so that's 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 windows in the bedrooms. 

Next, let's calculate the total number of additional windows. 

There are 4 additional windows in each house, so that's 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 additional windows. 

Finally, let's add the number of bedroom windows and the number of ad...
