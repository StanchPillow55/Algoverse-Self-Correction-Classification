=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total cost Mike will pay for the new camera and the lens after applying the discount on the lens. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the new camera:**
   - The old camera costs $4000.
   - The new model costs 30% more than the old model.
   - To find 30% of the old camera's price, we calculate:
     \[
     30\% \text{ of } 4000 = 0.30 \times 4000 = 1200
     \]
   - Now, we add this amount to the old camera's price to find the new camera's price:
     \[
     \text{New camera price} = 4000 + 1200 = 5200
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of the lens after the discount:**
   - The original price of the lens is $400.
   - Mike gets a discount of $200 on the lens.
   - To find the price he pays for the lens after the discount, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Price after discount} = 400 - 200 = 200
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for the camera and lens:**
   - Now, we add the cost of the new camera and the discounted lens:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{New camera price} + \text{Price of lens after discount}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 5200 + 200 = 5400
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total amount Mike pays for the camera and lens is:
     \[
     \boxed{5400}
     \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The new camera model costs 30% more than the current model.
- The old camera cost $4000.
- Mike gets $200 off a $400 lens he bought.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the new camera model.
Cost of the new camera model = Cost of the old camera model + 30% of the old camera model
Cost of the new camera model = $4000 + (0.30 × $4000)
Cost of the new camera model = $4000 + $1200
Cost of ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost Mike pays for the new camera and the lens after applying the discount on the lens. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the cost of the new camera:**

   The problem states that the new model costs 30% more than the current model. The current model costs $4000.

   To find 30% of the current model's cost:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 4000 = 0.30 \times 4000 = 1200
   \]

   Therefore, the new camera cos...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the cost of the new camera model. Since it costs 30% more than the old model, we can calculate this by finding 30% of the old model's cost and adding it to the original cost. 

30% of $4000 is (30/100) * 4000 = $1200.

So, the new model costs $4000 + $1200 = $5200.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the lens after the discount. The lens originally costs $400, but Mike gets a $200 discount, so he pays $400 - $200 = $200 for the lens.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The current model of the camera costs $4000.
   * The new model costs 30% more than the current model.
   * Mike gets a $200 discount on a $400 lens.

2. Calculate the cost of the new camera model:
   * The new model is 30% more expensive than the current model.
   * To calculate the price increase, multiply the current price by 30%:
     $4000 × 0....
