=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to define the amounts of each ingredient in terms of a variable. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (which is the same as the amount of fragrance) as \( z \) ounces. 

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. **Citrus Zest and Fragrance**: 
   \[
   \text{Fragrance} = z \quad \text{(same as citrus zest)}
   \]

2. **Salt and Sugar**: 
   Let the amount of salt be \( s \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, we have:
   \[
   \text{Sugar} = s
   \]

3. **Oil and Salt**: 
   Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so:
   \[
   \text{Oil} = 2s
   \]

4. **Salt and Zest**: 
   Tanya uses twice as much salt as zest, so:
   \[
   s = 2z
   \]

Now we can express all ingredients in terms of \( z \):

- From \( s = 2z \), we can substitute \( s \) into the oil equation:
  \[
  \text{Oil} = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z
  \]

Now we have the amounts of all ingredients in terms of \( z \):
- Citrus Zest = \( z \)
- Fragrance = \( z \)
- Salt = \( 2z \)
- Sugar = \( 2z \)
- Oil = \( 4z \)

Next, we can set up an equation for the total amount of the scrub, which is 10 ounces:
\[
\text{Citrus Zest} + \text{Fragrance} + \text{Salt} + \text{Sugar} + \text{Oil} = 10
\]
Substituting the expressions we have:
\[
z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
10z = 10
\]
Now, we can solve for \( z \):
\[
z = 1
\]

Now that we have \( z \), we can find the amount of oil:
\[
\text{Oil} = 4z = 4(1) = 4 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\] 

Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil in her salt scrub.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of oil Tanya uses in her salt scrub recipe.

Given information:
- Tanya makes enough salt scrub to fill a 10-ounce jar each time.
- She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
- She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt.
- She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the amount of zest and fragrance.
- Let y be the amount o...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses in her salt scrub, given the constraints and relationships between the ingredients. Let's break it down step by step.

### Define Variables
1. Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest (in ounces).
2. Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
3. Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
4. Since the amount of sugar i...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the amount of citrus zest and fragrance as x ounces each. Since the amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, it is 2x ounces. The amount of sugar is the same as salt, so it is also 2x ounces. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so it is 4x ounces.

The total amount of all ingredients should be equal to the size of the jar, which is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Tanya fills a 10-ounce jar with her salt scrub mixture.
   * The amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance.
   * The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar.
   * The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.
   * The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest.

2. Let's assign variables to the ingredients:
   * Let 'z' be th...
