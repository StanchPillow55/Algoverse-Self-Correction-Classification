Final Answer: To determine how many bonus points Tom earned on Monday, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of customers served by Tom in a day.**
   - Tom served 10 customers per hour.
   - He worked for 8 hours.
   - Therefore, the total number of customers served is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total customers served} = \text{Customers per hour} \times \text{Hours worked}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total customers served} = 10 \text{ customers/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ customers}
   \]

2. **Calculate the bonus points earned.**
   - According to the problem, for every customer served, an employee earns bonus points equal to 20% of the total number of customers served.
   - First, we need to calculate 20% of the total customers served (which is 80 customers):

   \[
   \text{Bonus points per customer} = 20\% \text{ of Total customers served}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Bonus points per customer} = 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \text{ bonus points}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total bonus points earned by Tom.**
   - Since Tom earns 16 bonus points for each of the 80 customers served, we multiply the bonus points per customer by the total number of customers served:

   \[
   \text{Total bonus points} = \text{Bonus points per customer} \times \text{Total customers served}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total bonus points} = 16 \text{ bonus points/customer} \times 80 \text{ customers} = 1280 \text{ bonus points}
   \]

Thus, the total number of bonus points Tom earned on Monday is:

\[
\boxed{1280}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how many customers Tom served on Monday. He served 10 customers per hour for 8 hours, so he served 10 * 8 = <<10*8=80>>80 customers.

The number of bonus points Tom gets is 20% of the number of customers he served. To find 20% of a number, we multiply that number by 0.20. So, Tom earned 80 * 0.20 = <<80*0.20=16>>16 bonus points on Monday.

Therefore, Tom earned 16 bonus points on Monday.
