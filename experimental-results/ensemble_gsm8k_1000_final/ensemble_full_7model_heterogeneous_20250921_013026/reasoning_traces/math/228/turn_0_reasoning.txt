=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of employees who drive to work:**
   - The total number of employees is 200.
   - 60% of the employees drive to work.
   - To find the number of employees who drive, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of employees who drive} = 60\% \times 200 = 0.60 \times 200 = 120
     \]

2. **Determine the number of employees who do not drive to work:**
   - To find the number of employees who do not drive, we subtract the number of employees who drive from the total number of employees:
     \[
     \text{Number of employees who do not drive} = 200 - 120 = 80
     \]

3. **Determine how many of the non-driving employees take public transportation:**
   - Half of the employees who do not drive take public transportation.
   - Therefore, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of employees who take public transportation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40
     \]

4. **Calculate how many more employees drive to work than take public transportation:**
   - We need to find the difference between the number of employees who drive and those who take public transportation:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Number of employees who drive} - \text{Number of employees who take public transportation} = 120 - 40 = 80
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - The number of employees who drive to work is 80 more than the number of employees who take public transportation.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{80}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The company has 200 employees total.

2. 60% of the employees drive to work.
   * To calculate this, we take 60% of 200:
   * 60% of 200 = 0.60 x 200 = 120 employees drive to work.

3. The remaining employees (200 - 120 = 80) do not drive to work.

4. Of the 80 employees who don't drive to work, half take public transportation.
   * Half of 80 = 80 / 2 = 40 employees take public transportation.

5. Now we ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many employees drive to work and how many take public transportation, and then find the difference between these two numbers.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of employees who drive to work.

The problem states that 60% of the employees drive to work. The company has 200 employees.

\[
\text{Number of employees who drive to work} = 60\% \times 200
\]

Convert 60% to a decimal:

\[
60\% = 0.60
\]

Now, perform the multiplic...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many employees drive to work. We know that 60% of the 200 employees drive to work. 

To find this, we multiply 200 by 60% (or 0.60 in decimal form):

200 * 0.60 = 120 employees

So, 120 employees drive to work.

Next, we need to find out how many employees don't drive to work. We do this by subtracting the number of employees who drive to work from the total number of employees:

200 - 120 = 80 employees

So, 80 employees don't drive to work...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The company has 200 employees in total.
   * 60% of the employees drive to work.
   * Among the employees who don't drive, half of them take public transportation.

2. Calculate the number of employees who drive to work:
   * 60% of 200 = 0.6 Ã— 200 = 120 employees drive to work

3. Calculate the number of employees who don't drive to work:
   * Total employees - Employ...
