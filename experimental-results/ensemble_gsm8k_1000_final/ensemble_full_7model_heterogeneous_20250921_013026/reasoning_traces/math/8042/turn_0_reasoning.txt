=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to calculate the total earnings for both Liam and Mitchell and then find the difference between their earnings.

1. **Calculate Liam's earnings:**
   - Liam made $63 over the weekend.

2. **Calculate Mitchell's earnings:**
   - Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each.
   - To find Mitchell's total earnings, we multiply the number of lemonades sold by the price per lemonade:
     \[
     \text{Mitchell's earnings} = \text{Number of lemonades} \times \text{Price per lemonade}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Mitchell's earnings} = 21 \times 4
     \]
     \[
     \text{Mitchell's earnings} = 84
     \]

3. **Determine how much more Mitchell made than Liam:**
   - Now we need to find the difference between Mitchell's earnings and Liam's earnings:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Mitchell's earnings} - \text{Liam's earnings}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 84 - 63
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 21
     \]

Thus, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend.

**Final Answer:**
Mitchell made $21 more than Liam.
