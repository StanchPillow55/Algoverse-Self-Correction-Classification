Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of mailing both the small and big coupons.

1. **Determine the number of big coupons:**
   - Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons.
   - He wants to send out twice as many big coupons.
   - Therefore, the number of big coupons is:
     \[
     \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times \text{Number of small coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400
     \]

2. **Calculate the mailing cost for small coupons:**
   - Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail.
   - The total cost for mailing the small coupons is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for small coupons} = \text{Number of small coupons} \times \text{Cost per small coupon} = 700 \times 5 \text{ cents}
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Calculate the mailing cost for big coupons:**
   - Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail.
   - The total cost for mailing the big coupons is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for big coupons} = \text{Number of big coupons} \times \text{Cost per big coupon} = 1400 \times 15 \text{ cents}
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total mailing cost:**
   - To find the total cost, we add the costs of mailing the small and big coupons:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for small coupons} + \text{Cost for big coupons} = 3500 \text{ cents} + 21000 \text{ cents}
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents}
     \]

5. **Convert the total cost to dollars:**
   - Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
     \[
     \text{Total cost in dollars} = \frac{24500 \text{ cents}}{100} = 245 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[
\boxed{245 \text{ dollars}}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's determine how many big coupons Anthony is sending out. Since he's sending out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he's sending out 700 small coupons, he's sending out 700 * 2 = <<700*2=1400>>1400 big coupons.

Next, we need to determine how much it costs to send out all the small coupons. Since each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he's sending out 700 of them, this will cost him 700 * $0.05 = $<<700*0.05=35>>35.

Similarly, we need to dete...
