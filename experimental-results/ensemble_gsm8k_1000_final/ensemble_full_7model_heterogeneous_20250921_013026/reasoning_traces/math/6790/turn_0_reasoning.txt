=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will define variables for the number of chickens each person has:

- Let \( Q \) be the number of chickens Quentin has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of chickens Skylar has.
- Let \( C \) be the number of chickens Colten has.

We are given the following information:

1. The total number of chickens is 383:
   \[
   Q + S + C = 383
   \]

2. Quentin has 25 more than double the number of chickens that Skylar has:
   \[
   Q = 2S + 25
   \]

3. Skylar has 4 less than triple the number of chickens that Colten has:
   \[
   S = 3C - 4
   \]

Now, we will substitute the expressions for \( Q \) and \( S \) into the total equation.

First, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into the second equation to express \( Q \) in terms of \( C \):
\[
S = 3C - 4
\]
Substituting this into the equation for \( Q \):
\[
Q = 2(3C - 4) + 25
\]
Expanding this:
\[
Q = 6C - 8 + 25
\]
\[
Q = 6C + 17
\]

Now we have expressions for both \( Q \) and \( S \) in terms of \( C \):
- \( Q = 6C + 17 \)
- \( S = 3C - 4 \)

Next, substitute these expressions into the total number of chickens equation:
\[
(6C + 17) + (3C - 4) + C = 383
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
6C + 3C + C + 17 - 4 = 383
\]
\[
10C + 13 = 383
\]

Now, isolate \( C \):
\[
10C = 383 - 13
\]
\[
10C = 370
\]
\[
C = \frac{370}{10} = 37
\]

Now that we have \( C \), we can find \( S \) and \( Q \) to verify our solution:
1. Calculate \( S \):
   \[
   S = 3C - 4 = 3(37) - 4 = 111 - 4 = 107
   \]

2. Calculate \( Q \):
   \[
   Q = 2S + 25 = 2(107) + 25 = 214 + 25 = 239
   \]

Finally, we check the total:
\[
Q + S + C = 239 + 107 + 37 = 383
\]

The calculations confirm that the total is correct. Thus, the number of chickens Colten has is:
\[
\boxed{37}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Quentin, Skylar, and Colten have a total of 383 chickens.
- Quentin has 25 more than double the chickens that Skylar has.
- Skylar has 4 less than triple the number of chickens that Colten has.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of chickens that Colten has.
- Let y = the number of chickens that Skylar has.
- Let z = the number of chickens that Quentin has.

Step 1: Express ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and then solve for the number of chickens each person has.

Let's define:
- \( Q \) as the number of chickens Quentin has.
- \( S \) as the number of chickens Skylar has.
- \( C \) as the number of chickens Colten has.

We are given the following information:

1. Quentin, Skylar, and Colten have a total of 383 chickens:
   \[
   Q + S + C = 383
   \]

2. Quentin has 25 more than double the ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of chickens that Quentin, Skylar, and Colten have as Q, S, and C respectively.

From the problem, we know that:

Q + S + C = 383 (equation 1)

Quentin has 25 more than double the chickens that Skylar has, so:

Q = 2S + 25 (equation 2)

Skylar has 4 less than triple the number of chickens that Colten has, so:

S = 3C - 4 (equation 3)

We can substitute equation 2 and equation 3 into equation 1 to solve for C:

(2S + 25) + (3C - 4) + C = 383
2S + 4C ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find out how many chickens Colten has.

Given:
- Quentin, Skylar, and Colten have a total of 383 chickens.
- Quentin has 25 more than double the chickens that Skylar has.
- Skylar has 4 less than triple the number of chickens that Colten has.

Step 1: Let's express Quentin's and Skylar's chickens in terms of Colten's.
- Let the number of chickens Colten has be x.
- Skylar has 4 less than triple...
