=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much soda Danny has left after drinking and giving away portions of his bottles. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Initial Amount of Soda:**
   Danny has 3 bottles of soda. We can assume each bottle contains 100% of soda. Therefore, the total amount of soda Danny starts with is:
   \[
   3 \text{ bottles} = 3 \times 100\% = 300\%
   \]

2. **Calculating Soda Drank by Danny:**
   Danny drinks 90% of one bottle. Since one bottle is 100%, 90% of one bottle is:
   \[
   90\% \text{ of 1 bottle} = 90\%
   \]

3. **Calculating Soda Given Away:**
   Danny gives away 70% of the other two bottles. Each bottle is 100%, so 70% of one bottle is:
   \[
   70\% \text{ of 1 bottle} = 70\%
   \]
   Since he gives away 70% of each of the two bottles, the total amount given away is:
   \[
   70\% + 70\% = 140\%
   \]

4. **Calculating Total Soda Consumed and Given Away:**
   Now, we add the amount Danny drank and the amount he gave away:
   \[
   \text{Total consumed and given away} = 90\% + 140\% = 230\%
   \]

5. **Calculating Remaining Soda:**
   To find out how much soda Danny has left, we subtract the total consumed and given away from the initial total amount of soda:
   \[
   \text{Remaining soda} = 300\% - 230\% = 70\%
   \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   Therefore, the amount of soda Danny has left, expressed as a percentage of a bottle, is:
   \[
   \boxed{70\%}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Danny has 3 bottles of soda.
- He drinks 90% of one bottle.
- He gives 70% of the other two bottles to his friends.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of soda Danny drinks from the first bottle.
90% of one bottle = 0.90 × 1 bottle = 0.90 bottles

Step 2: Calculate the amount of soda Danny gives to his friends from the other two bottles.
70% of two bottles = 0.70 × 2 bottles = 1.40 bott...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much soda Danny has left after drinking some and giving some away. We will express the remaining soda as a percentage of a bottle.

**Step 1: Calculate the soda Danny drinks from one bottle.**

Danny drinks 90% of one bottle. This means he leaves behind:
\[ 100\% - 90\% = 10\% \]
of that bottle.

**Step 2: Calculate the soda Danny gives away from the other two bottles.**

Danny gives away 70% of each of the other two bottle...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's break down the problem:

1. Danny drinks 90% of one bottle. This means he has 10% of that bottle left.
2. He gives away 70% of the other two bottles. This means he keeps 30% of each of those two bottles.

Now, let's calculate how much soda Danny has left in total:

1. From the first bottle, he has 10% left.
2. From the second bottle, he has 30% left.
3. From the third bottle, he has 30% left.

To find the total amount of soda Danny has left, we add up the per...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given:
- Danny has 3 bottles of soda.
- He drinks 90% of one bottle.
- He gives 70% of the other two bottles to his friends.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of soda Danny has left from the first bottle.
- Danny drinks 90% of the first bottle, so he has 10% left.
Soda left in the first bottle = 100% - 90% = 10%

Step 2: Calculate the amount of soda Danny has left from the other two bottles.
- Danny gives away 70%...
