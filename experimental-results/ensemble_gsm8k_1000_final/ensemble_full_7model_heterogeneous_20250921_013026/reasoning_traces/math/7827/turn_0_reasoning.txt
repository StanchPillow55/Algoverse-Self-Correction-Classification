=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Annabelle still needs to save for the phone, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount Annabelle currently has.**
   - She already has $80 in her savings.

2. **Calculate her earnings from her first job.**
   - Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job and works for 20 hours.
   - Earnings from the first job = hourly wage × hours worked
   \[
   \text{Earnings from first job} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate her earnings from her second job.**
   - Annabelle earns $5 per hour at her second job and works for 15 hours.
   - Earnings from the second job = hourly wage × hours worked
   \[
   \text{Earnings from second job} = 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate her total earnings from both jobs.**
   - Total earnings = earnings from first job + earnings from second job
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 275 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount Annabelle has after her earnings.**
   - Total amount = current savings + total earnings
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 80 \, \text{dollars} + 275 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

6. **Determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save for the phone.**
   - The cost of the phone is $400.
   - Amount needed = cost of the phone - total amount she currently has
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, Annabelle still needs to save **$45** to buy the phone.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The phone costs $400
- Annabelle already has $80 in her savings
- Her first job pays $10 per hour for 20 hours of work
- Her second job pays $5 per hour for 15 hours of work

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Annabelle earns from her two jobs.
First job earnings: $10 per hour x 20 hours = $200
Second job earnings: $5 per hour x 15 hours = $75
Total earnings = $200 + $75 = $275

Step 2: C...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save to buy the phone, we need to calculate her total savings after working both jobs and then compare it to the cost of the phone.

   Annabelle already has $80 in her savings.

2. **Earnings from the First Job:**
   - Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job.
   - She works 20 hours at this job.
   - Total earnings from the first job = hourly wage × hours worked
   \[

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She works 20 hours and earns $10 per hour, so she earns 20 * $10 = $<<20*10=200>>200.

Next, let's calculate how much money she earns from her second job. She works 15 hours and earns $5 per hour, so she earns 15 * $5 = $<<15*5=75>>75.

Now, let's add up all the money she has: the money she already had in her savings, the money she earned from her first job, and the money she earned from her second ...
