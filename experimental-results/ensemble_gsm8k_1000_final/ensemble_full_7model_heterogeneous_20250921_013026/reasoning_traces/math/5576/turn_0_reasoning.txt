=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine Mitch's weekly earnings, we need to break down her work hours and earnings for both weekdays and weekends.

### Step 1: Calculate weekday earnings

Mitch works 5 hours every day from Monday to Friday. 

- Number of weekdays = 5 (Monday to Friday)
- Hours worked per weekday = 5 hours

Total hours worked on weekdays:
\[
\text{Total weekday hours} = \text{Number of weekdays} \times \text{Hours per weekday} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ hours}
\]

Mitch earns $3 per hour during the weekdays. Therefore, her earnings for the weekdays are:
\[
\text{Weekday earnings} = \text{Total weekday hours} \times \text{Earnings per hour} = 25 \times 3 = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate weekend earnings

Mitch works 3 hours every day on Saturday and Sunday.

- Number of weekend days = 2 (Saturday and Sunday)
- Hours worked per weekend day = 3 hours

Total hours worked on weekends:
\[
\text{Total weekend hours} = \text{Number of weekend days} \times \text{Hours per weekend day} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

On weekends, Mitch earns double her regular rate, which is:
\[
\text{Weekend earnings per hour} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, her earnings for the weekends are:
\[
\text{Weekend earnings} = \text{Total weekend hours} \times \text{Weekend earnings per hour} = 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total weekly earnings

Now, we can find Mitch's total earnings for the week by adding her weekday and weekend earnings:
\[
\text{Total weekly earnings} = \text{Weekday earnings} + \text{Weekend earnings} = 75 + 36 = 111 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Mitch earns a total of **$111** every week.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mitch works 5 hours every day from Monday to Friday.
- Mitch works 3 hours every Saturday and Sunday.
- Mitch earns $3 per hour.
- Mitch earns double on weekends.

Step 1: Calculate Mitch's earnings for the weekdays (Monday to Friday).
Weekday hours = 5 hours per day × 5 days = 25 hours
Weekday earnings = 25 hours × $3 per hour = $75

Step 2: Calculate Mitch's earnings for the wee...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how much Mitch earns every week, we need to calculate her earnings separately for weekdays and weekends, then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate earnings from weekdays (Monday to Friday).**

- Mitch works 5 hours each day from Monday to Friday.
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.

First, calculate the total number of hours she works during the weekdays:
\[ 
5 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, calculate her earnings for these h...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Mitch works 5 hours per day from Monday to Friday, so she works 5 hours/day * 5 days/week = 25 hours/week.

She works 3 hours per day on Saturday and Sunday, so she works 3 hours/day * 2 days/week = 6 hours/week.

Therefore, Mitch works a total of 25 hours/week + 6 hours/week = 31 hours/week.

She earns $3 per hour from Monday to Friday, so she earns 3 dollars/hour * 25 hours/week = $75/week.

On weekends, she earns double, so she earns 3 dollars/hour * 2 = $6/hour.
