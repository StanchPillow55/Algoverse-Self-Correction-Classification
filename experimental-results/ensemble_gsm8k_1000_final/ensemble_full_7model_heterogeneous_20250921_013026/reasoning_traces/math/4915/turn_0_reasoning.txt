=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many grams of fat were added to each serving of food, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total grams of fat in the cream used**:
   Perry added a half cup of cream to the recipe. Since cream has 88 grams of fat per cup, we first need to find out how much fat is in half a cup.

   \[
   \text{Fat in half a cup} = \frac{1}{2} \times 88 \text{ grams} = 44 \text{ grams}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of servings**:
   The recipe serves four people.

3. **Calculate the grams of fat per serving**:
   To find out how many grams of fat are in each serving, we divide the total grams of fat by the number of servings.

   \[
   \text{Fat per serving} = \frac{44 \text{ grams}}{4 \text{ servings}} = 11 \text{ grams}
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   Each serving of food has 11 grams of fat from the cream added.

Thus, the final answer is:

**11 grams of fat per serving.**

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- The recipe serves 4 people.
- Perry added a half cup of cream at the end.
- Cream has 88 grams of fat per cup.

To find the grams of fat added to each serving, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total grams of fat added to the recipe.
Total grams of fat added = (1/2 cup of cream) × (88 grams of fat per cup)
Total grams of fat added = 0.5 × 88 = 44 grams

Step 2: Calc...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of fat were added to each serving of food when Perry added a half cup of cream to a recipe that serves four people.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total amount of cream added:**
   Perry added a half cup of cream to the recipe.

2. **Find out how much fat is in the cream added:**
   We know that cream has 88 grams of fat per cup. Since Perry added a half cup of cream, we need to c...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many grams of fat are in a half cup of cream. Since a full cup of cream has 88 grams of fat, a half cup would have half of that amount. 

So, we calculate 88 grams / 2 = 44 grams of fat in a half cup of cream.

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of servings, which is 4. 

So, we calculate 44 grams / 4 servings = 11 grams of fat per serving.

Therefore, Perry added 11 grams of fat to each serving of food.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The recipe serves four people.
   * Perry added a half cup of cream to the recipe.
   * One cup of cream has 88 grams of fat.

2. Calculate the amount of fat in a half cup of cream:
   * One cup of cream has 88 grams of fat.
   * Perry used a half cup of cream, which is 1/2 of a full cup.
   * To find the amount of fat in a half cup, multiply 88 grams by 1/2.
   * Fat ...
