=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of boys and girls**: 
   We know from the problem that there are 600 boys at the event. We also know that the difference between the number of boys and girls is 400, and that the number of girls is more than the number of boys.

2. **Set up the equation for the number of girls**:
   Let \( g \) represent the number of girls. According to the problem, the difference between the number of girls and boys can be expressed as:
   \[
   g - 600 = 400
   \]
   This equation states that the number of girls minus the number of boys (600) equals 400.

3. **Solve for the number of girls**:
   To find \( g \), we can rearrange the equation:
   \[
   g = 600 + 400
   \]
   \[
   g = 1000
   \]
   So, there are 1000 girls at the event.

4. **Calculate the total number of participants**:
   Now that we know the number of boys and girls, we can find the total number of participants at the event:
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} = 600 + 1000 = 1600
   \]

5. **Calculate 60% of the total number of participants**:
   To find 60% of the total number of boys and girls, we calculate:
   \[
   60\% \text{ of Total} = 0.60 \times 1600
   \]
   \[
   = 960
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, 60% of the total number of boys and girls at the event is \( \boxed{960} \).

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out the number of girls at the event. Since the difference between the number of boys and girls is 400 and the number of girls is more than the number of boys, we add 400 to the number of boys to get the number of girls.

Number of girls = Number of boys + 400
Number of girls = 600 boys + 400
Number of girls = 1000

Next, we find the total number of boys and girls at the event by adding the number of boys and girls together.

Total number of boys an...
