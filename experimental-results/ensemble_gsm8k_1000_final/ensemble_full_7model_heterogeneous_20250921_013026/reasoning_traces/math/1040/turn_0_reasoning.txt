=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step and calculate the number of each type of animal on the farm.

1. **Determine the number of chickens:**
   - We know there are 66 goats at the farm.
   - The number of chickens is twice the number of goats.
   \[
   \text{Number of chickens} = 2 \times \text{Number of goats} = 2 \times 66 = 132
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of goats and chickens:**
   - We add the number of goats and chickens together.
   \[
   \text{Total of goats and chickens} = \text{Number of goats} + \text{Number of chickens} = 66 + 132 = 198
   \]

3. **Determine the number of ducks:**
   - The number of ducks is half of the total number of goats and chickens.
   \[
   \text{Number of ducks} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Total of goats and chickens} = \frac{1}{2} \times 198 = 99
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of pigs:**
   - The number of pigs is a third of the number of ducks.
   \[
   \text{Number of pigs} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Number of ducks} = \frac{1}{3} \times 99 = 33
   \]

5. **Determine how many more goats there are than pigs:**
   - We need to find the difference between the number of goats and the number of pigs.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Number of goats} - \text{Number of pigs} = 66 - 33 = 33
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that there are **33 more goats than pigs**.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 66 goats at the farm.
- The number of chickens is twice the number of goats.
- The number of ducks is half the total of the goats and chickens.
- The number of pigs is a third of the number of ducks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens.
Number of chickens = 2 × Number of goats
Number of chickens = 2 × 66 = 132 chickens

Step 2: Calculate the total number of goats and chick...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of animal on the farm and then find the difference between the number of goats and pigs.

1. **Determine the number of chickens:**
   - We are told there are 66 goats and twice as many chickens.
   - Therefore, the number of chickens is \(2 \times 66 = 132\).

2. **Calculate the total number of goats and chickens:**
   - Total number of goats and chickens = Number of goats + Number of chickens
   - Total...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many chickens there are. Since there are twice as many chickens as goats, and we know there are 66 goats, we multiply 66 by 2 to get the number of chickens:

66 goats * 2 = 132 chickens

Next, we need to find out how many ducks there are. The problem tells us that the number of ducks is half the total of the goats and chickens. So we add the number of goats and chickens together and then divide by 2:

(66 goats + 132 chickens) / 2 = 99 ducks
