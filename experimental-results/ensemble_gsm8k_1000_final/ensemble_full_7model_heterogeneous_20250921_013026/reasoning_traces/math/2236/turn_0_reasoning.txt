=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of shells collected by Evie over 6 days.**
   - Evie collects 10 shells each day.
   - The number of days she collects shells is 6.

   We can calculate the total number of shells collected by multiplying the number of shells collected each day by the number of days:

   \[
   \text{Total shells collected} = \text{Number of shells per day} \times \text{Number of days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total shells collected} = 10 \text{ shells/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ shells}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of shells Evie has after giving some to her brother.**
   - Evie gives 2 shells to her brother.

   To find out how many shells she has left, we subtract the number of shells given away from the total number of shells collected:

   \[
   \text{Shells left} = \text{Total shells collected} - \text{Shells given to brother}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Shells left} = 60 \text{ shells} - 2 \text{ shells} = 58 \text{ shells}
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   Evie has 58 shells left after giving 2 shells to her brother.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{58}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Evie collects 10 shells each day.
- Evie collects shells for 6 days.
- Evie gives 2 shells to her brother at the end of the 6 days.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of shells Evie collected over the 6 days.
Number of shells collected per day = 10
Number of days = 6
Total number of shells collected = 10 shells/day Ã— 6 days = 60 shells

Step 2: Calculate the number of shells Evie has left aft...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many seashells Evie has collected and how many she has left after giving some away. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of shells collected each day:**
   - Evie collects 10 shells each day.

2. **Calculate the total number of shells collected over 6 days:**
   - Since Evie collects 10 shells per day, over 6 days she will collect:
     \[
     10 \, \text{shells/day} \times 6 \, \text{days}...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Evie collects 10 shells each day. Over 6 days, she would have collected 10 shells/day * 6 days = 60 shells.

After giving 2 shells to her brother, she would have 60 shells - 2 shells = 58 shells left.

So, Evie has 58 shells left.
