=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much time Monica spent studying in total during the five days, we will break down her study time day by day and then sum it all up.

1. **Wednesday**: Monica studied for 2 hours.
   \[
   \text{Wednesday's study time} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Thursday**: She studied three times as long as she did on Wednesday.
   \[
   \text{Thursday's study time} = 3 \times \text{Wednesday's study time} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Friday**: She studied half of the time she studied on Thursday.
   \[
   \text{Friday's study time} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thursday's study time} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total study time from Wednesday to Friday**:
   \[
   \text{Total study time (Wed-Fri)} = \text{Wednesday's study time} + \text{Thursday's study time} + \text{Friday's study time}
   \]
   \[
   = 2 + 6 + 3 = 11 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Weekend (Saturday and Sunday)**: Monica studied as much again as she did from Wednesday to Friday combined. This means she studied another 11 hours over the weekend.
   \[
   \text{Weekend study time} = 11 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Total study time for the five days**:
   \[
   \text{Total study time (5 days)} = \text{Total study time (Wed-Fri)} + \text{Weekend study time}
   \]
   \[
   = 11 + 11 = 22 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time Monica spent studying during the five days is:
\[
\boxed{22} \text{ hours}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the time Monica spent studying on each day and then add them up to get the total time spent studying.

Given information:
- On Wednesday, Monica studied for 2 hours.
- On Thursday, Monica studied three times as long as on Wednesday.
- On Friday, Monica studied half of the time she studied on Thursday.
- During the weekend (two days), Monica studied as much again as Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday combined.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine how much time Monica spent studying each day and then sum these amounts to find the total study time over the five days.

1. **Wednesday:**
   Monica studied for 2 hours.

2. **Thursday:**
   Monica studied three times as long as she did on Wednesday. 
   \[
   \text{Time studied on Thursday} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Friday:**
   Monica studied half of the time she studied on Thursday.
   \[

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Wednesday, Monica studied for 2 hours.

On Thursday, she studied three times as long as she did on Wednesday. So, she studied for 2 hours * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 hours on Thursday.

On Friday, Monica studied half of the time she studied on Thursday. So, she studied for 6 hours / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 hours on Friday.

During the weekend, Monica studied as much again as Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday combined. So, she studied for 2 hours (...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Monica studied for 2 hours on Wednesday.
   * On Thursday, she studied three times as long as Wednesday.
   * On Friday, she studied half of the time she studied on Thursday.
   * During the weekend (two days), she studied as much as Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday combined.

2. Calculate the study time for Thursday:
   * Thursday study time = 3 Ã— Wednesday study time
