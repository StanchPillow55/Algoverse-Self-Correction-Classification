=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Total Tickets Sold**: 
   We know that 900 tickets were sold to the concert.

2. **Tickets Sold Before the Concert**: 
   According to the problem, three-fourths of those who bought tickets came before the start of the concert. 
   \[
   \text{Tickets before concert} = \frac{3}{4} \times 900 = 675
   \]

3. **Remaining Tickets**: 
   After accounting for those who came before the concert, we can find out how many tickets were left.
   \[
   \text{Remaining tickets} = 900 - 675 = 225
   \]

4. **Tickets Arriving After the First Song**: 
   The problem states that five-ninths of the remaining tickets came a few minutes after the first song.
   \[
   \text{Tickets after first song} = \frac{5}{9} \times 225 = 125
   \]

5. **Tickets Arriving During the Middle Part of the Concert**: 
   We are told that 80 people arrived during the middle part of the concert.

6. **Total Tickets That Attended the Concert**: 
   Now, we can calculate the total number of people who attended the concert. This includes those who came before the concert, those who came after the first song, and those who arrived during the middle part.
   \[
   \text{Total attendees} = \text{Tickets before concert} + \text{Tickets after first song} + \text{Tickets during middle part}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total attendees} = 675 + 125 + 80 = 880
   \]

7. **Tickets That Did Not Go**: 
   Finally, we need to find out how many of those who bought tickets did not go to the concert. This is simply the total tickets sold minus the total attendees.
   \[
   \text{Tickets not going} = \text{Total tickets sold} - \text{Total attendees}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tickets not going} = 900 - 880 = 20
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that **20 people who bought tickets did not go to the concert**.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- 900 tickets were sold to the concert.
- Three-fourths of those who bought the ticket came before the start of the concert.
- Five-ninths of the remaining came few minutes after the first song.
- 80 people arrived during the middle part of the concert.
- The rest did not go.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people who came before t...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people who bought tickets did not attend the concert. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Tickets Sold:**
   - Total tickets sold = 900

2. **People Who Came Before the Start of the Concert:**
   - Three-fourths of the ticket holders came before the start of the concert.
   - Calculate this number: 
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 900 = 675
     \]
   - So, 675 people came before the start of the con...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many people came before the start of the concert. We do this by multiplying the total number of tickets sold by three-fourths:

900 tickets * 3/4 = 675 people

This means that 675 people came before the start of the concert.

Next, we need to find out how many people were left after this. We do this by subtracting the number of people who came before the start of the concert from the total number of tickets sold:

900 tickets - 675 people = ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start with the total number of tickets sold and work our way through the information given to find out how many people did not go to the concert.

Given:
- 900 tickets were sold to the concert.
- 3/4 of the ticket buyers came before the start of the concert.
- 5/9 of the remaining ticket buyers came a few minutes after the first song.
- 80 people arrived during the middle part of the concert.
- The res...
