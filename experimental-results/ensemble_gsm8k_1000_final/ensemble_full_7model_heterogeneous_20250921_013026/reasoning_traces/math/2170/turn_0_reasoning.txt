=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will calculate the total cost for each girl separately and then add their expenses together.

**Step 1: Calculate Kristine's total cost.**

Kristine buys:
- 1 set of barrettes at $3 each
- 1 comb at $1 each

Now, we calculate Kristine's total cost:

\[
\text{Cost of barrettes} = 1 \times 3 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of comb} = 1 \times 1 = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Now, we add these two amounts to find Kristine's total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost for Kristine} = \text{Cost of barrettes} + \text{Cost of comb} = 3 + 1 = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Crystal's total cost.**

Crystal buys:
- 3 sets of barrettes at $3 each
- 1 comb at $1 each

Now, we calculate Crystal's total cost:

\[
\text{Cost of barrettes} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of comb} = 1 \times 1 = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Now, we add these two amounts to find Crystal's total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost for Crystal} = \text{Cost of barrettes} + \text{Cost of comb} = 9 + 1 = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent by both girls.**

Now, we add Kristine's total cost and Crystal's total cost together:

\[
\text{Total amount spent by both} = \text{Total cost for Kristine} + \text{Total cost for Crystal} = 4 + 10 = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The total amount spent by Kristine and Crystal altogether is \( \boxed{14} \) dollars.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- One set of barrettes costs $3 each.
- One comb costs $1 each.
- Kristine buys one set of barrettes and one comb.
- Crystal buys three sets of barrettes and one comb.

Step 1: Calculate the cost for Kristine's purchase.
Kristine's purchase:
- 1 set of barrettes at $3 each
- 1 comb at $1 each
Total cost for Kristine = $3 + $1 = $4

Step 2: Calculate the cost for Crystal's purchase.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for each girl and then add those amounts together to find the total amount spent by both Kristine and Crystal.

**Step 1: Calculate Kristine's total spending.**

- Kristine buys one set of barrettes and one comb.
- The cost of one set of barrettes is $3.
- The cost of one comb is $1.

To find out how much Kristine spends, we add the cost of the barrettes and the comb:

\[
\text{Kristine's total spending} = (\text...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how much each girl spends.

Kristine buys one set of barrettes and one comb. The barrettes cost $3 and the comb costs $1. So, Kristine spends $3 + $1 = $4.

Crystal buys three sets of barrettes and one comb. Each set of barrettes costs $3, so three sets cost 3 * $3 = $9. The comb costs $1. So, Crystal spends $9 + $1 = $10.

To find out how much the two girls spend altogether, we add the amount Kristine spends to the amount Crystal spends. That ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given information:
- One set of barrettes costs $3 each
- One comb costs $1 each
- Kristine buys one set of barrettes and one comb
- Crystal buys three sets of barrettes and one comb

Step 1: Calculate the amount Kristine spends.
Kristine's barrettes cost = 1 × $3 = $3
Kristine's comb cost = 1 × $1 = $1
Kristine's total spending = Barrettes cost + Comb cost
Kristine's total spending = $3 + $1 = $4

Step 2: ...
