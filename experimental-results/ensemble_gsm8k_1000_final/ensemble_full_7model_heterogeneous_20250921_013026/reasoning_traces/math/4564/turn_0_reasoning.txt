=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( F \) represent the number of hoodies Fiona owns.
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of hoodies Casey owns.

2. **Set Up Equations**:
   - From the problem, we know that together they own a total of 8 hoodies:
     \[
     F + C = 8
     \]
   - We also know that Casey owns two more hoodies than Fiona:
     \[
     C = F + 2
     \]

3. **Substitute**:
   - We can substitute the expression for \( C \) from the second equation into the first equation:
     \[
     F + (F + 2) = 8
     \]

4. **Combine Like Terms**:
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     2F + 2 = 8
     \]

5. **Isolate \( F \)**:
   - Next, we subtract 2 from both sides:
     \[
     2F = 6
     \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     F = 3
     \]

6. **Find \( C \)**:
   - Now that we have \( F \), we can find \( C \) using the equation \( C = F + 2 \):
     \[
     C = 3 + 2 = 5
     \]

7. **Check the Solution**:
   - We can check our solution by verifying that the total number of hoodies is correct:
     \[
     F + C = 3 + 5 = 8
     \]
   - This confirms that our calculations are correct.

Thus, the final answer is that Fiona owns \( \boxed{3} \) hoodies.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Fiona and Casey share the hoodies they own.
- Between the two of them, they own a total of 8 hoodies.
- Casey owns 2 more hoodies than Fiona.

Let's represent the number of hoodies Fiona owns as "x".

Since Casey owns 2 more hoodies than Fiona, we can represent the number of hoodies Casey owns as "x + 2".

We know that the total number of hoodies they own is 8, so we can write an ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hoodies Fiona owns given the information about the total number of hoodies and the relationship between the number of hoodies Fiona and Casey own.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( F \) represent the number of hoodies Fiona owns.
- Let \( C \) represent the number of hoodies Casey owns.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Together, Fiona and Casey own a total of 8 hoodies.
2. Casey owns two...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of hoodies Fiona owns as F and the number of hoodies Casey owns as C. 

From the problem, we know two things:

1) F + C = 8 (the total number of hoodies they own together is eight)

2) C = F + 2 (Casey owns two more hoodies than Fiona)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for F:

F + (F + 2) = 8
2F + 2 = 8
2F = 8 - 2
2F = 6
F = 6 / 2
F = 3

So, Fiona owns 3 hoodies. 

To check our work, we can substitute F = 3 into the sec...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to set up an equation and solve for the number of hoodies Fiona owns.

Given:
- Fiona and Casey own a total of eight hoodies.
- Casey owns two more hoodies than Fiona.

Step 1: Let's express Casey's hoodies in terms of Fiona's.
If Fiona owns 'x' hoodies, then Casey owns 'x + 2' hoodies.

Step 2: Set up an equation using the total number of hoodies.
Fiona's hoodies + Casey's...
