=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, let's define the number of students in each group.

Let \( x \) be the number of students in each of the two equal groups. According to the problem, the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups. Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group can be expressed as \( x - 10 \).

Now, we know that the total number of students in all three groups is 200. We can set up the equation based on this information:

\[
x + x + (x - 10) = 200
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x + (x - 10) = 200
\]

Combining like terms gives:

\[
3x - 10 = 200
\]

Next, we will isolate \( x \) by adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[
3x = 210
\]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 70
\]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

\[
\text{Number of students in the smallest group} = x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60
\]

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]

To verify, we can check the total number of students:

- Two equal groups: \( 70 + 70 = 140 \)
- Smallest group: \( 60 \)

Adding these together:

\[
140 + 60 = 200
\]

The total is indeed 200, confirming that our solution is correct. Therefore, the final answer is \( \boxed{60} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students in the smallest group.

Given information:
- The class has 200 students.
- The class is split into 3 groups.
- 2 of the groups are equal in number.
- The third group (the smallest) is 10 less than each of the other groups.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of students in the two equal groups.
- Let y be the number of students in the smallest group.

Step 1: Set up an equati...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of students in each group based on the information given. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of students in each of the two equal groups.
   - The smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, so it has \( x - 10 \) students.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of students is 200. Therefore,...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as x. The number of students in the smallest group is then x - 10.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Solving this equation will give us the number of students in each group.

First, combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Next, add 10 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x:

3x = 210

Finally, divide both sides of the equa...
