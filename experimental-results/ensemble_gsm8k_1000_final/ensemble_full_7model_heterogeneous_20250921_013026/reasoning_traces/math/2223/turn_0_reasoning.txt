=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amount of Gum**: Elyse starts with 100 pieces of gum.

2. **Elyse Gives Half to Rick**: 
   - To find out how many pieces Elyse gives to Rick, we calculate half of 100:
     \[
     \text{Pieces given to Rick} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
     \]
   - After giving half to Rick, Elyse has:
     \[
     \text{Elyse's remaining gum} = 100 - 50 = 50
     \]

3. **Rick Gives Half to Shane**:
   - Now, Rick has 50 pieces of gum. He gives half of this to Shane:
     \[
     \text{Pieces given to Shane} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
     \]
   - After giving half to Shane, Rick has:
     \[
     \text{Rick's remaining gum} = 50 - 25 = 25
     \]

4. **Shane Chews 11 Pieces of Gum**:
   - Shane starts with 25 pieces of gum and chews 11 pieces. To find out how many pieces he has left, we subtract the pieces he chewed from the pieces he had:
     \[
     \text{Shane's remaining gum} = 25 - 11 = 14
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of pieces of gum Shane has left is:
     \[
     \boxed{14}
     \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Elyse had 100 pieces of gum.
- Elyse gave half of her gum to her brother Rick.
- Rick gave half of his gum to his friend Shane.
- Shane chewed 11 pieces of gum.

Step 1: Calculate how many pieces of gum Elyse gave to Rick.
Elyse had 100 pieces of gum, and she gave half to Rick.
Pieces of gum given to Rick = 100 รท 2 = 50 pieces

Step 2: Calculate how many pieces of gum Rick had after receiving ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events described and calculate the number of gum pieces at each step. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Amount of Gum:**
   Elyse starts with 100 pieces of gum.

2. **Elyse Gives Half to Rick:**
   Elyse gives half of her gum to her brother Rick. To find out how many pieces Rick receives, we calculate half of 100:
   \[
   \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]
   So, Rick receives 50 pieces of gum.

3. **Rick Give...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Elyse initially had 100 pieces of gum.

She gave half of this to her brother Rick. Half of 100 is 50, so Rick received 50 pieces of gum.

Rick then gave half of his 50 pieces to his friend Shane. Half of 50 is 25, so Shane received 25 pieces of gum.

Shane then chewed 11 pieces of gum. To find out how many pieces he has left, we subtract the number of pieces he chewed from the total number he received.

So, 25 - 11 = 14.

Therefore, Shane has 14 pieces of gum left.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Elyse started with 100 pieces of gum.
   * She gave half of her gum to her brother Rick.
   * Rick then gave half of his gum to his friend Shane.
   * Shane chewed 11 pieces of gum.

2. Calculate how many pieces of gum Rick received from Elyse:
   * Elyse gave half of her gum to Rick.
   * Half of 100 is 100 รท 2 = 50.
   * So, Rick received 50 pieces of gum from Ely...
