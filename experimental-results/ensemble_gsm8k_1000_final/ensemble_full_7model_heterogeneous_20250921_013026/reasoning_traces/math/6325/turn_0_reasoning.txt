=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Rihanna has left after her purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and then subtract that from her initial amount of money.

1. **Identify the costs of the items:**
   - Each mango costs $3.
   - Each carton of apple juice costs $3.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the mangoes:**
   - Rihanna bought 6 mangoes.
   - Total cost for mangoes = Number of mangoes × Cost per mango
   \[
   \text{Total cost for mangoes} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the apple juice:**
   - Rihanna bought 6 cartons of apple juice.
   - Total cost for apple juice = Number of cartons × Cost per carton
   \[
   \text{Total cost for apple juice} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of all items:**
   - Total cost = Total cost for mangoes + Total cost for apple juice
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 18 + 18 = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate how much money Rihanna has left:**
   - Initial amount of money = $50
   - Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 50 - 36 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, after buying 6 mangoes and 6 cartons of apple juice, Rihanna has **$14 left**.

Final answer: **$14**

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Rihanna bought 6 mangoes and each mango cost $3. So, the total cost of the mangoes is 6 * $3 = $18.

She also bought 6 cartons of apple juice and each carton cost $3. So, the total cost of the apple juice is 6 * $3 = $18.

The total cost of the mangoes and apple juice is $18 + $18 = $36.
