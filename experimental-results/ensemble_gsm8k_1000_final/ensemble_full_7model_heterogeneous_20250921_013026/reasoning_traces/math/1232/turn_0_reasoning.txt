=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find Megan's total earnings for two months of work, we can break the problem down into several steps:

1. **Calculate Daily Earnings**: 
   - Megan earns $7.50 per hour and works 8 hours a day.
   - Daily earnings can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Daily Earnings} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Hours Worked per Day}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Daily Earnings} = 7.50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 60 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate Monthly Earnings**: 
   - Megan works 20 days a month.
   - Monthly earnings can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Monthly Earnings} = \text{Daily Earnings} \times \text{Days Worked per Month}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Monthly Earnings} = 60 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 20 \, \text{days} = 1200 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate Total Earnings for Two Months**: 
   - To find her total earnings for two months, we multiply her monthly earnings by 2:
     \[
     \text{Total Earnings for Two Months} = \text{Monthly Earnings} \times 2
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Earnings for Two Months} = 1200 \, \text{dollars/month} \times 2 = 2400 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

Thus, Megan's total earnings for two months of work is **$2400**.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how much Megan earns in a day. Since she earns $7.50 per hour and works 8 hours a day, we multiply these two values together:

$7.50/hour * 8 hours/day = $60/day

Next, we need to calculate how much she earns in a month. Since she works 20 days a month and earns $60 a day, we multiply these two values together:

$60/day * 20 days/month = $1200/month

Finally, we need to calculate how much she earns in two months. Since she earns $1200 a month a...
