=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much money Scott made from selling berry smoothies and cakes, we need to calculate the total revenue from each item he sold and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate the revenue from smoothies**:
   - Scott sold 40 cups of smoothies.
   - Each cup of smoothie is sold for $3.
   - To find the total revenue from smoothies, we multiply the number of cups sold by the price per cup:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from smoothies} = \text{Number of cups} \times \text{Price per cup} = 40 \times 3
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     40 \times 3 = 120
     \]
   - So, Scott made $120 from selling smoothies.

2. **Calculate the revenue from cakes**:
   - Scott sold 18 cakes.
   - Each cake is sold for $2.
   - To find the total revenue from cakes, we multiply the number of cakes sold by the price per cake:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from cakes} = \text{Number of cakes} \times \text{Price per cake} = 18 \times 2
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     18 \times 2 = 36
     \]
   - So, Scott made $36 from selling cakes.

3. **Calculate the total revenue**:
   - Now we add the revenue from smoothies and cakes to find the total amount of money Scott made:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Revenue from smoothies} + \text{Revenue from cakes} = 120 + 36
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     120 + 36 = 156
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Scott made from selling berry smoothies and cakes is **$156**.

Final answer: **$156**.
