=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family has after adopting 7 kittens and receiving additional kittens from their two house cats.

1. **Identify the number of adopted kittens**: 
   The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens.

2. **Determine the number of kittens from Patchy**:
   According to the problem, Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since they adopted 7 kittens, we calculate the number of kittens from Patchy as follows:
   \[
   \text{Kittens from Patchy} = 3 \times \text{Number of adopted kittens} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

3. **Determine the number of kittens from Trixie**:
   The problem states that Trixie has had 12 kittens. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   \text{Kittens from Trixie} = 12
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of kittens**:
   Now, we can find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family has by adding the number of adopted kittens, the kittens from Patchy, and the kittens from Trixie:
   \[
   \text{Total kittens} = \text{Adopted kittens} + \text{Kittens from Patchy} + \text{Kittens from Trixie}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total kittens} = 7 + 21 + 12
   \]

5. **Perform the addition**:
   First, add the adopted kittens and the kittens from Patchy:
   \[
   7 + 21 = 28
   \]
   Now, add the kittens from Trixie:
   \[
   28 + 12 = 40
   \]

Thus, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The Doubtfire sisters have adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter.

Patchy, their first house cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. This means Patchy has had 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 kittens.

Trixie, their other house cat, has had 12 kittens.

To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we add the number of kittens from each source:
