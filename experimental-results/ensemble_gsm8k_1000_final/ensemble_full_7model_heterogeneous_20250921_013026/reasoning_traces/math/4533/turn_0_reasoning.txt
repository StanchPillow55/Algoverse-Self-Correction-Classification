=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine Mike's profit from developing and selling part of his land, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of purchasing the land.**
2. **Determine how much land he sold and at what price.**
3. **Calculate the total revenue from the sale.**
4. **Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of purchasing the land

Mike bought 200 acres of land at a price of $70 per acre.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Acres} \times \text{Price per Acre}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 200 \, \text{acres} \times 70 \, \text{dollars per acre} = 14000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much land he sold and at what price

Mike sold half of the acreage he purchased. Since he bought 200 acres, half of that is:

\[
\text{Acreage Sold} = \frac{200}{2} = 100 \, \text{acres}
\]

He sold this 100 acres at a price of $200 per acre.

### Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from the sale

Now we calculate the total revenue from selling the 100 acres.

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \text{Acreage Sold} \times \text{Selling Price per Acre}
\]
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 100 \, \text{acres} \times 200 \, \text{dollars per acre} = 20000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the profit

Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
\]
\[
\text{Profit} = 20000 \, \text{dollars} - 14000 \, \text{dollars} = 6000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Mike made a profit of **$6000**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the land, the total revenue from selling half of the acreage, and then find the profit.

Given information:
- Mike bought 200 acres of land for $70 per acre.
- He sold half of the acreage for $200 per acre.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the land.
Total cost of the land = Number of acres × Cost per acre
Total cost of the land = 200 acres × $70 per acre = $14,000

Step 2: Calculate the...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine the profit Mike made from this transaction, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Cost of the Land:**
   Mike bought 200 acres at $70 per acre. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of acres by the price per acre:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 200 \, \text{acres} \times 70 \, \text{dollars/acre} = 14,000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the Amount of Land Sold:**
   Mike sold half of the 200 acres. To find out how many acre...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much Mike spent to buy the land. He bought 200 acres at $70 per acre, so the total cost is:

200 acres * $70/acre = $14,000

Next, let's calculate how much he earned from selling half of the land. Half of 200 acres is 100 acres, and he sold this for $200 per acre, so the total earnings from the sale are:

100 acres * $200/acre = $20,000

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the earnings. So, the profit is:

$20,000 - $14,000 = $6,000

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. To find out how much profit Mike made, we need to calculate the total amount he spent on buying the land and the total amount he earned by selling half of the acreage.

Given:
- Mike bought 200 acres of land.
- The purchase price was $70 per acre.
- He sold half of the acreage for $200 per acre.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of buying the land.
Total cost = Number of acres × Price per acre
Total cost = 2...
