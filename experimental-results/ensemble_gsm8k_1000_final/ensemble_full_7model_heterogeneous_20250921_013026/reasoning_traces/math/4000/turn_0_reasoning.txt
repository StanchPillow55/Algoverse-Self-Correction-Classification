=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first calculate the total distance each person's bottle cap traveled, and then we will find the difference between the distances.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Jenny's bottle cap traveled.**

1. Jenny's bottle cap initially flies 18 feet.
2. After hitting the street light, it bounces and flies an additional distance equal to \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the distance it already went (which is 18 feet).

   To find this additional distance:
   \[
   \text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. Now, we add the initial distance and the additional distance to find the total distance Jenny's bottle cap traveled:
   \[
   \text{Total distance for Jenny} = 18 + 6 = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total distance Mark's bottle cap traveled.**

1. Mark's bottle cap initially flies 15 feet.
2. After hitting the window, it bounces and flies an additional distance that is twice the distance it already went (which is 15 feet).

   To find this additional distance:
   \[
   \text{Additional distance} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. Now, we add the initial distance and the additional distance to find the total distance Mark's bottle cap traveled:
   \[
   \text{Total distance for Mark} = 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ feet}
   \]

**Step 3: Calculate how much further Mark's bottle cap went than Jenny's.**

To find the difference in distance between Mark's and Jenny's bottle caps:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total distance for Mark} - \text{Total distance for Jenny}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ feet}
\]

**Final Answer:**
Mark's bottle cap went 21 feet further than Jenny's bottle cap.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jenny's bottle cap flies 18 feet straight, then bounces off a street light and flies another 1/3 of the distance it already went.
- Mark's bottle cap flies 15 feet forward, then bounces off a window and flies twice as far as it already did.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance Jenny's bottle cap traveled.
Initial distance: 18 feet
Distance after bouncing off the street light: 18 ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by both Jenny's and Mark's bottle caps and then compare the two distances to find out how much further Mark's bottle cap went than Jenny's.

### Step 1: Calculate Jenny's Total Distance

1. **Initial Distance**: Jenny's bottle cap initially flies 18 feet.
2. **Bounce Distance**: After bouncing off a street light, it flies an additional \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the initial distance.
   \[
   \text{Bounce ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total distance that Jenny's bottle cap went. We know it flew 18 feet straight, then it bounced off a street light and flew another 1/3 of the distance it already went. 

So, the additional distance it flew after bouncing off the street light is 1/3 * 18 feet = 6 feet.

Therefore, the total distance that Jenny's bottle cap went is 18 feet + 6 feet = 24 feet.

Next, let's calculate the total distance that Mark's bottle cap went. We know it flew 15...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Find the total distance Jenny's bottlecap traveled:
   * Jenny's bottlecap first flew 18 feet straight.
   * Then it bounced off a street light and flew another 1/3 of the distance it already went.
   * To find 1/3 of 18 feet: 18 รท 3 = 6 feet
   * So, after bouncing off the street light, Jenny's bottlecap flew an additional 6 feet.
   * Total distance for Jenny's bottlecap: 18 feet + 6 feet = 24 feet
