=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of how much money Jeff and Brad receive, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( B \) represent the amount of money Brad receives in dollars.
   - Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we can express Jeff's amount as \( J = 4B \).

2. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - According to the problem, the total amount of money they are dividing is 100 dollars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   J + B = 100
   \]

3. **Substitute for Jeff's Amount**:
   - We already know that \( J = 4B \). We can substitute this into the equation:
   \[
   4B + B = 100
   \]

4. **Combine Like Terms**:
   - Combine the terms on the left side:
   \[
   5B = 100
   \]

5. **Solve for \( B \)**:
   - To find \( B \), divide both sides of the equation by 5:
   \[
   B = \frac{100}{5} = 20
   \]

6. **Calculate Jeff's Amount**:
   - Now that we know Brad's amount, we can find Jeff's amount using the relationship \( J = 4B \):
   \[
   J = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Jeff receives **80 dollars**.

In conclusion, after working through the problem step by step, we find that Jeff gets **80 dollars**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jeff and Brad are trying to divide $100 between them.
- Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad.

Let's represent Brad's share as x.

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's share would be 4x.

The total amount they need to divide is $100, so we can set up an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Simplifying the equation:
5x = 100

Solving for x:
x = 100 / 5
x = 20

So, Brad's share is $20.

Now, we can ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Jeff and Brad each receive from the total of 100 dollars, given that Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad.

Let's define the amount of money Brad receives as \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff receives 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff receives \( 4x \) dollars.

The total amount of money they receive together is 100 dollars. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + 4x = 100
\]

Simplify ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the amount of money that Brad gets as B. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so we can denote Jeff's amount as 4B.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

B + 4B = 100

This simplifies to 5B = 100.

To find the value of B, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

B = 100 / 5 = 20.

So, Brad gets 20 dollars.

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we multiply Brad's amount by 4:

Jeff's amount = 4...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jeff and Brad are dividing $100 between them.
   * Jeff gets 4 times as much money as Brad.

2. Let's assign a variable to represent Brad's share:
   * Let x = Brad's share of the money

3. Express Jeff's share in terms of Brad's share:
   * Jeff's share = 4 times Brad's share
   * Jeff's share = 4x

4. Set up an equation based on the total amount they are dividi...
