=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many magazines Alexandra has now, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Magazines bought on Friday**: 
   - Alexandra bought 8 magazines.

2. **Magazines bought on Saturday**: 
   - On Saturday, she bought 12 more magazines.
   - Total magazines after Saturday = Magazines from Friday + Magazines from Saturday
   \[
   \text{Total after Saturday} = 8 + 12 = 20
   \]

3. **Magazines bought on Sunday**: 
   - On Sunday, she bought four times the number of magazines she bought on Friday.
   - Since she bought 8 magazines on Friday, the number of magazines she bought on Sunday is:
   \[
   \text{Magazines on Sunday} = 4 \times 8 = 32
   \]
   - Now, we add these to her total:
   \[
   \text{Total after Sunday} = 20 + 32 = 52
   \]

4. **Magazines chewed by the dog**: 
   - Later that day, her dog chewed up 4 magazines.
   - We need to subtract the chewed magazines from her total:
   \[
   \text{Total after dog chewed magazines} = 52 - 4 = 48
   \]

5. **Final count of magazines**: 
   - After all purchases and the incident with the dog, Alexandra has 48 magazines left.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]
