=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will define variables for the number of cans each boy collected and then use the information given to set up equations.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of cans Juwan collected.
   - Solomon collected three times as many cans as Juwan, so Solomon's cans can be expressed as \( S = 3J \).
   - Levi collected half of what Juwan collected, so Levi's cans can be expressed as \( L = \frac{1}{2}J \).

2. **Use the information given:**
   - We know from the problem that Solomon collected 66 cans. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     S = 66
     \]
   - Since we also have \( S = 3J \), we can substitute this into the equation:
     \[
     3J = 66
     \]

3. **Solve for \( J \):**
   - To find \( J \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
     \[
     J = \frac{66}{3} = 22
     \]
   - So, Juwan collected 22 cans.

4. **Calculate the number of cans collected by Solomon and Levi:**
   - We already know Solomon collected 66 cans.
   - Now we can find out how many cans Levi collected:
     \[
     L = \frac{1}{2}J = \frac{1}{2} \times 22 = 11
     \]
   - So, Levi collected 11 cans.

5. **Calculate the total number of cans collected by all three boys:**
   - The total number of cans collected by Solomon, Juwan, and Levi is:
     \[
     \text{Total} = S + J + L = 66 + 22 + 11
     \]
   - Now we perform the addition:
     \[
     66 + 22 = 88
     \]
     \[
     88 + 11 = 99
     \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - The total number of cans collected by all the boys is \( \boxed{99} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cans collected by each boy and then add them together to find the total number of cans collected.

Given information:
- Solomon collected three times as many cans as Juwan.
- Levi collected half of what Juwan collected.
- Solomon collected 66 cans.

Step 1: Find the number of cans collected by Juwan.
Since Solomon collected three times as many cans as Juwan, we can use the following equation:
Solomo...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cans each boy collected and then sum these amounts to find the total number of cans collected by all three boys.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( J \) represent the number of cans Juwan collected.
- Let \( S \) represent the number of cans Solomon collected.
- Let \( L \) represent the number of cans Levi collected.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Solomon collected three times as many cans...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by finding out how many cans Juwan collected. Since Solomon collected three times as many cans as Juwan, and Solomon collected 66 cans, we can set up the equation 3J = 66, where J represents the number of cans Juwan collected. Solving for J, we find that Juwan collected 66 / 3 = 22 cans.

Next, let's find out how many cans Levi collected. Since Levi collected half of what Juwan collected, and Juwan collected 22 cans, Levi collected 22 / 2 = 11 cans.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the solution.

Given:
- Solomon collected three times as many cans as Juwan.
- Levi collected half of what Juwan collected.
- Solomon collected 66 cans.

Step 1: Determine the number of cans Juwan collected.
Solomon's cans = 3 × Juwan's cans
66 = 3 × Juwan's cans
Juwan's cans = 6...
