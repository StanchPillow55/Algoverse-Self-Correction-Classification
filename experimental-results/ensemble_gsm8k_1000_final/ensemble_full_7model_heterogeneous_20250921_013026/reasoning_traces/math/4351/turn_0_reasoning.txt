=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Joe has left after his purchases, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the notebooks.**
   - Joe bought 7 notebooks, and each notebook costs $4.
   - The total cost for the notebooks can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of notebooks} = \text{Number of notebooks} \times \text{Cost per notebook} = 7 \times 4 = 28
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the books.**
   - Joe bought 2 books, and each book costs $7.
   - The total cost for the books can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of books} = \text{Number of books} \times \text{Cost per book} = 2 \times 7 = 14
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of all items Joe bought.**
   - Now, we add the total cost of the notebooks and the total cost of the books to find the total expenditure:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of notebooks} + \text{Total cost of books} = 28 + 14 = 42
     \]

4. **Calculate how much money Joe has left.**
   - Joe started with $56. To find out how much he has left after his purchases, we subtract the total cost from the amount he started with:
     \[
     \text{Money left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total cost} = 56 - 42 = 14
     \]

Thus, after completing all calculations, we find that Joe has **$14 left**.

Final answer: Joe has $14 left.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Joe's mother gave him $56 to go to the store.
- Joe bought 7 notebooks and 2 books.
- Each notebook costs $4.
- Each book costs $7.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the notebooks.
Cost of 7 notebooks = 7 × $4 = $28

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the books.
Cost of 2 books = 2 × $7 = $14

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Joe spent at the store.
Total amount spent = Cost of notebooks...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Joe bought and then subtract that from the amount of money his mother gave him. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the cost of the notebooks:**
   - Joe bought 7 notebooks.
   - Each notebook costs $4.
   - Total cost for the notebooks = Number of notebooks × Cost per notebook
   \[
   \text{Total cost for notebooks} = 7 \times 4 = 28
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of the book...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total cost of the notebooks. Since each notebook costs $4 and Joe bought 7 notebooks, the total cost of the notebooks is 7 notebooks * $4/notebook = $28.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the books. Since each book costs $7 and Joe bought 2 books, the total cost of the books is 2 books * $7/book = $14.

Now, we add the total cost of the notebooks and the books to find out how much Joe spent in total. The total cost is $28 (for t...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Joe's mother gave him $56.
   * Joe bought 7 notebooks and 2 books.
   * Each notebook costs $4.
   * Each book costs $7.

2. Calculate the total cost of the notebooks:
   * Cost of notebooks = Number of notebooks × Price per notebook
   * Cost of notebooks = 7 × $4
   * Cost of notebooks = $28

3. Calculate the total cost of the books:
   * Cost of books = Number of b...
