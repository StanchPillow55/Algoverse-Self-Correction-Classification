Final Answer: To determine how much Mary Anne spends on sparkling water every year, we can break the problem down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of sparkling water she drinks in a year.

Mary Anne drinks \( \frac{1}{5} \) of a bottle of sparkling water every night at dinner. 

First, we need to find out how many nights there are in a year. There are 365 days in a year, so she drinks sparkling water every night for 365 nights.

The total amount of sparkling water she drinks in a year is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total bottles per year} = \text{Amount per night} \times \text{Number of nights}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total bottles per year} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ bottle/night} \times 365 \text{ nights} = \frac{365}{5} \text{ bottles}
\]

Now, we perform the division:

\[
\frac{365}{5} = 73
\]

So, Mary Anne drinks 73 bottles of sparkling water in a year.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the sparkling water.

Each bottle costs $2.00. To find out how much she spends in a year, we multiply the total number of bottles by the cost per bottle:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total bottles per year} \times \text{Cost per bottle}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 73 \text{ bottles} \times 2.00 \text{ dollars/bottle}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
73 \times 2.00 = 146.00
\]

### Final Answer

Mary Anne spends **$146.00** on sparkling water every year.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much sparkling water Mary Anne drinks in a year. 

She drinks 1/5 of a bottle every night. There are 365 days in a year, so she drinks 1/5 * 365 = 73 bottles of sparkling water in a year.

Each bottle costs $2.00, so the total cost of the sparkling water she drinks in a year is 73 * $2.00 = $146.00.

So, Mary Anne spends $146.00 on sparkling water every year.
