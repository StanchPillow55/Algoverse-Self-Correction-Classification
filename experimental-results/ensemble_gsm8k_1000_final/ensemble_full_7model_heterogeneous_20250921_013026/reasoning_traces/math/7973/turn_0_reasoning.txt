=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi as \( L \), \( D \), and \( B \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Together, they collected a total of 43 insects:
   \[
   L + D + B = 43
   \]

2. Lily found 7 more insects than David:
   \[
   L = D + 7
   \]

3. David found half of what Bodhi found:
   \[
   D = \frac{1}{2}B
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \) into the first equation.

First, we substitute \( D \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[
L = \left(\frac{1}{2}B\right) + 7
\]

Now we have expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)
- \( L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7 \)

Next, we substitute these into the total insects equation:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2}B\right) + B = 43
\]

Now, combine the terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2}B + \frac{1}{2}B + B + 7 = 43
\]
\[
2B + 7 = 43
\]

Next, we solve for \( B \):
\[
2B = 43 - 7
\]
\[
2B = 36
\]
\[
B = 18
\]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( D \):
\[
D = \frac{1}{2}B = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
\]

Finally, we can find \( L \):
\[
L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
\]

Thus, the number of insects that Lily found is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]

To verify, we can check the total:
- \( L = 16 \)
- \( D = 9 \)
- \( B = 18 \)

Calculating the total:
\[
L + D + B = 16 + 9 + 18 = 43
\]

Everything checks out, confirming that Lily found \( \boxed{16} \) insects.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Lily, David, and Bodhi collected a total of 43 insects.
- Lily found 7 more than David.
- David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's start by representing the number of insects found by each person with variables:
- Let x = the number of insects found by Bodhi.
- Let y = the number of insects found by David.
- Let z = the number of insects found by Lily.

Step 1: Express the rel...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and solve for the number of insects each person found.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( L \) be the number of insects Lily found.
- Let \( D \) be the number of insects David found.
- Let \( B \) be the number of insects Bodhi found.

We are given the following information:
1. Together, Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects:
   \[
   L + D + B = 43
   \]

2. Lily found 7 more ins...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of insects found by David as D, the number of insects found by Lily as L, and the number of insects found by Bodhi as B. 

From the problem, we know that:

L + D + B = 43 (since together they collected 43 insects)

L = D + 7 (since Lily found 7 more insects than David)

D = B/2 (since David found half of what Bodhi found)

We can substitute the second and third equations into the first one to solve for the variables. 

Substituting L = D + 7 and D ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to set up an equation and solve for the number of insects Lily found.

Given:
- Lily, David, and Bodhi collected a total of 43 insects.
- Lily found 7 more insects than David.
- David found half the number of insects that Bodhi found.

Step 1: Let's express the number of insects each person found in terms of a variable.
Let x be the number of insects Bodhi found.
