=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many pieces of candy remain in the bowl after Talitha and Solomon took their shares, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of pieces of candy initially in the bowl**: 
   \[
   \text{Initial pieces of candy} = 349
   \]

2. **Determine how many pieces of candy Talitha took**: 
   \[
   \text{Talitha's pieces} = 108
   \]

3. **Determine how many pieces of candy Solomon took**: 
   \[
   \text{Solomon's pieces} = 153
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pieces taken by both Talitha and Solomon**:
   \[
   \text{Total pieces taken} = \text{Talitha's pieces} + \text{Solomon's pieces}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total pieces taken} = 108 + 153
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition:
   \[
   108 + 153 = 261
   \]

5. **Subtract the total pieces taken from the initial number of pieces**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces of candy} = \text{Initial pieces of candy} - \text{Total pieces taken}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces of candy} = 349 - 261
   \]

   Now, we perform the subtraction:
   \[
   349 - 261 = 88
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   The number of pieces of candy remaining in the bowl is:
   \[
   \boxed{88}
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem involves subtraction. We start with the total number of candies in the bowl and subtract the number of candies taken by Talitha and Solomon.

Step 1: Subtract the number of candies taken by Talitha from the total number of candies.

349 (total candies) - 108 (candies taken by Talitha) = 241 candies

Step 2: Subtract the number of candies taken by Solomon from the remaining candies.

241 (remaining candies) - 153 (candies taken by Solomon) = 88 candies

So, the...
