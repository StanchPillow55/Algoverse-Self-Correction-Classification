=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of green buttons**: 
   The problem states that the tailor purchased 90 green buttons. 
   \[
   \text{Green buttons} = 90
   \]

2. **Determine the number of yellow buttons**: 
   The problem states that the tailor bought 10 more yellow buttons than the green buttons. Therefore, we can calculate the number of yellow buttons as follows:
   \[
   \text{Yellow buttons} = \text{Green buttons} + 10 = 90 + 10 = 100
   \]

3. **Determine the number of blue buttons**: 
   The problem states that the tailor bought 5 fewer blue buttons than the green buttons. Thus, we can calculate the number of blue buttons as follows:
   \[
   \text{Blue buttons} = \text{Green buttons} - 5 = 90 - 5 = 85
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of buttons**: 
   Now that we have the number of each type of button, we can find the total number of buttons by adding the quantities of green, yellow, and blue buttons together:
   \[
   \text{Total buttons} = \text{Green buttons} + \text{Yellow buttons} + \text{Blue buttons}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total buttons} = 90 + 100 + 85
   \]

5. **Perform the addition**:
   \[
   90 + 100 = 190
   \]
   \[
   190 + 85 = 275
   \]

Thus, the total number of buttons the tailor purchased is:
\[
\boxed{275}
\]

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of buttons the tailor purchased by considering each color of button separately and then summing them up.

1. **Green Buttons:**
   - The problem states that the tailor purchased 90 green buttons.

2. **Yellow Buttons:**
   - The tailor bought 10 more yellow buttons than green buttons.
   - Since there are 90 green buttons, the number of yellow buttons is:
     \[
     90 + 10 = 100
     \]

3. **Blue Buttons:**...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The tailor bought 90 green buttons.

The number of yellow buttons she bought is 10 more than the green buttons. So, she bought 90 + 10 = <<90+10=100>>100 yellow buttons.

The number of blue buttons she bought is 5 less than the green buttons. So, she bought 90 - 5 = <<90-5=85>>85 blue buttons.

To find the total number of buttons she bought, we add the number of green, yellow, and blue buttons together. So, 90 green + 100 yellow + 85 blue = <<90+100+85=275>>275 buttons.
