=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how far Elvis is from his house after his journey. We'll break down the journey into two parts: the westward trip and the eastward trip.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled west

Elvis travels west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 miles per hour (mph).

To find the distance traveled, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

For the westward trip:
\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{west}} = 18 \text{ mph} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled east

Next, Elvis turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same average speed of 18 mph.

Using the same distance formula:
\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{east}} = 18 \text{ mph} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 144 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 3: Determine his final position relative to his house

Now we need to find out how far Elvis is from his house after both parts of the journey. 

1. After traveling west for 90 miles, he is 90 miles away from his house in the west direction.
2. Then, he travels east for 144 miles. Since he was 90 miles west of his house, traveling east means he is moving back towards his house.

To find his final position, we can calculate the net distance he has traveled east relative to his starting point (his house):
\[
\text{Net distance} = \text{Distance traveled east} - \text{Distance traveled west}
\]
\[
\text{Net distance} = 144 \text{ miles} - 90 \text{ miles} = 54 \text{ miles}
\]

### Final Answer

Elvis is now 54 miles east of his house. Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{54 \text{ miles}}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total distance Elvis traveled in each direction.

When Elvis was driving west, he drove for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph. The distance (d) he traveled can be calculated using the formula d = rt, where r is the rate (or speed) and t is the time. So, the distance he traveled west is:

d_west = r * t = 18 mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

Then, Elvis turned around and drove east for 8 hours at the same average speed of 18 mph. So, the distance he ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step by step and solve it:

Given information:
- Elvis travels west for 5 hours
- He then turns around and travels east for 8 hours
- His average speed is 18 mph for both parts of the journey

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled west.
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled east.
Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Step 3: Determine th...
