=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many of Tirzah's purses and handbags are genuine (authentic) after accounting for the fake ones.

1. **Identify the total number of purses and handbags:**
   - Total purses = 26
   - Total handbags = 24

2. **Calculate the number of fake purses:**
   - According to the problem, half of the purses are fake.
   - Number of fake purses = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13 \)

3. **Calculate the number of fake handbags:**
   - The problem states that one-fourth of the handbags are fake.
   - Number of fake handbags = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 24 = 6 \)

4. **Determine the number of authentic purses:**
   - To find the number of authentic purses, we subtract the number of fake purses from the total number of purses.
   - Number of authentic purses = Total purses - Fake purses
   - Number of authentic purses = \( 26 - 13 = 13 \)

5. **Determine the number of authentic handbags:**
   - Similarly, we find the number of authentic handbags by subtracting the number of fake handbags from the total number of handbags.
   - Number of authentic handbags = Total handbags - Fake handbags
   - Number of authentic handbags = \( 24 - 6 = 18 \)

6. **Calculate the total number of genuine items:**
   - Now, we add the number of authentic purses and authentic handbags to find the total number of genuine items.
   - Total genuine items = Authentic purses + Authentic handbags
   - Total genuine items = \( 13 + 18 = 31 \)

Thus, the total number of genuine purses and handbags is **31**.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many purses and handbags are fake.

Half of Tirzah's purses are fake, so we need to find half of 26. We do this by dividing 26 by 2:

26 ÷ 2 = 13

So, 13 of Tirzah's purses are fake.

Next, we find out how many of her handbags are fake. We know that 1/4 of her handbags are fake, so we need to find 1/4 of 24. We do this by dividing 24 by 4:

24 ÷ 4 = 6

So, 6 of Tirzah's handbags are fake.

Now, we need to find out how many purses and handbag...
