=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Hannah will get paid this week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Hannah's total earnings without deductions**:
   - Hannah earns $30 per hour and works 18 hours per week.
   - We can calculate her total earnings by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours worked:
     \[
     \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Hours Worked}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Earnings} = 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 18 \, \text{hours} = 540 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total deductions for being late**:
   - Hannah is docked $5 for each time she is late. If she was late 3 times, we can calculate the total deductions by multiplying the amount docked per late occurrence by the number of times she was late:
     \[
     \text{Total Deductions} = \text{Deductions per Late} \times \text{Number of Times Late}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Deductions} = 5 \, \text{dollars} \times 3 = 15 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate Hannah's final pay**:
   - To find out how much Hannah will actually get paid, we subtract the total deductions from her total earnings:
     \[
     \text{Final Pay} = \text{Total Earnings} - \text{Total Deductions}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Final Pay} = 540 \, \text{dollars} - 15 \, \text{dollars} = 525 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

Thus, after calculating her total earnings and subtracting the deductions for being late, we find that Hannah's final pay for the week is:

\[
\boxed{525} \, \text{dollars}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Hannah makes $30 per hour
- Hannah works 18 hours per week
- Hannah's pay is docked $5 each time she's late
- Hannah was late 3 times this week

Step 1: Calculate Hannah's total earnings for the week before the late deductions.
Total earnings = Hourly rate × Hours worked per week
Total earnings = $30 × 18 hours = $540

Step 2: Calculate the total deduction for Hannah being late 3 times.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how much Hannah gets paid this week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total earnings before deductions:**

   Hannah earns $30 per hour and works 18 hours per week. To find her total earnings before any deductions, we multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she worked:

   \[
   \text{Total earnings before deductions} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours worked}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total earnings before deductions} = 30 \, \tex...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Hannah's total earnings for the week can be calculated by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she worked. 

So, $30/hour * 18 hours = $540

However, Hannah was late 3 times this week, and her pay is docked $5 each time she's late. 

So, 3 times late * $5/time = $15

To find out how much Hannah gets paid this week, we need to subtract the amount docked from her total earnings. 

So, $540 - $15 = $525

Therefore, Hannah gets paid $525 this week.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Hannah's hourly wage is $30.
   * She works 18 hours per week.
   * Her pay is reduced by $5 each time she's late.
   * This week, she was late 3 times.

2. Calculate Hannah's base pay for the week:
   * Base pay = Hourly wage × Hours worked
   * Base pay = $30 × 18
   * Base pay = $540

3. Calculate the total deduction for being late:
   * Deduction per late arrival =...
