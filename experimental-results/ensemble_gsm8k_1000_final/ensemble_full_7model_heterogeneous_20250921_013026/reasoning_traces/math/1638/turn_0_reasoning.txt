=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Richard and Sarah need to save each month to reach their goal of $108,000 for a down payment in 3 years, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert the time period into months**: Since they are saving for 3 years, we first convert this time into months.
   \[
   3 \text{ years} = 3 \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 36 \text{ months}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount they need to save each month**: To find out how much they need to save each month, we divide the total down payment by the number of months they will be saving.
   \[
   \text{Monthly savings needed} = \frac{\text{Total down payment}}{\text{Number of months}} = \frac{108,000}{36}
   \]

   Performing the division:
   \[
   \frac{108,000}{36} = 3,000
   \]

   This means Richard and Sarah need to save a total of $3,000 each month.

3. **Determine how much each person saves per month**: Since Richard and Sarah are sharing the monthly savings equally, we divide the total monthly savings by 2.
   \[
   \text{Each person's monthly savings} = \frac{\text{Total monthly savings}}{2} = \frac{3,000}{2}
   \]

   Performing the division:
   \[
   \frac{3,000}{2} = 1,500
   \]

Thus, each person, Richard and Sarah, needs to save **$1,500 per month**.

### Final Answer:
Each person saves **$1,500 per month**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total monthly savings and then divide it equally between Richard and Sarah.

Given information:
- It will take Richard and Sarah 3 years to save enough for a down payment on a house.
- The down payment on the house is $108,000.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount that needs to be saved.
Total amount to be saved = $108,000

Step 2: Calculate the total amount saved in 3 years.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Richard and Sarah each save per month if they are sharing the savings equally to reach a down payment of $108,000 in 3 years.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Total Savings Needed Per Year:**
   - The total down payment needed is $108,000.
   - They plan to save this amount over 3 years.

   \[
   \text{Total savings needed per year} = \frac{\text{Total down payment}}{\text{Number of years}} = \frac{108,...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Richard and Sarah will save in a month. 

We know that they will save for 3 years, and there are 12 months in a year. So, the total number of months they will save is 3 years * 12 months/year = 36 months.

If the total amount they need to save is $108000, then the amount they need to save each month is $108000 / 36 months = $3000/month.

Since Richard and Sarah share the monthly savings equally, each person will save $...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step by step:

Given:
- It will take Richard and Sarah 3 years to save enough for a down payment on a house.
- The house's down payment is $108,000.
- They share the monthly savings equally.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of months in 3 years.
3 years = 3 ร 12 months = 36 months

Step 2: Calculate the total amount they need to save each month combined.
Total monthly savings = Down payment รท Number of months
