=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the final values of Jackson's and Brandon's investments after the changes described.

1. **Calculate Jackson's final investment value:**
   - Jackson invests $500.
   - His investment quadruples in value. 
   - To find the final value, we multiply the initial investment by 4:
     \[
     \text{Jackson's final value} = 500 \times 4 = 2000
     \]

2. **Calculate Brandon's final investment value:**
   - Brandon also invests $500.
   - His investment is reduced to 20% of the initial value.
   - To find 20% of the initial investment, we multiply $500 by 0.20:
     \[
     \text{Brandon's final value} = 500 \times 0.20 = 100
     \]

3. **Determine how much more money Jackson has than Brandon:**
   - We subtract Brandon's final value from Jackson's final value:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Jackson's final value} - \text{Brandon's final value} = 2000 - 100 = 1900
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Jackson has $1900 more than Brandon.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1900}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jackson and Brandon both invest $500 in the stock market.
- Jackson's investment quadruples in value.
- Brandon's investment is reduced to 20% of the initial value.

Step 1: Calculate the value of Jackson's investment.
Initial investment = $500
Jackson's investment quadruples in value, so the final value is:
Final value of Jackson's investment = $500 Ã— 4 = $2,000

Step 2: Calculate the value o...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the final value of both Jackson's and Brandon's investments and then compare them to find out how much more money Jackson has than Brandon.

**Step 1: Calculate Jackson's final investment value.**

Jackson's initial investment is $500. His investment quadruples in value. Quadrupling means multiplying the initial amount by 4.

\[
\text{Jackson's final value} = 500 \times 4 = 2000
\]

So, Jackson's investment is now worth $2000.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by calculating the final value of Jackson's investment. Since his investment quadruples, we multiply the initial amount by 4:

$500 * 4 = $2000

Next, let's calculate the final value of Brandon's investment. Since his investment is reduced to 20% of the initial value, we multiply the initial amount by 0.20:

$500 * 0.20 = $100

Now, to find out how much more money Jackson has than Brandon, we subtract the final value of Brandon's investment from the final valu...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Both Jackson and Brandon initially invested $500 each.
   * Jackson's investment quadrupled (increased by 4 times) in value.
   * Brandon's investment reduced to 20% of its initial value.

2. Calculate the current value of Jackson's investment:
   * Jackson's initial investment = $500
   * Jackson's investment quadrupled, so we multiply the initial value by 4.
