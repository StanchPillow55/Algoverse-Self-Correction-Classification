=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pictures Alexander draws for each of the 5 new galleries, given the total number of pencils he uses.

1. **Identify the total number of pictures drawn:**
   - Alexander draws 9 pictures for the initial exhibition.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pictures he draws for each of the 5 new galleries.
   - Therefore, the total number of pictures drawn for the 5 new galleries is \( 5x \).

   The total number of pictures drawn by Alexander is:
   \[
   9 + 5x
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of pencils used:**
   - For each picture, Alexander needs 4 pencils.
   - For signing his signature on the pictures, he needs an additional 2 pencils for each exhibition.
   - He has 1 exhibition for the initial 9 pictures and 5 exhibitions for the new galleries.

   The total number of exhibitions is:
   \[
   1 + 5 = 6
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of pencils used for signing is:
   \[
   2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ pencils}
   \]

   Now, the total number of pencils used for drawing the pictures is:
   \[
   4 \times (9 + 5x)
   \]

   Thus, the total number of pencils used (drawing + signing) is:
   \[
   4(9 + 5x) + 12
   \]

3. **Set up the equation:**
   We know that the total number of pencils used is 88. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   4(9 + 5x) + 12 = 88
   \]

4. **Solve the equation:**
   First, simplify the left side:
   \[
   4(9 + 5x) + 12 = 88
   \]
   \[
   36 + 20x + 12 = 88
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   48 + 20x = 88
   \]
   Now, isolate \( 20x \):
   \[
   20x = 88 - 48
   \]
   \[
   20x = 40
   \]
   Divide both sides by 20:
   \[
   x = 2
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Alexander draws \( x = 2 \) pictures for each of the 5 new galleries.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pictures Alexander drew for each of the 5 new galleries, given the total number of pencils he used.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Information:**
   - Alexander draws 9 pictures for the first exhibition.
   - He draws additional pictures for 5 new galleries, with each gallery receiving the same number of pictures.
   - Each picture requires 4 pencils.
   - Each exhibition requires an addition...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by calculating how many pencils Alexander used for the first exhibition. He drew 9 pictures, and each picture requires 4 pencils, so he used 9 * 4 = 36 pencils for drawing. He also needed 2 pencils for signing his pictures, so in total, he used 36 + 2 = 38 pencils for the first exhibition.

This means that he used 88 - 38 = 50 pencils for the 5 new exhibitions.

Since he uses 2 pencils for signing his pictures at each exhibition, he used 2 * 5 = 10 pencils for...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given:
- Alexander draws 9 pictures for the first exhibition.
- He draws pictures for 5 new galleries, with each gallery receiving the same number of pictures.
- Each picture requires 4 pencils.
- For each exhibition, he needs an additional 2 pencils for signing his pictures.
- In total, Alexander uses 88 pencils for drawing and signing all the pictures.
