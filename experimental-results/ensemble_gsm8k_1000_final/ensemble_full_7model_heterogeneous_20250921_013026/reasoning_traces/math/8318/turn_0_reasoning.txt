=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many students in Miss Susan's class are good at math. We know the following information:

1. There are a total of 20 students in the class.
2. 5 students are good at math only.
3. 8 students are good at English only.
4. The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

Let's denote:
- \( M \): the number of students good at math.
- \( E \): the number of students good at English.
- \( B \): the number of students good at both subjects.

From the information given, we can summarize the students as follows:
- Students good at math only: 5
- Students good at English only: 8
- Students good at both subjects: \( B \)

The total number of students can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Total students} = (\text{Students good at math only}) + (\text{Students good at English only}) + (\text{Students good at both})
\]
Substituting the known values, we have:
\[
20 = 5 + 8 + B
\]

Now, we can simplify this equation:
\[
20 = 13 + B
\]

To find \( B \), we subtract 13 from both sides:
\[
B = 20 - 13 = 7
\]

Now we know that there are 7 students who are good at both math and English.

Next, we need to find the total number of students who are good at math. This includes both the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both subjects:
\[
M = (\text{Students good at math only}) + (\text{Students good at both})
\]
Substituting the values we have:
\[
M = 5 + 7 = 12
\]

Thus, the total number of students who are good at math is \( 12 \).

Finally, we state our final answer:
\[
\text{The number of students good at math is } \boxed{12}.
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students who are good at math.

Given information:
- There are 20 students in Miss Susan's class.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

Let's represent the students in a Venn diagram:

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem tells us that there are 20 students in Miss Susan's class. We know that 5 of them are good at math only and 8 of them perform well in English only. 

To find out how many students are good at both math and English, we subtract the number of students who are good at math only and English only from the total number of students. 

So, we do 20 (total students) - 5 (math only students) - 8 (English only students) = 7 students who are good at both math and English....

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to find the total number of students who are good at math.

Given:
- There are 20 students in Miss Susan's class.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

Step 1: Find the number of students who are good at both math and English.
To do this, we'll subtract the number of students good at mat...
