=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many slices of pizza each person will get when 7 pizzas are shared equally among Henry and his 3 friends.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizzas.**
Henry orders 7 pizzas.

**Step 2: Determine how many slices are in each pizza.**
Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices.**
To find the total number of slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:

\[
\text{Total slices} = \text{Number of pizzas} \times \text{Slices per pizza}
\]
\[
\text{Total slices} = 7 \times 8 = 56
\]

**Step 4: Determine the total number of people sharing the pizzas.**
Henry has 3 friends, so the total number of people is:

\[
\text{Total people} = 1 \text{ (Henry)} + 3 \text{ (friends)} = 4
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the number of slices each person gets.**
To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the total number of people:

\[
\text{Slices per person} = \frac{\text{Total slices}}{\text{Total people}}
\]
\[
\text{Slices per person} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
\]

**Final Answer:**
Each person can have 14 slices of pizza.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices of pizza each person can have if the pizzas are shared equally among Henry and his 3 friends.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine the Total Number of People:**
   - Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people.
   \[
   \text{Total people} = 1 (\text{Henry}) + 3 (\text{friends}) = 4
   \]

2. **Calculate the Total Number of Pizzas:**
   - They ordered 7 pizzas.

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Sli...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out the total number of pizza slices. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices and they ordered 7 pizzas, we multiply 8 by 7. 

8 slices/pizza * 7 pizzas = 56 slices

Next, we need to find out how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry and 3 of his friends are sharing, so there are 4 people in total.

Finally, we divide the total number of slices by the total number of people to find out how many slices each person can have.

56 slices / 4 people = ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends).
- They ordered 7 pizzas.
- Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizza slices.
Total slices = Number of pizzas × Slices per pizza
Total slices = 7 × 8 = 56 slices

Step 2: Determine the number of slices each person can have if they share the pizzas equally.
Slices per person = Total slices ÷ Numb...
