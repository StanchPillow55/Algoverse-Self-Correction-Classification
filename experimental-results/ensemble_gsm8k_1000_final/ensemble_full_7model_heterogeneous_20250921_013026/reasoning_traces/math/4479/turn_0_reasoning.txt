=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ears of corn Bob initially had.**
   - Bob has 50 bushels of corn.
   - Each bushel contains 14 ears of corn.
   - Therefore, the total number of ears of corn Bob initially had is:
     \[
     \text{Total ears} = \text{Number of bushels} \times \text{Ears per bushel} = 50 \times 14
     \]
   - Calculating this:
     \[
     50 \times 14 = 700
     \]
   - So, Bob initially had **700 ears of corn**.

2. **Calculate the total number of ears of corn Bob gave away.**
   - Bob gave away corn to several friends:
     - Terry took 8 bushels.
     - Jerry took 3 bushels.
     - Linda took 12 bushels.
     - Stacy took 21 ears of corn.
   - First, we need to convert the bushels given to Terry, Jerry, and Linda into ears of corn:
     - For Terry:
       \[
       \text{Ears given to Terry} = 8 \text{ bushels} \times 14 \text{ ears/bushel} = 112 \text{ ears}
       \]
     - For Jerry:
       \[
       \text{Ears given to Jerry} = 3 \text{ bushels} \times 14 \text{ ears/bushel} = 42 \text{ ears}
       \]
     - For Linda:
       \[
       \text{Ears given to Linda} = 12 \text{ bushels} \times 14 \text{ ears/bushel} = 168 \text{ ears}
       \]
   - Now, we can sum up all the ears given away:
     \[
     \text{Total ears given away} = \text{Ears to Terry} + \text{Ears to Jerry} + \text{Ears to Linda} + \text{Ears to Stacy}
     \]
     \[
     = 112 + 42 + 168 + 21
     \]
   - Calculating this step by step:
     \[
     112 + 42 = 154
     \]
     \[
     154 + 168 = 322
     \]
     \[
     322 + 21 = 343
     \]
   - So, Bob gave away a total of **343 ears of corn**.

3. **Calculate how many ears of corn Bob has left.**
   - To find out how many ears of corn Bob has left, we subtract the total ears given away from the initial total:
     \[
     \text{Ears left} = \text{Initial ears} - \text{Ears given away}
     \]
     \[
     = 700 - 343
     \]
   - Performing the subtraction:
     \[
     700 - 343 = 357
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is that Bob has **357 ears of corn left**.

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ears of corn Bob initially had.**
   - Bob has 50 bushels of corn.
   - Each bushel contains 14 ears of corn.
   - Therefore, the total number of ears of corn Bob initially had is:
     \[
     \text{Total ears} = \text{Number of bushels} \times \text{Ears per bushel} = 50 \times 14
     \]
   - Calculating this:
     \[
     50 \times 14 = 700
     \]
   - So, Bob initially had...

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Bob started with 50 bushels of corn.
2. He gave away:
   - 8 bushels to his friend Terry
   - 3 bushels to his friend Jerry
   - 12 bushels to his friend Linda
   - 21 ears of corn to his neighbor Stacy

To calculate the total amount of corn given away, we need to convert the 21 ears of corn given to Stacy into bushels.

* Each bushel contains 14 ears of corn
* 21 ears of corn / 14 ears per bushel = 1.5 bu...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ears of corn Bob has left after giving some away to his friends. We'll start by calculating the total number of ears of corn Bob initially had, then subtract the number of ears he gave away.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of ears of corn Bob initially had.

Bob grew 50 bushels of corn. We are told that each bushel contains 14 ears of corn. Therefore, the total number of ears of corn Bob had initially is calcul...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's convert all the bushels of corn that Bob gave away into ears of corn. We know that each bushel contains 14 ears of corn.

Terry took 8 bushels, which is 8 bushels * 14 ears/bushel = 112 ears of corn.
Jerry took 3 bushels, which is 3 bushels * 14 ears/bushel = 42 ears of corn.
Linda took 12 bushels, which is 12 bushels * 14 ears/bushel = 168 ears of corn.

Adding these together, Bob gave away 112 ears + 42 ears + 168 ears = 322 ears of corn to Terry, Jerry, an...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step and solve it:

Given information:
- Bob grew 50 bushels of corn.
- Terry took 8 bushels.
- Jerry took 3 bushels.
- Linda took 12 bushels.
- Stacy took 21 ears of corn.
- Each bushel contains 14 ears of corn.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of bushels Bob gave away.
Bushels given away = Terry's bushels + Jerry's bushels + Linda's bushels
Bushels given away = 8 + 3 + 12 = 23 bushels

Step 2: Calculate ...
