Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of female dogs:**
   Tenisha has a total of 40 dogs, and 60% of them are female. We can calculate the number of female dogs as follows:

   \[
   \text{Number of female dogs} = 60\% \times 40 = 0.6 \times 40 = 24
   \]

2. **Determine the number of female dogs that give birth:**
   According to the problem, 3/4 of the female dogs give birth. We can calculate the number of female dogs that give birth:

   \[
   \text{Number of female dogs that give birth} = \frac{3}{4} \times 24 = 18
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of puppies born:**
   Each of the female dogs that gives birth has 10 puppies. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of puppies born:

   \[
   \text{Total puppies born} = 18 \times 10 = 180
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of puppies after donation:**
   Tenisha donates 130 puppies to the church. We need to find out how many puppies she has left after the donation:

   \[
   \text{Puppies remaining} = \text{Total puppies born} - \text{Puppies donated} = 180 - 130 = 50
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   After calculating all the steps, we find that the total number of puppies that Tenisha remains with after donating 130 puppies to the church is:

   \[
   \boxed{50}
   \]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many of Tenisha's dogs are female. We do this by multiplying the total number of dogs by the percentage that are female. 

40 dogs * 60% = 24 dogs

So, 24 of Tenisha's dogs are female. 

Next, we need to find out how many of these female dogs give birth. We do this by multiplying the total number of female dogs by the fraction that give birth.

24 dogs * 3/4 = 18 dogs

So, 18 of Tenisha's female dogs give birth. 

Each of these dogs gives bi...
