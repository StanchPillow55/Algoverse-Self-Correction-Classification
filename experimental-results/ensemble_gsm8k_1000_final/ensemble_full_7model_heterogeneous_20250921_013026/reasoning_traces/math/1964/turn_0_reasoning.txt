Final Answer: To determine how many cups of coffee Maria orders per day, we can break the problem down into simple steps.

1. **Identify the number of times Maria goes to the coffee shop per day**: 
   - According to the problem, Maria goes to the coffee shop 2 times a day.

2. **Identify how many cups of coffee she orders each time**:
   - Each time she goes to the coffee shop, she orders 3 cups of coffee.

3. **Calculate the total number of cups of coffee ordered per day**:
   - To find the total number of cups of coffee Maria orders in a day, we multiply the number of times she goes to the coffee shop by the number of cups she orders each time.

   \[
   \text{Total cups of coffee} = (\text{Number of visits}) \times (\text{Cups per visit})
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Total cups of coffee} = 2 \times 3
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication**:
   - Now we calculate:

   \[
   2 \times 3 = 6
   \]

Thus, Maria orders a total of 6 cups of coffee per day.
