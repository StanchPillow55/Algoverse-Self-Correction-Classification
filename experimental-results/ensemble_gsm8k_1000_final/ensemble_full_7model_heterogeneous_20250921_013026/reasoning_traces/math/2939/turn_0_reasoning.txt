=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pebbles Lance threw compared to Candy and then find the difference between the two amounts.

1. **Identify how many pebbles Candy threw**:
   - According to the problem, Candy throws 4 pebbles into the lake.

2. **Determine how many pebbles Lance threw**:
   - The problem states that Lance throws in 3 times as many pebbles as Candy. 
   - Since Candy threw 4 pebbles, we calculate the number of pebbles Lance threw as follows:
     \[
     \text{Lance's pebbles} = 3 \times \text{Candy's pebbles} = 3 \times 4 = 12
     \]

3. **Calculate how many more pebbles Lance threw compared to Candy**:
   - To find out how many more pebbles Lance threw than Candy, we subtract the number of pebbles Candy threw from the number of pebbles Lance threw:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Lance's pebbles} - \text{Candy's pebbles} = 12 - 4 = 8
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Lance threw 8 more pebbles than Candy.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Candy throws 4 pebbles into the lake.

Lance throws in 3 times as many pebbles as Candy. To find out how many pebbles Lance throws, we multiply the number of pebbles Candy throws by 3.

4 pebbles * 3 = 12 pebbles

So, Lance throws 12 pebbles into the lake.

To find out how many more pebbles Lance throws compared to Candy, we subtract the number of pebbles Candy throws from the number of pebbles Lance throws.

12 pebbles - 4 pebbles = 8 pebbles

So, Lance throws 8 more peb...
