=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will go through it step by step.

1. **Determine how many balloons each friend initially receives:**
   Dante has 250 balloons and he shares them evenly among his 5 friends. To find out how many balloons each friend receives, we divide the total number of balloons by the number of friends:

   \[
   \text{Balloons per friend} = \frac{250 \text{ balloons}}{5 \text{ friends}} = 50 \text{ balloons per friend}
   \]

   So, initially, each friend has 50 balloons.

2. **Calculate how many balloons each friend gives to Dante:**
   Dante then asks each of his friends to give him 11 balloons. 

3. **Determine how many balloons each friend has after giving some to Dante:**
   Each friend starts with 50 balloons and gives away 11 balloons. We can calculate the remaining number of balloons for each friend as follows:

   \[
   \text{Balloons remaining per friend} = 50 \text{ balloons} - 11 \text{ balloons} = 39 \text{ balloons}
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   After giving Dante 11 balloons, each friend has 39 balloons left.

Thus, the final answer is:

**Each friend has 39 balloons now.**

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- There were 250 balloons in one package.
- Dante evenly shared the balloons among his 5 friends.
- Dante then asked each of his friends to give him 11 balloons.

Step 1: Calculate how many balloons each friend received initially.
Total balloons / Number of friends = Balloons per friend
250 balloons / 5 friends = 50 balloons per friend

Step 2: Calculate how many balloons each friend has after g...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps to determine how many balloons each of Dante's friends has after the exchange.

1. **Determine the initial distribution of balloons:**
   - Dante starts with 250 balloons.
   - He shares these balloons evenly among his 5 friends.
   - To find out how many balloons each friend receives initially, we divide the total number of balloons by the number of friends:
     \[
     \text{Balloons per friend initially} = \f...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Dante initially shared the 250 balloons evenly among his 5 friends. To find out how many balloons each friend received, we divide the total number of balloons by the number of friends. 

250 balloons รท 5 friends = 50 balloons per friend

Then, Dante asked each friend to give him 11 balloons. To find out how many balloons each friend has now, we subtract the number of balloons Dante took from the initial number each friend had.

50 balloons - 11 balloons = 39 balloons

So,...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step, showing all the calculations and explaining the reasoning.

Given:
- There were 250 balloons in one package.
- Dante evenly shared the balloons among his 5 friends.
- Dante asked each of his friends to give him 11 balloons.

Step 1: Calculate the number of balloons each friend initially received.
Since Dante evenly shared the balloons among his 5 friends, we need to divide the total number of balloons by the...
