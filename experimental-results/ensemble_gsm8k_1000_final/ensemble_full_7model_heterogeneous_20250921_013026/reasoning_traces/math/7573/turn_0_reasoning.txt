=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the number of times each of Jerome's friends pressed the doorbell and then sum these values to find the total number of doorbell rings.

1. **First Friend**: 
   - The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
   \[
   \text{First Friend's presses} = 20
   \]

2. **Second Friend**: 
   - The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend. 
   - To find out how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell, we first calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the first friend's presses:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
   \]
   - Now, we add this to the first friend's presses:
   \[
   \text{Second Friend's presses} = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Fourth Friend**: 
   - The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
   \[
   \text{Fourth Friend's presses} = 60
   \]

4. **Third Friend**: 
   - The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
   - To find out how many times the third friend pressed the doorbell, we add 10 to the fourth friend's presses:
   \[
   \text{Third Friend's presses} = 60 + 10 = 70
   \]

5. **Total Doorbell Rings**: 
   - Now, we sum the number of presses from all four friends:
   \[
   \text{Total presses} = \text{First Friend's presses} + \text{Second Friend's presses} + \text{Third Friend's presses} + \text{Fourth Friend's presses}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total presses} = 20 + 25 + 70 + 60
   \]

   Let's calculate this step by step:
   - First, add the first two friends:
   \[
   20 + 25 = 45
   \]
   - Next, add the third friend's presses:
   \[
   45 + 70 = 115
   \]
   - Finally, add the fourth friend's presses:
   \[
   115 + 60 = 175
   \]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is:
\[
\boxed{175}
\]

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times the doorbell was pressed by all four of Jerome's friends.

1. **First Friend:**
   - The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

2. **Second Friend:**
   - The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend.
   - First, calculate 1/4 of the number of times the first friend pressed the doorbell:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
     \]
   - Therefore, the second frien...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Second, the problem states that the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find out how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell, we need to calculate 1/4 of 20 and add it to 20. 

1/4 * 20 = 5

So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

Third, we know that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell ...
