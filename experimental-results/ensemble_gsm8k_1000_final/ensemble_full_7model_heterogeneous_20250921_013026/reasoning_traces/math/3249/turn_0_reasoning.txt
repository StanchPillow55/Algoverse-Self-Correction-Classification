=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of both strawberries and cherries, and then calculate the total cost for Briget's purchase.

1. **Cost of Strawberries**:
   - We know that a pound of strawberries costs $2.20.
   - Briget plans to buy 5 pounds of strawberries.
   - Therefore, the total cost for strawberries can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for strawberries} = \text{Cost per pound} \times \text{Number of pounds}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost for strawberries} = 2.20 \times 5 = 11.00
     \]

2. **Cost of Cherries**:
   - The problem states that a pound of cherries costs 6 times as much as strawberries.
   - Since a pound of strawberries costs $2.20, the cost of a pound of cherries is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound of cherries} = 6 \times 2.20 = 13.20
     \]
   - Briget also plans to buy 5 pounds of cherries.
   - Therefore, the total cost for cherries can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for cherries} = \text{Cost per pound of cherries} \times \text{Number of pounds}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost for cherries} = 13.20 \times 5 = 66.00
     \]

3. **Total Cost**:
   - Now, we can find the total cost for both strawberries and cherries by adding the two amounts together:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for strawberries} + \text{Total cost for cherries}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 11.00 + 66.00 = 77.00
     \]

Thus, the total cost for Briget to buy 5 pounds of strawberries and 5 pounds of cherries is **$77.00**.

Final answer: **$77.00**

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- A pound of strawberries costs $2.20.
- A pound of cherries costs 6 times as much as a pound of strawberries.
- Briget will buy 5 pounds of strawberries and 5 pounds of cherries.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of 5 pounds of strawberries.
Cost of 5 pounds of strawberries = 5 × $2.20 = $11.00

Step 2: Calculate the cost of a pound of cherries.
Cost of a pound of cherries = 6 × $2.20 = $13.20

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of 5 pounds of strawberries and 5 pounds of cherries, given the prices per pound.

1. **Determine the cost of cherries per pound:**

   We know that a pound of strawberries costs $2.20. The problem states that a pound of cherries costs 6 times as much as strawberries. Therefore, we calculate the cost of cherries per pound as follows:

   \[
   \text{Cost of cherries per pound} = 6 \times \text{Cost of strawberries per ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much a pound of cherries costs. Since we know that a pound of cherries costs 6 times as much as strawberries, we multiply the cost of strawberries by 6.

$2.20 * 6 = $13.20

So, a pound of cherries costs $13.20.

Next, we need to calculate how much Briget will pay for 5 pounds of strawberries and 5 pounds of cherries. 

For the strawberries, we multiply the cost per pound by the number of pounds:

$2.20 * 5 = $11.00

For the cherries, we do ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * 1 pound of strawberries costs $2.20
   * 1 pound of cherries costs 6 times as much as strawberries
   * Briget wants to buy 5 pounds of strawberries and 5 pounds of cherries

2. Calculate the cost of cherries per pound:
   * Cost of cherries per pound = 6 × Cost of strawberries per pound
   * Cost of cherries per pound = 6 × $2.20
   * Cost of cherries per pound = $13....
