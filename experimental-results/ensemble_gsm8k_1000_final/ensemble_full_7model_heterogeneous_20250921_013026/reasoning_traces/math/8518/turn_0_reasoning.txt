=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's denote the amount that the first person took as \( x \).

According to the problem:

1. The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the amount the second person took can be expressed as:
   \[
   x + 80
   \]

2. The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount the third person took can be expressed as:
   \[
   2(x + 80)
   \]

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total amount of money, which is $1920. The sum of the amounts taken by all three people must equal $1920:
\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
\]

Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation step by step:

1. Combine the terms:
   \[
   x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = x + x + 80 + 2x + 160
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   4x + 240
   \]

2. Now, we can set the equation:
   \[
   4x + 240 = 1920
   \]

3. Next, we will isolate \( x \) by subtracting 240 from both sides:
   \[
   4x = 1920 - 240
   \]
   \[
   4x = 1680
   \]

4. Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{1680}{4}
   \]
   \[
   x = 420
   \]

Thus, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \).

### Verification:
1. The first person took \( x = 420 \).
2. The second person took \( x + 80 = 420 + 80 = 500 \).
3. The third person took \( 2(x + 80) = 2 \times 500 = 1000 \).

Now, let's check the total:
\[
420 + 500 + 1000 = 1920
\]
This confirms that our calculations are correct. The share of the first person is indeed \( \boxed{420} \).

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): Let's denote the amount that the first person took as \( x \).

According to the problem:

1. The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the amount the second person took can be expressed as:
   \[
   x + 80
   \]

2. The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount the third person took can be expressed as:
   \[
   2(x + 80)
   \]

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total amount of money, which is $1920. The sum of the...

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- The total amount to be divided is $1920.
- The second person took $80 more than the first person.
- The third person took twice what the second person took.

Let's define the variables:
- Let the share of the first person be x.
- Then, the share of the second person will be x + $80.
- The share of the third person will be 2(x + $80).

We know that the total amount to be divided is...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much each of the three people received from the total amount of $1920. We are given that the second person took $80 more than the first, and the third person took twice what the second person took. Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let the share of the first person be \( x \).
   - The second person took $80 more than the first, so their sha...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the amount of money the first person took as x. 

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so we can denote the amount of money the second person took as x + $80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so we can denote the amount of money the third person took as 2*(x + $80).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + $80) + 2*(x + $80) = $1920

Solving thi...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find the share of the first person.

Given:
- The total amount divided is $1920.
- The second person took $80 more than the first person.
- The third person took twice the amount of the second person.

Step 1: Let's express the shares of each person in terms of the first person's share.
First person's share = x
Second person's share = x + 80
Third person's share = 2(x + 80)

Step 2: The sum of ...
