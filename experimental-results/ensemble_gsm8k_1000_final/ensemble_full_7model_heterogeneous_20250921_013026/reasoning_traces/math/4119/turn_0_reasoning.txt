=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much Grant made in his first three months, we will break down his earnings month by month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month Earnings**:
   - Grant made $350 in the first month.
   \[
   \text{First Month Earnings} = 350
   \]

2. **Second Month Earnings**:
   - Grant made $50 more than double what he made in the first month. 
   - First, we calculate double the first month's earnings:
   \[
   2 \times 350 = 700
   \]
   - Now, we add $50 to this amount:
   \[
   \text{Second Month Earnings} = 700 + 50 = 750
   \]

3. **Third Month Earnings**:
   - Grant quadrupled the sum of the first two months' earnings. 
   - First, we need to find the total of the first two months:
   \[
   \text{Total of First Two Months} = 350 + 750 = 1100
   \]
   - Now, we quadruple this total:
   \[
   \text{Third Month Earnings} = 4 \times 1100 = 4400
   \]

4. **Total Earnings Over Three Months**:
   - Now we sum up all three months' earnings:
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = 350 + 750 + 4400
   \]
   - Performing the addition step by step:
   \[
   350 + 750 = 1100
   \]
   \[
   1100 + 4400 = 5500
   \]

Thus, the total amount Grant made in his first three months is:
\[
\boxed{5500}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- In the first month, Grant made $350.
- In the second month, he made $50 more than double what he made in the first month.
- In the third month, he quadrupled the sum of the first two months.

Step 1: Calculate the amount Grant made in the second month.
Amount made in the second month = (2 × $350) + $50 = $750

Step 2: Calculate the sum of the first two months.
Sum of the first two...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate Grant's earnings for each of the three months and then find the total amount he made over these months.

**Step 1: Calculate earnings for each month.**

1. **First Month:**
   - Grant made $350.

2. **Second Month:**
   - He made $50 more than double what he made the first month.
   - First, calculate double of the first month's earnings: 
     \[
     2 \times 350 = 700
     \]
   - Then, add $50 to this amount:
     \[
     7...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Grant made $350 in the first month.

Second, we're told that he made $50 more than double what he made in the first month. To find this, we first double what he made in the first month, which is 2 * $350 = $700. Then, we add $50 to this amount, which gives us $700 + $50 = $750. So, Grant made $750 in the second month.

Third, we're told that he quadrupled the sum of the first two months in the third month. To...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * In the first month, Grant made $350.
   * In the second month, he made $50 more than double the amount he made in the first month.
   * In the third month, he made four times the sum of the first two months.

2. Calculate Grant's earnings for the second month:
   * First month earnings = $350
   * Second month earnings = (2 × First month earnings) + $50
   * Second ...
