Final Answer: To find out how much money the city raised for charity from the sale of rubber ducks, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from both the regular size and large size rubber ducks.

1. **Calculate the revenue from regular size rubber ducks:**
   - The price of each regular size rubber duck is $3.00.
   - The number of regular size rubber ducks sold is 221.
   - To find the total revenue from regular size ducks, we multiply the number of ducks sold by the price per duck:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from regular ducks} = \text{Number of regular ducks} \times \text{Price per regular duck}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Revenue from regular ducks} = 221 \times 3.00
     \]
     \[
     \text{Revenue from regular ducks} = 663.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the revenue from large size rubber ducks:**
   - The price of each large size rubber duck is $5.00.
   - The number of large size rubber ducks sold is 185.
   - To find the total revenue from large size ducks, we multiply the number of ducks sold by the price per duck:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from large ducks} = \text{Number of large ducks} \times \text{Price per large duck}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Revenue from large ducks} = 185 \times 5.00
     \]
     \[
     \text{Revenue from large ducks} = 925.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue raised for charity:**
   - Now, we add the revenue from regular size ducks and the revenue from large size ducks to find the total amount raised for charity:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from regular ducks} + \text{Revenue from large ducks}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = 663.00 + 925.00
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = 1588.00
     \]

Therefore, the total amount of money raised for charity from the rubber duck race is **$1588.00**. 

Final answer: **$1588.00**.
