=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many hours Marta has worked on the farm, we need to analyze the total amount of money she has collected and how that relates to her hourly wage and tips.

1. **Identify the total amount collected**: 
   Marta has collected a total of $240.

2. **Identify the total amount in tips**: 
   Marta has received $50 in tips.

3. **Calculate the amount earned from working hours**: 
   To find out how much money Marta earned from her work (not including tips), we subtract the tips from the total amount collected:
   \[
   \text{Amount earned from work} = \text{Total amount collected} - \text{Total tips}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount earned from work} = 240 - 50 = 190
   \]

4. **Determine the hourly wage**: 
   Marta earns $10 for every hour she works.

5. **Calculate the number of hours worked**: 
   To find the number of hours Marta has worked, we divide the amount she earned from work by her hourly wage:
   \[
   \text{Number of hours worked} = \frac{\text{Amount earned from work}}{\text{Hourly wage}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of hours worked} = \frac{190}{10} = 19
   \]

Thus, Marta has worked a total of **19 hours** on the farm.

Final answer: **19 hours**.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to first understand how Marta earns money. She earns $10 per hour for her work and also receives tips from her grandmother. 

We know that Marta has collected a total of $240 so far, and $50 of this total is from tips. Therefore, the remaining amount she has earned from her hourly wage can be calculated by subtracting the tips from the total amount collected. 

So, $240 (total earnings) - $50 (tips) = $190 (earnings from hourly wage).

Since...
