=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much time Mia spent studying each day based on the fractions of her day she spent watching TV and studying.

1. **Understanding the total time in a day**: 
   A full day has 24 hours. To work with minutes, we convert hours into minutes:
   \[
   24 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1440 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculating time spent watching TV**:
   Mia spent \( \frac{1}{5} \) of her day watching TV. We calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Time spent watching TV} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1440 \text{ minutes} = \frac{1440}{5} = 288 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculating the remaining time after watching TV**:
   After watching TV, we need to find out how much time is left in the day:
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = 1440 \text{ minutes} - 288 \text{ minutes} = 1152 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Calculating time spent studying**:
   Mia spent \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining time studying. We calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Time spent studying} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1152 \text{ minutes} = \frac{1152}{4} = 288 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total time Mia spent studying each day is:
   \[
   \boxed{288} \text{ minutes}
   \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the time Mia spent studying each day.

Given information:
- Mia spent 1/5 of her day watching TV.
- Mia spent 1/4 of the remaining time studying.

Step 1: Determine the total time in a day.
Total time in a day = 24 hours = 1440 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time spent watching TV.
Time spent watching TV = 1/5 of the day = 1/5 × 1440 minutes = 288 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the remaining time after watching TV.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many minutes Mia spent studying each day based on the given fractions of her day.

1. **Understand the Total Time in a Day:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Since we need the answer in minutes, we convert hours to minutes: \( 24 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1440 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Calculate Time Spent Watching TV:**
   - Mia spent \(\frac{1}{5}\) of her day watching TV.
   - Calculate the ti...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's determine how many hours are in a day. There are 24 hours in a day. 

Mia spent 1/5 of her day watching TV. To find out how many hours she spent watching TV, we multiply 24 hours by 1/5:

24 hours * 1/5 = 4.8 hours

So, Mia spent 4.8 hours watching TV.

To find out how much time she had left after watching TV, we subtract the time she spent watching TV from the total hours in a day:

24 hours - 4.8 hours = 19.2 hours

Mia spent 1/4 of the remaining time study...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mia spent 1/5 of her day watching TV.
   * She spent 1/4 of the remaining time studying.
   * We need to find out how many minutes she spent studying each day.

2. Convert the time in a day to minutes:
   * There are 24 hours in a day.
   * 24 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 1440 minutes in a day.

3. Calculate the time Mia spent watching TV:
   * Mia spent 1/5 of her ...
