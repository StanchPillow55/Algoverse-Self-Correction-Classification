=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( M \) be the size of Martha's bedroom in square feet.
   - Since Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, we can express Jenny's bedroom size as \( J = M + 60 \).

2. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - According to the problem, the total square footage of both bedrooms is 300 square feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   M + J = 300
   \]
   Substituting \( J \) with \( M + 60 \):
   \[
   M + (M + 60) = 300
   \]

3. **Combine Like Terms**:
   - Simplifying the equation gives:
   \[
   2M + 60 = 300
   \]

4. **Isolate the Variable**:
   - To isolate \( M \), first subtract 60 from both sides:
   \[
   2M = 300 - 60
   \]
   \[
   2M = 240
   \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   M = \frac{240}{2}
   \]
   \[
   M = 120
   \]

5. **Find Jenny's Bedroom Size**:
   - Now that we have \( M \), we can find Jenny's bedroom size:
   \[
   J = M + 60 = 120 + 60 = 180
   \]

6. **Verify the Total**:
   - To ensure our solution is correct, we can check the total:
   \[
   M + J = 120 + 180 = 300
   \]
   This confirms that our calculations are correct.

Thus, the size of Martha's bedroom is \( \boxed{120} \) square feet.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the size of Martha's bedroom given the total square footage of the two bedrooms and the difference in size between the two bedrooms.

Given information:
- The total square footage of the two bedrooms is 300 square feet.
- Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's bedroom.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the size of Martha's bedroom in square feet.
- Then, the size of Jenny's bedroom is (x + 6...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the size of Martha's bedroom in square feet. We know two things from the problem:

1. The total square footage of both bedrooms is 300 square feet.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's bedroom.

Let's use algebra to solve this problem step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( M \) represent the square footage of Martha's bedroom. Therefore, Jenny's bedroom, being 60 square feet larger, can be repre...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the square footage of Martha's bedroom as M and the square footage of Jenny's bedroom as J. 

From the problem, we know two things:

1) J + M = 300 (The total square footage of both bedrooms is 300 square feet)

2) J = M + 60 (Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for M:

(M + 60) + M = 300
2M + 60 = 300
2M = 300 - 60
2M = 240
M = 240 / 2
M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 squa...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The total square footage of the two bedrooms is 300 square feet.
   * Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's.

2. Let's define a variable for Martha's bedroom size:
   * Let x = the size of Martha's bedroom in square feet

3. Express Jenny's bedroom size in terms of Martha's:
   * Jenny's bedroom = Martha's bedroom + 60 square feet
   * Jenny's be...
