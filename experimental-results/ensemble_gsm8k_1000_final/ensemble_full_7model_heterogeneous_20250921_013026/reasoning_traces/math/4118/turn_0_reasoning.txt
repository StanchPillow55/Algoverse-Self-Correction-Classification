=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of servings Jessica will make.**
2. **Calculate the total number of apples needed for those servings.**
3. **Calculate the average number of apples each guest eats.**

### Step 1: Determine the total number of servings

Jessica plans to make 3 pies, and each pie contains 8 servings. Therefore, the total number of servings is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total servings} = \text{Number of pies} \times \text{Servings per pie}
\]
\[
\text{Total servings} = 3 \times 8 = 24
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of apples needed

Each serving requires 1.5 apples. To find the total number of apples needed for all the servings, we multiply the total number of servings by the number of apples per serving:

\[
\text{Total apples} = \text{Total servings} \times \text{Apples per serving}
\]
\[
\text{Total apples} = 24 \times 1.5
\]

Calculating this:

\[
24 \times 1.5 = 36
\]

So, Jessica needs a total of 36 apples to make the pies.

### Step 3: Calculate the average number of apples each guest eats

Jessica has 12 guests. To find out how many apples each guest eats on average, we divide the total number of apples by the number of guests:

\[
\text{Average apples per guest} = \frac{\text{Total apples}}{\text{Number of guests}}
\]
\[
\text{Average apples per guest} = \frac{36}{12}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\frac{36}{12} = 3
\]

### Final Answer

On average, each guest eats **3 apples**.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of apples used for the three pies and then divide it by the total number of guests to determine the average number of apples eaten per guest.

Given information:
- Each serving requires 1.5 apples.
- Jessica plans to make 3 pies, each with 8 servings.
- There are 12 guests.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings.
Total number of servings = Number of pies × Number of servings per pie
Tota...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many apples are used in total for the pies and then find out how many apples each guest eats on average.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Servings:**
   - Jessica plans to make 3 pies.
   - Each pie contains 8 servings.
   - Therefore, the total number of servings is:
     \[
     3 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ servings per pie} = 24 \text{ servings}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Total Number of...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how many apples Jessica needs for one pie. Since each serving requires 1.5 apples and each pie contains 8 servings, she needs 1.5 apples/serving * 8 servings/pie = 12 apples/pie.

Since she plans to make 3 pies, she will need 12 apples/pie * 3 pies = 36 apples in total.

If all her guests finish all the pie, and she has 12 guests, then on average, each guest will eat 36 apples / 12 guests = 3 apples/guest.

So, on average, each guest will eat 3 appl...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Each serving requires 1.5 apples.
   * Jessica has 12 guests.
   * She plans to make 3 pies.
   * Each pie contains 8 servings.

2. Calculate the total number of servings Jessica will make:
   * Total servings = Number of pies × Servings per pie
   * Total servings = 3 × 8
   * Total servings = 24

3. Calculate the total number of apples needed for all the pies...
