=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Jane earned for planting flower bulbs, we need to calculate the total number of bulbs she planted and then multiply that by the payment rate of $0.50 per bulb.

1. **Calculate the number of tulip bulbs:**
   Jane planted 20 tulip bulbs.

   \[
   \text{Tulip bulbs} = 20
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of iris bulbs:**
   Jane planted half the amount of iris bulbs compared to tulip bulbs. Therefore, the number of iris bulbs is:

   \[
   \text{Iris bulbs} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of daffodil bulbs:**
   Jane planted 30 daffodil bulbs.

   \[
   \text{Daffodil bulbs} = 30
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of crocus bulbs:**
   Jane planted three times the amount of crocus bulbs compared to daffodil bulbs. Therefore, the number of crocus bulbs is:

   \[
   \text{Crocus bulbs} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of bulbs planted:**
   Now we sum all the bulbs that Jane planted:

   \[
   \text{Total bulbs} = \text{Tulip bulbs} + \text{Iris bulbs} + \text{Daffodil bulbs} + \text{Crocus bulbs}
   \]

   Substituting the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Total bulbs} = 20 + 10 + 30 + 90 = 150
   \]

6. **Calculate Jane's earnings:**
   Jane earns $0.50 for each bulb she planted. Therefore, her total earnings can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Earnings} = \text{Total bulbs} \times \text{Payment per bulb}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Earnings} = 150 \times 0.50 = 75
   \]

Thus, Jane earned a total of **$75.00**.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's determine the total number of bulbs Jane planted.

We know that Jane planted 20 tulip bulbs. She also planted half that amount of iris bulbs, which is 20/2 = 10 iris bulbs.

Jane planted 30 daffodil bulbs and three times that amount of crocus bulbs, which is 30*3 = 90 crocus bulbs.

To find the total number of bulbs Jane planted, we add up the number of each type of bulb: 20 tulip bulbs + 10 iris bulbs + 30 daffodil bulbs + 90 crocus bulbs = 150 bulbs.
