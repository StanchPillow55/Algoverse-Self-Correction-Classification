=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables based on the information given.

Let:
- \( b \) = number of boys
- \( g \) = number of girls

From the problem, we know two key pieces of information:

1. The ratio of boys to girls is 3:5. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   \frac{b}{g} = \frac{3}{5}
   \]
   This implies that:
   \[
   5b = 3g \quad \text{(1)}
   \]

2. There are 4 more girls than boys, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   g = b + 4 \quad \text{(2)}
   \]

Now, we can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to find the values of \( b \) and \( g \).

Substituting \( g \) from equation (2) into equation (1):
\[
5b = 3(b + 4)
\]

Now, we will expand and simplify this equation:
\[
5b = 3b + 12
\]

Next, we will isolate \( b \) by subtracting \( 3b \) from both sides:
\[
5b - 3b = 12
\]
\[
2b = 12
\]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( b \):
\[
b = 6
\]

Now that we have the number of boys, we can find the number of girls using equation (2):
\[
g = b + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Now we have:
- Number of boys \( b = 6 \)
- Number of girls \( g = 10 \)

To find the total number of students in the classroom, we add the number of boys and girls:
\[
\text{Total students} = b + g = 6 + 10 = 16
\]

Finally, we can state our answer:
The total number of students in the classroom is \( \boxed{16} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of boys and girls in the classroom, and then add them together to get the total number of students.

Given information:
- The ratio of boys to girls in the classroom is 3:5.
- There are 4 more girls than boys.

Step 1: Let's represent the number of boys as x.
Since the ratio of boys to girls is 3:5, the number of girls can be represented as 5x/3.

Step 2: We know that there are 4 more girls than boys, ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of boys and girls in the classroom based on the given ratio and the additional information about the difference in their numbers.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( b \) be the number of boys in the classroom.
- Let \( g \) be the number of girls in the classroom.

According to the problem, the ratio of boys to girls is 3:5. This can be expressed as:
\[
\frac{b}{g} = \frac{3}{5}
\]

This implies:
\[
5b = 3g
\]

We are ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of boys as B and the number of girls as G. 

According to the problem, we know two things:

1) The ratio of boys to girls is 3:5. This means that B/G = 3/5.

2) There are 4 more girls than boys. This means that G = B + 4.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of B and G.

First, let's substitute the second equation into the first one:

B/(B + 4) = 3/5

To solve this equation, we can cross-multiply:

5B = 3(B + 4)

This...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to set up an equation and solve for the total number of students in the classroom.

Given:
- The ratio of boys to girls is 3:5.
- There are 4 more girls than boys.

Step 1: Let's express the number of girls in terms of the number of boys.
Number of girls = Number of boys + 4

Step 2: Use the ratio to express the number of girls in terms of the number of boys.
Ratio of boys ...
