=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of cats**: We start with 50 cats on the rock.

2. **Boats carrying away cats**: Four boats each carried away 5 cats. We need to calculate the total number of cats taken away by the boats.

   \[
   \text{Total cats taken away} = \text{Number of boats} \times \text{Cats per boat} = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

3. **Remaining cats after the boats**: We subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats.

   \[
   \text{Remaining cats} = \text{Initial cats} - \text{Total cats taken away} = 50 - 20 = 30
   \]

4. **Cats running after a mouse**: Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining cats ran after the mouse.

   \[
   \text{Cats running after the mouse} = \frac{3}{5} \times \text{Remaining cats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18
   \]

5. **Cats left on the rock**: Finally, we need to determine how many cats are left on the rock after some ran after the mouse. We subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats.

   \[
   \text{Cats left on the rock} = \text{Remaining cats} - \text{Cats running after the mouse} = 30 - 18 = 12
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\] 

This means there are 12 cats left on the rock after the boats took some away and some ran after the mouse.

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of cats**: We start with 50 cats on the rock.

2. **Boats carrying away cats**: Four boats each carried away 5 cats. We need to calculate the total number of cats taken away by the boats.

   \[
   \text{Total cats taken away} = \text{Number of boats} \times \text{Cats per boat} = 4 \times 5 = 20

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Initial number of cats on the rock:
   * 50 cats

2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each:
   * 4 boats x 5 cats per boat = 20 cats taken away
   * 50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats remaining on the rock

3. 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse:
   * 3/5 of 30 cats = (3/5) x 30 = 18 cats ran after the mouse
   * 30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats left on the rock

Therefore, the final number of cats left on t...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events described and perform calculations step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Cats:**
   - We start with 50 cats on the rock.

2. **Cats Carried Away by Boats:**
   - Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each.
   - To find out how many cats were carried away in total, we multiply the number of boats by the number of cats each boat carried:
     \[
     4 \text{ boats} \times 5 \text{ cats/boat} = 20 \text{ cat...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Step 1: Determine the number of cats taken by the boats

The problem states that four boats came and each boat carried away 5 cats. So, we multiply the number of boats by the number of cats each boat took:

4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

Step 2: Subtract the number of cats taken by the boats from the total number of cats

The problem states that there were initially 50 cats on the rock. We subtract the number of cats taken by the boats from the total number of cats to f...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
- Four boats carried away 5 cats each.
- Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cats carried away by the boats.
Cats carried away = Number of boats × Cats per boat
Cats carried away = 4 × 5 = 20 cats

Step 2: Calculate the number of cats remaining on the rock after the boats left.
Remaining cats after boats = I...
