=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many houses are on the street based on the information given about the clotheslines, clothing items, and the number of children and adults.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of clothing items

We know that:
- There are 11 children, and each child has 4 items of clothing.
- There are 20 adults, and each adult has 3 items of clothing.

First, we calculate the total number of clothing items for children:
\[
\text{Total clothing items from children} = 11 \text{ children} \times 4 \text{ items/child} = 44 \text{ items}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of clothing items for adults:
\[
\text{Total clothing items from adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 3 \text{ items/adult} = 60 \text{ items}
\]

Now, we can find the total number of clothing items on the clotheslines:
\[
\text{Total clothing items} = 44 \text{ items (children)} + 60 \text{ items (adults)} = 104 \text{ items}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the total capacity of the clotheslines

We know that:
- Each clothesline can hold 2 items of clothing.
- There are 2 clotheslines for every house.

Let \( h \) be the number of houses on the street. The total number of clotheslines is:
\[
\text{Total clotheslines} = 2 \times h
\]

The total capacity of all the clotheslines is:
\[
\text{Total capacity} = \text{Total clotheslines} \times \text{Capacity per clothesline} = (2 \times h) \times 2 = 4h
\]

### Step 3: Set up the equation

Since all the clotheslines are full, the total capacity of the clotheslines must equal the total number of clothing items:
\[
4h = 104
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( h \)

To find the number of houses, we solve the equation:
\[
h = \frac{104}{4} = 26
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of houses on the street is:
\[
\boxed{26}
\]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total number of items of clothing on the clotheslines. 

Each child has 4 items of clothing on the clotheslines, and there are 11 children, so the total number of items of clothing from the children is 4 * 11 = 44 items.

Each adult has 3 items of clothing on the clotheslines, and there are 20 adults, so the total number of items of clothing from the adults is 3 * 20 = 60 items.

So, the total number of items of clothing on the clotheslines is 4...
