Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many pieces of candy are in each bag.**
2. **Identify how many bags contain chocolate candy.**
3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of chocolate candy.**
4. **Subtract the number of chocolate pieces from the total to find the number of non-chocolate pieces.**

### Step 1: Determine how many pieces of candy are in each bag.

Jerry had a total of 63 pieces of candy, which he divided equally into 9 bags. To find out how many pieces of candy are in each bag, we perform the following calculation:

\[
\text{Pieces per bag} = \frac{\text{Total pieces of candy}}{\text{Number of bags}} = \frac{63}{9}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{63}{9} = 7
\]

So, each bag contains 7 pieces of candy.

### Step 2: Identify how many bags contain chocolate candy.

According to the problem:
- 2 bags contain chocolate hearts.
- 3 bags contain chocolate kisses.

Now, we can find the total number of bags that contain chocolate candy:

\[
\text{Total chocolate bags} = 2 + 3 = 5
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of pieces of chocolate candy.

Since each bag contains 7 pieces of candy, we can calculate the total number of pieces of chocolate candy in the 5 bags:

\[
\text{Total chocolate pieces} = \text{Number of chocolate bags} \times \text{Pieces per bag} = 5 \times 7
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
5 \times 7 = 35
\]

So, there are 35 pieces of chocolate candy.

### Step 4: Subtract the number of chocolate pieces from the total to find the number of non-chocolate pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of candy are not chocolate. We do this by subtracting the total number of chocolate pieces from the total number of pieces of candy:

\[
\text{Non-chocolate pieces} = \text{Total pieces of candy} - \text{Total chocolate pieces} = 63 - 35
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
63 - 35 = 28
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of pieces of candy that were not chocolate is:

\[
\boxed{28}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many pieces of candy are in each bag. Since Jerry divided 63 pieces of candy equally into 9 bags, we can do this by dividing 63 by 9. 

63 รท 9 = 7

So, each bag contains 7 pieces of candy.

Next, we need to find out how many bags contain chocolate. We know that 2 of the bags had chocolate hearts and 3 of the bags had chocolate kisses. 

2 + 3 = 5

So, 5 bags contain chocolate.

We know that the rest of the bags were not chocolate. Since ther...
