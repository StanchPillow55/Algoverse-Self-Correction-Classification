=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Tina makes in a week, we need to calculate her regular pay for the first 8 hours of each day and her overtime pay for the additional hours she works.

1. **Identify Tina's hourly wage**: 
   - Tina makes $18.00 per hour.

2. **Determine the number of hours worked per day**:
   - Tina works 10 hours each day.

3. **Calculate the regular and overtime hours**:
   - Regular hours per day: 8 hours
   - Overtime hours per day: 10 hours - 8 hours = 2 hours

4. **Calculate the overtime pay rate**:
   - Overtime pay is calculated as the hourly wage plus half of the hourly wage.
   - Half of Tina's hourly wage: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \)
   - Overtime pay rate: \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) dollars per hour

5. **Calculate daily earnings**:
   - Regular pay for the first 8 hours: 
     \[
     8 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ dollars/hour} = 144 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Overtime pay for the 2 hours:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours} \times 27 \text{ dollars/hour} = 54 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total daily earnings:
     \[
     144 \text{ dollars} + 54 \text{ dollars} = 198 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Calculate total earnings for the week**:
   - Tina works 5 days a week.
   - Total earnings for the week:
     \[
     198 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 990 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, after calculating all the components, Tina makes a total of **$990.00** for the week.

Final answer: **$990.00**

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tina's hourly wage is $18.00
- If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime
- Overtime pay is her hourly wage + 1/2 of her hourly wage
- Tina works 10 hours every day for 5 days

Step 1: Calculate the regular pay for the first 8 hours of each shift.
Regular pay = Hourly wage × Number of regular hours
Regular pay = $18.00 × 8 hours = $144.00 per day

Step 2: Calcu...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate Tina's earnings based on her regular and overtime hours. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Regular and Overtime Hours:**
   - Tina works 10 hours each day.
   - Regular hours per day are 8 hours.
   - Overtime hours per day = Total hours worked per day - Regular hours per day = 10 hours - 8 hours = 2 hours.

2. **Calculate Regular Pay:**
   - Regular hourly wage = $18.00.
   - Regular hours per day = 8 hours.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Tina's regular pay is $18.00 per hour. For each day, she works 10 hours, which means she works 2 hours of overtime each day.

First, let's calculate her regular pay for 8 hours of work per day for 5 days:

8 hours/day * $18.00/hour * 5 days = $720.00

Next, let's calculate her overtime pay. Overtime is paid at 1.5 times the regular hourly wage. So, her overtime wage is:

$18.00/hour * 1.5 = $27.00/hour

She works 2 hours of overtime per day for 5 days, so her overtime pay...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Tina's regular hourly wage is $18.00.
   * If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime.
   * Overtime pay is calculated as her regular hourly wage + 1/2 of her regular hourly wage.
