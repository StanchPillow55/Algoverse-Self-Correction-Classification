=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of both Juanico and Gladys, and then calculate Juanico's age 30 years from now.

1. **Determine Gladys's current age**:
   We know that Gladys will be 40 years old ten years from now. Therefore, we can calculate her current age by subtracting 10 years from 40 years:
   \[
   \text{Gladys's current age} = 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **Determine Juanico's current age**:
   The problem states that Juanico is 4 years less than half the age of Gladys. First, we need to find half of Gladys's current age:
   \[
   \text{Half of Gladys's age} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ years}
   \]
   Now, we subtract 4 years from this value to find Juanico's current age:
   \[
   \text{Juanico's current age} = 15 - 4 = 11 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Calculate Juanico's age 30 years from now**:
   To find Juanico's age in 30 years, we simply add 30 years to his current age:
   \[
   \text{Juanico's age in 30 years} = 11 + 30 = 41 \text{ years old}
   \]

Thus, after working through the problem step by step, we find that Juanico's age 30 years from now will be:

\[
\boxed{41}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Juanico is 4 years less than half the age of Gladys.
- Gladys will be 40 years old ten years from now.

Step 1: Find Gladys' current age.
Gladys' age 10 years from now = 40 years
Gladys' current age = 40 - 10 = 30 years

Step 2: Find half of Gladys' current age.
Half of Gladys' current age = 30 / 2 = 15 years

Step 3: Find Juanico's current age.
Juanico's age = Half of Gladys' current age...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Juanico and Gladys, and then calculate Juanico's age 30 years from now.

### Step 1: Determine Gladys's Current Age

We know that Gladys will be 40 years old ten years from now. To find her current age, we subtract 10 years from her age in the future:

\[
\text{Gladys's current age} = 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ years old}
\]

### Step 2: Determine Juanico's Current Age

The problem states that Juanico is 4 years le...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by finding out Gladys's current age. If Gladys will be 40 years old ten years from now, that means she is currently 40 - 10 = 30 years old.

Juanico is 4 years less than half the age of Gladys. Half of Gladys's age is 30 / 2 = 15 years.

So, Juanico is 15 - 4 = 11 years old.

30 years from now, Juanico will be 11 + 30 = 41 years old.

So, Juanico's age 30 years from now will be 41 years old.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Juanico is 4 years less than half the age of Gladys.
   * Gladys will be 40 years old ten years from now.
   * We need to find Juanico's age 30 years from now.

2. Calculate Gladys' current age:
   * Gladys' age 10 years from now = 40 years
   * Gladys' current age = 40 - 10 = 30 years

3. Express Juanico's current age in terms of Gladys' current age:
   * Juanic...
