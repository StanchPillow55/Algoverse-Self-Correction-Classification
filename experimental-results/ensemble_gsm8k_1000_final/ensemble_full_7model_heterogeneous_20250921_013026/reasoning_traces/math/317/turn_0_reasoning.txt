=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many hours Madeline has left over in a week, we first need to calculate the total number of hours she spends on various activities and then subtract that from the total hours available in a week.

1. **Calculate the total hours in a week:**
   \[
   \text{Total hours in a week} = 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 168 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total hours spent in class:**
   Madeline spends 18 hours a week in class.

3. **Calculate the total hours spent on homework:**
   She spends 4 hours per day on homework. Therefore, over 7 days:
   \[
   \text{Total homework hours} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total hours spent sleeping:**
   Madeline sleeps 8 hours per day. Therefore, over 7 days:
   \[
   \text{Total sleep hours} = 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 56 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total hours spent working part-time:**
   Madeline works part-time for 20 hours a week.

6. **Calculate the total hours spent on all activities:**
   Now, we add up all the hours spent on class, homework, sleep, and work:
   \[
   \text{Total hours spent} = \text{Class hours} + \text{Homework hours} + \text{Sleep hours} + \text{Work hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total hours spent} = 18 \text{ hours} + 28 \text{ hours} + 56 \text{ hours} + 20 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total hours spent} = 122 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

7. **Calculate the hours left over:**
   To find the hours left over, we subtract the total hours spent from the total hours in a week:
   \[
   \text{Hours left over} = \text{Total hours in a week} - \text{Total hours spent}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Hours left over} = 168 \text{ hours} - 122 \text{ hours} = 46 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Madeline has **46 hours left over** in her week.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of hours Madeline spends on different activities and then subtract it from the total number of hours in a week to find the remaining hours.

Given information:
- Madeline spends 18 hours a week in class.
- She spends 4 hours per day working on homework.
- She spends 8 hours per day sleeping.
- She works part-time 20 hours per week.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how many hours Madeline has left over in a week, we need to account for all the activities she spends time on and subtract these from the total number of hours available in a week.

1. **Calculate the total number of hours in a week:**

   There are 24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week. Therefore, the total number of hours in a week is:
   \[
   24 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 168 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total hours s...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how many hours Madeline spends on homework per week. Since she spends 4 hours per day on homework, and there are 7 days in a week, she spends 4 * 7 = 28 hours per week on homework.

Next, let's calculate how many hours Madeline spends sleeping per week. Since she spends 8 hours per day sleeping, and there are 7 days in a week, she spends 8 * 7 = 56 hours per week sleeping.

Now, let's add up all the hours Madeline spends on class, homework, sleeping...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given information:
- Madeline spends 18 hours a week in class.
- She spends 4 hours per day working on homework.
- She spends 8 hours per day sleeping.
- She works part-time 20 hours per week.

Step 1: Calculate the total hours Madeline spends on homework per week.
Homework hours per week = Hours per day × 7 days
Homework hours per week = 4 × 7 = 28 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total hours ...
