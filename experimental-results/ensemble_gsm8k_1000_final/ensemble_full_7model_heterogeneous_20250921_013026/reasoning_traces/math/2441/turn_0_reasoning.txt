=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of blue fish**:
   - We know that there are 30 fish in total in the tank.
   - According to the problem, one third of these fish are blue.
   - To find the number of blue fish, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of blue fish} = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 = 10
     \]

2. **Determine the number of spotted blue fish**:
   - The problem states that half of the blue fish have spots.
   - We already calculated that there are 10 blue fish.
   - To find the number of spotted blue fish, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of spotted blue fish} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5
     \]

3. **Final answer**:
   - The number of fish in the tank that are blue and have spots is 5.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 30 fish in the tank.
- One third of the fish are blue.
- Half of the blue fish have spots.

Step 1: Calculate the number of blue fish.
One third of 30 fish = 30 ÷ 3 = 10 blue fish

Step 2: Calculate the number of blue fish with spots.
Half of the 10 blue fish have spots = 10 ÷ 2 = 5 blue fish with spots

Therefore, the final answer is:
There are 5 blue, spotted fish in the tank.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine how many fish in the tank are blue and have spots.

1. **Determine the number of blue fish:**
   - We are told that one third of the fish in the tank are blue.
   - There are 30 fish in total.
   - To find the number of blue fish, we calculate one third of 30:
     \[
     \text{Number of blue fish} = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 = 10
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 10 blue fish in the tank.

2. **Determine the number of blue fish wi...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many fish are blue. Since one third of the fish are blue, we can calculate this by dividing the total number of fish by 3. 

30 ÷ 3 = 10

So, there are 10 blue fish in the tank.

Next, we need to find out how many of these blue fish have spots. Since half of the blue fish have spots, we can calculate this by dividing the number of blue fish by 2.

10 ÷ 2 = 5

So, there are 5 blue, spotted fish in the tank.

Therefore, the final answer is tha...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to calculate the number of blue, spotted fish in the tank.

Given:
- There are 30 fish in the tank.
- One third of the fish are blue.
- Half of the blue fish have spots.

Step 1: Calculate the number of blue fish in the tank.
One third of the fish are blue, so we need to find one third of 30.

One third of 30 = 30 ÷ 3 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 blue fish in the tank.
