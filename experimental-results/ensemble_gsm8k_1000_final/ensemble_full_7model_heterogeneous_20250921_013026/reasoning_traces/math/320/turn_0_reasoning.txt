Final Answer: To find out how much Austin started with, we need to calculate the total cost of the robots, including tax, and then add the change he received back.

1. **Calculate the cost of the robots:**
   Austin bought 7 robots, and each robot costs $8.75. We can calculate the total cost of the robots as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total cost of robots} = \text{Number of robots} \times \text{Cost per robot}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of robots} = 7 \times 8.75
   \]

   Now, performing the multiplication:

   \[
   7 \times 8.75 = 61.25
   \]

   So, the total cost of the robots is **$61.25**.

2. **Add the tax to the total cost:**
   Austin was charged $7.22 for tax. We need to add this tax to the total cost of the robots to find the total amount Austin spent.

   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of robots} + \text{Tax}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = 61.25 + 7.22
   \]

   Now, performing the addition:

   \[
   61.25 + 7.22 = 68.47
   \]

   So, the total amount Austin spent is **$68.47**.

3. **Calculate how much Austin started with:**
   We know that after making the purchase, Austin received $11.53 in change. To find out how much he started with, we can add the total amount spent to the change he received.

   \[
   \text{Amount started with} = \text{Total amount spent} + \text{Change}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount started with} = 68.47 + 11.53
   \]

   Now, performing the addition:

   \[
   68.47 + 11.53 = 80.00
   \]

   Therefore, the amount Austin started with is **$80.00**.

**Final Answer:**
Austin started with **$80.00**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the robots and the tax, and then add the change Austin received to find the amount he started with.

Given information:
- Austin bought 7 robots.
- Each robot costs $8.75.
- The total tax charged was $7.22.
- Austin left with $11.53 in change.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the robots.
Cost of each robot × Number of robots = Total cost of robots
$8.75 × 7 = $61.25

Step 2: Calculate the to...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how much money Austin started with, we need to calculate the total cost of the robots, add the tax, and then account for the change he received. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the robots:**
   - Austin bought a robot for each of his seven friends, and each robot costs $8.75.
   - To find the total cost of the robots, multiply the number of robots by the cost per robot:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of robots} = 7...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total cost of the robots. Since each robot costs $8.75 and Austin bought seven robots, we multiply 8.75 by 7. 

8.75 * 7 = $61.25

Next, we need to add the tax to the total cost of the robots. The tax was $7.22, so we add this to $61.25.

61.25 + 7.22 = $68.47

This is the total amount Austin spent. But we know he left with $11.53 in change. So, to find out how much money Austin started with, we need to add this change to the total amount h...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Austin bought 7 robots for his friends.
   * Each robot costs $8.75.
   * The total tax charged was $7.22.
   * Austin received $11.53 in change.

2. Calculate the total cost of the robots before tax:
   * Cost per robot = $8.75
   * Number of robots = 7
   * Total cost of robots = $8.75 × 7
   * Total cost of robots = $61.25

3. Calculate the total cost including tax:...
