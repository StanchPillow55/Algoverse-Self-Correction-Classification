=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total storage space available in the warehouse and then calculate how much of that space is still available after placing the boxes on the second floor.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let:
- \( S_2 \) = the area of the second floor in square feet.
- \( S_1 \) = the area of the first floor in square feet.

According to the problem, the first floor contains twice as much floor space as the second floor:
\[
S_1 = 2S_2
\]

### Step 2: Total Storage Space
The total storage space in the warehouse is the sum of the areas of both floors:
\[
\text{Total Storage Space} = S_1 + S_2 = 2S_2 + S_2 = 3S_2
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Area of the Second Floor
We know that the boxes filled one-quarter of the second floor's storage space and that they occupy 5,000 square feet:
\[
\frac{1}{4} S_2 = 5000 \text{ square feet}
\]

To find \( S_2 \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
S_2 = 5000 \times 4 = 20000 \text{ square feet}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Area of the First Floor
Using the relationship \( S_1 = 2S_2 \):
\[
S_1 = 2 \times 20000 = 40000 \text{ square feet}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Total Storage Space
Now we can find the total storage space in the warehouse:
\[
\text{Total Storage Space} = S_1 + S_2 = 40000 + 20000 = 60000 \text{ square feet}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate Remaining Storage Space
The boxes occupy 5,000 square feet, so we need to subtract this from the total storage space to find the remaining available space:
\[
\text{Remaining Storage Space} = \text{Total Storage Space} - \text{Space Occupied by Boxes}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining Storage Space} = 60000 - 5000 = 55000 \text{ square feet}
\]

### Final Answer
The amount of storage space still available in the building is:
\[
\boxed{55000} \text{ square feet}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out the total amount of storage space on the second floor. If 5,000 square feet filled one-quarter of the second floor, then the total storage space on the second floor is 4 times that amount. 

5,000 sq ft * 4 = 20,000 sq ft

So, the total storage space on the second floor is 20,000 square feet. 

Now, we know that the first floor has twice as much storage space as the second floor. So, the total storage space on the first floor is:

20,000 sq ft ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The first floor has twice as much storage space as the second floor.
   * The boxes filled one-quarter (1/4) of the second floor storage space.
   * The boxes used up 5,000 square feet of storage space.

2. Find the total storage space on the second floor:
   * If the boxes used 1/4 of the second floor and took up 5,000 square feet, then the total storage space o...
