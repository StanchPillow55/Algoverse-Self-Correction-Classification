=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack all 95 muffins, given that each box can hold 5 muffins. We also need to consider how many boxes are already available.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of boxes needed

First, we need to find out how many boxes are required to pack all 95 muffins. Since each box can hold 5 muffins, we can calculate the number of boxes needed by dividing the total number of muffins by the number of muffins per box.

\[
\text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{\text{Total muffins}}{\text{Muffins per box}} = \frac{95}{5}
\]

Now, performing the division:

\[
\frac{95}{5} = 19
\]

So, **19 boxes** are needed to pack all 95 muffins.

### Step 2: Determine how many boxes are still needed

Next, we need to find out how many more boxes are needed given that there are already 10 boxes available.

To find this, we subtract the number of available boxes from the total number of boxes needed:

\[
\text{Boxes still needed} = \text{Total boxes needed} - \text{Available boxes} = 19 - 10
\]

Now, performing the subtraction:

\[
19 - 10 = 9
\]

### Final Answer

Therefore, the bakery still needs **9 more boxes** to pack all the muffins.

Thus, the final answer is:

**9 boxes**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The bakery made 95 muffins.
- Each box can hold 5 muffins.
- There are only 10 available boxes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of muffins that can be packed in the 10 available boxes.
Number of muffins per box × Number of available boxes = Total muffins that can be packed
5 muffins per box × 10 boxes = 50 muffins

Step 2: Calculate the number of muffins that are still left to be packed.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack all 95 muffins, given that each box can hold 5 muffins, and then compare this to the number of boxes currently available.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of boxes needed.**

Each box holds 5 muffins. Therefore, to find out how many boxes are needed to pack all 95 muffins, we divide the total number of muffins by the number of muffins per box:

\[
\text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{95...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many muffins can be packed in the 10 available boxes. Since each box can hold 5 muffins, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of muffins each box can hold. 

10 boxes * 5 muffins/box = 50 muffins

This means that 50 muffins can be packed in the 10 available boxes.

Next, we need to determine how many muffins are left after packing 50 muffins. We do this by subtracting the number of muffins that can be packed from the total number o...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The bakery made 95 muffins in total.
   * Each box will contain 5 muffins.
   * There are only 10 boxes available.

2. Calculate the total number of boxes needed to pack all the muffins:
   * Total muffins = 95
   * Muffins per box = 5
   * Number of boxes needed = Total muffins ÷ Muffins per box
   * Number of boxes needed = 95 ÷ 5 = 19
   
   So, the bakery nee...
