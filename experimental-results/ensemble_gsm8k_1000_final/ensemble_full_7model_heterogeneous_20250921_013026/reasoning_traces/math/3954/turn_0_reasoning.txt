=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many building blocks Jesse started with, we need to consider the total number of blocks he used for his constructions and the number of blocks he has left.

1. **Calculate the total number of blocks used:**
   - Jesse built a building with 80 blocks.
   - He built a farmhouse with 123 blocks.
   - He added a fenced-in area with 57 blocks.

   We can find the total number of blocks used by adding these amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total blocks used} = 80 + 123 + 57
   \]

   Let's perform the addition step by step:

   - First, add 80 and 123:
     \[
     80 + 123 = 203
     \]

   - Now, add 57 to the result:
     \[
     203 + 57 = 260
     \]

   Therefore, the total number of blocks used is **260 blocks**.

2. **Add the blocks left to the total used:**
   Jesse has 84 blocks left after building. To find out how many blocks he started with, we need to add the blocks he used to the blocks he has left:

   \[
   \text{Total blocks started with} = \text{Total blocks used} + \text{Blocks left}
   \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   \text{Total blocks started with} = 260 + 84
   \]

   Now, perform the addition:

   \[
   260 + 84 = 344
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of building blocks Jesse started with is **344 blocks**.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{344}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of building blocks Jesse used and then add the remaining blocks to get the initial number of building blocks he started with.

Given information:
- Jesse built a building with 80 building blocks.
- Jesse built a farmhouse with 123 building blocks.
- Jesse built a fenced-in area with 57 building blocks.
- Jesse has 84 building blocks left.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of building blocks Jesse started with. We know the following:

1. Jesse builds a building using 80 building blocks.
2. Jesse builds a farmhouse using 123 building blocks.
3. Jesse builds a fenced-in area using 57 building blocks.
4. After building these structures, Jesse has 84 building blocks left.

Let's denote the total number of building blocks Jesse started with as \( x \).

First, we calculate the total n...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To find out how many building blocks Jesse started with, we need to add up all the building blocks he used and the ones he has left.

First, let's add up the building blocks he used:
He used 80 building blocks for the building, 123 for the farmhouse, and 57 for the fenced-in area. 

80 (for the building) + 123 (for the farmhouse) + 57 (for the fenced-in area) = 260 building blocks used.

Now, we know that he has 84 building blocks left. To find out how many he started wit...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. To find out how many building blocks Jesse started with, we need to add up all the building blocks he used and the ones he has left.

Given:
- Jesse built a building with 80 building blocks.
- He then built a farmhouse with 123 building blocks.
- He added a fenced-in area next to the farm made of 57 building blocks.
- Jesse has 84 building blocks left.
