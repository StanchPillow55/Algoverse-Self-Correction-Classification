=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately, and then add those amounts together.

1. **Calculate the cost of the notebooks:**
   - William bought 5 notebooks.
   - The price of each notebook is $1.50.
   - To find the total cost of the notebooks, we multiply the number of notebooks by the price per notebook:

   \[
   \text{Total cost of notebooks} = \text{Number of notebooks} \times \text{Price per notebook}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of notebooks} = 5 \times 1.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of notebooks} = 7.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the ballpen:**
   - William bought 1 ballpen.
   - The price of each ballpen is $0.50.
   - To find the total cost of the ballpen, we multiply the number of ballpens by the price per ballpen:

   \[
   \text{Total cost of ballpen} = \text{Number of ballpens} \times \text{Price per ballpen}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of ballpen} = 1 \times 0.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of ballpen} = 0.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Now, we add the total cost of the notebooks and the total cost of the ballpen together:

   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of notebooks} + \text{Total cost of ballpen}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = 7.50 + 0.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = 8.00
   \]

Thus, William spent a total of **$8.00**. 

Final answer: **$8.00**

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Notebooks cost $1.50 each
- Ballpens cost $0.50 each
- William bought 5 notebooks and 1 ballpen

To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the ballpen, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the notebooks.
Cost of 5 notebooks = 5 Ã— $1.50 = $7.50

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the ballpen.
Cost of 1 ballpen = $0.50

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items William purchased from the educational shop. We know the prices of the items and the quantities William bought, so we can use basic arithmetic to find the total cost.

1. **Identify the prices and quantities:**
   - Price of one notebook = $1.50
   - Price of one ballpen = $0.50
   - Quantity of notebooks bought = 5
   - Quantity of ballpens bought = 1

2. **Calculate the total cost for the notebooks...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the notebooks. Each notebook costs $1.50 and William bought 5 notebooks. So, the total cost of the notebooks is:

1.50 (cost per notebook) * 5 (number of notebooks) = $7.50

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ballpen. The ballpen costs $0.5. So, the total cost of the ballpen is:

0.5 (cost per ballp...
