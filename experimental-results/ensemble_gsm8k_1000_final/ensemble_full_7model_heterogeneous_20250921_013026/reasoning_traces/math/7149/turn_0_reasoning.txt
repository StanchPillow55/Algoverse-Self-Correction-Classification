=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much Hillary spends on the newspaper over 8 weeks, we need to calculate her weekly spending and then multiply that by the number of weeks.

1. **Calculate the cost of the newspaper for one week:**
   - Hillary buys the Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday editions of the newspaper for $0.50 each.
   - The cost for these three days is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Wednesday} + \text{Cost for Thursday} + \text{Cost for Friday} = 0.50 + 0.50 + 0.50 = 1.50
     \]
   - On Sunday, she spends $2.00 for that edition.
   - Therefore, the total cost for one week is:
     \[
     \text{Total weekly cost} = \text{Cost for weekdays} + \text{Cost for Sunday} = 1.50 + 2.00 = 3.50
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost over 8 weeks:**
   - Now that we know she spends $3.50 each week, we can find out how much she spends over 8 weeks:
     \[
     \text{Total cost over 8 weeks} = \text{Weekly cost} \times \text{Number of weeks} = 3.50 \times 8
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     3.50 \times 8 = 28.00
     \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total amount Hillary spends on the newspaper over 8 weeks is:
     \[
     \boxed{28.00}
     \]

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the newspapers Hillary buys over an 8-week period. We will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the weekly cost for the newspapers

1. **Cost of Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday editions:**
   - Each edition costs $0.50.
   - There are 3 editions (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).
   - Total cost for these editions per week:

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Hillary buys the newspaper on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, which means she buys 3 newspapers a week at $0.50 each. So, the total cost of newspapers from Wednesday to Friday is 3 * $0.50 = $1.50.

On Sunday, she spends $2.00 on the newspaper. 

Therefore, the total amount she spends on newspapers in a week is $1.50 (Wednesday to Friday) + $2.00 (Sunday) = $3.50.

Over 8 weeks, she would spend 8 * $3.50 = $28.00.

So, Hillary spends $28.00 on newspapers over 8 weeks.
