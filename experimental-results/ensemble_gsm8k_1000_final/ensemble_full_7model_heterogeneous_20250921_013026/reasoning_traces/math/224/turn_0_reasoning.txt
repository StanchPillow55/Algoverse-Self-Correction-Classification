=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of the five scrolls based on the information provided. 

1. **Identify the age of the first scroll**: 
   The first scroll is given to be 4080 years old.

2. **Determine the age of the second scroll**: 
   The second scroll is older than the first scroll by half as many years as the first scroll's age. 
   - Half of the first scroll's age: 
     \[
     \text{Half of 4080} = \frac{4080}{2} = 2040
     \]
   - Therefore, the age of the second scroll is:
     \[
     \text{Age of second scroll} = 4080 + 2040 = 6120
     \]

3. **Determine the age of the third scroll**: 
   The third scroll is older than the second scroll by half as many years as the second scroll's age.
   - Half of the second scroll's age:
     \[
     \text{Half of 6120} = \frac{6120}{2} = 3060
     \]
   - Therefore, the age of the third scroll is:
     \[
     \text{Age of third scroll} = 6120 + 3060 = 9180
     \]

4. **Determine the age of the fourth scroll**: 
   The fourth scroll is older than the third scroll by half as many years as the third scroll's age.
   - Half of the third scroll's age:
     \[
     \text{Half of 9180} = \frac{9180}{2} = 4590
     \]
   - Therefore, the age of the fourth scroll is:
     \[
     \text{Age of fourth scroll} = 9180 + 4590 = 13770
     \]

5. **Determine the age of the fifth scroll**: 
   The fifth scroll is older than the fourth scroll by half as many years as the fourth scroll's age.
   - Half of the fourth scroll's age:
     \[
     \text{Half of 13770} = \frac{13770}{2} = 6885
     \]
   - Therefore, the age of the fifth scroll is:
     \[
     \text{Age of fifth scroll} = 13770 + 6885 = 20655
     \]

Now that we have calculated the ages of all five scrolls, we can summarize:

- Age of the first scroll: 4080 years
- Age of the second scroll: 6120 years
- Age of the third scroll: 9180 years
- Age of the fourth scroll: 13770 years
- Age of the fifth scroll: 20655 years

Thus, the age of the fifth scroll is:

\[
\boxed{20655}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the age of each scroll based on the given information.

Given information:
- The first scroll is 4080 years old.
- Each scroll is older than the last by half as many years as the last scroll's age.

Step 1: Find the age of the second scroll.
Age of the second scroll = Age of the first scroll + (1/2 × Age of the first scroll)
Age of the second scroll = 4080 + (1/2 × 4080)
Age of the second scroll = 4080 + 2040
Age...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of each scroll based on the information given and find the age of the fifth scroll.

Let's denote the age of the scrolls as follows:
- \( S_1 \) is the age of the first scroll,
- \( S_2 \) is the age of the second scroll,
- \( S_3 \) is the age of the third scroll,
- \( S_4 \) is the age of the fourth scroll,
- \( S_5 \) is the age of the fifth scroll.

We know from the problem:
- \( S_1 = 4080 \) years.

The problem st...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that the first scroll is 4080 years old.

The problem states that each scroll is older than the last by half as many years as the last scroll’s age. 

So, the second scroll would be 4080 years + (1/2 * 4080 years) = 4080 years + 2040 years = 6120 years old.

The third scroll would be 6120 years + (1/2 * 6120 years) = 6120 years + 3060 years = 9180 years old.

The fourth scroll would be 9180 years + (1/2 * 9180 years) = 9180 ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find the age of the fifth scroll, given the age of the first scroll and the pattern of age differences between the scrolls.

Given:
- The first scroll is 4080 years old.
- Each scroll is older than the last by half as many years as the last scroll's age.

Step 1: Let's find the age difference between the first and second scrolls.
Age difference = 1/2 × Age of the first scroll
Age difference = 1...
