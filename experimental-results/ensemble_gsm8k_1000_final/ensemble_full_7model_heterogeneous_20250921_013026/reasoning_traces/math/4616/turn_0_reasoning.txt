=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many sacks of strawberries Antoine needs to supply all the bakeries in 4 weeks, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of sacks needed per week.**
   - First bakery needs: 2 sacks
   - Second bakery needs: 4 sacks
   - Third bakery needs: 12 sacks

   We will add these amounts together to find the total number of sacks needed per week:

   \[
   \text{Total sacks per week} = 2 + 4 + 12
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   2 + 4 = 6
   \]
   \[
   6 + 12 = 18
   \]

   So, the total number of sacks needed per week is **18 sacks**.

2. **Calculate the total number of sacks needed for 4 weeks.**
   Now that we know the total number of sacks needed per week, we will multiply this by the number of weeks (4 weeks):

   \[
   \text{Total sacks for 4 weeks} = \text{Total sacks per week} \times 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total sacks for 4 weeks} = 18 \times 4
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   18 \times 4 = 72
   \]

3. **Final answer.**
   Therefore, the total number of sacks of strawberries Antoine needs to supply all the bakeries in 4 weeks is **72 sacks**.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{72}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The total number of sacks of strawberries needed by the bakeries per week is the sum of the sacks needed by each bakery. 

So, we add the sacks needed by the first bakery (2 sacks), the second bakery (4 sacks), and the third bakery (12 sacks):

2 sacks + 4 sacks + 12 sacks = 18 sacks

This is the total number of sacks needed per week. 

However, we need to find out how many sacks are needed for 4 weeks. 

To do this, we multiply the total number of sacks needed per week b...
