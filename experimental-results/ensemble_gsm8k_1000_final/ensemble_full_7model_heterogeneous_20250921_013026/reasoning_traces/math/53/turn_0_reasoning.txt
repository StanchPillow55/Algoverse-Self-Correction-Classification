=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much more Caleb spent on ice cream than on frozen yoghurt, we will first calculate the total cost for each type of product and then find the difference between the two amounts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of ice cream.**

Caleb bought 10 cartons of ice cream, and each carton costs $4. 

To find the total cost of the ice cream, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

\[
\text{Total cost of ice cream} = \text{Number of cartons} \times \text{Cost per carton}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of ice cream} = 10 \times 4 = 40
\]

So, Caleb spent $40 on ice cream.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of frozen yoghurt.**

Caleb bought 4 cartons of frozen yoghurt, and each carton costs $1.

To find the total cost of the frozen yoghurt, we perform a similar calculation:

\[
\text{Total cost of frozen yoghurt} = \text{Number of cartons} \times \text{Cost per carton}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of frozen yoghurt} = 4 \times 1 = 4
\]

So, Caleb spent $4 on frozen yoghurt.

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in spending between ice cream and frozen yoghurt.**

Now, we need to find out how much more Caleb spent on ice cream than on frozen yoghurt. We do this by subtracting the total cost of frozen yoghurt from the total cost of ice cream:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total cost of ice cream} - \text{Total cost of frozen yoghurt}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 40 - 4 = 36
\]

**Final Answer:**

Caleb spent $36 more on ice cream than on frozen yoghurt.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Caleb bought 10 cartons of ice cream
- Each carton of ice cream costs $4
- Caleb bought 4 cartons of frozen yoghurt
- Each carton of frozen yoghurt costs $1

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the ice cream.
Total cost of ice cream = Number of cartons × Cost per carton
Total cost of ice cream = 10 × $4 = $40

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the frozen yoghurt.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total cost of the ice cream and the frozen yoghurt separately.

The cost of the ice cream is calculated by multiplying the number of cartons by the cost per carton. So, 10 cartons of ice cream at $4 each gives a total cost of 10 * $4 = $40.

Similarly, the cost of the frozen yoghurt is calculated by multiplying the number of cartons by the cost per carton. So, 4 cartons of frozen yoghurt at $1 each gives a total cost of 4 * $1 = $4.
