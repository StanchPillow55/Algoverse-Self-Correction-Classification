=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Pete and Raymond spent altogether in cents.

**Step 1: Determine how much Pete spent.**

Pete received $2.50 from his grandmother. We need to convert this amount into cents:
\[
2.50 \text{ dollars} = 2.50 \times 100 = 250 \text{ cents}
\]

Pete spends 4 nickels. We know that each nickel is worth 5 cents. Therefore, the total amount Pete spent can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Total spent by Pete} = 4 \text{ nickels} \times 5 \text{ cents/nickel} = 20 \text{ cents}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how much Raymond spent.**

Raymond also received $2.50, which is 250 cents. He spends some of his money at the arcade but has 7 dimes left. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so the total amount of money Raymond has left can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Total left for Raymond} = 7 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 70 \text{ cents}
\]

To find out how much Raymond spent, we subtract the amount he has left from the total amount he received:
\[
\text{Total spent by Raymond} = \text{Total received} - \text{Total left} = 250 \text{ cents} - 70 \text{ cents} = 180 \text{ cents}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent by both Pete and Raymond.**

Now, we can find the total amount spent by both:
\[
\text{Total spent by both} = \text{Total spent by Pete} + \text{Total spent by Raymond} = 20 \text{ cents} + 180 \text{ cents} = 200 \text{ cents}
\]

**Final Answer:**
The total amount that Pete and Raymond spent altogether is:
\[
\boxed{200} \text{ cents}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Pete and Raymond each receive $2.50 from their grandmother.
- Pete saves his money and only spends 4 nickels.
- Raymond spends his money at the arcade games but still has 7 dimes left.

Step 1: Calculate how much money Pete spent.
Pete spent 4 nickels, which is 4 × $0.05 = $0.20.

Step 2: Calculate how much money Raymond spent.
Raymond had $2.50 initially, and he has 7 dimes ($0.7...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Pete and Raymond each spent, and then add those amounts together to find the total amount spent.

### Step 1: Determine Pete's Spending

1. **Initial Amount**: Pete receives $2.50 from his grandmother.
2. **Convert to Cents**: Since $1 is 100 cents, $2.50 is equivalent to 250 cents.
3. **Spending**: Pete spends 4 nickels.
   - A nickel is worth 5 cents.
   - Therefore, 4 nickels are worth \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cent...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's convert the amount of money Pete and Raymond received from their grandmother from dollars to cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, $2.50 is equal to 250 cents. 

Pete spent 4 nickels. A nickel is worth 5 cents, so 4 nickels are worth 4*5 = 20 cents. 

To find out how much Pete spent, we subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he received. So, Pete spent 250 - 20 = 230 cents.

Raymond has 7 dimes left. A dime is worth 10 cents, so 7 dimes are...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Pete and Raymond each receive $2.50 from their grandmother.
- Pete spends 4 nickels.
- Raymond spends some money at the arcade games but still has 7 dimes left.

Step 1: Calculate how much money Pete spent.
- 1 nickel = 5 cents
- Pete spent 4 nickels
So, Pete spent: 4 × 5 cents = 20 cents

Step 2: Calculate how much money Raymond spent.
- Raymond initially had $2.50, which is equal to 250 ...
