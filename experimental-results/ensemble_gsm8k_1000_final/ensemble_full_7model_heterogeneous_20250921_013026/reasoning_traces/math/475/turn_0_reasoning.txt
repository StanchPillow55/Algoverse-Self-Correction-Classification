=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many apples Layla picked, we can start by using the information given about the average number of apples picked by the three girls: Maggie, Kelsey, and Layla.

1. **Understanding the average**: The average number of apples picked by the three girls is given as 30. The formula for the average is:

   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Number of girls}}
   \]

   In this case, the number of girls is 3.

2. **Calculating the total number of apples**: Since the average is 30, we can set up the equation:

   \[
   30 = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{3}
   \]

   To find the total number of apples, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

   \[
   \text{Total number of apples} = 30 \times 3 = 90
   \]

3. **Finding the total apples picked by Maggie and Kelsey**: We know that Maggie picked 40 apples and Kelsey picked 28 apples. We can calculate the total number of apples they picked together:

   \[
   \text{Total picked by Maggie and Kelsey} = 40 + 28 = 68
   \]

4. **Calculating how many apples Layla picked**: Now that we know the total number of apples picked by all three girls is 90, we can find out how many apples Layla picked by subtracting the total picked by Maggie and Kelsey from the total:

   \[
   \text{Apples picked by Layla} = \text{Total number of apples} - \text{Total picked by Maggie and Kelsey}
   \]

   Substituting the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Apples picked by Layla} = 90 - 68 = 22
   \]

5. **Final answer**: Therefore, Layla picked 22 apples.

\[
\boxed{22}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Maggie picked 40 apples.
- Kelsey picked 28 apples.
- Layla picked some apples.
- The three averaged 30 apples picked.

To find the number of apples Layla picked, we need to set up an equation based on the given information.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of apples picked by the three.
Total apples picked = Average apples picked × Number of people
Total apples picked = 30 × 3 = 90 apples
...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many apples Layla picked given that the average number of apples picked by Maggie, Kelsey, and Layla is 30.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understand the Average Formula:**
   The average of a set of numbers is calculated by dividing the sum of the numbers by the count of the numbers. In this case, the average number of apples picked by Maggie, Kelsey, and Layla is given as 30.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   Let \( L \)...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that the three people (Maggie, Kelsey, and Layla) averaged 30 apples each. This means that the total number of apples picked by all three of them is 30 apples/person * 3 people = 90 apples.

We know that Maggie picked 40 apples and Kelsey picked 28 apples. So, the total number of apples picked by Maggie and Kelsey is 40 apples + 28 apples = 68 apples.

To find out how many apples Layla picked, we subtract the total number of apples picked by Maggie and ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Maggie picked 40 apples.
   * Kelsey picked 28 apples.
   * Layla picked an unknown number of apples.
   * The average number of apples picked by the three is 30.

2. To find the average, we add up all the values and divide by the number of values. In this case, we have the average and two of the three values. Let's call the unknown number of apples Layla picked ...
