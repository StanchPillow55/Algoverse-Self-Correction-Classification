=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first calculate the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards that Ben has, and then we will determine how many cards he has left after giving away some to his classmates.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of basketball cards
Ben has four boxes of basketball cards, and each box contains ten basketball cards. We can calculate the total number of basketball cards as follows:

\[
\text{Total basketball cards} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Cards per box}
\]
\[
\text{Total basketball cards} = 4 \times 10 = 40
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of baseball cards
Ben's mother gave him five boxes of baseball cards, with each box containing eight baseball cards. We can calculate the total number of baseball cards as follows:

\[
\text{Total baseball cards} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Cards per box}
\]
\[
\text{Total baseball cards} = 5 \times 8 = 40
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of cards Ben has
Now we can find the total number of cards (both basketball and baseball) that Ben has:

\[
\text{Total cards} = \text{Total basketball cards} + \text{Total baseball cards}
\]
\[
\text{Total cards} = 40 + 40 = 80
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of cards left after giving some away
Ben gives away 58 cards to his classmates. To find out how many cards he has left, we subtract the number of cards given away from the total number of cards:

\[
\text{Cards left} = \text{Total cards} - \text{Cards given away}
\]
\[
\text{Cards left} = 80 - 58 = 22
\]

### Final Answer
After giving away 58 cards, Ben has **22 cards left**.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cards Ben has initially, and then subtract the number of cards he gives away to find out how many he has left.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of basketball cards.**

Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. To find the total number of basketball cards, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of cards per box:

\[
4 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ cards/box} = 40 \text{ basketball...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many cards Ben has in total. 

Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. So, the total number of basketball cards is 4 boxes * 10 cards/box = 40 cards.

His mother gave him five boxes with eight baseball cards in each box. So, the total number of baseball cards is 5 boxes * 8 cards/box = 40 cards.

So, the total number of cards that Ben has is 40 basketball cards + 40 baseball cards = 80 cards.

Then, Ben gives 58 cards to hi...
