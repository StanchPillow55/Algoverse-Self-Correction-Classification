=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of singers at the party given the total number of students and the relationships between the different groups (poets, singers, and tree huggers).

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Total number of students = 400
   - Number of tree huggers = 120
   - There are 50 more poets than tree huggers.

2. **Determine the number of poets:**
   Since we know there are 50 more poets than tree huggers, we can calculate the number of poets as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of poets} = \text{Number of tree huggers} + 50
   \]
   Substituting the number of tree huggers:
   \[
   \text{Number of poets} = 120 + 50 = 170
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of singers:**
   We know the total number of students is the sum of poets, singers, and tree huggers. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Total students} = \text{Number of poets} + \text{Number of singers} + \text{Number of tree huggers}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   400 = 170 + \text{Number of singers} + 120
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   Combine the known quantities:
   \[
   400 = 290 + \text{Number of singers}
   \]

5. **Isolate the number of singers:**
   To find the number of singers, we subtract 290 from both sides:
   \[
   \text{Number of singers} = 400 - 290 = 110
   \]

6. **Final answer:**
   The number of singers at the party is \( \boxed{110} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of singers at the party.

Given information:
- There are 400 students at the party, consisting of poets, singers, and tree huggers.
- There are 50 more poets than tree huggers.
- The number of tree huggers is 120.

Step 1: Find the number of poets.
Number of poets = Number of tree huggers + 50
Number of poets = 120 + 50 = 170

Step 2: Find the number of singers.
Total number of students = Number of poe...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of singers at the party given the total number of students and the relationships between the poets, singers, and tree huggers.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( P \) represent the number of poets.
- Let \( S \) represent the number of singers.
- Let \( T \) represent the number of tree huggers.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of students at the party is 400. Therefore, we have the equ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of poets as P, the number of singers as S, and the number of tree huggers as T.

From the problem, we know that:

1) P + S + T = 400 (since there are 400 students at the party)

2) P = T + 50 (since there are 50 more poets than tree huggers)

3) T = 120 (since the number of tree huggers is 120)

We can substitute the value of T from equation 3) into equation 2) to find the number of poets:

P = 120 + 50 = 170

Now that we know P and T, we can subst...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There are a total of 400 students at the party.
- The students are a combination of poets, singers, and tree huggers.
- There are 50 more poets than tree huggers.
- The number of tree huggers is 120.

Step 1: Determine the number of poets at the party.
Since there are 50 more poets than tree huggers, we can express the number of poets as:
Poets = Tree huggers + 50
Poets = 120 + 50 = ...
