=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many hours of sleep Tom gets after increasing his sleep by \( \frac{1}{3} \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify Tom's current sleep duration**: Tom currently sleeps for 6 hours a day.

2. **Calculate the increase in sleep**: We need to find \( \frac{1}{3} \) of Tom's current sleep duration. This can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Increase} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

   To perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

   So, the increase in sleep is 2 hours.

3. **Add the increase to the current sleep duration**: Now we add the increase to Tom's original sleep duration:

   \[
   \text{New sleep duration} = \text{Current sleep} + \text{Increase}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{New sleep duration} = 6 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: Therefore, after increasing his sleep by \( \frac{1}{3} \), Tom gets **8 hours of sleep per night**.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the increase in the number of hours of sleep per night and then add it to the original number of hours of sleep.

Given information:
- Tom was getting 6 hours of sleep per night.
- He increases his sleep by 1/3.

Step 1: Calculate the increase in the number of hours of sleep per night.
Increase in hours of sleep = Original hours of sleep × 1/3
Increase in hours of sleep = 6 hours × 1/3 = 2 hours

Step 2: Calculat...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine how many hours of sleep Tom gets per night after increasing his sleep by 1/3 of his current amount.

1. **Identify the current amount of sleep:**
   Tom currently gets 6 hours of sleep per day.

2. **Calculate the increase in sleep:**
   The problem states that Tom increases his sleep by 1/3. We need to find 1/3 of his current sleep amount.

   \[
   \text{Increase in sleep} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Tom initially gets 6 hours of sleep per day. He increases this by 1/3. 

To find out how much he increased his sleep by, we need to calculate 1/3 of 6 hours. 

1/3 of 6 hours = 6 * 1/3 = 2 hours

So, Tom increased his sleep by 2 hours. 

Now, to find out how much sleep he gets per night after the increase, we add the increase to his initial sleep time.

6 hours (initial sleep time) + 2 hours (increase) = 8 hours

So, Tom now gets 8 hours of sleep per night.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Tom currently sleeps for 6 hours a day.
   * He increases his sleep time by 1/3 (one-third).

2. Calculate the increase in sleep time:
   * To find the increase, multiply the current sleep time by 1/3.
   * Increase in sleep time = 6 hours × 1/3
   * To calculate this, first convert 1/3 to a decimal: 1 ÷ 3 = 0.333... (rounded to 0.33 or 0.333)
   * Increase in sleep...
