=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many brownies Katy made in total. We know the following:

1. Katy eats 5 brownies on Monday.
2. On Tuesday, she eats twice as many brownies as she did on Monday.

Let's break this down step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of brownies Katy eats on Tuesday.**

Since Katy eats twice as many brownies on Tuesday as she did on Monday, we can calculate the number of brownies she eats on Tuesday as follows:

\[
\text{Brownies eaten on Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Brownies eaten on Monday}
\]
\[
\text{Brownies eaten on Tuesday} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of brownies Katy made.**

Now that we know how many brownies she ate on both days, we can find the total number of brownies she made by adding the brownies eaten on Monday and Tuesday:

\[
\text{Total brownies made} = \text{Brownies eaten on Monday} + \text{Brownies eaten on Tuesday}
\]
\[
\text{Total brownies made} = 5 + 10 = 15
\]

**Final Answer:**

Katy made a total of \( \boxed{15} \) brownies.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Katy eats 5 brownies on Monday. 

On Tuesday, she eats twice as many as she did on Monday. This means she eats 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 brownies on Tuesday.

To find out how many brownies Katy made, we add the number of brownies she ate on Monday and Tuesday. 

So, 5 (Monday) + 10 (Tuesday) = 15 brownies.

Therefore, Katy made 15 brownies.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to find out how many brownies Katy made in total.

Given:
- Katy eats 5 brownies on Monday.
- On Tuesday, she eats twice as many brownies as she did on Monday.
- After eating the brownies on Tuesday, all the brownies she made are gone.

Step 1: Determine the number of brownies Katy ate on Tuesday.
Tuesday's brownies = 2 × Monday's brownies
Tuesday's brownies = 2 × 5 = 10
