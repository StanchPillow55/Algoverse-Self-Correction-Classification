=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of kids going to soccer camp**:
   - We know that there are 2,000 kids in total at the camp.
   - According to the problem, half of the kids are going to soccer camp.
   - Therefore, the number of kids going to soccer camp is:
     \[
     \text{Number of kids going to soccer camp} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2000 = 1000
     \]

2. **Determine how many of those kids are going to soccer camp in the morning**:
   - We are told that \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the kids going to soccer camp are going in the morning.
   - To find the number of kids going to soccer camp in the morning, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of kids going to soccer camp in the morning} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
     \]

3. **Determine how many kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon**:
   - Since we have already calculated that 1,000 kids are going to soccer camp in total and 250 of them are going in the morning, we can find the number of kids going to soccer camp in the afternoon by subtracting the number of kids going in the morning from the total number of kids going to soccer camp:
     \[
     \text{Number of kids going to soccer camp in the afternoon} = 1000 - 250 = 750
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of kids going to soccer camp in the afternoon is:
     \[
     \boxed{750}
     \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. There are 2,000 kids in the camp.

2. Half of the kids are going to soccer camp.
   * 2,000 / 2 = 1,000 kids are going to soccer camp.

3. 1/4 of the kids going to soccer camp are going in the morning.
   * 1,000 * 1/4 = 250 kids are going to soccer camp in the morning.

4. To find the number of kids going to soccer camp in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of kids going in the morning from the...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon. We will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of kids going to soccer camp:**

   We know that half of the 2,000 kids are going to soccer camp. To find this number, we calculate:

   \[
   \text{Number of kids going to soccer camp} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2000 = 1000
   \]

   So, 1,000 kids are going to soccer camp.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many kids are going to soccer camp. Since half of the kids are going to soccer camp, we can calculate this by dividing the total number of kids by 2.

2000 kids / 2 = 1000 kids

So, 1000 kids are going to soccer camp.

Next, we need to find out how many kids are going to soccer camp in the morning. Since 1/4 of the kids going to soccer camp are going to soccer camp in the morning, we can calculate this by dividing the number of kids going to...
