=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, keeping track of the number of shoes Frank has at each stage.

1. **Initial Number of Shoes**: 
   Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. **Shoes Gained on Monday**: 
   Frank receives 5 pairs of shoes on Monday. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, we calculate the total number of shoes gained on Monday:
   \[
   \text{Shoes gained on Monday} = 5 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes/pair} = 10 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   Now, we add this to the initial number of shoes:
   \[
   \text{Total shoes after Monday} = 200 \text{ shoes} + 10 \text{ shoes} = 210 \text{ shoes}
   \]

3. **Shoes Gained on Wednesday**: 
   On Wednesday, Frank gains 15 new pairs of shoes. Again, we convert pairs to shoes:
   \[
   \text{Shoes gained on Wednesday} = 15 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes/pair} = 30 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   We add this to the total from Monday:
   \[
   \text{Total shoes after Wednesday} = 210 \text{ shoes} + 30 \text{ shoes} = 240 \text{ shoes}
   \]

4. **Shoes Gained on Friday**: 
   On Friday, Frank gains 30 pairs of shoes:
   \[
   \text{Shoes gained on Friday} = 30 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes/pair} = 60 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   We add this to the total from Wednesday:
   \[
   \text{Total shoes after Friday} = 240 \text{ shoes} + 60 \text{ shoes} = 300 \text{ shoes}
   \]

5. **Shoes Lost on Saturday**: 
   On Saturday, Frank gets rid of 180 shoes. We subtract this from the total:
   \[
   \text{Total shoes after Saturday} = 300 \text{ shoes} - 180 \text{ shoes} = 120 \text{ shoes}
   \]

6. **Final Count of Shoes on Sunday**: 
   After all the gains and losses, the total number of shoes Frank has on Sunday is:
   \[
   \text{Final total on Sunday} = 120 \text{ shoes}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]

=== INDIVIDUAL MODEL RESPONSES ===

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, keeping track of the number of shoes Frank has at each stage.

1. **Initial Number of Shoes**: 
   Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. **Shoes Gained on Monday**: 
   Frank receives 5 pairs of shoes on Monday. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, we calculate the total number of shoes gained on Monday:
   \[
   \text{Shoes gained on Monday} = 5 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes/pair} = 10 \text{ shoes}
   \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Fireman Frank has 200 shoes initially.
- On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes.
- On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes.
- On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs of shoes.
- On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Step 1: Calculate the number of shoes Fireman Frank has after Monday.
Initial number of shoes = 200
Shoes gained on Monday = 5 pairs × 2 shoes per pair = 10 shoes
Total n...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of shoes Fireman Frank has throughout the week, taking into account the pairs of shoes he gains and the shoes he gets rid of.

### Initial Information:
- Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

### Monday:
- He gains 5 pairs of shoes.
- Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, 5 pairs equal \(5 \times 2 = 10\) shoes.
- New total after Monday: \(200 + 10 = 210\) shoes.

### Wednesday:
- He gains 15 pairs of shoes.
- 1...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since a pair of shoes is made up of 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 shoes on Monday.

On Wednesday, he gets 15 new pairs of shoes. This means he gets 15 * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 shoes on Wednesday.

On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes. This means he gets 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 shoes on Friday.

So, by Friday, Fireman Frank has 200 (original shoes) + 10 (Monday's shoes) + 30 (Wednesday's shoes) + ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start with the initial number of shoes and add or subtract shoes based on the events described in the problem.

Given:
- Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.
- He gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday.
- He gains 15 new pairs on Wednesday.
- He gains 30 pairs on Friday.
- He gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday.

Step 1: Convert the pairs of shoes gained into individual shoes.
- Monday: 5 pairs × 2 shoes/pair =...
