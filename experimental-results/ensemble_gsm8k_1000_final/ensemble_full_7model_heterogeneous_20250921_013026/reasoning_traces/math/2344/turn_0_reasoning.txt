=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine Olivia's new insurance premium after one accident and three tickets, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the increase in premium due to the accident.**
   - Olivia's initial premium is $50/month.
   - The increase due to one accident is 10% of her current premium.
   - To find 10% of $50, we calculate:
     \[
     10\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
     \]
   - Therefore, the increase in premium due to the accident is $5.

2. **Calculate the increase in premium due to the tickets.**
   - Each ticket increases the premium by $5/month.
   - Since Olivia received 3 tickets, the total increase due to the tickets is:
     \[
     3 \text{ tickets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total increase in premium.**
   - The total increase in premium from both the accident and the tickets is:
     \[
     \text{Increase from accident} + \text{Increase from tickets} = 5 + 15 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the new insurance premium.**
   - To find the new premium, we add the total increase to the initial premium:
     \[
     \text{New premium} = \text{Initial premium} + \text{Total increase} = 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Olivia's new insurance premium after one accident and three tickets is **$70/month**.

Final answer: **$70/month**.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the increase in Olivia's insurance premium due to the accident. 

The premium increases by 10% for every accident. So, for one accident, the increase would be 10% of $50. 

To calculate 10% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.10. 

So, 10% of $50 = 0.10 * $50 = $5.

Next, let's calculate the increase in Olivia's insurance premium due to the tickets. 

The premium increases by $5/month for every ticket. So, for three tickets, the increase would ...
