=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many eggs Theo needs to make all the omelettes, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the types of omelettes and their egg counts**:
   - 3 egg omelette: uses 3 eggs.
   - 4 egg omelette: uses 4 eggs.

2. **Count the number of omelettes ordered in each hour**:
   - **First hour**: 5 customers order 3 egg omelettes.
   - **Second hour**: 7 customers order 4 egg omelettes.
   - **Third hour**: 3 customers order 3 egg omelettes.
   - **Fourth hour**: 8 customers order 4 egg omelettes.

3. **Calculate the total number of each type of omelette ordered**:
   - Total 3 egg omelettes ordered:
     - First hour: 5 omelettes
     - Third hour: 3 omelettes
     - Total = 5 + 3 = 8 omelettes
   - Total 4 egg omelettes ordered:
     - Second hour: 7 omelettes
     - Fourth hour: 8 omelettes
     - Total = 7 + 8 = 15 omelettes

4. **Calculate the total number of eggs needed for each type of omelette**:
   - For the 3 egg omelettes:
     - Total eggs = Number of 3 egg omelettes × Eggs per 3 egg omelette
     - Total eggs = 8 omelettes × 3 eggs/omelette = 24 eggs
   - For the 4 egg omelettes:
     - Total eggs = Number of 4 egg omelettes × Eggs per 4 egg omelette
     - Total eggs = 15 omelettes × 4 eggs/omelette = 60 eggs

5. **Calculate the total number of eggs needed for all omelettes**:
   - Total eggs needed = Total eggs for 3 egg omelettes + Total eggs for 4 egg omelettes
   - Total eggs needed = 24 eggs + 60 eggs = 84 eggs

Thus, the total number of eggs Theo needs to make all the omelettes is **84 eggs**. 

Final answer: **84 eggs**.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs used for both types of omelettes over the four-hour period. We will break down the problem hour by hour and calculate the number of eggs used in each hour, then sum them up.

### Hour 1:
- **3 egg omelettes:** 5 customers order 3 egg omelettes.
  - Number of eggs used = 5 customers × 3 eggs/customer = 15 eggs

### Hour 2:
- **4 egg omelettes:** 7 customers order 4 egg omelettes.
  - Number of eggs used ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to multiply the number of omelettes ordered by the number of eggs in each omelette, and then add up all the eggs used in each hour.

In the first hour, 5 customers order the 3 egg omelettes. So, the number of eggs used in the first hour is 5 omelettes * 3 eggs/omelette = 15 eggs.

In the second hour, 7 customers order the 4 egg omelettes. So, the number of eggs used in the second hour is 7 omelettes * 4 eggs/omelette = 28 eggs.

In the third...
