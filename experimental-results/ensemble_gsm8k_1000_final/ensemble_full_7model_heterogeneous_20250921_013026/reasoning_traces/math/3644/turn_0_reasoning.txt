Final Answer: To find out how many followers Malcolm has on all his social media platforms, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of followers on Instagram and Facebook:**
   - Followers on Instagram = 240
   - Followers on Facebook = 500
   - Total followers on Instagram and Facebook = 240 + 500 = 740

2. **Calculate the number of followers on Twitter:**
   - The number of followers on Twitter is half the total number of followers on Instagram and Facebook combined.
   - Followers on Twitter = \( \frac{740}{2} = 370 \)

3. **Calculate the number of followers on TikTok:**
   - The number of followers on TikTok is 3 times the number of followers on Twitter.
   - Followers on TikTok = \( 3 \times 370 = 1110 \)

4. **Calculate the number of followers on YouTube:**
   - The number of followers on YouTube is 510 more than the number of followers on TikTok.
   - Followers on YouTube = \( 1110 + 510 = 1620 \)

5. **Calculate the total number of followers across all platforms:**
   - Total followers = Followers on Instagram + Followers on Facebook + Followers on Twitter + Followers on TikTok + Followers on YouTube
   - Total followers = \( 240 + 500 + 370 + 1110 + 1620 \)

Now, let's perform the addition step by step:

- First, add Instagram and Facebook:
  \[
  240 + 500 = 740
  \]

- Next, add Twitter:
  \[
  740 + 370 = 1110
  \]

- Then, add TikTok:
  \[
  1110 + 1110 = 2220
  \]

- Finally, add YouTube:
  \[
  2220 + 1620 = 3840
  \]

Thus, the total number of followers Malcolm has on all his social media platforms is \( \boxed{3840} \).
