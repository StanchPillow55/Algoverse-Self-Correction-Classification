=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many hours Mike will practice from now until the next game in 3 weeks, we need to break down his practice schedule and calculate the total hours based on that schedule.

1. **Identify the number of weekdays and weekends in 3 weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - In 3 weeks, the total number of days is:
     \[
     3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
     \]
   - Each week has 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) and 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).
   - Therefore, in 3 weeks:
     - Weekdays: 
     \[
     3 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ weekdays/week} = 15 \text{ weekdays}
     \]
     - Weekend days:
     \[
     3 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ weekend days/week} = 6 \text{ weekend days}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total practice hours for weekdays:**
   - Mike practices for 3 hours every weekday.
   - Therefore, the total practice hours on weekdays is:
     \[
     15 \text{ weekdays} \times 3 \text{ hours/weekday} = 45 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total practice hours for weekends:**
   - Mike practices for 5 hours on Saturdays and takes Sundays off.
   - In 3 weeks, there are 3 Saturdays.
   - Therefore, the total practice hours on Saturdays is:
     \[
     3 \text{ Saturdays} \times 5 \text{ hours/Saturday} = 15 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total practice hours over the 3 weeks:**
   - Now, we add the total practice hours from weekdays and weekends:
   \[
   45 \text{ hours (weekdays)} + 15 \text{ hours (Saturdays)} = 60 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of hours Mike will practice from now until the next game is:
   \[
   \boxed{60} \text{ hours}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of hours Mike will practice from now until the next game, which is in 3 weeks.

Given information:
- Mike practices for 3 hours every weekday.
- Mike practices for 5 hours on Saturdays.
- Mike takes Sundays off.
- The team has a game in 3 weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of hours Mike will practice on weekdays.
Number of weekdays in 3 weeks = 15 (3 weeks × 5 weekdays per week)
Hours of p...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how many hours Mike will practice from now until the next game, we need to calculate the total number of practice hours over the 3-week period. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the practice schedule:**
   - Mike practices 3 hours every weekday (Monday through Friday).
   - On Saturdays, he practices for 5 hours.
   - He takes Sundays off, so he practices 0 hours on Sundays.

2. **Calculate the weekly practice hours:**
   - **Weekdays:** There...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Mike practices for 3 hours every weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he practices for 3*5 = 15 hours every week.

On Saturdays, he practices for 5 hours. So, in total, he practices for 15+5 = 20 hours every week.

If his team has a game in 3 weeks, he will practice for 3*20 = <<3*20=60>>60 hours from now until the next game.

So, Mike will practice for 60 hours from now until the next game.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mike practices for 3 hours every weekday.
   * On Saturdays, he practices for 5 hours.
   * He takes Sundays off (no practice).
   * The next game is in 3 weeks.

2. Calculate the number of practice hours per week:
   * Weekdays: 5 days × 3 hours per day = 15 hours
   * Saturdays: 1 day × 5 hours per day = 5 hours
   * Total practice hours per week = Weekdays +...
