=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how much Doris spent.**
   - According to the problem, Doris spent $6 from the cookie jar.

2. **Calculate how much Martha spent.**
   - The problem states that Martha spent half as much as Doris. Since Doris spent $6, we can calculate Martha's spending as follows:
     \[
     \text{Martha's spending} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Doris's spending} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount spent by both Doris and Martha.**
   - Now we need to find the total amount spent by both Doris and Martha:
     \[
     \text{Total spent} = \text{Doris's spending} + \text{Martha's spending} = 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine the initial amount in the cookie jar and calculate the remaining amount.**
   - Initially, there were 21 dollars in the cookie jar. To find out how much money is left after Doris and Martha spent their amounts, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
     \[
     \text{Amount left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total spent} = 21 - 9 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **State the final answer.**
   - Therefore, the amount of money left in the cookie jar is:
     \[
     \boxed{12}
     \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- There were $21 in the cookie jar initially.
- Doris spent $6 from the cookie jar.
- Martha spent half as much as Doris.

Step 1: Calculate how much Martha spent from the cookie jar.
Martha spent half as much as Doris, so:
Martha's spending = $6 ÷ 2 = $3

Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent from the cookie jar.
Total amount spent = Doris' spending + Martha's spending
Total amount spent = $...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money was spent from the cookie jar and then subtract that amount from the initial total to find out how much money is left.

1. **Initial Amount in the Cookie Jar:**
   - The cookie jar initially contains $21.

2. **Amount Spent by Doris:**
   - Doris spent $6 from the cookie jar.

3. **Amount Spent by Martha:**
   - Martha spent half as much as Doris. Since Doris spent $6, we calculate half of this amount:
     \[

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem starts with $21 in the cookie jar.

Doris spent $6 from the cookie jar. So, we subtract $6 from $21 to find out how much is left after Doris's spending.

$21 - $6 = $15

So, after Doris spent $6, there was $15 left in the cookie jar.

Martha spent half as much as Doris. Doris spent $6, so half of that amount is $6 / 2 = $3.

So, Martha spent $3 from the cookie jar. We subtract this amount from what was left after Doris's spending to find out how much is left a...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- There were 21 dollars in the cookie jar initially.
- Doris spent $6 from the cookie jar.
- Martha spent half as much as Doris.

Step 1: Calculate how much Martha spent.
Martha's spending = 1/2 × Doris's spending
Martha's spending = 1/2 × $6 = $3

Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent by Doris and Martha.
Total spent = Doris's spending + Martha's spending
Total spent = $6 + $3 = $9

Step 3: Calcu...
