=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many minutes Marcus spends on making calzones, we will break down each step of the process and calculate the time spent on each task.

1. **Sauteing the Onions**:
   - Time spent: 20 minutes.

2. **Sauteing the Garlic and Peppers**:
   - It takes a quarter of the time it takes to saute the onions.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     \text{Time for garlic and peppers} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ minutes}.
     \]

3. **Kneading the Dough**:
   - Time spent: 30 minutes.

4. **Letting the Dough Rest**:
   - It takes twice as long as kneading the dough.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Time for resting} = 2 \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}.
     \]

5. **Assembling the Calzones**:
   - It takes \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the combined kneading and resting time.
   - First, we need to find the combined time for kneading and resting:
     \[
     \text{Combined time} = 30 \text{ minutes (kneading)} + 60 \text{ minutes (resting)} = 90 \text{ minutes}.
     \]
   - Now, calculate the time for assembling:
     \[
     \text{Time for assembling} = \frac{1}{10} \times 90 \text{ minutes} = 9 \text{ minutes}.
     \]

6. **Total Time Spent**:
   - Now we will sum all the times calculated:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time for onions} + \text{Time for garlic and peppers} + \text{Time for kneading} + \text{Time for resting} + \text{Time for assembling}.
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 20 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} + 9 \text{ minutes}.
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 20 + 5 + 30 + 60 + 9 = 124 \text{ minutes}.
     \]

Thus, the total time Marcus spends on making calzones is \( \boxed{124} \) minutes.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- It takes Marcus 20 minutes to sauté the onions.
- It takes him a quarter of the time to sauté the garlic and peppers.
- It takes him 30 minutes to knead the dough.
- It takes him twice as long to let the dough rest.
- It takes him 1/10th the combined kneading and resting time to assemble the calzones.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to sauté the garlic and peppers.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Marcus spends on each task involved in making the calzones and then sum these times.

1. **Sauteing Onions:**
   - It takes Marcus 20 minutes to saute the onions.

2. **Sauteing Garlic and Peppers:**
   - The time to saute the garlic and peppers is a quarter of the time it takes to saute the onions.
   - Calculation: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 20 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ minutes}\).

3. **Kneading the Dough:**
   - I...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how long it takes Marcus to saute the garlic and peppers. Since it's a quarter of the time it takes to saute the onions, we divide the onion saute time by 4:

20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes

Next, let's find out how long it takes for the dough to rest. Since it's twice as long as the kneading time, we multiply the kneading time by 2:

30 minutes * 2 = 60 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it takes to assemble the calzones. Since it's 1/10th the combin...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

1. Sauteing the onions:
   * Time to saute onions = 20 minutes

2. Sauteing the garlic and peppers:
   * Time to saute garlic and peppers = 1/4 × Time to saute onions
   * Time to saute garlic and peppers = 1/4 × 20 minutes = 5 minutes

3. Kneading the dough:
   * Time to knead the dough = 30 minutes

4. Letting the dough rest:
   * Time to let the dough rest = 2 × Time to knead the dough
