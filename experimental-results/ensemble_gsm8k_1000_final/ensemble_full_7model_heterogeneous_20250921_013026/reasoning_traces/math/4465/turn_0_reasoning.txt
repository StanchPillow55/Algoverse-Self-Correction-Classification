=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of bird eggs June found, we need to calculate the number of eggs in each nest and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the eggs in the first tree:**
   - June found 2 nests with 5 eggs each.
   - The total number of eggs in these nests is:
     \[
     2 \text{ nests} \times 5 \text{ eggs/nest} = 10 \text{ eggs}
     \]

2. **Calculate the eggs in the second tree:**
   - June found 1 nest with 3 eggs.
   - The total number of eggs in this nest is:
     \[
     1 \text{ nest} \times 3 \text{ eggs/nest} = 3 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the eggs in the front yard:**
   - June found 1 nest with 4 eggs.
   - The total number of eggs in this nest is:
     \[
     1 \text{ nest} \times 4 \text{ eggs/nest} = 4 \text{ eggs}
     \]

4. **Sum all the eggs:**
   - Now we add the total number of eggs from all the nests:
     \[
     10 \text{ eggs (from the first tree)} + 3 \text{ eggs (from the second tree)} + 4 \text{ eggs (from the front yard)} = 17 \text{ eggs}
     \]

Thus, the total number of bird eggs June found is \( \boxed{17} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- June found 2 bird nests with 5 eggs each in 1 tree.
- June found 1 nest with 3 eggs in another tree.
- June found 1 nest with 4 eggs in her front yard.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs in the 2 nests found in the first tree.
Number of nests in the first tree = 2
Number of eggs in each nest = 5
Total eggs in the first tree = 2 nests Ã— 5 eggs per nest = 10 eggs

Step 2: Calculate the ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bird eggs that June found. We will do this by adding up the eggs from each nest she discovered.

1. **Nests in the first tree:**
   - June found 2 nests with 5 eggs each in one tree.
   - To find the total number of eggs in these nests, we multiply the number of nests by the number of eggs per nest:
     \[
     2 \text{ nests} \times 5 \text{ eggs per nest} = 10 \text{ eggs}
     \]

2. **Nest in the second...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total number of eggs in the two nests that June found in one tree. Since each of these nests has 5 eggs, we multiply the number of nests (2) by the number of eggs in each nest (5). 

2 nests * 5 eggs/nest = 10 eggs

Next, we add the number of eggs in the nest from the other tree, which is 3.

10 eggs + 3 eggs = 13 eggs

Finally, we add the number of eggs in the nest from her front yard, which is 4.

13 eggs + 4 eggs = 17 eggs

So, June foun...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the total number of bird eggs June found.

Given:
- June found 2 bird nests with 5 eggs each in 1 tree.
- She found 1 nest with 3 eggs in another tree.
- There was also a nest with 4 eggs in her front yard.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs in the first tree.
