=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of Kyle, Julian, Frederick, and Tyson based on the information given.

1. **Identify Tyson's age**: 
   We know from the problem that Tyson is 20 years old.

   \[
   \text{Tyson's age} = 20
   \]

2. **Determine Frederick's age**:
   The problem states that Frederick is "2 times older than Tyson." This phrase can be a bit confusing, but it typically means that Frederick's age is twice Tyson's age.

   \[
   \text{Frederick's age} = 2 \times \text{Tyson's age} = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

3. **Determine Julian's age**:
   Next, we are told that Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick. We can calculate Julian's age by subtracting 20 from Frederick's age.

   \[
   \text{Julian's age} = \text{Frederick's age} - 20 = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Determine Kyle's age**:
   Finally, we know that Kyle is 5 years older than Julian. We can find Kyle's age by adding 5 to Julian's age.

   \[
   \text{Kyle's age} = \text{Julian's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

Now that we have calculated all the ages, we can summarize:

- Tyson's age: 20
- Frederick's age: 40
- Julian's age: 20
- Kyle's age: 25

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Kyle's age} = 25
\]

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of Kyle, Julian, Frederick, and Tyson based on the information given.

1. **Identify Tyson's age**: 
   We know from the problem that Tyson is 20 years old.

   \[
   \text{Tyson's age} = 20

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Kyle is 5 years older than Julian.
- Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick.
- Frederick is 2 times older than Tyson.
- Tyson is 20 years old.

Step 1: Find Frederick's age.
Since Frederick is 2 times older than Tyson, and Tyson is 20 years old, we can calculate Frederick's age as:
Frederick's age = 2 × Tyson's age
Frederick's age = 2 × 20 = 40 years old

Step 2: Find Julian's age.
Jul...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of each person mentioned based on the relationships described. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Tyson's Age:**
   - We are given that Tyson is 20 years old.

2. **Determine Frederick's Age:**
   - The problem states that Frederick is 2 times older than Tyson. 
   - Since Tyson is 20, we calculate Frederick's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Frederick's age} = 2 \times \text{Tyson's age} = 2 \times 20...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: We know that Tyson is 20 years old.

Step 2: Frederick is 2 times older than Tyson. This means Frederick is 2 * 20 = 40 years old.

Step 3: Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick. So, Julian is 40 - 20 = 20 years old.

Step 4: Kyle is 5 years older than Julian. So, Kyle is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.

So, Kyle is 25 years old.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start with the information given and work our way through to find Kyle's age.

Given:
- Kyle is 5 years older than Julian.
- Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick.
- Frederick is 2 times older than Tyson.
- Tyson is 20 years old.

Step 1: Determine Tyson's age.
Tyson's age = 20 years

Step 2: Calculate Frederick's age.
Frederick's age = 2 × Tyson's age
Frederick's age = 2 × 20 = 40 years

Step 3: C...
