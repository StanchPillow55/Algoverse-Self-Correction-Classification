=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much money Khalil paid Mr. Sean for the treatment of his dogs and cats, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the costs for each type of animal**:
   - The cost to treat one dog is $60.
   - The cost to care for one cat is $40.

2. **Determine the number of each type of animal Khalil took to the clinic**:
   - Khalil took 20 dogs.
   - Khalil took 60 cats.

3. **Calculate the total cost for the dogs**:
   - Total cost for dogs = Number of dogs × Cost per dog
   - Total cost for dogs = 20 dogs × $60/dog
   - Total cost for dogs = 20 × 60 = $1200

4. **Calculate the total cost for the cats**:
   - Total cost for cats = Number of cats × Cost per cat
   - Total cost for cats = 60 cats × $40/cat
   - Total cost for cats = 60 × 40 = $2400

5. **Calculate the total amount Khalil paid**:
   - Total amount paid = Total cost for dogs + Total cost for cats
   - Total amount paid = $1200 + $2400
   - Total amount paid = $3600

Thus, the total amount of money Khalil paid Mr. Sean for the treatment of his dogs and cats is **$3600**. 

Final answer: **$3600**.
