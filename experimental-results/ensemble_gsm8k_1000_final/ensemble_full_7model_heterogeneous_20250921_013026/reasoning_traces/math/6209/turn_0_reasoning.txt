=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many herb plants Gilbert had when spring ended, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Plant Count**:
   - Gilbert planted:
     - 3 basil bushes
     - 1 parsley plant
     - 2 kinds of mint

   We can summarize this initial count:
   \[
   \text{Total initial plants} = \text{Basil} + \text{Parsley} + \text{Mint} = 3 + 1 + 2 = 6
   \]

2. **Basil Plant Growth**:
   - Halfway through spring, one of the basil plants dropped seeds and produced an extra basil plant. This means we need to add 1 more basil plant to the total count.
   \[
   \text{New total after basil growth} = 6 + 1 = 7
   \]

3. **Rabbit Incident**:
   - Near the end of spring, a rabbit came and ate all the mint plants. Since Gilbert had 2 kinds of mint, this means both mint plants were eaten.
   - Therefore, we need to subtract the 2 mint plants from the total count.
   \[
   \text{Total after rabbit eats mint} = 7 - 2 = 5
   \]

4. **Final Count of Herb Plants**:
   - After accounting for the growth of the basil plant and the loss of the mint plants, we find that Gilbert has:
   - 4 remaining plants (3 basil + 1 parsley).

Thus, the final count of herb plants Gilbert had when spring ended is:

\[
\text{Final answer} = 5
\] 

So, Gilbert had **5 herb plants** when spring ended.

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To determine how many herb plants Gilbert had when spring ended, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Plant Count**:
   - Gilbert planted:
     - 3 basil bushes
     - 1 parsley plant
     - 2 kinds of mint

   We can summarize this initial count:
   \[
   \text{Total initial plants} = \text{Basil} + \text{Parsley} + \text{Mint} = 3 + 1 + 2 = 6
   \]

2. **Basil Plant Growth**:
   - Halfway through spring, one of the basil plants dropped seeds ...

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- At the beginning of spring, Gilbert planted:
  - 3 basil bushes
  - 1 parsley plant
  - 2 kinds of mint
- Halfway through spring, one of the basil plants dropped seeds and made an extra basil plant grow.
- Near the end of spring, a rabbit ate all the mint plants.

Step 1: Calculate the number of herb plants at the beginning of spring.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of each type of herb plant Gilbert has throughout the spring season, taking into account the events described.

1. **Initial Planting:**
   - Gilbert initially plants three basil bushes.
   - He plants one parsley plant.
   - He plants two kinds of mint.

   Let's summarize the initial counts:
   - Basil: 3 plants
   - Parsley: 1 plant
   - Mint: 2 plants

2. **Mid-Spring Event:**
   - Halfway through spring, o...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Gilbert started with three basil bushes, one parsley plant, and two kinds of mint. This totals to 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 plants.

Halfway through spring, one of the basil plants dropped seeds from a flower and made an extra basil plant grow. This means Gilbert now has 6 + 1 = 7 plants.

However, a rabbit came by the garden near the end of spring and ate all the mint. Since there were two mint plants, this means Gilbert now has 7 - 2 = 5 plants.

Therefore, Gilbert had 5 herb plant...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly listing the information given in the question.

Given:
- At the beginning of spring, Gilbert planted:
  - 3 basil bushes
  - 1 parsley plant
  - 2 kinds of mint (assuming 1 plant each)
- Halfway through spring, one extra basil plant grew from dropped seeds.
- Near the end of spring, a rabbit ate all the mint plants.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of herb plants at the beginning of...
