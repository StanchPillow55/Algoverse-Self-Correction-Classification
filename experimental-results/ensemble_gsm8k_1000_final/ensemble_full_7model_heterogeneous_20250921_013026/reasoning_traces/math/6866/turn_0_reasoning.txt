=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of ducks**:
   - We are given that there are 25 mallard ducks at the park.

2. **Calculate the number of geese**:
   - The problem states that there are "ten less than twice as many geese as ducks."
   - First, we calculate twice the number of ducks:
     \[
     2 \times 25 = 50
     \]
   - Now, we subtract 10 from this result to find the number of geese:
     \[
     50 - 10 = 40
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 40 geese at the park.

3. **Account for the arrival of new ducks**:
   - A small flock of 4 ducks arrives at the park. We add these ducks to the existing number of ducks:
     \[
     25 + 4 = 29
     \]
   - Now, there are 29 ducks at the park.

4. **Account for the departure of geese**:
   - The problem states that "five less than 15 geese leave the park." We first calculate how many geese that is:
     \[
     15 - 5 = 10
     \]
   - So, 10 geese leave the park. We subtract this from the original number of geese:
     \[
     40 - 10 = 30
     \]
   - Now, there are 30 geese remaining at the park.

5. **Calculate the difference between the number of geese and ducks**:
   - We need to find out how many more geese than ducks remain at the park:
     \[
     30 - 29 = 1
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that there is **1 more goose than duck** remaining at the park.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There are 25 mallard ducks at the park initially.
- The number of geese is ten less than twice the number of ducks.
- A small flock of 4 ducks arrived at the park and joined the birds already there.
- Five less than 15 geese leave the park.

Step 1: Calculate the initial number of geese.
Number of geese = (2 × 25) - 10 = 50 - 10 = 40 geese

Step 2: Calculate the total number of bi...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ducks and geese at the park after the changes described, and then find out how many more geese than ducks remain.

### Step 1: Determine the initial number of ducks and geese.

1. **Initial number of ducks**: 
   - The problem states there are 25 mallard ducks initially.

2. **Initial number of geese**:
   - The problem states there are "ten less than twice as many geese as ducks."
   - Twice the number of ducks i...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many geese there are at the park. The problem states that there are "ten less than twice as many geese as ducks." We know there are 25 ducks, so twice that number would be 50. Ten less than 50 is 40, so there are 40 geese at the park.

Next, we add the 4 ducks that arrived at the park to the original number of ducks. 25 ducks + 4 ducks = 29 ducks.

Then, we subtract the number of geese that left the park from the original number of geese. The pro...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the initial situation:
   * There are 25 mallard ducks at the park.
   * The number of geese is ten less than twice the number of ducks.

2. Calculate the initial number of geese:
   * Number of geese = (2 × Number of ducks) - 10
   * Number of geese = (2 × 25) - 10
   * Number of geese = 50 - 10 = 40
   So, initially, there are 40 geese at the park.

3. Update the number of ducks after the small...
