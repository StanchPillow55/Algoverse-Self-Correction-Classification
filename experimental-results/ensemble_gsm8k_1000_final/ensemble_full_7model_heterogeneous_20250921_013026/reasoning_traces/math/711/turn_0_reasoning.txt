=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( E \) represent the number of oranges Emily sold.
   - Since Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily, we can express the number of oranges Alice sold as \( A = 2E \).

2. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - According to the problem, the total number of oranges sold by both Alice and Emily is 180. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   A + E = 180
   \]
   Substituting \( A \) with \( 2E \) gives us:
   \[
   2E + E = 180
   \]

3. **Combine Like Terms**:
   - Combine the terms on the left side:
   \[
   3E = 180
   \]

4. **Solve for \( E \)**:
   - To find \( E \), divide both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   E = \frac{180}{3} = 60
   \]

5. **Find \( A \)**:
   - Now that we have the number of oranges Emily sold, we can find the number of oranges Alice sold using the equation \( A = 2E \):
   \[
   A = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Alice sold 120 oranges.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily.
- In total, they sold 180 oranges.

Let's represent the number of oranges Emily sold as x.

Since Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily, we can represent the number of oranges Alice sold as 2x.

The total number of oranges sold is 180, so we can write the equation:
x + 2x = 180

Simplifying the equation:
3x = 180

Solving for x:
x = 180 / 3
x = 60...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges Alice sold, given that she sold twice as many oranges as Emily and together they sold a total of 180 oranges.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( E \) represent the number of oranges Emily sold.
   - Since Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily, we can express the number of oranges Alice sold as \( 2E \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of oranges Emily sold as E. According to the problem, Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily did, so we can denote the number of oranges Alice sold as 2E.

The problem states that together, Alice and Emily sold 180 oranges. We can express this as an equation:

E (Emily's oranges) + 2E (Alice's oranges) = 180

This simplifies to 3E = 180.

To find the value of E (the number of oranges Emily sold), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

E = 1...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. To find out how many oranges Alice sold, we need to set up an equation based on the given information.

Given:
- Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily.
- In total, they sold 180 oranges.

Step 1: Let's define variables for the unknown quantities.
Let x = the number of oranges Emily sold.

Step 2: Express Alice's oranges in terms of Emily's.
Alice's oranges = 2x

Step 3: Set up an equation based on the...
