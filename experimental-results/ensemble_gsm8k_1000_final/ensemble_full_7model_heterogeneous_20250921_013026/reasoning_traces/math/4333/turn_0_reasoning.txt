=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of episodes for the show "Magic King," we need to break down the problem into manageable parts based on the information provided.

1. **Determine the number of seasons**: 
   The show aired for a total of 10 seasons.

2. **Determine the number of episodes per season**:
   - For the first half of the seasons (which is 5 seasons), there were 20 episodes per season.
   - For the second half of the seasons (the remaining 5 seasons), there were 25 episodes per season.

3. **Calculate the total number of episodes for the first half**:
   \[
   \text{Total episodes in the first half} = \text{Number of seasons} \times \text{Episodes per season}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total episodes in the first half} = 5 \text{ seasons} \times 20 \text{ episodes/season} = 100 \text{ episodes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of episodes for the second half**:
   \[
   \text{Total episodes in the second half} = \text{Number of seasons} \times \text{Episodes per season}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total episodes in the second half} = 5 \text{ seasons} \times 25 \text{ episodes/season} = 125 \text{ episodes}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of episodes for the entire show**:
   \[
   \text{Total episodes} = \text{Total episodes in the first half} + \text{Total episodes in the second half}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total episodes} = 100 \text{ episodes} + 125 \text{ episodes} = 225 \text{ episodes}
   \]

Thus, the total number of episodes for the show "Magic King" is **225 episodes**. 

Final answer: **225 episodes**.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The show Magic King was on the air for 10 seasons. The number of episodes per season changed halfway through the show's run. 

For the first half of the seasons, there were 20 episodes per season. Since half of 10 seasons is 5 seasons, we can calculate the total number of episodes for the first half of the show by multiplying the number of seasons by the number of episodes per season:

5 seasons * 20 episodes/season = 100 episodes

For the second half of the seasons, ther...
