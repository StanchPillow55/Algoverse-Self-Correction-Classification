=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( d \).

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense:
   \[
   \text{Offense} = 2d
   \]

2. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense:
   \[
   \text{Special Teams} = \frac{1}{2}d
   \]

Now, we can express the total number of team members in terms of \( d \):
\[
\text{Total} = \text{Offense} + \text{Defense} + \text{Special Teams}
\]
Substituting the expressions we have for offense and special teams, we get:
\[
\text{Total} = 2d + d + \frac{1}{2}d
\]

Now, let's combine these terms:
\[
\text{Total} = 2d + d + \frac{1}{2}d = 3d + \frac{1}{2}d
\]

To combine \( 3d \) and \( \frac{1}{2}d \), we can convert \( 3d \) into a fraction:
\[
3d = \frac{6}{2}d
\]
Thus,
\[
\text{Total} = \frac{6}{2}d + \frac{1}{2}d = \frac{7}{2}d
\]

We know the total number of team members is 105, so we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{7}{2}d = 105
\]

To solve for \( d \), we first multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
7d = 210
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 7:
\[
d = \frac{210}{7} = 30
\]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \( d = 30 \).

To verify, we can calculate the number of players on the offense and special teams:
- Offense: \( 2d = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Special Teams: \( \frac{1}{2}d = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \)

Now, let's check the total:
\[
\text{Total} = \text{Offense} + \text{Defense} + \text{Special Teams} = 60 + 30 + 15 = 105
\]

Since the total matches the given number of team members, our solution is confirmed.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of players on the defense.

Given information:
- The football team has 105 members.
- There are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense.
- There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of players on the defense.
- Let 2x be the number of players on the offense (since there are twice as man...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of players on the defense, given the relationships between the numbers of players on the offense, defense, and special teams.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( d \) represent the number of players on the defense.
- According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense. Therefore, the number of players on the offense is \( 2d \).

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D, on the offense as O, and on the special teams as S.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. O = 2D (There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense)
2. S = D/2 (There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense)

The total number of players is 105, so we can write:

3. O + D + S = 105

We can substitute the expressions from relati...
