=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of glasses broken by both David and William.

1. **Identify the number of glasses broken by David:**
   - According to the problem, David broke 2 glasses.

2. **Calculate the number of glasses broken by William:**
   - The problem states that William broke 4 times the number of glasses that David broke.
   - Since David broke 2 glasses, we can calculate the number of glasses William broke as follows:
     \[
     \text{Glasses broken by William} = 4 \times \text{Glasses broken by David} = 4 \times 2 = 8
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of glasses broken:**
   - Now, we need to find the total number of glasses broken by both David and William. We do this by adding the number of glasses broken by each:
     \[
     \text{Total glasses broken} = \text{Glasses broken by David} + \text{Glasses broken by William} = 2 + 8 = 10
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of glasses broken at the party is:
     \[
     \boxed{10}
     \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we know that David broke 2 glasses.

The problem states that William broke 4 times the number of glasses that David broke. To find out how many glasses William broke, we multiply the number of glasses David broke by 4.

2 glasses * 4 = 8 glasses

So, William broke 8 glasses.

To find out the total number of glasses broken, we add the number of glasses David broke to the number of glasses William broke.

2 glasses + 8 glasses = 10 glasses

Therefore, David and Willi...
