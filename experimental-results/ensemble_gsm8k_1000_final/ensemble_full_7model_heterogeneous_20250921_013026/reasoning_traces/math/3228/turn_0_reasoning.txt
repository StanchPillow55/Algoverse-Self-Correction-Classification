=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much more money Daisy spent on lunch than on breakfast, we will first calculate the total amount she spent on each meal and then find the difference.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of breakfast.**

Daisy bought:
- A muffin for $2
- A cup of coffee for $4

To find the total cost of breakfast, we add the costs of the muffin and the coffee:

\[
\text{Total cost of breakfast} = \text{Cost of muffin} + \text{Cost of coffee}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of breakfast} = 2 + 4 = 6
\]

So, Daisy spent $6 on breakfast.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of lunch.**

Daisy had:
- Soup for $3
- Salad for $5.25
- Lemonade for $0.75

To find the total cost of lunch, we add the costs of the soup, salad, and lemonade:

\[
\text{Total cost of lunch} = \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of salad} + \text{Cost of lemonade}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of lunch} = 3 + 5.25 + 0.75
\]

Now, we will perform the addition step-by-step:

1. First, add the cost of the soup and salad:
   \[
   3 + 5.25 = 8.25
   \]

2. Next, add the cost of the lemonade:
   \[
   8.25 + 0.75 = 9
   \]

So, Daisy spent $9 on lunch.

**Step 3: Calculate how much more Daisy spent on lunch than on breakfast.**

Now we will find the difference between the total cost of lunch and the total cost of breakfast:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total cost of lunch} - \text{Total cost of breakfast}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3
\]

Thus, Daisy spent $3 more on lunch than on breakfast.

**Final Answer:**
Daisy spent $3 more on lunch than on breakfast.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

For breakfast, Daisy bought:
* Muffin: $2
* Cup of coffee: $4
Total spent on breakfast: $2 + $4 = $6

For lunch, Daisy bought:
* Soup: $3
* Salad: $5.25
* Lemonade: $0.75
Total spent on lunch: $3 + $5.25 + $0.75 = $9

Now, to find how much more Daisy spent on lunch than on breakfast, we subtract the breakfast total from the lunch total:
* Lunch total: $9
* Breakfast total: $6
* Difference: $9 - $6 = $3

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much Daisy spent on breakfast. She bought a muffin for $2 and a cup of coffee for $4. 

So, the total cost of breakfast is $2 (muffin) + $4 (coffee) = $6.

Next, let's calculate how much Daisy spent on lunch. She had soup for $3, a salad for $5.25, and lemonade for $0.75.

So, the total cost of lunch is $3 (soup) + $5.25 (salad) + $0.75 (lemonade) = $9.
