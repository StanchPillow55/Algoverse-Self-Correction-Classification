Final Answer: To determine how long Kitty has spent cleaning the living room over the course of 4 weeks, we need to first calculate the total time she spends cleaning the living room in one week. Then, we will multiply that time by 4 to find the total time over 4 weeks.

Let's break down the cleaning tasks and their respective times:

1. **Picking up toys and straightening the living room**: 5 minutes
2. **Vacuuming the living room floor, seating, and drapes**: 20 minutes
3. **Cleaning the windows**: 15 minutes
4. **Dusting the furniture**: 10 minutes

Now, we will add these times together to find the total time spent cleaning the living room in one week.

\[
\text{Total time in one week} = \text{Time for picking up toys} + \text{Time for vacuuming} + \text{Time for cleaning windows} + \text{Time for dusting}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total time in one week} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 15 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we perform the addition step-by-step:

1. \(5 + 20 = 25\) minutes
2. \(25 + 15 = 40\) minutes
3. \(40 + 10 = 50\) minutes

Thus, the total time Kitty spends cleaning the living room in one week is:

\[
\text{Total time in one week} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much time she spends cleaning the living room over 4 weeks:

\[
\text{Total time in 4 weeks} = \text{Total time in one week} \times 4
\]

Substituting the value we calculated:

\[
\text{Total time in 4 weeks} = 50 \text{ minutes} \times 4
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
50 \times 4 = 200 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time Kitty has spent cleaning the living room over the course of 4 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{200 \text{ minutes}}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Kitty spends 5 minutes picking up toys, 20 minutes vacuuming, 15 minutes cleaning windows, and 10 minutes dusting furniture. 

To find out how long she spends cleaning the living room in one week, we need to add up all these times:

5 minutes (picking up toys) + 20 minutes (vacuuming) + 15 minutes (cleaning windows) + 10 minutes (dusting furniture) = 50 minutes per week.

To find out how long Kitty spends cleaning the living room over 4 weeks, we need to multiply the time...
