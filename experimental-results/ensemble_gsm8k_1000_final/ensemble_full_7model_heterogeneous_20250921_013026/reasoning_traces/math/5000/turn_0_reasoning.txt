=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find Ray's total grocery bill, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of each item.**
2. **Sum the total costs to find the subtotal.**
3. **Apply the 10% discount to the subtotal.**
4. **Calculate the final total after the discount.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of each item

- **Hamburger meat:** $5.00
- **Crackers:** $3.50
- **Frozen vegetables:** 4 bags at $2.00 per bag
  \[
  \text{Total for frozen vegetables} = 4 \times 2.00 = 8.00
  \]
- **Cheese:** $3.50

### Step 2: Sum the total costs to find the subtotal

Now we add all these amounts together:
\[
\text{Subtotal} = \text{Hamburger meat} + \text{Crackers} + \text{Frozen vegetables} + \text{Cheese}
\]
\[
\text{Subtotal} = 5.00 + 3.50 + 8.00 + 3.50
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:
1. \(5.00 + 3.50 = 8.50\)
2. \(8.50 + 8.00 = 16.50\)
3. \(16.50 + 3.50 = 20.00\)

So, the subtotal is:
\[
\text{Subtotal} = 20.00
\]

### Step 3: Apply the 10% discount

Next, we calculate the 10% discount on the subtotal:
\[
\text{Discount} = 10\% \text{ of } 20.00 = 0.10 \times 20.00 = 2.00
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the final total after the discount

Now we subtract the discount from the subtotal:
\[
\text{Final total} = \text{Subtotal} - \text{Discount}
\]
\[
\text{Final total} = 20.00 - 2.00 = 18.00
\]

### Final Answer

Ray's total grocery bill comes to:
\[
\boxed{18.00}
\]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. 

The cost of the hamburger meat is $5.00, the cost of the crackers is $3.50, the cost of the cheese is $3.50, and the cost of the 4 bags of frozen vegetables is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

So, the total cost before the discount is $5.00 + $3.50 + $3.50 + $8.00 = $20.00.

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The discount is 10% of the total cost, so the discount is 0.10 * $20.00 = $2.00.

Finally, we...
