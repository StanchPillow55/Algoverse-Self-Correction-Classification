=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many calories Bob consumed from the pizza, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of slices in the pizza**: Bob's pizza has 8 slices.

2. **Determine how many slices Bob ate**: Bob eats half of the pizza. Since there are 8 slices in total, half of that is:
   \[
   \text{Slices eaten} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Calculate the calories per slice**: Each slice of pizza contains 300 calories.

4. **Calculate the total calories consumed by Bob**: To find out how many calories Bob ate, we multiply the number of slices he ate by the calories per slice:
   \[
   \text{Total calories eaten} = \text{Slices eaten} \times \text{Calories per slice}
   \]
   Substituting in the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total calories eaten} = 4 \text{ slices} \times 300 \text{ calories/slice}
   \]

5. **Perform the multiplication**:
   \[
   \text{Total calories eaten} = 4 \times 300 = 1200 \text{ calories}
   \]

Thus, the total number of calories Bob consumed from the pizza is **1200 calories**.

Final answer: **1200 calories**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The pizza has 8 slices.
- Each slice is 300 calories.
- Bob eats half of the pizza.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories in the entire pizza.
Total calories in the pizza = Number of slices × Calories per slice
Total calories in the pizza = 8 × 300 = 2,400 calories

Step 2: Calculate the number of slices Bob ate.
Bob ate half of the pizza, so he ate half of the 8 slices.
Number ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many calories Bob consumed by eating half of the pizza.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Slices Bob Ate:**
   - The pizza has a total of 8 slices.
   - Bob eats half of the pizza.
   - To find out how many slices he ate, we calculate half of 8 slices:
     \[
     \text{Number of slices Bob ate} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
     \]

2. **Calculate the Calories Per Slice:**
   - We are giv...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many slices Bob ate. Since he ate half of the pizza, and the pizza had 8 slices, he ate 8/2 = 4 slices.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of calories Bob consumed. Since each slice was 300 calories, and he ate 4 slices, he consumed 300*4 = 1200 calories.

So, Bob ate 1200 calories.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The pizza has 8 slices in total.
   * Bob eats half of the pizza.
   * Each slice contains 300 calories.

2. Calculate the number of slices Bob ate:
   * Bob ate half of the pizza, which means he ate half of the total slices.
   * Half of 8 slices = 8 ÷ 2 = 4 slices
   So, Bob ate 4 slices of pizza.

3. Calculate the total calories Bob consumed:
   * Each slice has ...
