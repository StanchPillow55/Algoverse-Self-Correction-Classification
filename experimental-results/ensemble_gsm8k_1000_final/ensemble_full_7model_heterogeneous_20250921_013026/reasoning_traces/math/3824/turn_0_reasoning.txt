=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the amount Rene received**: 
   According to the problem, Rene received $300.

2. **Determine how much Florence received**: 
   The problem states that Florence received three times as much money as Rene. Therefore, we can calculate the amount Florence received as follows:
   \[
   \text{Amount Florence received} = 3 \times \text{Amount Rene received} = 3 \times 300 = 900
   \]

3. **Determine how much Maria gave to Isha**: 
   The problem states that Maria gave half of what she gave to Florence to Isha. Since we know Florence received $900, we can find out how much Maria gave to Isha:
   \[
   \text{Amount Isha received} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Amount Florence received} = \frac{1}{2} \times 900 = 450
   \]

4. **Determine how much Maria gave to her friend**: 
   The problem states that Maria gave a third of her money to Isha. Let \( M \) be the total amount of money Maria has. According to the problem:
   \[
   \text{Amount Isha received} = \frac{1}{3} M
   \]
   We already calculated that Isha received $450, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} M = 450
   \]

5. **Solve for Maria's total amount of money**:
   To find \( M \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   M = 450 \times 3 = 1350
   \]

6. **Determine how much Maria gave to Florence**: 
   We already know that Florence received $900.

7. **Calculate the total amount Maria gave to her three friends**: 
   Now we can find the total amount Maria gave to her three friends (Isha, Florence, and Rene):
   \[
   \text{Total amount given} = \text{Amount Isha received} + \text{Amount Florence received} + \text{Amount Rene received}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total amount given} = 450 + 900 + 300 = 1650
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money that Maria gave to her three friends is \(\boxed{1650}\).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it.

Given information:
- Maria gave a third of her money to her friend Isha.
- Maria gave half of what she gave to Isha to Florence.
- Florence received three times as much money as Maria's cousin Rene.
- Rene received $300.

Step 1: Find the amount of money Maria gave to Isha.
Let's assume Maria's total money is x.
Amount given to Isha = 1/3 of x = x/3

Step 2: Find the amount of money Maria...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Maria gave to each of her three friends: Isha, Florence, and Rene. We are given that Rene received $300, and we need to use this information to find out how much Maria gave to the other two friends and the total amount given.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine how much Florence received:**
   - We are told that Florence received three times as much money as Maria's cousin Rene.
   - Rene ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out how much money Florence received. Since Florence received three times as much money as Rene, and Rene received $300, we can calculate Florence's amount by multiplying Rene's amount by 3.

Florence's amount = 3 * Rene's amount
Florence's amount = 3 * $300
Florence's amount = $900

Next, we know that the amount Maria gave to Isha is half of what she gave to Florence. So, we can calculate Isha's amount by dividing Florence's amount by 2.

Isha's a...
