=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided about Jenny's games with her friends Mark and Jill.

1. **Games Played with Mark**:
   - Jenny has played against Mark **10 times**.
   - Mark has won **1 time**.
   - Therefore, the number of games Jenny has won against Mark is:
     \[
     \text{Games won by Jenny against Mark} = \text{Total games} - \text{Games won by Mark} = 10 - 1 = 9
     \]

2. **Games Played with Jill**:
   - Jenny has played against Jill **twice as many times as she has played against Mark**.
   - Since she played Mark 10 times, she has played Jill:
     \[
     \text{Games played against Jill} = 2 \times 10 = 20
     \]
   - Jill has won **75%** of the games played against her. To find out how many games Jill won, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Games won by Jill} = 0.75 \times \text{Total games against Jill} = 0.75 \times 20 = 15
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of games Jenny has won against Jill is:
     \[
     \text{Games won by Jenny against Jill} = \text{Total games} - \text{Games won by Jill} = 20 - 15 = 5
     \]

3. **Total Wins**:
   - Now, we can find the total number of games Jenny has won against both friends:
     \[
     \text{Total wins by Jenny} = \text{Games won against Mark} + \text{Games won against Jill} = 9 + 5 = 14
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Jenny has won a total of **14 games** against her two friends.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of games Jenny has won against Mark and Jill, and then add them together to get the total number of games she has won.

Given information:
- Jenny has played Mark 10 times, and Mark has won once.
- Jenny has played Jill twice as many times as she's played Mark, and Jill has won 75% of those games.

Step 1: Find the number of games Jenny has won against Mark.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times Jenny has won board games against her two friends, Mark and Jill.

**Step 1: Determine the number of games played against Mark.**

Jenny has played against Mark 10 times. Mark has won only once. Therefore, the number of games Jenny has won against Mark is:

\[
10 \text{ games} - 1 \text{ game} = 9 \text{ games}
\]

So, Jenny has won 9 games against Mark.

**Step 2: Determine the number of games played against Jil...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's look at the games Jenny played against Mark. They played 10 times and Mark won once. That means Jenny won the rest of the games. So, Jenny won 10 - 1 = 9 games against Mark.

Next, let's look at the games Jenny played against Jill. Jenny played Jill twice as many times as she played Mark, so they played 2 * 10 = 20 games. Jill won 75% of these games, so Jill won 0.75 * 20 = 15 games.

That means Jenny won the rest of the games against Jill. So, Jenny won 20 -...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given information:
- Jenny has played Mark 10 times.
- Mark has won only once against Jenny.
- Jenny has played Jill twice as many times as she's played Mark.
- Jill has won 75% of the games against Jenny.

Step 1: Calculate the number of times Jenny has won against Mark.
Total games played with Mark = 10
Mark's wins = 1
Jenny's wins against Mark = Total games played with Mark - Mark's wins...
