Final Answer: To determine how much Bill gets paid for a 50-hour workweek, we need to break down his pay structure based on the hours he works.

1. **Identify the pay rate**:
   - Bill earns $20 per hour for the first 40 hours.
   - For any hours worked beyond 40 hours, he earns double that rate, which is $20 * 2 = $40 per hour.

2. **Calculate the pay for the first 40 hours**:
   - For the first 40 hours, his pay is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Pay for first 40 hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 800 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of hours worked beyond 40**:
   - Bill works a total of 50 hours. Therefore, the number of hours he worked beyond 40 hours is:
     \[
     50 \text{ hours} - 40 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the pay for the additional hours**:
   - For the additional 10 hours, he earns $40 per hour:
     \[
     \text{Pay for additional 10 hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \times 40 \text{ dollars/hour} = 400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total pay for the week**:
   - Now, we add the pay for the first 40 hours and the pay for the additional hours:
     \[
     \text{Total pay} = \text{Pay for first 40 hours} + \text{Pay for additional 10 hours}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total pay} = 800 \text{ dollars} + 400 \text{ dollars} = 1200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Bill's total pay for a 50-hour workweek is **$1200**.

Final answer: **$1200**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bill gets paid $20 per hour for the first 40 hours he works.
- After 40 hours, Bill gets paid double the amount, which is $40 per hour.
- Bill works a 50-hour workweek.

Step 1: Calculate the amount Bill gets paid for the first 40 hours.
Amount paid for the first 40 hours = 40 hours × $20 per hour = $800

Step 2: Calculate the amount Bill gets paid for the remaining 10 hours (50 hours - 4...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate Bill's total earnings for a 50-hour workweek, considering the different pay rates for hours worked up to and beyond 40 hours.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine the pay rate for the first 40 hours:**
   - Bill gets paid $20 per hour for the first 40 hours.
   - Calculate the total pay for these 40 hours:
     \[
     \text{Pay for first 40 hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$800
     \]

2. **Deter...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Bill gets paid $20 per hour for the first 40 hours. So, for the first 40 hours, he earns:

40 hours * $20/hour = $800

For the remaining 10 hours (50 total hours - 40 initial hours), he gets paid double the initial rate, which is $40 per hour. So, for the remaining 10 hours, he earns:

10 hours * $40/hour = $400

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount Bill earns for a 50-hour workweek:

$800 + $400 = $1200

So, Bill gets paid $1200 for a 50-hour workweek...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Bill gets paid $20 per hour for the first 40 hours.
   * After 40 hours, Bill's pay rate doubles.
   * We need to calculate Bill's total pay for a 50-hour workweek.

2. Calculate Bill's pay for the first 40 hours:
   * Pay for the first 40 hours = $20 per hour × 40 hours
   * Pay for the first 40 hours = $800

3. Calculate Bill's pay for the hours worked beyond...
