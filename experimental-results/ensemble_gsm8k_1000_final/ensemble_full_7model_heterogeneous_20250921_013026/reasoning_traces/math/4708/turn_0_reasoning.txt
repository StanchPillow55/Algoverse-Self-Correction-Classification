=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Mirasol has left in her account after her purchases, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial amount in the account**: Mirasol starts with $50.

2. **List her expenditures**:
   - She spends $10 on coffee beans.
   - She spends $30 on a tumbler.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent**:
   To find out how much Mirasol spent in total, we add the amounts she spent on both items:
   \[
   \text{Total spent} = \text{Amount spent on coffee beans} + \text{Amount spent on tumbler}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total spent} = 10 + 30 = 40
   \]

4. **Subtract the total spent from the initial amount**:
   Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount in her account to find out how much is left:
   \[
   \text{Amount left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total spent}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount left} = 50 - 40 = 10
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Mirasol has $10 left in her account after her purchases.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
