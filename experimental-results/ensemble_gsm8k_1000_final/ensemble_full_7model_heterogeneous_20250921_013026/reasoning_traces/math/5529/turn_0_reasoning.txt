=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of insects Dean has**: 
   We are given that Dean has 30 insects.

   \[
   \text{Dean's insects} = 30
   \]

2. **Determine how many insects Jacob has**: 
   The problem states that Jacob has 5 times as many insects as Dean. Therefore, we can calculate the number of insects Jacob has by multiplying the number of insects Dean has by 5.

   \[
   \text{Jacob's insects} = 5 \times \text{Dean's insects} = 5 \times 30 = 150
   \]

3. **Determine how many insects Angela has**: 
   The problem states that Angela has half as many insects as Jacob. To find the number of insects Angela has, we will take half of the number of insects Jacob has.

   \[
   \text{Angela's insects} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Jacob's insects} = \frac{1}{2} \times 150 = 75
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   After performing the calculations, we find that Angela has 75 insects.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{75}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Angela has half as many insects as Jacob.
- Jacob has 5 times as many insects as Dean.
- Dean has 30 insects.

Step 1: Find how many insects Jacob has.
Jacob has 5 times as many insects as Dean.
Jacob's insects = 5 × Dean's insects
Jacob's insects = 5 × 30 = 150 insects

Step 2: Find how many insects Angela has.
Angela has half as many insects as Jacob.
Angela's insects = 1/2 × Jacob's in...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many insects Angela has based on the information given about the number of insects that Dean and Jacob have.

1. **Identify the number of insects Dean has:**
   - We are told that Dean has 30 insects.

2. **Determine the number of insects Jacob has:**
   - Jacob has 5 times as many insects as Dean.
   - Since Dean has 30 insects, we calculate the number of insects Jacob has by multiplying Dean's number by 5:
     \[
     \t...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many insects Jacob has. Since Jacob has 5 times as many insects as Dean, and Dean has 30 insects, we multiply 5 by 30 to find out how many insects Jacob has.

5 * 30 = 150 insects

So, Jacob has 150 insects.

Next, we need to find out how many insects Angela has. Since Angela has half as many insects as Jacob, and Jacob has 150 insects, we divide 150 by 2 to find out how many insects Angela has.

150 / 2 = 75 insects

So, Angela has 75 insec...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll start with the information given and work our way to the final answer.

Given:
- Angela has half as many insects as Jacob.
- Jacob has 5 times as many insects as Dean.
- Dean has 30 insects.

Step 1: Determine the number of insects Jacob has.
Jacob's insects = 5 × Dean's insects
Jacob's insects = 5 × 30 = 150

Explanation: Since Jacob has 5 times as many insects as Dean, and Dean has 30 insects, we ...
