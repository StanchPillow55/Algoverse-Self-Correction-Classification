=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine Marco's score**: 
   The average score on the Spanish test was 90. Marco scored 10% less than the average score. 

   First, we calculate 10% of the average score:
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } 90 = 0.10 \times 90 = 9
   \]

   Now, we subtract this value from the average score to find Marco's score:
   \[
   \text{Marco's score} = 90 - 9 = 81
   \]

2. **Determine Margaret's score**: 
   Margaret received 5 more points than Marco. We add 5 to Marco's score to find Margaret's score:
   \[
   \text{Margaret's score} = \text{Marco's score} + 5 = 81 + 5 = 86
   \]

3. **Final Answer**: 
   Therefore, the score that Margaret received on her test is:
   \[
   \boxed{86}
   \]

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine Marco's score**: 
   The average score on the Spanish test was 90. Marco scored 10% less than the average score. 

   First, we calculate 10% of the average score:
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } 90 = 0.10 \times 90 = 9

   Now, we subtract this value from the average score to find Marco's score:
   \[
   \text{Marco's score} = 90 - 9 = 81

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The average score on last week's Spanish test was 90.

2. Marco scored 10% less than the average test score.
   * To calculate 10% less than 90:
   * 10% of 90 = 0.10 x 90 = 9
   * 90 - 9 = 81
   * So Marco's score was 81.

3. Margaret received 5 more points than Marco.
   * Marco's score was 81
   * Margaret's score = Marco's score + 5
   * Margaret's score = 81 + 5 = 86

Therefore, the score that Margare...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the scores of Marco and Margaret based on the given information about the average score.

1. **Understand the average score:**
   - The average score on the test was 90.

2. **Calculate Marco's score:**
   - Marco scored 10% less than the average score.
   - To find 10% of the average score, we calculate:
     \[
     10\% \text{ of } 90 = \frac{10}{100} \times 90 = 9
     \]
   - Marco's score is 10% less than 90, so we subtra...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out what score Marco received on his test. Since we know that Marco scored 10% less than the average test score, we can calculate his score by subtracting 10% of the average score from the average score.

The average score was 90, so 10% of 90 is 90 * 0.10 = 9.

Subtracting this from the average score, we find that Marco's score was 90 - 9 = 81.

Next, we need to find out what score Margaret received on her test. We know that Margaret received 5 mor...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The average score on the Spanish test was 90.
   * Marco scored 10% less than the average test score.
   * Margaret received 5 more points than Marco.

2. Calculate Marco's score:
   * The average score is 90, and Marco scored 10% less than that.
   * To find 10% of 90, we multiply 90 by 10/100 (or 0.1).
     90 Ã— 0.1 = 9
   * So, 10% of 90 is 9.
   * To find Mar...
