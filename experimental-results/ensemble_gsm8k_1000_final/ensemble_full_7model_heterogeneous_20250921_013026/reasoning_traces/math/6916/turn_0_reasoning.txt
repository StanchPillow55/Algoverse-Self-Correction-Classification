=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the percent profit on the book, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the marked price of the book.**
2. **Calculate the sale price after the discount.**
3. **Calculate the profit made by the store.**
4. **Calculate the percent profit.**

### Step 1: Determine the Marked Price

The book costs $50. The store marks the book 30% above the cost.

To find the marked price, we calculate 30% of the cost and then add it to the cost:

\[
\text{Marked Price} = \text{Cost} + (0.30 \times \text{Cost})
\]

Substituting the cost:

\[
\text{Marked Price} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50)
\]

Calculating \(0.30 \times 50\):

\[
0.30 \times 50 = 15
\]

Now, adding this to the cost:

\[
\text{Marked Price} = 50 + 15 = 65
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Sale Price After the Discount

During the sale, a 10% discount is given on the marked price. We need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the marked price.

First, calculate 10% of the marked price:

\[
\text{Discount} = 0.10 \times \text{Marked Price} = 0.10 \times 65
\]

Calculating \(0.10 \times 65\):

\[
0.10 \times 65 = 6.5
\]

Now, subtract the discount from the marked price to find the sale price:

\[
\text{Sale Price} = \text{Marked Price} - \text{Discount} = 65 - 6.5
\]

Calculating the sale price:

\[
\text{Sale Price} = 65 - 6.5 = 58.5
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Profit Made by the Store

Profit is calculated as the difference between the sale price and the cost:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Sale Price} - \text{Cost} = 58.5 - 50
\]

Calculating the profit:

\[
\text{Profit} = 58.5 - 50 = 8.5
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Percent Profit

Percent profit is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Percent Profit} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Percent Profit} = \left( \frac{8.5}{50} \right) \times 100
\]

Calculating the fraction:

\[
\frac{8.5}{50} = 0.17
\]

Now, multiplying by 100 to get the percent:

\[
\text{Percent Profit} = 0.17 \times 100 = 17
\]

### Final Answer

The percent profit made by the store on the book is **17%**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- The store marks a book 30% above the cost.
- During a sale, a 10% discount was given.
- The book costs $50.

Step 1: Calculate the selling price of the book before the discount.
Cost price of the book = $50
Markup percentage = 30%
Selling price before discount = Cost price + (Cost price × Markup percentage)
Selling price before discount = $50 + ($50 × 0.30) = $50 + $15 = $65

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the percent profit after the store marks up the book and then applies a discount during a sale. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the Marked Price:**
   - The cost of the book is $50.
   - The store marks the book 30% above the cost. To find the marked price, we calculate 30% of $50 and add it to the original cost.
   - Calculate 30% of $50:
     \[
     0.30 \times 50 = 15
     \]
   - Add this amount ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Step 1: Calculate the marked price of the book

The store marks the book 30% above the cost. So, the marked price of the book is the cost price plus 30% of the cost price.

Marked price = Cost price + 30% of Cost price
Marked price = $50 + 30% of $50
Marked price = $50 + $15
Marked price = $65

Step 2: Calculate the selling price of the book

During a sale, a 10% discount was given. So, the selling price of the book is the marked price minus 10% of the marked price.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The store marks the book 30% above the cost.
   * During a sale, a 10% discount is given on the marked price.
   * The book's cost is $50.

2. Calculate the marked price of the book:
   * Marked price = Cost + 30% of the cost
   * 30% of the cost = 0.3 × $50 = $15
   * Marked price = $50 + $15 = $65

3. Calculate the selling price after the 10% discount:
