=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many apps Travis has on his tablet now, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial number of apps**: Travis starts with 61 apps on his tablet.

2. **Subtract the number of apps deleted**: Travis deleted 9 apps that he didn't use anymore. We need to subtract this number from the initial total.
   \[
   61 - 9 = 52
   \]
   After deleting 9 apps, Travis has 52 apps left.

3. **Add the number of apps downloaded**: Travis then downloaded 18 more apps. We need to add this number to the current total of apps.
   \[
   52 + 18 = 70
   \]
   After downloading 18 apps, Travis now has a total of 70 apps.

4. **Final answer**: Therefore, the total number of apps on Travis's tablet now is 70.

In conclusion, after deleting 9 apps and downloading 18 more, Travis has **70 apps** on his tablet.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Travis had 61 apps on his tablet.
- He deleted 9 apps he didn't use anymore.
- He downloaded 18 more apps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apps Travis had after deleting 9 apps.
Initial number of apps - Number of apps deleted = Number of apps after deleting
61 - 9 = 52 apps

Step 2: Calculate the number of apps Travis has after downloading 18 more apps.
Number of apps after deleting + Number ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Travis started with 61 apps on his tablet. 

He then deleted 9 apps, so we subtract 9 from 61. 

61 - 9 = 52

So, after deleting the apps, Travis had 52 apps left on his tablet. 

Then, he downloaded 18 more apps. So, we add 18 to 52. 

52 + 18 = 70

So, Travis now has 70 apps on his tablet. 

Therefore, the final answer is 70 apps.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start with the given information and then work through the problem, explaining each step along the way.

Given:
- Travis had 61 apps on his tablet initially.
- He deleted 9 apps he didn't use anymore.
- He downloaded 18 new apps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apps remaining after deleting the unused apps.
Apps remaining = Initial number of apps - Number of apps deleted
Apps remaining = 61 - 9 = 52
