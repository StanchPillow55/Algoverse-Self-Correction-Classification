=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many chocolate cookies Andy originally had on the platter before he started eating and giving them away.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial Actions**:
   - Andy ate 3 cookies.
   - He then gave 5 cookies to his little brother.

   So, the total number of cookies eaten or given away by Andy before handing the platter to his basketball team is:
   \[
   3 + 5 = 8 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Distribution to Basketball Team**:
   - The basketball team has 8 members, and the number of cookies taken by each player follows a specific pattern:
     - The first player took 1 cookie.
     - The second player took 3 cookies.
     - The third player took 5 cookies.
     - The fourth player took 7 cookies.
     - The fifth player took 9 cookies.
     - The sixth player took 11 cookies.
     - The seventh player took 13 cookies.
     - The eighth player took 15 cookies.

   This sequence of cookies taken by the players is an arithmetic series where the first term \(a = 1\) and the common difference \(d = 2\).

3. **Finding the Total Cookies Taken by the Team**:
   - The number of cookies taken by the \(n\)-th player can be expressed as:
   \[
   a_n = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2 = 2n - 1
   \]
   - To find the total number of cookies taken by all 8 players, we sum the first 8 terms of this sequence:
   \[
   \text{Total} = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8
   \]
   - This can also be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first \(n\) odd numbers, which is \(n^2\):
   \[
   \text{Total} = 8^2 = 64 \text{ cookies}
   \]

4. **Calculating the Original Number of Cookies**:
   - Let \(x\) be the original number of cookies Andy had. After eating and giving away cookies, the number of cookies left for the basketball team is:
   \[
   x - 8
   \]
   - Since the basketball team took all the remaining cookies, we set up the equation:
   \[
   x - 8 = 64
   \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 64 + 8 = 72
   \]

Thus, the total number of chocolate cookies Andy originally had is:
\[
\boxed{72}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many cookies the basketball team took. 

The pattern of the basketball team taking cookies is an arithmetic sequence, where the first term is 1, the difference between terms is 2, and there are 8 terms (since there are 8 players).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula: 

Sum = n/2 * (a + l)

where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.

In this case, the last term can be found by adding ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Andy had a platter of chocolate cookies.
   * He ate 3 cookies.
   * He gave his little brother 5 cookies.
   * There are 8 players in Andy's basketball team.
   * The players took cookies in an arithmetic sequence: 1, 3, 5, and so on.

2. Calculate the number of cookies Andy and his brother took:
   * Cookies taken by Andy and his brother = 3 + 5 = 8 cookies
