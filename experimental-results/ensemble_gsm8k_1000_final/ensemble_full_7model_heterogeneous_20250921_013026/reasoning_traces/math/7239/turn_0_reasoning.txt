=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Scout made over the weekend, we need to calculate his earnings from both his hourly wage and the tips he received from delivering groceries. We will break this down step by step for both Saturday and Sunday.

### Step 1: Calculate Saturday's Earnings

**Hourly Wage:**
- Scout's base pay is $10.00 per hour.
- He worked for 4 hours on Saturday.

To find his earnings from his hourly wage on Saturday:
\[
\text{Earnings from hourly wage} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked}
\]
\[
\text{Earnings from hourly wage} = 10.00 \, \text{USD/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 40.00 \, \text{USD}
\]

**Tips:**
- Scout delivered groceries to 5 customers on Saturday.
- He earns $5.00 per customer.

To find his earnings from tips on Saturday:
\[
\text{Earnings from tips} = \text{Tip per customer} \times \text{Number of customers}
\]
\[
\text{Earnings from tips} = 5.00 \, \text{USD/customer} \times 5 \, \text{customers} = 25.00 \, \text{USD}
\]

**Total Earnings on Saturday:**
Now, we add his earnings from the hourly wage and tips:
\[
\text{Total earnings on Saturday} = \text{Earnings from hourly wage} + \text{Earnings from tips}
\]
\[
\text{Total earnings on Saturday} = 40.00 \, \text{USD} + 25.00 \, \text{USD} = 65.00 \, \text{USD}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Sunday's Earnings

**Hourly Wage:**
- Scout's base pay is still $10.00 per hour.
- He worked for 5 hours on Sunday.

To find his earnings from his hourly wage on Sunday:
\[
\text{Earnings from hourly wage} = 10.00 \, \text{USD/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50.00 \, \text{USD}
\]

**Tips:**
- Scout delivered groceries to 8 customers on Sunday.
- He earns $5.00 per customer.

To find his earnings from tips on Sunday:
\[
\text{Earnings from tips} = 5.00 \, \text{USD/customer} \times 8 \, \text{customers} = 40.00 \, \text{USD}
\]

**Total Earnings on Sunday:**
Now, we add his earnings from the hourly wage and tips:
\[
\text{Total earnings on Sunday} = \text{Earnings from hourly wage} + \text{Earnings from tips}
\]
\[
\text{Total earnings on Sunday} = 50.00 \, \text{USD} + 40.00 \, \text{USD} = 90.00 \, \text{USD}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Earnings Over the Weekend

Finally, we add the total earnings from both Saturday and Sunday:
\[
\text{Total earnings over the weekend} = \text{Total earnings on Saturday} + \text{Total earnings on Sunday}
\]
\[
\text{Total earnings over the weekend} = 65.00 \, \text{USD} + 90.00 \, \text{USD} = 155.00 \, \text{USD}
\]

### Final Answer
Scout made a total of **$155.00** over the weekend.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Scout's earnings can be divided into two parts: his base pay and his tips.

First, let's calculate his base pay. He worked 4 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so he worked a total of 4 + 5 = <<4+5=9>>9 hours over the weekend. Since his base pay is $10.00 an hour, his total base pay for the weekend is 9 hours * $10.00/hour = $<<9*10=90.00>>90.00.

Next, let's calculate his tips. He delivered groceries to 5 people on Saturday and 8 people on Sunday, so he delivered g...
