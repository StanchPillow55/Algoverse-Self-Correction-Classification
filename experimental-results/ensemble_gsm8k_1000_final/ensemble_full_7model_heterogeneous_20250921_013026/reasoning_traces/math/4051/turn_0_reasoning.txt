=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much each of the five friends will pay if they split the bill equally, we first need to calculate the total cost of their orders. We will break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of Taco Salad**: 
   - The cost of the platter of Taco Salad is $10.

2. **Cost of Dave's Single hamburgers**: 
   - Each Dave's Single hamburger costs $5.
   - They ordered 5 hamburgers.
   - Total cost for hamburgers = 5 hamburgers × $5/hamburger = $25.

3. **Cost of French fries**: 
   - Each set of french fries costs $2.50.
   - They ordered 4 sets of french fries.
   - Total cost for french fries = 4 sets × $2.50/set = $10.

4. **Cost of Peach lemonade**: 
   - Each cup of peach lemonade costs $2.
   - They ordered 5 cups of peach lemonade.
   - Total cost for peach lemonade = 5 cups × $2/cup = $10.

Now, we will sum all these costs to find the total bill:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Taco Salad} + \text{Cost of Hamburgers} + \text{Cost of French Fries} + \text{Cost of Peach Lemonade}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 10 + 25 + 10 + 10
\]

Calculating the total:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 10 + 25 = 35
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 35 + 10 = 45
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 45 + 10 = 55
\]

So, the total cost of the meal is **$55**.

Next, we need to find out how much each friend will pay if they split the bill equally among the 5 friends:

\[
\text{Cost per person} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of friends}} = \frac{55}{5}
\]

Calculating the cost per person:

\[
\text{Cost per person} = 11
\]

Thus, each friend will pay **$11**.

Final answer: Each friend will pay **$11**.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total cost of the meal. 

The cost of the Taco Salad is $10. 

The cost of the Dave's Single hamburgers is 5 hamburgers * $5 each = $25. 

The cost of the french fries is 4 sets * $2.50 each = $10. 

The cost of the peach lemonade is 5 cups * $2 each = $10. 

Adding all these together, the total cost of the meal is $10 (Taco Salad) + $25 (hamburgers) + $10 (french fries) + $10 (peach lemonade) = $55. 

Since there are ...
