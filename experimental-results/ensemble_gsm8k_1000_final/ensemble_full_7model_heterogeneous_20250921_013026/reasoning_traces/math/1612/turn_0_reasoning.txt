=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Paul's gross earnings for 40 hours of work.**
2. **Determine the amount deducted for taxes and fees.**
3. **Calculate Paul's net earnings after taxes and fees.**
4. **Find out how much Paul spends on gummy bears.**
5. **Calculate how much money Paul has left after his purchase.**

### Step 1: Calculate Gross Earnings

Paul earns $12.50 per hour. If he works for 40 hours, his gross earnings can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Gross Earnings} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours Worked}
\]
\[
\text{Gross Earnings} = 12.50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours} = 500 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Deductions for Taxes and Fees

Paul has to pay 20% of his gross earnings in taxes and fees. We can calculate the amount deducted as follows:

\[
\text{Deductions} = \text{Gross Earnings} \times \text{Tax Rate}
\]
\[
\text{Deductions} = 500 \, \text{dollars} \times 0.20 = 100 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Net Earnings

Now, we can find Paul's net earnings after the deductions:

\[
\text{Net Earnings} = \text{Gross Earnings} - \text{Deductions}
\]
\[
\text{Net Earnings} = 500 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 400 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Spending on Gummy Bears

Paul spends 15% of his net earnings on gummy bears. We can calculate the amount he spends as follows:

\[
\text{Spending on Gummy Bears} = \text{Net Earnings} \times \text{Spending Rate}
\]
\[
\text{Spending on Gummy Bears} = 400 \, \text{dollars} \times 0.15 = 60 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Amount Left After Purchase

Finally, we can find out how much money Paul has left after buying gummy bears:

\[
\text{Amount Left} = \text{Net Earnings} - \text{Spending on Gummy Bears}
\]
\[
\text{Amount Left} = 400 \, \text{dollars} - 60 \, \text{dollars} = 340 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Paul has **$340** left after spending on gummy bears.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how much Paul earns before taxes and fees. He earns $12.50 per hour and he worked 40 hours, so his total earnings are 12.50 * 40 = $500.

Next, we need to calculate how much Paul pays in taxes and fees. He pays 20% of his earnings, so he pays 500 * 0.20 = $100 in taxes and fees.

After paying taxes and fees, Paul has 500 - 100 = $400 left.

Then, Paul spends 15% of his paycheck on gummy bears. So, he spends 400 * 0.15 = $60 on gummy bears.

1. Calculate Paul's gross pay (before taxes and fees):
   * Paul earns $12.50 per hour and works for 40 hours.
   * Gross pay = Hourly rate × Hours worked
   * Gross pay = $12.50 × 40
   * Gross pay = $500

2. Calculate the amount of taxes and fees Paul has to pay:
   * Paul has to pay 20% of his gross pay in taxes and fees.
   * Taxes and fees = 20% of gross pay
   * Taxes and fees = 0.20 × $500
