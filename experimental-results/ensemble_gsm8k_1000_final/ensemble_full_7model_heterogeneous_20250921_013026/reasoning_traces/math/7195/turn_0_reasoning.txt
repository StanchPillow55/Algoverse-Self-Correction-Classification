Final Answer: To determine how many puppies Dorchester washed on Wednesday, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

1. **Identify the components of Dorchester's earnings**:
   - He earns a fixed amount of $40 per day.
   - He earns an additional $2.25 for each puppy he washes.

2. **Let \( x \) represent the number of puppies washed**. 
   - The total earnings from washing puppies would then be \( 2.25x \).

3. **Set up the equation for total earnings**:
   - The total earnings on Wednesday can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Fixed Earnings} + \text{Earnings from Puppies}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     76 = 40 + 2.25x
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - First, subtract the fixed earnings from both sides:
     \[
     76 - 40 = 2.25x
     \]
     \[
     36 = 2.25x
     \]

   - Next, divide both sides by 2.25 to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{36}{2.25}
     \]

5. **Calculate \( \frac{36}{2.25} \)**:
   - To simplify the division, we can convert 2.25 to a fraction:
     \[
     2.25 = \frac{225}{100} = \frac{9}{4}
     \]
   - Thus, we have:
     \[
     x = \frac{36}{\frac{9}{4}} = 36 \times \frac{4}{9} = \frac{144}{9} = 16
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Dorchester washed **16 puppies** on Wednesday.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of puppies Dorchester washed on Wednesday.

Given information:
- Dorchester is paid $40 per day.
- Dorchester is paid $2.25 for each puppy he washes.
- On Wednesday, Dorchester earned $76.

Let's represent the number of puppies Dorchester washed on Wednesday as "x".

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent Dorchester's earnings on Wednesday.
Dorchester's earnings = Base pay + Pay per puppy washed
$76 =...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Dorchester's earnings for a day can be calculated by adding his daily pay of $40 to the product of the number of puppies he washes and the amount he earns per puppy. 

So, if P represents the number of puppies he washed on Wednesday, we can set up the following equation to represent his earnings for that day:

40 + 2.25P = 76

To solve for P, we first isolate the term with P by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

2.25P = 76 - 40
2.25P = 36

Then, we divide bo...
