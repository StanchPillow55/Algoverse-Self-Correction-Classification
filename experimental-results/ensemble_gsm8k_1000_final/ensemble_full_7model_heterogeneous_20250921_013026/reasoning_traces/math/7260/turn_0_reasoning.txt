=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of birds in the park, we need to calculate the number of blackbirds and add that to the number of magpies.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of blackbirds.**

We know that there are 3 blackbirds in each of the park's 7 trees. To find the total number of blackbirds, we multiply the number of blackbirds per tree by the number of trees:

\[
\text{Total blackbirds} = \text{Number of blackbirds per tree} \times \text{Number of trees}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Total blackbirds} = 3 \text{ blackbirds/tree} \times 7 \text{ trees} = 21 \text{ blackbirds}
\]

**Step 2: Add the number of magpies.**

Next, we know that there are 13 magpies roaming around the park. 

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of birds.**

Now, we add the total number of blackbirds to the total number of magpies:

\[
\text{Total birds} = \text{Total blackbirds} + \text{Total magpies}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total birds} = 21 \text{ blackbirds} + 13 \text{ magpies} = 34 \text{ birds}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The total number of birds in the park is \( \boxed{34} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of birds in the park by adding the number of blackbirds and the number of magpies.

Given information:
- There are 3 blackbirds in each of the 7 trees in the park.
- There are 13 magpies roaming around the park.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of blackbirds in the park.
Number of blackbirds per tree × Number of trees = Total number of blackbirds
3 blackbirds × 7 trees = 21 blackbirds

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of birds in the park by considering both the blackbirds in the trees and the magpies roaming around.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of blackbirds.**

We are given that there are 3 blackbirds in each of the park's 7 trees. To find the total number of blackbirds, we multiply the number of blackbirds per tree by the number of trees:

\[
\text{Number of blackbirds} = 3 \, \text{blackbirds/tree} \times 7 \, \text{t...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many blackbirds are in the park. Since there are 3 blackbirds in each of the park's 7 trees, we multiply 3 by 7 to get the total number of blackbirds. 

3 blackbirds/tree * 7 trees = 21 blackbirds

Next, we add the number of magpies to the number of blackbirds to find the total number of birds in the park. 

21 blackbirds + 13 magpies = 34 birds

So, there are 34 birds in the park in total.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 7 trees in the park.
   * Each tree has 3 blackbirds.
   * There are also 13 magpies roaming around the park.

2. Calculate the total number of blackbirds:
   * Number of blackbirds per tree = 3
   * Number of trees = 7
   * Total number of blackbirds = Number of blackbirds per tree × Number of trees
   * Total number of blackbirds = 3 × 7 = 21

3. Add ...
