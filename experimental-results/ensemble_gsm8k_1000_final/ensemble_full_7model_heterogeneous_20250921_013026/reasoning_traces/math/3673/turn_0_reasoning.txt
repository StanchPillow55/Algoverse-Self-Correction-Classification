=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much shorter Lucille's house is than the average height of the houses, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the heights of the houses**:
   - Lucille's house: \( L \) (unknown height)
   - Neighbor 1's house: 80 feet
   - Neighbor 2's house: 70 feet
   - Neighbor 3's house: 99 feet

2. **Calculate the average height of the houses**:
   To find the average height, we first need to sum the heights of all the houses and then divide by the number of houses.

   The formula for the average height is:
   \[
   \text{Average height} = \frac{\text{Sum of heights}}{\text{Number of houses}}
   \]

   The sum of the heights of the three neighbors' houses is:
   \[
   80 + 70 + 99 = 249 \text{ feet}
   \]

   There are 3 houses (the two neighbors and Lucille's house). Therefore, the average height of the three houses is:
   \[
   \text{Average height} = \frac{249}{3} = 83 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine how much shorter Lucille's house is than the average height**:
   We need to find the difference between the average height and Lucille's house height. Since we do not know the height of Lucille's house, we will denote it as \( L \).

   The difference is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Average height} - L = 83 - L
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Since we do not have the specific height of Lucille's house, we cannot provide a numerical answer for how much shorter it is than the average height. However, we can express it as:
   \[
   \text{Lucille's house is } (83 - L) \text{ feet shorter than the average height.}
   \]

If Lucille provides the height of her house, we can substitute \( L \) with that value to find the exact difference.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the average height of the houses and then calculate the difference between Lucille's house height and the average height.

Given information:
- Lucille's house is 80 feet tall.
- One neighbor's house is 70 feet tall.
- Another neighbor's house is 99 feet tall.

Step 1: Calculate the average height of the houses.
Average height = (Lucille's house height + Neighbor 1's house height + Neighbor 2's house height) / 3
...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how much shorter Lucille's house is than the average height of the houses, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the heights of all the houses:**
   - Lucille's house: 80 feet
   - First neighbor's house: 70 feet
   - Second neighbor's house: 99 feet

2. **Calculate the average height of the houses:**
   - First, sum up the heights of all the houses:
     \[
     80 + 70 + 99 = 249 \text{ feet}
     \]
   - Next, divide the total sum by the number of...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find the average height of the three houses. 

To do this, we add the heights of the three houses together and then divide by the number of houses. 

So, the total height of the three houses is 80 feet (Lucille's house) + 70 feet (first neighbor's house) + 99 feet (second neighbor's house) = 249 feet.

The average height is then 249 feet / 3 houses = 83 feet (rounded to the nearest whole number).

Now, we need to find out how much shorter Lucille's house...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Lucille's house is 80 feet tall.
   * One neighbor's house is 70 feet tall.
   * Another neighbor's house is 99 feet tall.

2. Calculate the average height of the three houses:
   * To find the average, we add up all the heights and divide by the number of houses.
   * Total height = Lucille's house + Neighbor 1's house + Neighbor 2's house
   * Total height = 80...
