=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let \( x \) represent the number of Oreos that Jordan has. According to the problem, James has 7 more than 4 times the number of Oreos that Jordan has. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[
\text{James' Oreos} = 4x + 7
\]

We also know that the total number of Oreos is 52. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
x + (4x + 7) = 52
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms on the left side:
   \[
   x + 4x + 7 = 52
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   5x + 7 = 52
   \]

2. Next, we need to isolate \( 5x \). We can do this by subtracting 7 from both sides:
   \[
   5x + 7 - 7 = 52 - 7
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   5x = 45
   \]

3. Now, we can solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 5:
   \[
   x = \frac{45}{5} = 9
   \]

Now that we have found \( x \), which is the number of Oreos Jordan has, we can find out how many Oreos James has. We substitute \( x = 9 \) back into the equation for James' Oreos:

\[
\text{James' Oreos} = 4x + 7 = 4(9) + 7
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{James' Oreos} = 36 + 7 = 43
\]

Thus, the final answer is that James has:

\[
\boxed{43}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- James has 7 more than 4 times the number of Oreos Jordan has.
- There are 52 Oreos total.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of Oreos Jordan has.
- Then, the number of Oreos James has is 4x + 7.

We know the total number of Oreos is 52, so we can set up an equation:
x + (4x + 7) = 52

Solving this equation:
x + 4x + 7 = 52
5x + 7 = 52
5x = 45
x = 9

Now that we know Jordan ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of Oreos Jordan has as J and the number of Oreos James has as O.

According to the problem, we know that:

1) James has 7 more than 4 times the number of Oreos Jordan has, so we can write this as: O = 4J + 7

2) The total number of Oreos is 52, so we can write this as: O + J = 52

We can solve this system of equations by substitution. 

First, we can substitute the first equation into the second to get: 4J + 7 + J = 52

Combine like terms to get: 5...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. To find out how many Oreos James has, we need to set up an equation using the information given.

Given:
- James has 7 more than 4 times the number of Oreos Jordan has.
- There are 52 Oreos in total.

Step 1: Let's define a variable for the number of Oreos Jordan has.
Let x = the number of Oreos Jordan has

Step 2: Express the number of Oreos James has in terms of x.
James has 7 more than 4 times the numb...
