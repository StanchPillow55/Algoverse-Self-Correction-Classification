=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, given that she has just completed five years at the company and is eligible for a salary increase.

1. **Initial Monthly Salary**: 
   Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600.

2. **Annual Salary Calculation**:
   To find her annual salary, we multiply her monthly salary by the number of months in a year:
   \[
   \text{Annual Salary} = \text{Monthly Salary} \times 12 = 600 \times 12 = 7200
   \]
   So, Sylvie's initial annual salary is $7200.

3. **Salary Increase Policy**:
   The company increases the salaries of employees who have been with the company for five years by 10% of their initial salary every year. Since Sylvie has just completed five years, she will receive her first salary increase.

4. **Calculating the 10% Increase**:
   The increase is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of Initial Salary} = 0.10 \times 7200 = 720
   \]
   Therefore, the increase in her salary after five years is $720.

5. **New Annual Salary After First Increase**:
   After the first increase, her new annual salary will be:
   \[
   \text{New Annual Salary} = \text{Initial Annual Salary} + \text{Increase} = 7200 + 720 = 7920
   \]

6. **Subsequent Increases**:
   Sylvie will receive this 10% increase every year for the next three years. We will calculate her salary for each of the next three years.

   - **Year 1 (After 6 years)**:
     \[
     \text{Increase} = 0.10 \times 7920 = 792
     \]
     \[
     \text{New Annual Salary} = 7920 + 792 = 8712
     \]

   - **Year 2 (After 7 years)**:
     \[
     \text{Increase} = 0.10 \times 8712 = 871.20
     \]
     \[
     \text{New Annual Salary} = 8712 + 871.20 = 9583.20
     \]

   - **Year 3 (After 8 years)**:
     \[
     \text{Increase} = 0.10 \times 9583.20 = 958.32
     \]
     \[
     \text{New Annual Salary} = 9583.20 + 958.32 = 10541.52
     \]

7. **Final Annual Salary After Three More Years**:
   After three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary will be:
   \[
   \text{Final Annual Salary} = 10541.52
   \]

Thus, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is **$10,541.52**.
