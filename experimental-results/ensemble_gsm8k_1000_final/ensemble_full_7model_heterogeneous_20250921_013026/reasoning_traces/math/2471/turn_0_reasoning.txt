=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much John pays for his hotel stay, we can break the problem down into a few simple steps.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the hotel stay before the discount:**
   John is booking the hotel room for 3 nights, and the cost per night is $250. Therefore, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Nights} \times \text{Cost per Night}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 3 \text{ nights} \times 250 \text{ dollars/night} = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Apply the discount:**
   John has a discount of $100. To find out how much he actually pays after applying the discount, we subtract the discount from the total cost:

   \[
   \text{Amount Paid} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Discount}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Amount Paid} = 750 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 650 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   After performing the calculations, we find that John pays a total of $650 for his 3-night stay at the hotel after applying the discount.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{650}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- John books 3 nights at a hotel room.
- The cost per night is $250.
- John has a $100 discount.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the hotel room without the discount.
Total cost without discount = Number of nights × Cost per night
Total cost without discount = 3 × $250 = $750

Step 2: Apply the $100 discount to the total cost.
Total cost with discount = Total cost without discount - Discount...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of John's hotel stay before applying the discount and then subtract the discount from this total to find out how much John pays.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the hotel stay before the discount.**

John books 3 nights at a hotel, and the cost per night is $250. To find the total cost for 3 nights, we multiply the number of nights by the cost per night:

\[
\text{Total cost before discount} = \text{Number ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total cost of the hotel room for 3 nights without the discount. This can be done by multiplying the cost per night ($250) by the number of nights (3). 

So, $250 * 3 = $750

Next, we subtract the discount from the total cost. The discount is $100. 

So, $750 - $100 = $650

Therefore, John pays $650 for 3 nights at the hotel after the discount.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * John is booking a hotel room for 3 nights.
   * The cost of the room is $250 per night.
   * He has a discount of $100.

2. Calculate the total cost of the room without the discount:
   * Cost per night = $250
   * Number of nights = 3
   * Total cost = Cost per night × Number of nights
   * Total cost = $250 × 3 = $750

3. Apply the discount to the total cost:
   * Di...
