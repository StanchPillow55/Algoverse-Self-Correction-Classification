Final Answer: To determine the total yield of corn from Jorge's 60 acres of property, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

1. **Identify the types of soil and their respective yields:**
   - Good soil yields 400 bushels per acre.
   - Clay-rich soil yields half of that, which is:
     \[
     \text{Yield from clay-rich soil} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ bushels per acre}
     \]

2. **Determine the distribution of soil types on Jorge's property:**
   - Total acres of land = 60 acres.
   - One-third of the land is clay-rich soil:
     \[
     \text{Acres of clay-rich soil} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \text{ acres}
     \]
   - The remaining land is good soil:
     \[
     \text{Acres of good soil} = 60 - 20 = 40 \text{ acres}
     \]

3. **Calculate the yield from each type of soil:**
   - **Yield from good soil:**
     \[
     \text{Yield from good soil} = \text{Acres of good soil} \times \text{Yield per acre from good soil}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Yield from good soil} = 40 \text{ acres} \times 400 \text{ bushels/acre} = 16000 \text{ bushels}
     \]

   - **Yield from clay-rich soil:**
     \[
     \text{Yield from clay-rich soil} = \text{Acres of clay-rich soil} \times \text{Yield per acre from clay-rich soil}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Yield from clay-rich soil} = 20 \text{ acres} \times 200 \text{ bushels/acre} = 4000 \text{ bushels}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total yield:**
   - Total yield from both types of soil:
     \[
     \text{Total yield} = \text{Yield from good soil} + \text{Yield from clay-rich soil}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total yield} = 16000 \text{ bushels} + 4000 \text{ bushels} = 20000 \text{ bushels}
     \]

Thus, the total yield of corn from Jorge's land last year is:

\[
\boxed{20000} \text{ bushels}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total yield of corn from Jorge's land, which consists of both good soil and clay-rich soil.

Given information:
- Jorge has 60 acres of property.
- Corn grown on good soil yields 400 bushels per acre.
- Corn grown on clay-rich soil yields half as much as corn grown on good soil.
- One-third of Jorge's 60 acres is clay-rich soil, and the rest is good soil.

Step 1: Calculate the area of good soil and clay-rich...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total yield of corn from Jorge's 60 acres of land, taking into account the different yields from good soil and clay-rich soil.

1. **Determine the acreage of each type of soil:**

   - Jorge's total land is 60 acres.
   - One-third of the land is clay-rich soil.

   \[
   \text{Clay-rich soil acreage} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \text{ acres}
   \]

   - The remaining land is good soil.

   \[
   \text{Good soil acreage} =...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how much of Jorge's land is clay-rich soil and how much is good soil. 

One-third of Jorge's 60 acres of land is clay-rich soil. To find out how many acres this is, we multiply 60 by 1/3:

60 * 1/3 = 20 acres

This means that the remaining two-thirds of Jorge's land, or 60 - 20 = 40 acres, is good soil.

Next, we need to calculate how many bushels of corn each type of soil yields. 

Good soil yields 400 bushels per acre, so 40 acres of good soi...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given information:
- Jorge has 60 acres of property.
- Corn grown on good soil yields 400 bushels per acre.
- In clay-rich soil, the yield is half as much per acre as in good soil.
- One-third of Jorge's 60 acres of land is clay-rich soil.
- The rest of Jorge's land is good soil.

Step 1: Calculate the number of acres of clay-rich soil.
One-third of 60 acres = 1/3 Ã— 60 = 20 acres of clay-ri...
