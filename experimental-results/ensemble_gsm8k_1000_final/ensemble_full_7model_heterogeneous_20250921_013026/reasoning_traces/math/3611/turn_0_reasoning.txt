=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much Dabbie spent on all the turkeys, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the weight of the third turkey.**
   - The weight of the second turkey is given as 9 kilograms.
   - The weight of the third turkey is twice the weight of the second turkey.
   - Therefore, the weight of the third turkey is:
     \[
     \text{Weight of third turkey} = 2 \times \text{Weight of second turkey} = 2 \times 9 \text{ kg} = 18 \text{ kg}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of all the turkeys.**
   - We have the weights of the three turkeys:
     - First turkey: 6 kg
     - Second turkey: 9 kg
     - Third turkey: 18 kg
   - Now, we add these weights together to find the total weight:
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of first turkey} + \text{Weight of second turkey} + \text{Weight of third turkey}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = 6 \text{ kg} + 9 \text{ kg} + 18 \text{ kg} = 33 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the turkeys.**
   - The cost per kilogram of turkey is given as $2.
   - To find the total cost, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Total weight} \times \text{Cost per kilogram}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 33 \text{ kg} \times 2 \text{ dollars/kg} = 66 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   - Dabbie spent a total of $66 on all the turkeys.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{66}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Dabbie bought 3 turkeys for Thanksgiving.
- The first turkey is 6 kilograms.
- The second turkey is 9 kilograms.
- The third turkey's weight is twice the weight of the second turkey.
- The cost of a kilogram of turkey is $2.

Step 1: Find the weight of the third turkey.
Weight of the third turkey = 2 × Weight of the second turkey
Weight of the third turkey = 2 × 9 kg = 18 kg

Step 2: Calculate...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weight of all the turkeys Dabbie bought and then calculate the total cost based on the price per kilogram.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the weight of each turkey:**
   - The first turkey weighs 6 kilograms.
   - The second turkey weighs 9 kilograms.
   - The third turkey weighs twice the weight of the second turkey. Since the second turkey is 9 kilograms, the third turkey weighs:
     \[
     2 \times 9...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out the weight of the third turkey. Since it's twice the weight of the second turkey, which is 9 kilograms, the third turkey weighs 2 * 9 = 18 kilograms.

Next, we add up the weights of all the turkeys to find the total weight. The total weight is 6 (first turkey) + 9 (second turkey) + 18 (third turkey) = 33 kilograms.

Finally, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find out how much Dabbie spent. The total cost is 33 (total weigh...
