=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost for each of them after applying any discounts.

### Step 1: Calculate Becky's total cost

1. **Price per apple**: 45 cents
2. **Number of apples**: 20
3. **Total cost before discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Price per apple} \times \text{Number of apples} = 0.45 \times 20 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Discount**: $1
5. **Total cost after discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount} = 9.00 - 1.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Kelly's total cost

1. **Price per apple**: 50 cents
2. **Number of apples**: 20
3. **Total cost before discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Price per apple} \times \text{Number of apples} = 0.50 \times 20 = 10.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Discount**: 10 percent of the total cost
5. **Calculating the discount**:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 10\% \text{ of } 10.00 = 0.10 \times 10.00 = 1.00 \text{ dollar}
   \]
6. **Total cost after discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount} = 10.00 - 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 3: Determine how much more Kelly paid than Becky

1. **Becky's total cost**: $8.00
2. **Kelly's total cost**: $9.00
3. **Difference**:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Kelly's total cost} - \text{Becky's total cost} = 9.00 - 8.00 = 1.00 \text{ dollar}
   \]

### Final Answer

Kelly paid **$1.00** more than Becky.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount.
- Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost for Becky's apples.
Total cost for Becky's apples = (20 apples × $0.45 per apple) - $1 discount
Total cost for Becky's apples = $9 - $1 = $8

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for Kelly's apples.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for both Becky and Kelly and then find the difference between the two amounts.

**Step 1: Calculate Becky's total cost.**

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each. First, we calculate the total cost before the discount:

\[
\text{Total cost before discount for Becky} = 20 \times 45 \text{ cents} = 900 \text{ cents}
\]

Becky received a $1 discount. Since $1 is equivalent to 100 cents, we subtract this from the to...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

The cost of each apple is 45 cents, so for 20 apples, the cost would be 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents or $9. 

Becky received a $1 discount, so the total amount she paid is $9 - $1 = $8.

Now, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

The cost of each apple is 50 cents, so for 20 apples, the cost would be 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents or $10.

Kelly received a 10 percent discount, so the discount amount is 10...
