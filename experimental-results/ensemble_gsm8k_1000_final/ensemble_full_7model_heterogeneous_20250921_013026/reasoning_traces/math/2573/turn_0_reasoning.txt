=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of problems each person composes:**
   - Bill composes 20 math questions.
   - Ryan composes twice as many problems as Bill. Therefore, the number of problems Ryan composes is:
     \[
     \text{Ryan's problems} = 2 \times \text{Bill's problems} = 2 \times 20 = 40
     \]
   - Frank composes three times as many problems as Ryan. Therefore, the number of problems Frank composes is:
     \[
     \text{Frank's problems} = 3 \times \text{Ryan's problems} = 3 \times 40 = 120
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of problems composed by each person:**
   - Bill: 20 problems
   - Ryan: 40 problems
   - Frank: 120 problems

3. **Determine the total number of problems composed by all three:**
   \[
   \text{Total problems} = \text{Bill's problems} + \text{Ryan's problems} + \text{Frank's problems} = 20 + 40 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. **Determine the number of problems of each type:**
   - Each person has to compose 4 different types of math problems in equal proportion. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of problems each person composes by the number of types.
   - For Frank, who composes 120 problems, the number of problems of each type is:
     \[
     \text{Problems of each type} = \frac{\text{Frank's problems}}{\text{Number of types}} = \frac{120}{4} = 30
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Frank composes 30 problems of each type.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of problems each person composes:**
   - Bill composes 20 math questions.
   - Ryan composes twice as many problems as Bill. Therefore, the number of problems Ryan composes is:
     \[
     \text{Ryan's problems} = 2 \times \text{Bill's problems} = 2 \times 20 = 40
     \]
   - Frank composes three times as many problems as Ryan. Therefore, the number of problems Frank composes is:
...

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of problems composed by all three people, and then determine the number of problems of each type that Frank composes.

Given information:
- Bill composes 20 total math questions.
- Ryan composes twice as many problems as Bill.
- Frank composes 3 times as many problems as Ryan.
- Each person has to compose 4 different types of math problems in equal proportion out of the total amount.

Step 1: Cal...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many math problems each person composes and then find out how many problems of each type Frank composes.

### Step 1: Determine the number of problems each person composes.

1. **Bill's Problems:**
   Bill composes 20 math questions.

2. **Ryan's Problems:**
   Ryan composes twice as many problems as Bill. Therefore, the number of problems Ryan composes is:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

3. **Frank's Problems:**
   Frank ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many problems Ryan and Frank compose.

Ryan composes twice as many problems as Bill, so he composes 2 * 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 problems.

Frank composes 3 times as many problems as Ryan, so he composes 3 * 40 = <<3*40=120>>120 problems.

Each person has to compose 4 different types of math problems in equal proportion out of the total amount. This means that Frank composes 120 / 4 = <<120/4=30>>30 problems of each type.

So, Frank composes 30 problem...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Bill composes 20 math questions in total.
   * Ryan composes twice as many problems as Bill.
   * Frank composes 3 times as many problems as Ryan.
   * Each person composes 4 different types of math problems in equal proportion.

2. Calculate the number of problems Ryan composes:
   * Ryan's problems = 2 × Bill's problems
   * Ryan's problems = 2 × 20 = 40 proble...
