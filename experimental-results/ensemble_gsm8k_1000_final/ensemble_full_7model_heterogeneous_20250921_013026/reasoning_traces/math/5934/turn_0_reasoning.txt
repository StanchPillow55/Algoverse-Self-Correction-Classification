=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will define the number of students in each of Ms. Cole's classes based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the number of students in the sixth-level class:**
   - We are given that the sixth-level class has 40 students.
   \[
   \text{Number of students in sixth-level class} = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of students in the fourth-level class:**
   - The problem states that there are four times as many students in the fourth-level class as in the sixth-level class.
   \[
   \text{Number of students in fourth-level class} = 4 \times \text{Number of students in sixth-level class} = 4 \times 40 = 160
   \]

3. **Determine the number of students in the seventh-level class:**
   - The problem states that the number of students in the seventh-level class is twice that in the fourth-level class.
   \[
   \text{Number of students in seventh-level class} = 2 \times \text{Number of students in fourth-level class} = 2 \times 160 = 320
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of students Ms. Cole teaches:**
   - Now, we will add the number of students in all three classes together.
   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of students in sixth-level class} + \text{Number of students in fourth-level class} + \text{Number of students in seventh-level class}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = 40 + 160 + 320
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = 520
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Ms. Cole teaches a total of **520 math students**.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by finding out how many students are in each class.

According to the problem, there are four times as many students in Ms. Cole's fourth-level math class as in her sixth-level math class. Since the sixth-level class has 40 students, we can find the number of students in the fourth-level class by multiplying 40 by 4.

40 students * 4 = 160 students

So, there are 160 students in the fourth-level class.

The problem also tells us that the number of students in ...
