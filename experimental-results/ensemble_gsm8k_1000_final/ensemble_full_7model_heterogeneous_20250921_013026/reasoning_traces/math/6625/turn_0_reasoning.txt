=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many apples Ivan uses for the mini pies and then find out how many apples he has left over after making them.

1. **Understanding the problem**: 
   - Ivan originally buys 48 apples.
   - He plans to make 24 full-size pies, but instead, he decides to make mini pies.
   - Each mini pie uses 1/2 an apple.
   - Ivan bakes 24 mini pies.

2. **Calculating the number of apples used for mini pies**:
   - Since each mini pie uses 1/2 an apple, we can calculate the total number of apples used for 24 mini pies as follows:
   \[
   \text{Apples used} = \text{Number of mini pies} \times \text{Apples per mini pie}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Apples used} = 24 \times \frac{1}{2} = 12 \text{ apples}
   \]

3. **Calculating the number of apples leftover**:
   - Ivan started with 48 apples and used 12 apples for the mini pies. To find out how many apples he has left, we subtract the number of apples used from the total number of apples he had:
   \[
   \text{Apples leftover} = \text{Total apples} - \text{Apples used}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Apples leftover} = 48 - 12 = 36 \text{ apples}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - After making 24 mini pies, Ivan has **36 apples** leftover.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of apples used for the mini pies and then subtract it from the total number of apples Ivan bought.

Given information:
- Ivan bought 48 apples to make 24 full-size pies.
- He decides to make 24 mini pies instead, which use 1/2 an apple each.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apples used for the mini pies.
Number of mini pies × Apples per mini pie = Total apples used for mini pies
24 × 1/2 = 12 apples

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many apples Ivan uses to make 24 mini pies and then subtract that number from the total number of apples he originally bought.

**Step 1: Determine the number of apples used for mini pies.**

Each mini pie uses \( \frac{1}{2} \) an apple. Ivan makes 24 mini pies. Therefore, the total number of apples used for the mini pies is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Number of apples used} = 24 \times \frac{1}{2} = 12
\]

**Step 2: ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many apples Ivan used for the mini pies. Since each mini pie uses 1/2 an apple, we multiply the number of mini pies by the amount of apple each one uses:

24 mini pies * 1/2 apple/mini pie = 12 apples

Next, we subtract the number of apples used from the total number of apples Ivan bought to find out how many he has left:

48 apples - 12 apples = 36 apples

So, Ivan has 36 apples leftover.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ivan buys 48 apples.
- Originally, he planned to make 24 full-size pies.
- He changes his mind and decides to make mini pies instead.
- Each mini pie uses 1/2 an apple.
- Ivan bakes 24 mini pies.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apples used for the mini pies.
- Each mini pie uses 1/2 an apple.
- Ivan bakes 24 mini pies.
Number of apples used = 1/2 apple per pie × 24 pies
