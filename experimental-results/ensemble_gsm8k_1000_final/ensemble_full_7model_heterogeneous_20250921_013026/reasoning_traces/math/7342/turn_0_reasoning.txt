=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money you saved by buying 3 shirts at the retailer, we need to calculate the total cost of the shirts with and without the discounts.

1. **Cost without discounts**:
   - Each shirt costs $10.
   - If you buy 3 shirts without any discounts, the total cost would be:
     \[
     \text{Total cost without discounts} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost with discounts**:
   - According to the sale:
     - The first shirt costs $10.
     - The second shirt is at a 50% discount, so:
       \[
       \text{Cost of second shirt} = 10 \times 0.5 = 5 \text{ dollars}
       \]
     - The third shirt is at a 60% discount, so:
       \[
       \text{Cost of third shirt} = 10 \times 0.4 = 4 \text{ dollars}
       \]
   - Now, we can calculate the total cost with the discounts:
     \[
     \text{Total cost with discounts} = 10 + 5 + 4 = 19 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculating the savings**:
   - To find out how much money you saved, we subtract the total cost with discounts from the total cost without discounts:
     \[
     \text{Savings} = \text{Total cost without discounts} - \text{Total cost with discounts}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Savings} = 30 - 19 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the amount of money saved by buying 3 shirts is \(\boxed{11}\) dollars.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the original cost of 3 shirts without any discounts. Since each shirt costs $10, the total cost for 3 shirts would be 3 * $10 = $30.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 3 shirts with the discounts applied. The first shirt is $10, the second shirt is $10 with a 50% discount, and the third shirt is $10 with a 60% discount.

The cost of the second shirt with the discount is $10 - ($10 * 50/100) = $5.

The cost of the third shirt with the discount is $10...
