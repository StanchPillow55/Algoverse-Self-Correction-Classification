=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of confirmed Coronavirus cases in New York, California, and Texas, and then sum these numbers to find the total.

1. **Identify the number of cases in New York:**
   - It is given that New York had 2000 confirmed cases.

2. **Determine the number of cases in California:**
   - The problem states that California had half the number of cases as New York.
   - Therefore, the number of cases in California can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cases in California} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cases in New York} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2000 = 1000
     \]

3. **Determine the number of cases in Texas:**
   - The problem states that California had 400 more cases than Texas.
   - Let \( T \) represent the number of cases in Texas. According to the information provided:
     \[
     \text{Cases in California} = T + 400
     \]
   - We already calculated that California has 1000 cases, so we can set up the equation:
     \[
     1000 = T + 400
     \]
   - To find \( T \), we can rearrange the equation:
     \[
     T = 1000 - 400 = 600
     \]

4. **Summing the cases in all states:**
   - Now we have the number of cases in each state:
     - New York: 2000 cases
     - California: 1000 cases
     - Texas: 600 cases
   - We can find the total number of cases by adding these values together:
     \[
     \text{Total cases} = \text{Cases in New York} + \text{Cases in California} + \text{Cases in Texas}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cases} = 2000 + 1000 + 600 = 3600
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - The total number of confirmed Coronavirus cases in New York, California, and Texas is:
     \[
     \boxed{3600}
     \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cases in each state and then add them together to get the total number of cases.

Given information:
- 2000 cases of Coronavirus were confirmed in the state of New York in May 2020.
- The number of cases in California was half the number of cases in New York.
- The number of cases in Texas was 400 less than the number of cases in California.

Step 1: Find the number of cases in California.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of confirmed Coronavirus cases in each of the three states mentioned: New York, California, and Texas. We will then sum these numbers to find the total number of cases confirmed in all three states.

1. **New York:**
   - It is given that New York had 2000 confirmed cases.

2. **California:**
   - It is stated that California had half the number of cases as New York.
   - Since New York had 2000 cases, California had...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by breaking down the information given in the problem.

1. We know that New York had 2000 confirmed cases.

2. California had half the number of cases as New York, so California had 2000/2 = 1000 cases.

3. California had 400 more cases than Texas. So, Texas had 1000 - 400 = 600 cases.

Now, to find the total number of cases in all three states, we simply add the number of cases in each state together.

So, the total number of cases is 2000 (New York) + 1000 (...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given information:
- New York had 2000 confirmed cases of Coronavirus in May 2020.
- California had half the number of cases as New York.
- Texas had 400 fewer cases than California.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cases in California.
California cases = 1/2 × New York cases
California cases = 1/2 × 2000 = 1000

Step 2: Calculate the number of cases in Texas.
Texas cases = California cases...
