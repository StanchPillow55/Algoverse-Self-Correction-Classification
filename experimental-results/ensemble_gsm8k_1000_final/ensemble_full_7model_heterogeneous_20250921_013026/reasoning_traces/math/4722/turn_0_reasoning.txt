=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps to find out how many dresses Jane sews in total and then calculate how many ribbons she uses.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of dresses sewn in the first 7 days.
Jane sews 2 dresses a day for 7 days. We can calculate the total number of dresses sewn during this period as follows:

\[
\text{Dresses in 7 days} = \text{Dresses per day} \times \text{Number of days}
\]
\[
\text{Dresses in 7 days} = 2 \text{ dresses/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ dresses}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of dresses sewn in the next 2 days.
Next, Jane sews 3 dresses a day for 2 days. We calculate the total number of dresses sewn during this period:

\[
\text{Dresses in 2 days} = \text{Dresses per day} \times \text{Number of days}
\]
\[
\text{Dresses in 2 days} = 3 \text{ dresses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ dresses}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of dresses sewn.
Now, we add the number of dresses sewn in both periods to find the total number of dresses:

\[
\text{Total dresses} = \text{Dresses in 7 days} + \text{Dresses in 2 days}
\]
\[
\text{Total dresses} = 14 \text{ dresses} + 6 \text{ dresses} = 20 \text{ dresses}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of ribbons used.
Jane adds 2 ribbons to each dress. To find the total number of ribbons used, we multiply the total number of dresses by the number of ribbons per dress:

\[
\text{Total ribbons} = \text{Total dresses} \times \text{Ribbons per dress}
\]
\[
\text{Total ribbons} = 20 \text{ dresses} \times 2 \text{ ribbons/dress} = 40 \text{ ribbons}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of ribbons Jane uses is:

\[
\boxed{40}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Jane sews 2 dresses a day for 7 days.
- Then she sews 3 dresses a day for the next 2 days.
- She adds 2 ribbons to each dress.

Step 1: Calculate the number of dresses Jane sews in the first 7 days.
Number of dresses per day × Number of days = Total dresses in the first 7 days
2 dresses per day × 7 days = 14 dresses

Step 2: Calculate the number of dresses Jane sews in the next 2 ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of dresses Jane sews and then calculate the total number of ribbons she uses.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of dresses sewn in the first 7 days.**

Jane sews 2 dresses per day for 7 days. To find the total number of dresses sewn during this period, we multiply the number of dresses per day by the number of days:

\[
2 \text{ dresses/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ dresses}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the n...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many dresses Jane sews in total. 

She sews 2 dresses a day for 7 days, which is 2*7 = <<2*7=14>>14 dresses.

Then she sews 3 dresses a day for the next 2 days, which is 3*2 = <<3*2=6>>6 dresses.

So in total, Jane sews 14 + 6 = <<14+6=20>>20 dresses.

Then, she adds 2 ribbons to each dress. So the total number of ribbons she uses is 20*2 = <<20*2=40>>40 ribbons.

So, Jane uses 40 ribbons in total.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. First, let's calculate the number of dresses Jane sews in the first 7 days:
   * Jane sews 2 dresses per day for 7 days.
   * Number of dresses sewn in 7 days = 2 dresses/day × 7 days = 14 dresses

2. Next, let's calculate the number of dresses Jane sews in the next 2 days:
   * Jane sews 3 dresses per day for 2 days.
   * Number of dresses sewn in 2 days = 3 dresses/day × 2 days = 6 dresses

3. Now, let's ...
