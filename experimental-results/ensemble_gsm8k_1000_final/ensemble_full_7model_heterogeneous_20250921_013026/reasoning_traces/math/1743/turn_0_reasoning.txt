=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Wayne will spend on shrimp for his appetizer, we can break the problem down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of shrimp needed
Wayne plans to serve 5 shrimp per guest and has 40 guests. We can calculate the total number of shrimp needed by multiplying the number of guests by the number of shrimp per guest:

\[
\text{Total shrimp} = \text{Number of guests} \times \text{Shrimp per guest}
\]
\[
\text{Total shrimp} = 40 \text{ guests} \times 5 \text{ shrimp/guest} = 200 \text{ shrimp}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of pounds of shrimp needed
Next, we need to determine how many pounds of shrimp Wayne will need. We know that each pound contains 20 shrimp. To find the total pounds required, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp per pound:

\[
\text{Total pounds of shrimp} = \frac{\text{Total shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp per pound}}
\]
\[
\text{Total pounds of shrimp} = \frac{200 \text{ shrimp}}{20 \text{ shrimp/pound}} = 10 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the shrimp
Now that we know Wayne needs 10 pounds of shrimp and the cost per pound is $17.00, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of pounds by the cost per pound:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total pounds of shrimp} \times \text{Cost per pound}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 \text{ pounds} \times 17.00 \text{ dollars/pound} = 170.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Wayne will spend a total of **$170.00** on the shrimp cocktail appetizer for his guests.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Wayne plans to serve 5 shrimp per guest.
- There will be 40 guests.
- The shrimp costs $17.00 per pound.
- Each pound has 20 shrimp.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of shrimp needed.
Total number of shrimp = Number of shrimp per guest × Number of guests
Total number of shrimp = 5 × 40 = 200 shrimp

Step 2: Calculate the number of pounds of shrimp needed.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pounds of shrimp Wayne needs to buy and then calculate the total cost based on the price per pound.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of shrimp needed.**

Wayne plans to serve 5 shrimp per guest and he has 40 guests. Therefore, the total number of shrimp needed is:

\[ 
5 \text{ shrimp/guest} \times 40 \text{ guests} = 200 \text{ shrimp} 
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of pounds of shrimp needed.**

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many shrimp Wayne needs in total. He plans on serving 5 shrimp per guest and he has 40 guests, so he needs 5 * 40 = 200 shrimp.

Next, we need to determine how many pounds of shrimp Wayne needs to buy. Each pound of shrimp contains 20 shrimp, so Wayne needs 200 / 20 = 10 pounds of shrimp.

Finally, we need to determine how much Wayne will spend on the shrimp. The shrimp costs $17.00 per pound and Wayne needs 10 pounds, so he will spend 17 *...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Wayne plans to serve 5 shrimp per guest.
   * He will have 40 guests.
   * Shrimp costs $17.00 per pound.
   * Each pound of shrimp contains 20 shrimp.

2. Calculate the total number of shrimp needed:
   * Number of guests = 40
   * Shrimp per guest = 5
   * Total shrimp needed = Number of guests × Shrimp per guest
   * Total shrimp needed = 40 × 5 = 200 shrimp

3. Cal...
