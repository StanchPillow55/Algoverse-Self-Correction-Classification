Final Answer: To find out how much change Kendra received after her purchases, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the cost of the wooden toys:**
   - Kendra bought 2 wooden toys, and each wooden toy costs $20.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the wooden toys is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of wooden toys} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of the hats:**
   - Kendra bought 3 hats, and each hat costs $10.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the hats is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of hats} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of all items purchased:**
   - Now we add the total cost of the wooden toys and the total cost of the hats:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of wooden toys} + \text{Cost of hats} = 40 + 30 = 70 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine the amount of change Kendra receives:**
   - Kendra started with a $100 bill. To find out how much change she receives, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid:
     \[
     \text{Change} = \text{Amount paid} - \text{Total cost} = 100 - 70 = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the change Kendra received after her purchases is:

\[
\boxed{30 \text{ dollars}}
\]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden toys and hats that Kendra bought.

The price of one wooden toy is $20. Since Kendra bought two wooden toys, the total cost for the wooden toys is 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.

The price of one hat is $10. Since Kendra bought three hats, the total cost for the hats is 3 * $10 = $<<3*10=30>>30.

To find the total cost of the items Kendra bought, we add the cost of the wooden toys and the hats together. So, $40 (for the w...
