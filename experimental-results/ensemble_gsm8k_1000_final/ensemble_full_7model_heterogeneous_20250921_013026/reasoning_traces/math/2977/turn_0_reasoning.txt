=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how long each person can jump rope and then compare Tina's jumping time to Cindy's.

1. **Cindy's Jumping Time**:
   - Cindy can jump rope for **12 minutes**.

2. **Betsy's Jumping Time**:
   - Betsy can jump rope for half as long as Cindy. 
   - To find Betsy's time, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Betsy's time} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cindy's time} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ minutes} = 6 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Tina's Jumping Time**:
   - Tina can jump rope for three times as long as Betsy.
   - To find Tina's time, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Tina's time} = 3 \times \text{Betsy's time} = 3 \times 6 \text{ minutes} = 18 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Comparing Tina's and Cindy's Jumping Times**:
   - Now we need to find out how many more minutes Tina can jump rope than Cindy:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Tina's time} - \text{Cindy's time} = 18 \text{ minutes} - 12 \text{ minutes} = 6 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, Tina can jump rope **6 minutes longer** than Cindy.

**Final Answer**: Tina can jump rope 6 minutes longer than Cindy.

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to determine how long each person can jump rope and then compare Tina's jumping time to Cindy's.

1. **Cindy's Jumping Time**:
   - Cindy can jump rope for **12 minutes**.

2. **Betsy's Jumping Time**:
   - Betsy can jump rope for half as long as Cindy. 
   - To find Betsy's time, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Betsy's time} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cindy's time} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ minutes} = 6 \text{ minutes}

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Cindy can jump rope for 12 minutes before tripping up.
- Betsy can jump rope half as long as Cindy before tripping up.
- Tina can jump rope three times as long as Betsy.

Step 1: Calculate how long Betsy can jump rope before tripping up.
Betsy's jump rope time = Cindy's jump rope time / 2
Betsy's jump rope time = 12 minutes / 2 = 6 minutes

Step 2: Calculate how long Tina can jump rope be...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how long each person can jump rope and then compare the times for Tina and Cindy.

1. **Determine how long Betsy can jump rope:**
   - We know from the problem statement that Betsy can jump rope for half as long as Cindy.
   - Cindy can jump rope for 12 minutes.
   - Therefore, Betsy's jump rope time is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Betsy's time} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cindy's time} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how long Betsy can jump rope. Since Betsy can jump rope half as long as Cindy, we divide Cindy's time by 2. 

12 minutes / 2 = 6 minutes

So, Betsy can jump rope for 6 minutes before tripping up.

Next, we need to find out how long Tina can jump rope. Since Tina can jump three times as long as Betsy, we multiply Betsy's time by 3.

6 minutes * 3 = 18 minutes

So, Tina can jump rope for 18 minutes before tripping up.

Finally, to find out how man...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Cindy can jump rope for 12 minutes before tripping.
   * Betsy can jump rope for half as long as Cindy.
   * Tina can jump rope for three times as long as Betsy.

2. Calculate how long Betsy can jump rope:
   * Betsy's jumping time = 1/2 × Cindy's jumping time
   * Betsy's jumping time = 1/2 × 12 minutes
   * Betsy's jumping time = 6 minutes

3. Calculate how long T...
