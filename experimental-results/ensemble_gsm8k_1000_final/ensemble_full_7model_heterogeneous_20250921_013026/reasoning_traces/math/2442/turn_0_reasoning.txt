=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the hula hooping times for each person based on the information provided.

1. **Determine Nancy's hula hooping time:**
   - Nancy can hula hoop for **10 minutes**.

2. **Determine Casey's hula hooping time:**
   - Casey can hula hoop **3 minutes less than Nancy**.
   - Since Nancy hula hoops for 10 minutes, we calculate Casey's time as follows:
     \[
     \text{Casey's time} = \text{Nancy's time} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 10 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 7 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Determine Morgan's hula hooping time:**
   - Morgan can hula hoop **three times as long as Casey**.
   - We already calculated that Casey hula hoops for 7 minutes. Therefore, Morgan's time is:
     \[
     \text{Morgan's time} = 3 \times \text{Casey's time} = 3 \times 7 \text{ minutes} = 21 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Now that we have calculated the times for each person, we can summarize:

- Nancy: 10 minutes
- Casey: 7 minutes
- Morgan: 21 minutes

Finally, the question asks how long Morgan can hula hoop. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{21 \text{ minutes}}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Nancy can hula hoop for 10 minutes.
- Casey can hula hoop 3 minutes less than Nancy.
- Morgan can hula hoop three times as long as Casey.

Step 1: Find how long Casey can hula hoop.
Casey's hula hoop time = Nancy's hula hoop time - 3 minutes
Casey's hula hoop time = 10 minutes - 3 minutes = 7 minutes

Step 2: Find how long Morgan can hula hoop.
Morgan's hula hoop time = Casey's hula hoop ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how long each person can hula hoop and then use that information to find out how long Morgan can hula hoop.

1. **Determine how long Casey can hula hoop:**
   - We know that Nancy can hula hoop for 10 minutes.
   - Casey can hula hoop 3 minutes less than Nancy.
   - Therefore, we subtract 3 minutes from Nancy's time to find Casey's time:
     \[
     \text{Casey's time} = 10 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 7 \text{ minute...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Nancy can hula hoop for 10 minutes.

Casey can hula hoop 3 minutes less than Nancy, so Casey can hula hoop for 10 minutes - 3 minutes = 7 minutes.

Morgan can hula hoop three times as long as Casey, so Morgan can hula hoop for 3 * 7 minutes = 21 minutes.

Therefore, Morgan can hula hoop for 21 minutes.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Nancy can hula hoop for 10 minutes.
   * Casey can hula hoop 3 minutes less than Nancy.
   * Morgan can hula hoop three times as long as Casey.

2. Find out how long Casey can hula hoop:
   * Casey's hula hoop time = Nancy's hula hoop time - 3 minutes
   * Casey's hula hoop time = 10 minutes - 3 minutes
   * Casey's hula hoop time = 7 minutes

3. Calculate how long ...
