=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pennies James collected and then find the total number of pennies donated to charity by both Cassandra and James.

1. **Identify the number of pennies Cassandra collected:**
   - Cassandra collected 5000 pennies.

2. **Determine how many pennies James collected:**
   - According to the problem, James collected 276 fewer pennies than Cassandra.
   - To find the number of pennies James collected, we subtract 276 from the number of pennies Cassandra collected:
     \[
     \text{Pennies collected by James} = \text{Pennies collected by Cassandra} - 276
     \]
     \[
     \text{Pennies collected by James} = 5000 - 276
     \]

3. **Perform the subtraction:**
   - Now, we calculate \(5000 - 276\):
     \[
     5000 - 276 = 4724
     \]
   - Therefore, James collected 4724 pennies.

4. **Calculate the total number of pennies donated to charity:**
   - To find the total number of pennies donated by both Cassandra and James, we add the number of pennies they each collected:
     \[
     \text{Total pennies donated} = \text{Pennies collected by Cassandra} + \text{Pennies collected by James}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total pennies donated} = 5000 + 4724
     \]

5. **Perform the addition:**
   - Now, we calculate \(5000 + 4724\):
     \[
     5000 + 4724 = 9724
     \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - The total number of pennies donated to charity by Cassandra and James is:
     \[
     \boxed{9724}
     \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Cassandra collected 5000 pennies for the charity drive. 

James collected 276 fewer pennies than Cassandra. To find out how many pennies James collected, we subtract 276 from 5000. 

5000 - 276 = 4724 pennies

So, James collected 4724 pennies.

To find out the total number of pennies they donated to charity, we add the number of pennies Cassandra collected to the number of pennies James collected.

5000 (Cassandra's pennies) + 4724 (James's pennies) = 9724 pennies

So, th...
