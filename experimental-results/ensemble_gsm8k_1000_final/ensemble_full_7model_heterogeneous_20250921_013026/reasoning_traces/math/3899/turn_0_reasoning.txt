=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of oranges:**
   We know that one-fourth of the box contains oranges. The total number of pieces of fruit in the box is 56.

   \[
   \text{Number of oranges} = \frac{1}{4} \times 56 = 14
   \]

2. **Determine the number of peaches:**
   The problem states that there are half as many peaches as oranges. Since we found that there are 14 oranges, we can calculate the number of peaches as follows:

   \[
   \text{Number of peaches} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of oranges} = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7
   \]

3. **Determine the number of apples:**
   The problem also states that there are five times as many apples as peaches. We found that there are 7 peaches, so we can calculate the number of apples:

   \[
   \text{Number of apples} = 5 \times \text{Number of peaches} = 5 \times 7 = 35
   \]

4. **Final verification:**
   Now, let's verify that the total number of fruits adds up to 56. We have:
   - Oranges: 14
   - Peaches: 7
   - Apples: 35

   Adding these together:

   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = \text{Number of oranges} + \text{Number of peaches} + \text{Number of apples} = 14 + 7 + 35 = 56
   \]

   This confirms that our calculations are correct.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Number of apples in the box} = 35
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There are 56 pieces of fruit in the box.
- One-fourth of the box contains oranges.
- There are half as many peaches as oranges.
- There are five times as many apples as peaches.

Step 1: Find the number of oranges in the box.
One-fourth of 56 pieces of fruit = 56 รท 4 = 14 oranges

Step 2: Find the number of peaches in the box.
There are half as many peaches as oranges, so:
Number ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of apples in the box given the relationships between the different types of fruit.

1. **Determine the number of oranges:**
   - We know that one-fourth of the box contains oranges.
   - The total number of pieces of fruit in the box is 56.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges is:
     \[
     \text{Number of oranges} = \frac{1}{4} \times 56 = 14
     \]

2. **Determine the number of peaches:**
   - We are told that...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by finding out how many oranges are in the box. Since one-fourth of the box contains oranges, we can calculate this by dividing the total number of fruits by 4. 

56 รท 4 = 14 oranges

Next, we know that there are half as many peaches as oranges. So, we can find the number of peaches by dividing the number of oranges by 2.

14 รท 2 = 7 peaches

Finally, we know that there are five times as many apples as peaches. So, we can find the number of apples by multiplyi...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 56 pieces of fruit in the box.
   * 1/4 of the box contains oranges.
   * There are half as many peaches as oranges.
   * There are five times as many apples as peaches.

2. Calculate the number of oranges:
   * 1/4 of the fruit are oranges.
   * Number of oranges = 1/4 ร 56
   * Number of oranges = 14

3. Calculate the number of peaches:
   * There are half ...
