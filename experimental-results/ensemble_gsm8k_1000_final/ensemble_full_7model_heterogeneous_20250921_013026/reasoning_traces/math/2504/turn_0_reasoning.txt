Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many wet wipes Elsie had in the container in the morning based on the information given about her usage and refilling throughout the day.

Let's denote the number of wet wipes Elsie had in the morning as \( x \).

### Step 1: Understand the usage and refilling process
1. **Initial amount in the morning**: \( x \) wipes.
2. **Wipes used throughout the day**: For every 20 wipes used, she refills the container with 10 more wipes.

### Step 2: Set up the equation
Let’s analyze how many wipes she uses and refills throughout the day. We will denote the number of times she uses 20 wipes as \( n \).

- Each time she uses 20 wipes, she refills with 10 wipes.
- Therefore, after using 20 wipes, the net change in wipes after one cycle (using and refilling) is:
  \[
  \text{Net change} = -20 + 10 = -10 \text{ wipes}
  \]
- After \( n \) cycles, the total wipes used will be \( 20n \) and the total wipes refilled will be \( 10n \). Thus, the total wipes remaining after \( n \) cycles will be:
  \[
  \text{Wipes remaining} = x - 20n + 10n = x - 10n
  \]

### Step 3: Set the final condition
By nighttime, we know that Elsie has 60 wipes left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
x - 10n = 60
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Rearranging the equation gives us:
\[
x = 60 + 10n
\]

### Step 5: Determine possible values for \( n \)
Since \( n \) represents the number of times she used 20 wipes, it must be a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...). We can substitute different values for \( n \) to find corresponding values for \( x \).

- If \( n = 0 \):
  \[
  x = 60 + 10(0) = 60
  \]
- If \( n = 1 \):
  \[
  x = 60 + 10(1) = 70
  \]
- If \( n = 2 \):
  \[
  x = 60 + 10(2) = 80
  \]
- If \( n = 3 \):
  \[
  x = 60 + 10(3) = 90
  \]
- If \( n = 4 \):
  \[
  x = 60 + 10(4) = 100
  \]

### Step 6: Check for validity
Now, we need to check which of these values for \( x \) allows for a feasible number of wipes used throughout the day without going negative.

- For \( n = 0 \): \( x = 60 \) → No wipes used, valid.
- For \( n = 1 \): \( x = 70 \) → Used 20, refilled 10, remaining 60, valid.
- For \( n = 2 \): \( x = 80 \) → Used 40, refilled 20, remaining 60, valid.
- For \( n = 3 \): \( x = 90 \) → Used 60, refilled 30, remaining 60, valid.
- For \( n = 4 \): \( x = 100 \) → Used 80, refilled 40, remaining 60, valid.

### Conclusion
All values of \( x \) from 60 to 100 are valid based on the number of cycles \( n \). However, the problem does not specify any constraints on the maximum number of wipes, so we can conclude that Elsie could have started with any of these amounts.

The simplest and most straightforward answer is:
\[
\text{The number of wipes in the container in the morning could be } 60, 70, 80, 90, \text{ or } 100.
\]

However, if we are to provide a single answer, we can state:
\[
\text{Final answer: } 60 \text{ wipes (minimum possible).}

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of wipes in the container in the morning.

Given information:
- Elsie starts with a specific amount of wet wipes in the container in the morning.
- Throughout the day, she refills the container with 10 more wipes after using up 20.
- By nighttime, she only has 60 wipes left.

Let's represent the initial number of wipes in the container in the morning as "x".

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many wipes Elsie had in the container in the morning, given the information about her usage and refilling throughout the day.

Let's denote the number of wipes Elsie had in the morning as \( x \).

Throughout the day, Elsie uses 20 wipes and then refills the container with 10 wipes. This means that for each cycle of using and refilling, the net change in the number of wipes is:

\[
\text{Net change} = -20 + 10 = -10 \text{ ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the initial number of wet wipes in the morning as X.

According to the problem, Elsie uses 20 wipes and then adds 10 more. This means that the total number of wipes decreases by 20 - 10 = 10 wipes.

By nighttime, Elsie has 60 wipes left. This means that the initial number of wipes X decreased by 10 throughout the day. We can express this as an equation:

X - 10 = 60

To find X, we need to add 10 to both sides of the equation:

X = 60 + 10

So, X = 70.
