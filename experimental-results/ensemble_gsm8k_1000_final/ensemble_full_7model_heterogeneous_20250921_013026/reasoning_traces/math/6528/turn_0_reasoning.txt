=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many fewer onions are grown than the total number of tomatoes and corn together, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes and corn.**
   - We have:
     - Number of tomatoes = 2073
     - Number of cobs of corn = 4112

   We will add these two quantities together:
   \[
   \text{Total tomatoes and corn} = \text{Number of tomatoes} + \text{Number of cobs of corn}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total tomatoes and corn} = 2073 + 4112
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition:
   \[
   2073 + 4112 = 6185
   \]

2. **Determine the number of onions grown.**
   - We know the number of onions:
     - Number of onions = 985

3. **Calculate how many fewer onions are grown than the total number of tomatoes and corn.**
   - We need to find the difference between the total number of tomatoes and corn and the number of onions:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total tomatoes and corn} - \text{Number of onions}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 6185 - 985
   \]

   Now, we perform the subtraction:
   \[
   6185 - 985 = 5200
   \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   - The number of fewer onions grown than the total number of tomatoes and corn together is:
   \[
   \boxed{5200}
   \]

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To find out how many fewer onions are grown than the total number of tomatoes and corn together, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes and corn.**
   - We have:
     - Number of tomatoes = 2073
     - Number of cobs of corn = 4112

   We will add these two quantities together:
   \[
   \text{Total tomatoes and corn} = \text{Number of tomatoes} + \text{Number of cobs of corn}

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Bertolli Farm grows 2073 tomatoes
- Bertolli Farm grows 4112 cobs of corn
- Bertolli Farm grows 985 onions

Step 1: Find the total number of tomatoes and corn grown.
Total tomatoes and corn = 2073 + 4112 = 6185

Step 2: Find the difference between the total tomatoes and corn, and the number of onions grown.
Difference = Total tomatoes and corn - Number of onions
Difference = 6185 - 985...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of finding how many fewer onions are grown than tomatoes and corn together at the Bertolli Farm, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes and corn together.**

   We are given:
   - Number of tomatoes = 2073
   - Number of cobs of corn = 4112

   To find the total number of tomatoes and corn together, we add these two quantities:

   \[
   2073 \, (\text{tomatoes}) + 4112 \, (\text{cobs of corn}) = 6185
   \]

   So...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find the total number of tomatoes and corn grown together. We do this by adding the number of tomatoes to the number of corn cobs.

2073 (tomatoes) + 4112 (corn) = 6185

Next, we need to find out how many fewer onions are grown than the total number of tomatoes and corn. We do this by subtracting the number of onions from the total number of tomatoes and corn.

6185 (tomatoes and corn) - 985 (onions) = 5200

So, 5200 fewer onions are grown than tomatoes ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. To find out how many fewer onions are grown compared to tomatoes and corn together, we need to:

1. Find the total number of tomatoes and corn grown
2. Subtract the number of onions from the total of tomatoes and corn

Step 1: Find the total number of tomatoes and corn grown
* Number of tomatoes grown = 2073
* Number of corn cobs grown = 4112
* Total tomatoes and corn = Number of tomatoes + Number of corn...
