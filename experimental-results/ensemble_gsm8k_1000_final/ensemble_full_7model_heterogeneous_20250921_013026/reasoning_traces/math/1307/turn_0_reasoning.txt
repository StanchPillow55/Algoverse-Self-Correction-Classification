=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will define the ages of each person involved and use the relationships given in the problem to find Sarah's age.

1. **Determine Ana's current age**:
   - We know that Ana will be 15 in 3 years. Therefore, her current age can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Ana's current age} = 15 - 3 = 12
     \]

2. **Determine Billy's age**:
   - We are told that Billy is half of Ana's age. Since Ana is currently 12 years old, we can find Billy's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Billy's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Ana's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6
     \]

3. **Determine Mark's age**:
   - According to the problem, Mark is four years older than Billy. Therefore, we can calculate Mark's age:
     \[
     \text{Mark's age} = \text{Billy's age} + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
     \]

4. **Determine Sarah's age**:
   - The problem states that Sarah's age is equal to three times Mark's age minus 4. We can express this mathematically:
     \[
     \text{Sarah's age} = 3 \times \text{Mark's age} - 4
     \]
   - Substituting Mark's age into the equation:
     \[
     \text{Sarah's age} = 3 \times 10 - 4 = 30 - 4 = 26
     \]

Thus, after working through the relationships and calculations step by step, we find that Sarah's age is:

\[
\boxed{26}
\]

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will define the ages of each person involved and use the relationships given in the problem to find Sarah's age.

1. **Determine Ana's current age**:
   - We know that Ana will be 15 in 3 years. Therefore, her current age can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Ana's current age} = 15 - 3 = 12
     \]

2. **Determine Billy's age**:
   - We are told that Billy is half of Ana's age. Since Ana is currently 12 years old, we can find Billy's age...

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it.

Given information:
- Sarah's age is equal to three times Mark's age minus 4.
- Mark is four years older than Billy.
- Billy is half Ana's age.
- Ana will be 15 in 3 years.

Step 1: Find Ana's current age.
Ana's age in 3 years = 15
Ana's current age = 15 - 3 = 12 years old

Step 2: Find Billy's age.
Billy's age = 1/2 × Ana's age
Billy's age = 1/2 × 12 = 6 years old

Step 3: Find Mark's age...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of each person involved, starting with the information given about Ana, and then work our way through the relationships between the ages of the other individuals.

1. **Determine Ana's current age:**
   - We know that Ana will be 15 years old in 3 years. Therefore, her current age is:
     \[
     \text{Ana's current age} = 15 - 3 = 12
     \]

2. **Determine Billy's age:**
   - Billy is half of Ana's age. Since Ana is...

--- Model 4 Response ---

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out Ana's current age. If Ana will be 15 in 3 years, that means Ana is currently 15 - 3 = 12 years old.

Billy is half Ana's age, so Billy is 12 / 2 = 6 years old.

Mark is four years older than Billy, so Mark is 6 + 4 = 10 years old.

Sarah's age is equal to three times Mark's age minus 4. So, Sarah is 3 * 10 - 4 = 30 - 4 = 26 years old.

So, Sarah is 26 years old.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by identifying the key information given in the problem and then work through the relationships between the ages of Sarah, Mark, Billy, and Ana.

Given:
- Sarah's age is equal to three times Mark's age minus 4.
- Mark is four years older than Billy.
- Billy is half Ana's age.
- Ana will be 15 in 3 years.

Step 1: Determine Ana's current age.
Ana will be 15 in 3 years, so her current age is:
