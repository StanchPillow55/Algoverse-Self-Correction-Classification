=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of rooms in Linda's hotel, we need to calculate the number of rooms in each wing separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of rooms in the first wing.

The first wing has:
- 9 floors
- Each floor has 6 halls
- Each hall has 32 rooms

First, we calculate the total number of rooms on one floor:

\[
\text{Rooms per floor} = \text{Number of halls per floor} \times \text{Number of rooms per hall}
\]
\[
\text{Rooms per floor} = 6 \text{ halls} \times 32 \text{ rooms/hall} = 192 \text{ rooms}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of rooms in the first wing:

\[
\text{Total rooms in first wing} = \text{Number of floors} \times \text{Rooms per floor}
\]
\[
\text{Total rooms in first wing} = 9 \text{ floors} \times 192 \text{ rooms/floor} = 1728 \text{ rooms}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of rooms in the second wing.

The second wing has:
- 7 floors
- Each floor has 9 halls
- Each hall has 40 rooms

First, we calculate the total number of rooms on one floor in the second wing:

\[
\text{Rooms per floor} = \text{Number of halls per floor} \times \text{Number of rooms per hall}
\]
\[
\text{Rooms per floor} = 9 \text{ halls} \times 40 \text{ rooms/hall} = 360 \text{ rooms}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of rooms in the second wing:

\[
\text{Total rooms in second wing} = \text{Number of floors} \times \text{Rooms per floor}
\]
\[
\text{Total rooms in second wing} = 7 \text{ floors} \times 360 \text{ rooms/floor} = 2520 \text{ rooms}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of rooms in the hotel.

Now, we sum the total number of rooms from both wings:

\[
\text{Total rooms in hotel} = \text{Total rooms in first wing} + \text{Total rooms in second wing}
\]
\[
\text{Total rooms in hotel} = 1728 \text{ rooms} + 2520 \text{ rooms} = 4248 \text{ rooms}
\]

### Final Answer:

The total number of rooms in the hotel is **4248 rooms**.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total number of rooms in the first wing of the hotel. 

The first wing has 9 floors, each floor has 6 halls, and each hall has 32 rooms. So, the total number of rooms in the first wing is 9 floors * 6 halls/floor * 32 rooms/hall = 1728 rooms.

Next, let's calculate the total number of rooms in the second wing of the hotel. 

The second wing has 7 floors, each floor has 9 halls, and each hall has 40 rooms. So, the total number of rooms in the sec...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. First wing:
   * There are 9 floors in the first wing.
   * Each floor has 6 halls.
   * Each hall has 32 rooms.
   * To find the total rooms in each floor of the first wing, we multiply:
     - Rooms per floor = 6 halls × 32 rooms = 192 rooms
   * Now, to find the total rooms in the first wing, we multiply the rooms per floor by the number of floors:
     - Total rooms in first wing = 9 floors × 192 rooms ...
