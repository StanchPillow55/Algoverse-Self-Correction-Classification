=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much John spends on paintballs each month, we can break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Identify the number of times John plays paintball in a month**: 
   - John plays paintball 3 times a month.

2. **Determine how many boxes of paintballs he buys each time**: 
   - Each time he plays, he buys 3 boxes of paintballs.

3. **Calculate the total number of boxes he buys in a month**:
   - Since he plays 3 times a month and buys 3 boxes each time, we can calculate the total number of boxes as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total boxes} = \text{Number of times played} \times \text{Boxes per time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total boxes} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ boxes}
   \]

4. **Determine the cost per box of paintballs**:
   - The cost of each box of paintballs is $25.

5. **Calculate the total cost for the boxes he buys in a month**:
   - To find the total cost, we multiply the total number of boxes by the cost per box:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total boxes} \times \text{Cost per box}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 9 \times 25
   \]

6. **Perform the multiplication**:
   \[
   9 \times 25 = 225
   \]

Thus, John spends a total of $225 on paintballs each month.

**Final Answer**: John spends $225 a month on paintballs.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to find out how much John spends on paintballs each time he plays and then multiply that by the number of times he plays in a month.

First, we find out how much John spends each time he plays. He buys 3 boxes of paintballs at $25 per box. So, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

3 boxes * $25/box = $75

So, John spends $75 each time he plays paintball.

Next, we find out how much he spends in a month. He plays 3 times a mon...
