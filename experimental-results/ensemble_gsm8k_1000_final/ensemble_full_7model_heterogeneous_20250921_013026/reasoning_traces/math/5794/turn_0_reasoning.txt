=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Loan**: Todd borrowed $100 from his brother.

2. **Repayment Amount**: Todd needs to repay his brother $110.

3. **Expenses**: Todd spent $75 on ingredients for the snow cones.

4. **Sales Revenue**: Todd sells 200 snow cones for $0.75 each. We need to calculate the total revenue from these sales.

   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Snow Cones} \times \text{Price per Snow Cone}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 200 \times 0.75 = 150
   \]

5. **Calculating Profit**: Now we need to determine Todd's profit after subtracting his expenses from his revenue.

   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Expenses}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 150 - 75 = 75
   \]

6. **Total Money After Sales**: To find out how much money Todd has after selling the snow cones and before repaying his brother, we add the profit to the initial amount he borrowed.

   \[
   \text{Total Money} = \text{Initial Loan} + \text{Profit}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Money} = 100 + 75 = 175
   \]

7. **Repaying His Brother**: Now, Todd needs to repay his brother $110. We will subtract this repayment from the total money he has.

   \[
   \text{Money After Repayment} = \text{Total Money} - \text{Repayment}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Money After Repayment} = 175 - 110 = 65
   \]

8. **Final Answer**: After repaying his brother, Todd has $65 left.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{65}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how much money Todd makes from selling 200 snow cones at $0.75 each. 

To do this, we multiply the number of snow cones (200) by the price of each snow cone ($0.75). 

200 * $0.75 = $150

So, Todd makes $150 from selling snow cones.

Next, we need to subtract the cost of the ingredients ($75) from the total amount of money Todd made ($150). 

$150 - $75 = $75

So, after buying the ingredients, Todd has $75 left.

Then, Todd needs to pay back hi...
