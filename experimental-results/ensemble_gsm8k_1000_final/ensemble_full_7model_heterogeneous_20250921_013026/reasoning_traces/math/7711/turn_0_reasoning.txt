=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa based on the relationships given in the problem.

1. **Identify Jessa's Age**:
   - We know that Jessa is 20 years old.

2. **Determine Joan's Age**:
   - The problem states that Joan is five years older than Jessa. 
   - Since Jessa is 20 years old, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
     \]

3. **Determine Mary's Age**:
   - The problem states that Mary is two years younger than Joan.
   - Since we found that Joan is 25 years old, we can calculate Mary's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
     \]

4. **Calculate the Sum of Their Ages**:
   - Now that we have the ages of all three girls:
     - Jessa: 20 years
     - Joan: 25 years
     - Mary: 23 years
   - We can find the sum of their ages:
     \[
     \text{Sum of ages} = \text{Jessa's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Mary's age} = 20 + 25 + 23
     \]
   - Performing the addition step-by-step:
     \[
     20 + 25 = 45
     \]
     \[
     45 + 23 = 68
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - The sum of the ages of the three girls is \( \boxed{68} \).

=== INDIVIDUAL MODEL RESPONSES ===

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa based on the relationships given in the problem.

1. **Identify Jessa's Age**:
   - We know that Jessa is 20 years old.

2. **Determine Joan's Age**:
   - The problem states that Joan is five years older than Jessa. 
   - Since Jessa is 20 years old, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
     \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mary is two years younger than Joan.
- Joan is five years older than Jessa.
- Jessa is 20 years old.

Step 1: Find Joan's age.
Joan is five years older than Jessa.
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5 = 25 years old

Step 2: Find Mary's age.
Mary is two years younger than Joan.
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2 = 23 years old

Step 3: Calculate the sum of the age...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, and then find the sum of their ages.

1. **Identify Jessa's Age:**
   - We are given that Jessa is 20 years old.

2. **Determine Joan's Age:**
   - The problem states that Joan is five years older than Jessa.
   - Since Jessa is 20 years old, we calculate Joan's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
     \]

3. **Determine Mary's Age:**
   - The ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's start with the information we know. We know that Jessa is 20 years old.

The problem states that Joan is five years older than Jessa. So, to find Joan's age, we add 5 years to Jessa's age:

Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5 years
Joan's age = 20 years + 5 years = 25 years

Next, the problem states that Mary is two years younger than Joan. So, to find Mary's age, we subtract 2 years from Joan's age:

Mary's age = Joan's age - 2 years
Mary's age = 25 years - 2 years...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the sum of the ages of the three girls.

Given:
- Mary is two years younger than Joan.
- Joan is five years older than Jessa.
- Jessa is 20 years old.

Step 1: Determine Joan's age.
Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, and Jessa is 20 years old, we can calculate Joan's age:...
