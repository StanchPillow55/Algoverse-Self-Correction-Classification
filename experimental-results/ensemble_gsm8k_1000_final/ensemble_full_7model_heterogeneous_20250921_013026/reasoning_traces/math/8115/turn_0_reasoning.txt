=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total cost of James's new wardrobe, we will break down the costs of each item he purchased: suits, dress pants, and dress shirts.

1. **Calculate the cost of the suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - The cost of each suit is $750.
   - Total cost for suits = Number of suits × Cost per suit
   \[
   \text{Total cost for suits} = 10 \times 750 = 7500
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - The cost of each dress pant is 1/5 the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of each dress pant = \( \frac{750}{5} = 150 \)
   - Total cost for dress pants = Number of dress pants × Cost per dress pant
   \[
   \text{Total cost for dress pants} = 10 \times 150 = 1500
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts for each suit, and he has 10 suits.
   - Total number of dress shirts = Number of suits × Shirts per suit
   \[
   \text{Total number of dress shirts} = 10 \times 3 = 30
   \]
   - The cost of each dress shirt is $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = Number of dress shirts × Cost per dress shirt
   \[
   \text{Total cost for dress shirts} = 30 \times 60 = 1800
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the wardrobe:**
   - Total cost = Total cost for suits + Total cost for dress pants + Total cost for dress shirts
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 7500 + 1500 + 1800
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 7500 + 1500 = 9000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 9000 + 1800 = 10800
   \]

Thus, the total cost of everything James bought is **$10,800**.

Final answer: **$10,800**.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items James bought: suits, dress pants, and dress shirts. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the suits
James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750. To find the total cost of the suits, we multiply the number of suits by the cost per suit:

\[
\text{Total cost of suits} = 10 \times 750 = 7500
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the dress pants
James buys 10...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total cost of the suits. Since each suit costs $750 and James bought 10 suits, the total cost of the suits is 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants. Since the dress pants cost 1/5 the cost of the suits, each pair of dress pants costs $750/5 = $150. Since James bought 10 pairs of dress pants, the total cost of the dress pants is 10 pants * $150/pants = $1500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress s...
