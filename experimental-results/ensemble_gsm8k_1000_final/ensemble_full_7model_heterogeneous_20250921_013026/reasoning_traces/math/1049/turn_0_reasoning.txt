=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine Mark's score based on the information provided.

1. **Understanding the terms**:
   - Let the least score be denoted as \( L \).
   - Mark's score is given as \( 2L \) (twice the least score).
   - The highest score is given as \( H = 98 \).
   - The range of the scores is defined as \( \text{Range} = H - L \).

2. **Using the range**:
   The range is provided as 75. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   H - L = 75
   \]
   Substituting the value of \( H \):
   \[
   98 - L = 75
   \]

3. **Solving for the least score \( L \)**:
   Rearranging the equation gives:
   \[
   L = 98 - 75
   \]
   \[
   L = 23
   \]

4. **Calculating Mark's score**:
   Now that we have the least score \( L \), we can find Mark's score:
   \[
   \text{Mark's score} = 2L = 2 \times 23 = 46
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, Mark's score is \( \boxed{46} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find Mark's score based on the given information.

Given information:
- Mark scored twice as much as the least score.
- The highest score is 98.
- The range of the scores is 75.

Step 1: Find the least score.
Range of the scores = Highest score - Lowest score
75 = 98 - Lowest score
Lowest score = 98 - 75 = 23

Step 2: Find Mark's score.
Mark's score = 2 × Least score
Mark's score = 2 × 23 = 46

Therefore, Mark's score...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine Mark's score based on the given information about the scores on a math test.

Let's break down the information provided:

1. The highest score on the test is 98.
2. The range of the scores is 75.
3. Mark scored twice as much as the least score.

The range of a set of numbers is defined as the difference between the highest and the lowest values in the set. Therefore, we can express the range as:

\[
\text{Range} = \text{Highest...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The range of a set of numbers is the difference between the highest and lowest number. In this case, the range of the scores is 75, and the highest score is 98. Therefore, we can find the lowest score by subtracting the range from the highest score.

98 - 75 = 23

So, the lowest score is 23.

According to the problem, Mark scored twice as much as the least score. So, to find Mark's score, we multiply the lowest score by 2.

23 * 2 = 46

Therefore, Mark's score was 46.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. To find Mark's score, we need to determine the least score on the math test.

Given:
- Mark scored twice as much as the least score.
- The highest score is 98.
- The range of the scores is 75.

Step 1: Determine the least score using the range and the highest score.
Range = Highest score - Lowest score
75 = 98 - Lowest score
Lowest score = 98 - 75
Lowest score = 23

Therefore, the least score on the math ...
