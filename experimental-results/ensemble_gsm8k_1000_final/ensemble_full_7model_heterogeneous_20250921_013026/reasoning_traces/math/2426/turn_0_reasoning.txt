=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the scholarship amounts for Nina, Kelly, and Wendy, and then find the total amount they received together.

1. **Identify Wendy's scholarship amount:**
   - Wendy received a scholarship worth $20,000.

2. **Determine Kelly's scholarship amount:**
   - According to the problem, Kelly received a scholarship worth twice the amount Wendy received.
   - Therefore, Kelly's scholarship amount can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Kelly's scholarship} = 2 \times \text{Wendy's scholarship} = 2 \times 20000 = 40000
     \]

3. **Determine Nina's scholarship amount:**
   - The problem states that Nina has received a scholarship worth $8,000 less than Kelly's amount.
   - Thus, we can calculate Nina's scholarship amount as follows:
     \[
     \text{Nina's scholarship} = \text{Kelly's scholarship} - 8000 = 40000 - 8000 = 32000
     \]

4. **Calculate the total scholarship amount received by all three:**
   - Now we can find the total amount of scholarships received by Nina, Kelly, and Wendy by adding their individual amounts:
     \[
     \text{Total scholarship} = \text{Nina's scholarship} + \text{Kelly's scholarship} + \text{Wendy's scholarship}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total scholarship} = 32000 + 40000 + 20000
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total scholarship} = 92000
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - The total amount of money they received in scholarships together is **$92,000**. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{92000}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out how much money Kelly received. Since Kelly received a scholarship worth twice the amount Wendy received, and Wendy received $20000, we can calculate Kelly's scholarship amount by multiplying Wendy's amount by 2:

Kelly's scholarship = 2 * Wendy's scholarship
Kelly's scholarship = 2 * $20000
Kelly's scholarship = $40000

Next, we can figure out how much Nina received. Since Nina received a scholarship worth $8000 less than Kelly's amount, we can...
