=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the size of Peter's locker based on the sizes of Timothy's and Zack's lockers.

1. **Determine the size of Zack's locker:**
   - We know that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches.
   - Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker.
   - Therefore, we calculate Zack's locker size as follows:
     \[
     \text{Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \text{ cubic inches} = 12 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

2. **Determine the size of Peter's locker:**
   - Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker.
   - We have already calculated Zack's locker to be 12 cubic inches.
   - Now, we calculate Peter's locker size:
     \[
     \text{Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ cubic inches} = 3 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

3. **Final Answer:**
   - After performing the calculations, we find that Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

Thus, the size of Peter's locker is \(\boxed{3}\) cubic inches.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches.
- Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.
- Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker.

Step 1: Find the size of Zack's locker.
Zack's locker = 1/2 of Timothy's locker
Zack's locker = 1/2 × 24 cubic inches = 12 cubic inches

Step 2: Find the size of Peter's locker.
Peter's locker = 1/4 of Zack's locker
Peter's locker = 1/4 × 12 cubic inch...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the size of Peter's locker in cubic inches, given the sizes of Timothy's and Zack's lockers.

1. **Determine Zack's locker size:**
   - We know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.
   - Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches.
   - Therefore, Zack's locker size is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubi...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we divide Timothy's locker size by 2.

24 cubic inches / 2 = 12 cubic inches

So, Zack's locker is 12 cubic inches.

Next, we need to find the size of Peter's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we divide Zack's locker size by 4.

12 cubic inches / 4 = 3 cubic inches

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start with the given information and work our way through to find the size of Peter's locker.

Given:
- Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches.
- Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.
- Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker.

Step 1: Calculate the size of Zack's locker.
Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so we can divide Timothy's locker size by 2.

Zack's locker size = ...
