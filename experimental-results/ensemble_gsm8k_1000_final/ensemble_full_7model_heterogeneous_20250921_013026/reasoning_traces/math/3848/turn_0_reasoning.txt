=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total investment**: James buys 20 coins at $15 each.
2. **Determine the new value of the coins after the increase**: The value of the coins increases by \( \frac{2}{3} \).
3. **Calculate the selling price of the coins**: We need to find out how much James can sell the coins for after the increase.
4. **Determine how many coins he needs to sell to recoup his original investment**: We will find out how many coins he needs to sell to get back the amount he initially invested.

### Step 1: Calculate the total investment
James buys 20 coins at $15 each.

\[
\text{Total Investment} = \text{Number of Coins} \times \text{Price per Coin} = 20 \times 15 = 300
\]

So, James's total investment is **$300**.

### Step 2: Determine the new value of the coins after the increase
The value of the coins increases by \( \frac{2}{3} \). 

First, we calculate the new price per coin:

\[
\text{Increase in Price} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{2}{3} = 15 \times \frac{2}{3} = 10
\]

Now, we add this increase to the original price to find the new price per coin:

\[
\text{New Price per Coin} = \text{Original Price} + \text{Increase in Price} = 15 + 10 = 25
\]

So, the new price per coin is **$25**.

### Step 3: Calculate the selling price of the coins
Now, we need to determine how many coins James needs to sell to recoup his original investment of $300.

Let \( x \) be the number of coins he sells. The total amount he receives from selling \( x \) coins at the new price of $25 each is:

\[
\text{Total Selling Price} = x \times 25
\]

### Step 4: Set up the equation to recoup the original investment
To recoup his original investment of $300, we set up the equation:

\[
x \times 25 = 300
\]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{300}{25} = 12
\]

### Final Answer
James needs to sell **12 coins** to recoup his original investment of $300.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- James buys 20 coins of a cryptocurrency at $15 each.
- The value of the coins increases by 2/3.
- James sells coins to recoup his original investment.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount James spent on the 20 coins.
Total amount spent = 20 coins × $15 per coin = $300

Step 2: Calculate the new value of the coins after the 2/3 increase.
New value per coin = $15 + (2/3 × $15) = $15 ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many coins James needs to sell to recoup his original investment after the value of the coins increases by 2/3.

**Step 1: Calculate the original investment.**

James buys 20 coins at $15 each. Therefore, his original investment is:

\[
20 \text{ coins} \times 15 \text{ dollars/coin} = 300 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the new value of each coin after the increase.**

The value of the coins increases by 2/3. To fi...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): James' original investment is 20 coins * $15/coin = $300.

The value of the coins increases by 2/3, so each coin is now worth $15 + $15*(2/3) = $25.

To recoup his original investment of $300, James needs to sell $300 / $25/coin = 12 coins.

So, James sold 12 coins to recoup his original investment.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * James buys 20 coins at $15 each.
   * The value of the coins increases by 2/3.
   * James sells some coins to recoup his original investment.

2. Calculate James' original investment:
   * Original investment = Number of coins × Price per coin
   * Original investment = 20 × $15
   * Original investment = $300

3. Calculate the new value of each coin after the 2/...
