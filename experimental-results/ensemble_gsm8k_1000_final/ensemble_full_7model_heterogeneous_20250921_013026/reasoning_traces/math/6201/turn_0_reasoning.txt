Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of comic books liked by females:**
   We know that 30% of the 300 comic books are liked by females. To find this number, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of comic books liked by females} = 30\% \times 300 = 0.30 \times 300 = 90
   \]

2. **Determine the number of comic books liked by males:**
   The problem states that males like 120 comic books. So we have:
   \[
   \text{Number of comic books liked by males} = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of comic books liked by either gender:**
   To find the total number of comic books liked by either females or males, we add the number liked by females and males:
   \[
   \text{Total liked} = \text{Number liked by females} + \text{Number liked by males} = 90 + 120 = 210
   \]

4. **Determine the number of comic books disliked by both genders:**
   To find the number of comic books that are disliked by both males and females, we subtract the total number of comic books liked from the total number of comic books in the store:
   \[
   \text{Number disliked by both} = \text{Total comic books} - \text{Total liked} = 300 - 210 = 90
   \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of comic books disliked by both genders:**
   To find the percentage of comic books that are disliked by both genders, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage disliked} = \left( \frac{\text{Number disliked by both}}{\text{Total comic books}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Percentage disliked} = \left( \frac{90}{300} \right) \times 100 = 0.30 \times 100 = 30\%
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that **30% of the comic books are disliked by both males and females.**

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the number of comic books liked by females. 

30% of 300 comic books are liked by females. To find this, we multiply 300 by 30% (or 0.30):

300 * 0.30 = 90 comic books

So, 90 comic books are liked by females.

We know that males like 120 comic books.

Therefore, the total number of comic books liked by either males or females is 90 (liked by females) + 120 (liked by males) = 210 comic books.

Since the total number of comic books in the store is 30...
