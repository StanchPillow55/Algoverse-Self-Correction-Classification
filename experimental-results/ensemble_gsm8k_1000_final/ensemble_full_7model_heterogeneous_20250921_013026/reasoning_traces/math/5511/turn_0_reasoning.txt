=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine Ember's current age based on the information given about Nate's age.

1. **Determine Ember's current age:**
   - We know that Nate is currently 14 years old.
   - The problem states that Ember is half as old as Nate. Therefore, we can calculate Ember's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Ember's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Nate's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7
     \]
   - So, Ember is currently 7 years old.

2. **Determine the age difference between Ember and Nate:**
   - The age difference between Nate and Ember is:
     \[
     \text{Age difference} = \text{Nate's age} - \text{Ember's age} = 14 - 7 = 7
     \]
   - This means Nate is 7 years older than Ember.

3. **Calculate Nate's age when Ember is 14:**
   - We need to find out how many years it will take for Ember to reach the age of 14. Since she is currently 7, the number of years until she is 14 is:
     \[
     \text{Years until Ember is 14} = 14 - 7 = 7
     \]
   - In 7 years, Nate will also age by the same amount of time. Therefore, we can calculate Nate's age at that time:
     \[
     \text{Nate's age in 7 years} = \text{Nate's current age} + \text{Years until Ember is 14} = 14 + 7 = 21
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - When Ember is 14 years old, Nate will be 21 years old.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ember is half as old as Nate.
- Nate is 14 years old.

Step 1: Find Ember's current age.
Since Ember is half as old as Nate, we can use the following equation:
Ember's age = 1/2 × Nate's age
Ember's age = 1/2 × 14 = 7 years old

Step 2: Find how old Nate will be when Ember is 14 years old.
We know that when Ember is 14, Nate will be older than 14. We can use the following equation to find Nate...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how old Nate will be when Ember is 14 years old. We start by understanding the current ages of Ember and Nate, and then calculate the difference in their ages to project into the future.

1. **Determine Ember's current age:**
   - We know that Nate is currently 14 years old.
   - Ember is half as old as Nate.
   - Therefore, Ember's current age is:
     \[
     \text{Ember's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7
     \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Ember is half as old as Nate, who is 14. This means Ember is 14/2 = 7 years old.

When Ember is 14, she will have aged 14 - 7 = 7 years.

Since time passes equally for both of them, Nate will also have aged 7 years.

So, when Ember is 14, Nate will be 14 (his current age) + 7 (the years that will have passed) = 21 years old.

So, when Ember is 14, Nate will be 21 years old.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Nate is currently 14 years old.
   * Ember is half as old as Nate.
   * We need to find out how old Nate will be when Ember is 14.

2. Calculate Ember's current age:
   * Ember is half as old as Nate.
   * Nate is 14 years old.
   * Ember's age = 14 ÷ 2
   * Ember's age = 7 years old

3. Determine the age difference between Ember and Nate:
   * Age difference = Nate...
