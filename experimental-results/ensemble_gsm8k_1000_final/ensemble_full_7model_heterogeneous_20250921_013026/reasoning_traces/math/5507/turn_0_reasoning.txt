=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much weight John can put on the bar while staying 20% under the maximum weight his bench can support, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the maximum weight the bench can support**: 
   The maximum weight supported by the bench is 1000 pounds.

2. **Calculate 20% of the maximum weight**:
   To find out how much weight corresponds to 20% of 1000 pounds, we calculate:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine the safe weight limit**:
   Since John wants to stay 20% under the maximum weight, we subtract the 20% from the maximum weight:
   \[
   \text{Safe weight limit} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Account for John's weight**:
   John weighs 250 pounds, so we need to subtract his weight from the safe weight limit to find out how much additional weight he can put on the bar:
   \[
   \text{Weight he can put on the bar} = \text{Safe weight limit} - \text{John's weight}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weight he can put on the bar} = 800 - 250 = 550 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the maximum weight John can safely put on the bar, considering his own weight and the safety margin, is:
   \[
   \boxed{550 \text{ pounds}}
   \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum weight that the bench can support while staying 20% under the maximum capacity.

Given information:
- The weight bench can support 1000 pounds.
- John wants to stay 20% under the maximum capacity for safety.
- John weighs 250 pounds.

Step 1: Calculate the maximum weight the bench can support while staying 20% under the maximum capacity.
Maximum capacity of the bench = 1000 pounds
20% under the maximu...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight John can safely put on the bar, given that he wants to stay 20% under the maximum weight capacity of the bench.

**Step 1: Determine the safe weight limit.**

The bench can support a maximum of 1000 pounds. John wants to stay 20% under this limit for safety. To find 20% of 1000 pounds, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, subtract this 20% from the maximum capa...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate 20% of the weight bench's maximum capacity, which is 1000 pounds. 

20% of 1000 pounds = 0.20 * 1000 = 200 pounds

John wants to stay 20% under the maximum capacity for safety, so we subtract this amount from the maximum capacity:

1000 pounds - 200 pounds = 800 pounds

This is the total weight that the bench can safely support, including John's weight. 

John weighs 250 pounds, so we subtract his weight from the safe total weight:

800 pounds ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * John's weight bench can support 1000 pounds.
   * He wants to stay 20% under the maximum weight for safety.
   * John weighs 250 pounds.

2. Calculate 20% of the maximum weight:
   * 20% of 1000 pounds = 0.20 Ã— 1000 = 200 pounds

3. Subtract the 20% safety margin from the maximum weight to find the safe weight limit:
   * Safe weight limit = Maximum weight - 20% ...
