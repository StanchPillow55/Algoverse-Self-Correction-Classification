=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years when she invests $300 at a simple interest rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year.

### Step 1: Determine the interest rate

The problem states that the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount. Since the original amount is $300, we first need to calculate three-quarters of this amount.

\[
\text{Interest Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Interest Rate} = 0.75 \times 300 = 225
\]

This means that the interest earned per year is $225.

### Step 2: Calculate the total interest earned over 3 years

Since the interest is simple interest, the total interest earned over a period of time is calculated as:

\[
\text{Total Interest} = \text{Interest per Year} \times \text{Number of Years}
\]

In this case, the interest per year is $225, and the number of years is 3.

\[
\text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount after 3 years

To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we add the total interest earned to the original investment.

\[
\text{Total Amount} = \text{Original Investment} + \text{Total Interest}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975
\]

### Final Answer

After 3 years, Brenda will have a total of **$975**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, including the initial investment and the accumulated simple interest.

Given information:
- Brenda invested $300.
- The simple interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year.
- The time period is 3 years.

Step 1: Calculate the simple interest earned each year.
Simple interest per year = Principal × Interest rate
Simple interest per year = $30...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, given that her investment accumulates simple interest at a rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand Simple Interest:**
   Simple interest is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t
   \]
   where:
   - \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
   - \( r \) is the ra...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The formula for simple interest is I = PRT, where I is the interest, P is the principal (the initial amount of money), R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years.

In this case, Brenda's principal (P) is $300. The rate of interest (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is 0.75 (or 75%) of the original amount. The time (T) is 3 years.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Brenda invested $300 initially.
   * The scheme offers simple interest.
   * The interest rate is three-quarters (3/4 or 75%) of the original amount per year.
   * We need to find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years.

2. Calculate the annual interest:
   * Annual interest = Original amount × Interest rate
   * Annual interest = $300 × 3/4
   * Annual intere...
