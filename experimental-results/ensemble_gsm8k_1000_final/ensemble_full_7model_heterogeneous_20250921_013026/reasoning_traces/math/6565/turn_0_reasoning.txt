=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many minutes Gnuff tutored for, we can set up an equation based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the components of the cost**:
   - Gnuff charges a flat rate of $20 for each tutoring session.
   - Additionally, Gnuff charges $7 for each minute of tutoring.

2. **Set up the equation**:
   Let \( m \) represent the number of minutes tutored. The total cost for one session can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Flat Rate} + (\text{Cost per Minute} \times \text{Number of Minutes})
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   146 = 20 + 7m
   \]

3. **Solve for \( m \)**:
   First, we will isolate the term involving \( m \) by subtracting the flat rate from both sides:
   \[
   146 - 20 = 7m
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   126 = 7m
   \]

4. **Divide both sides by 7** to solve for \( m \):
   \[
   m = \frac{126}{7}
   \]
   Performing the division:
   \[
   m = 18
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   Gnuff tutored for \( \boxed{18} \) minutes. 

This means that the total amount paid for the tutoring session, which was $146, corresponds to 18 minutes of tutoring at the rate of $7 per minute, plus the flat fee of $20.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem tells us that Gnuff charges a flat rate of $20 per tutoring session plus $7 per minute. We know that the total amount paid for one session is $146. 

First, we need to subtract the flat rate from the total amount to find out how much was paid for the minutes of tutoring. 

So, $146 - $20 = $126

This means that $126 was paid for the minutes of tutoring. 

Since Gnuff charges $7 per minute, we can find out how many minutes were tutored by dividing the total amo...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Gnuff charges a flat rate of $20 per tutoring session.
   * Gnuff also charges $7 per minute.
   * The total amount paid for one session is $146.

2. Let's define a variable for the unknown:
   * Let x be the number of minutes Gnuff tutored for.

3. Set up an equation based on the given information:
   * Total amount = Flat rate + (Rate per minute × Number of minutes)
