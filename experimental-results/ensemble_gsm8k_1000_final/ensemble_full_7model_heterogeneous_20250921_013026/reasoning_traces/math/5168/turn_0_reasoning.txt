=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Amount**: Isabel starts with $204 in her piggy bank.

2. **First Spending (Toy)**: 
   - Isabel spends half of her initial amount on a toy.
   - Half of $204 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Half of } 204 = \frac{204}{2} = 102
     \]
   - After buying the toy, the amount of money Isabel has left is:
     \[
     204 - 102 = 102
     \]

3. **Second Spending (Book)**:
   - Isabel then spends half of the remaining money on a book.
   - Half of the remaining amount ($102) is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Half of } 102 = \frac{102}{2} = 51
     \]
   - After buying the book, the amount of money Isabel has left is:
     \[
     102 - 51 = 51
     \]

4. **Final Amount**: 
   - After both purchases, Isabel has $51 left in her piggy bank.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{51}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Isabel has $204 in her piggy bank.
- She spent half the amount and bought a toy.
- She then spent half of the remaining money and bought her brother a book.

Step 1: Calculate the amount Isabel spent on the toy.
Amount spent on the toy = 1/2 ร $204 = $102

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money left after buying the toy.
Amount left after buying the toy = $204 - $102 = $102

Step 3: Calculate t...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to track the amount of money Isabel has at each step of her spending.

1. **Initial Amount:**
   Isabel starts with $204 in her piggy bank.

2. **First Purchase (Toy):**
   Isabel spends half of her initial amount on a toy. To find out how much she spends, we calculate half of $204:

   \[
   \text{Amount spent on toy} = \frac{204}{2} = 102
   \]

   After buying the toy, the remaining amount of money is:

   \[
   \text{Remaining after toy...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Isabel started with $204.

Step 1: She spent half of her money on a toy. Half of $204 is $204 divided by 2, which equals $102. So, she spent $102 on a toy.

Step 2: After buying the toy, Isabel has $204 - $102 = $102 left.

Step 3: She then spent half of the remaining money on a book. Half of $102 is $102 divided by 2, which equals $51. So, she spent $51 on a book.

Step 4: After buying the book, Isabel has $102 - $51 = $51 left.

Therefore, Isabel has $51 left over.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- Isabel has $204 in her piggy bank.
- She spent half the amount on a toy.
- She then spent half of the remaining money on a book for her brother.

Step 1: Calculate the amount Isabel spent on the toy.
Half of the initial amount = $204 รท 2 = $102
So, Isabel spent $102 on the toy.

Step 2: Calculate the remaining money after buying the toy.
Remaining money after buying the toy = Initial amount - Amoun...
