=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the cost of a one-year subscription to a newspaper after applying a 45% discount, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the original price of the subscription**: The original price is given as $80.

2. **Calculate the amount of the discount**: The discount is 45% of the original price. To find the discount amount, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \left(\frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100}\right)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 80 \times \left(\frac{45}{100}\right)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 80 \times 0.45
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 36
   \]

3. **Calculate the discounted price**: To find the final price after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the original price:
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = 80 - 36
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = 44
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: The cost of the discounted subscription is \(\boxed{44}\).
