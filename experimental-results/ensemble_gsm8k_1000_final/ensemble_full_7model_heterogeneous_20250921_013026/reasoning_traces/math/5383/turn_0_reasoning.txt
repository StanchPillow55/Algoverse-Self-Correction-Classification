=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many bundles of wood were burned in the afternoon after knowing how many were burned in the morning and how many were left at the end of the day.

1. **Identify the initial amount of wood**: 
   At the start of the day, there were 10 bundles of wood.

2. **Determine the amount of wood burned in the morning**: 
   The problem states that 4 bundles of wood were burned in the morning.

3. **Calculate the remaining wood after the morning**:
   To find out how much wood is left after the morning, we subtract the amount burned in the morning from the initial amount:
   \[
   \text{Remaining wood after morning} = \text{Initial wood} - \text{Wood burned in morning}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining wood after morning} = 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ bundles}
   \]

4. **Identify the amount of wood left at the end of the day**: 
   The problem states that there were 3 bundles of wood left at the end of the day.

5. **Calculate the amount of wood burned in the afternoon**:
   To find out how much wood was burned in the afternoon, we need to subtract the amount of wood left at the end of the day from the amount remaining after the morning:
   \[
   \text{Wood burned in afternoon} = \text{Remaining wood after morning} - \text{Wood left at end of day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Wood burned in afternoon} = 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ bundles}
   \]

6. **Final answer**: 
   The number of bundles of wood burned in the afternoon is \( \boxed{3} \).

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem involves simple subtraction. 

At the start of the day, there were 10 bundles of wood. In the morning, the wood stove burned 4 bundles. So, we subtract the number of bundles burned in the morning from the total number of bundles at the start of the day to find out how many bundles were left after the morning burn.

10 bundles - 4 bundles = 6 bundles

So, there were 6 bundles of wood left after the morning burn.

At the end of the day, there were 3 bundles of w...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to determine how many bundles of wood were burned in the afternoon.

Given:
- The wood stove burns 4 bundles of wood in the morning.
- There were 10 bundles of wood at the start of the day.
- There were 3 bundles of wood at the end of the day.

Step 1: Determine the total number of bundles burned throughout the day.
Total bundles burned = Bundles at start of day - Bundles a...
