=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much it will cost Christopher to have enough sugar substitutes to last him 90 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of packets needed for 90 days.**
   - Christopher uses 1 packet of sugar substitute per coffee.
   - He drinks 2 coffees a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of packets he uses in one day is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packets/day}
     \]
   - Over 90 days, the total number of packets he will need is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packets/day} \times 90 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ packets}
     \]

2. **Determine how many boxes of sugar substitute are needed.**
   - Each box contains 30 packets.
   - To find out how many boxes are needed for 180 packets, we divide the total number of packets by the number of packets per box:
     \[
     \frac{180 \text{ packets}}{30 \text{ packets/box}} = 6 \text{ boxes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for the boxes of sugar substitute.**
   - Each box costs $4.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 6 boxes is:
     \[
     6 \text{ boxes} \times 4.00 \text{ dollars/box} = 24.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - The total cost for Christopher to have enough sugar substitutes to last him 90 days is:
     \[
     \boxed{24.00}
     \]

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To determine how much it will cost Christopher to have enough sugar substitutes to last him 90 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of packets needed for 90 days.**
   - Christopher uses 1 packet of sugar substitute per coffee.
   - He drinks 2 coffees a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of packets he uses in one day is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packets/day}
     \]
   - Over 90 days, the total number of packets he will need is:

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Christopher uses 1 packet of sugar substitute per coffee
- He has 2 coffees per day
- The packets come 30 to a box and cost $4.00 per box

To find the cost for 90 days, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of packets Christopher will need for 90 days
2. Calculate the number of boxes he needs to buy
3. Calculate the total cost

Step 1: Calculate the number of packets Christopher wil...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many packets of sugar substitute Christopher will use over 90 days and then calculate the cost based on the price of the packets.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Daily Usage:**
   - Christopher uses 1 packet of sugar substitute per coffee.
   - He drinks 2 coffees a day.
   - Therefore, he uses \(1 \text{ packet/coffee} \times 2 \text{ coffees/day} = 2 \text{ packets/day}\).

2. **Calculate the Total Usage f...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many packets of sugar substitute Christopher uses in a day. Since he uses 1 packet per coffee and he drinks 2 coffees a day, he uses 2 packets a day.

Next, we need to calculate how many packets he will need for 90 days. We do this by multiplying the number of packets he uses in a day by the number of days. 

2 packets/day * 90 days = 180 packets

Now we need to determine how many boxes of sugar substitute he will need to buy. Since each bo...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given:
- Christopher uses 1 packet of sugar substitute per coffee.
- He drinks 2 coffees a day.
- The packets come in a box of 30.
- Each box costs $4.00.
- We need to find the cost for enough sugar substitutes to last 90 days.

Step 1: Calculate the number of sugar substitute packets Christopher uses per day.
Packets per day = Coffees per day × Packets per coffee
Packets per day = 2 × 1 = ...
