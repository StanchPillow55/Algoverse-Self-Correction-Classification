=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of pens in Maria's desk drawer, we will first determine the number of black pens and blue pens based on the information given about the red pens.

1. **Identify the number of red pens**:
   - We know that there are 8 red pens.

2. **Calculate the number of black pens**:
   - The problem states that there are 10 more black pens than red pens.
   - Therefore, the number of black pens can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of black pens} = \text{Number of red pens} + 10 = 8 + 10 = 18
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of blue pens**:
   - The problem also states that there are 7 more blue pens than red pens.
   - Thus, the number of blue pens can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of blue pens} = \text{Number of red pens} + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pens**:
   - Now that we have the number of red, black, and blue pens, we can find the total number of pens by adding them together:
     \[
     \text{Total number of pens} = \text{Number of red pens} + \text{Number of black pens} + \text{Number of blue pens}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total number of pens} = 8 + 18 + 15
     \]

5. **Perform the addition**:
   - First, add the red and black pens:
     \[
     8 + 18 = 26
     \]
   - Next, add the blue pens:
     \[
     26 + 15 = 41
     \]

Thus, the total number of pens in Maria's desk drawer is \( \boxed{41} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 8 red pens in Maria's desk drawer.
- There are 10 more black pens than red pens.
- There are 7 more blue pens than red pens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of black pens.
Number of black pens = Number of red pens + 10
Number of black pens = 8 + 10 = 18

Step 2: Calculate the number of blue pens.
Number of blue pens = Number of red pens + 7
Number of blue pens = 8 + 7 = 15

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pens in Maria's desk drawer by considering the quantities of red, black, and blue pens.

1. **Determine the number of red pens:**
   - The problem states that there are 8 red pens.

2. **Determine the number of black pens:**
   - The problem states that there are 10 more black pens than red pens.
   - Since there are 8 red pens, the number of black pens is:
     \[
     8 + 10 = 18
     \]
   - Therefore, th...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's determine how many black and blue pens Maria has.

The problem states that Maria has 10 more black pens than red pens. Since she has 8 red pens, we can calculate the number of black pens by adding 10 to 8:

8 red pens + 10 = 18 black pens

Similarly, the problem states that Maria has 7 more blue pens than red pens. So we can calculate the number of blue pens by adding 7 to 8:

8 red pens + 7 = 15 blue pens

Now, to find the total number of pens, we add the nu...
