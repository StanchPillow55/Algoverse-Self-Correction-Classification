=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies Danny made.**
   - Danny made 4 dozen cookies. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we can calculate the total number of cookies as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total cookies} = 4 \times 12 = 48
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of chocolate chips in all the cookies.**
   - Each cookie has exactly 7 chocolate chips. Therefore, the total number of chocolate chips in all the cookies can be calculated by multiplying the number of cookies by the number of chips per cookie:
   \[
   \text{Total chips} = 48 \times 7
   \]
   Now, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   48 \times 7 = 336
   \]
   So, there are a total of 336 chocolate chips in all the cookies.

3. **Determine how many cookies are eaten by the class.**
   - The problem states that the class eats half of the cookies. Therefore, we calculate the number of cookies eaten:
   \[
   \text{Cookies eaten} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]

4. **Calculate how many cookies are left uneaten.**
   - To find the number of cookies left, we subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies:
   \[
   \text{Cookies left} = 48 - 24 = 24
   \]

5. **Calculate how many chocolate chips are left uneaten.**
   - Since each cookie has 7 chips, we can find the total number of chips in the uneaten cookies:
   \[
   \text{Chips left} = \text{Cookies left} \times \text{Chips per cookie} = 24 \times 7
   \]
   Now, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   24 \times 7 = 168
   \]

Thus, the total number of chocolate chips left uneaten is \( \boxed{168} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each cookie has 7 chocolate chips.
- Danny made a total of 4 dozen cookies.
- The class eats half the cookies.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies made.
1 dozen = 12 cookies
4 dozen = 4 × 12 = 48 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the total number of chocolate chips in all the cookies.
Number of chips per cookie = 7
Total number of cookies = 48
Total number of chips = 7 × 48 = 336 chip...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine the total number of cookies Danny made. Since a dozen is 12, and he made 4 dozen, we multiply 4 by 12 to get 48 cookies.

Next, we know that each cookie has exactly 7 chips. So, to find the total number of chips, we multiply the number of cookies by the number of chips per cookie. That gives us 48 * 7 = 336 chips.

The problem states that the class eats half the cookies. Therefore, half the chips would also be eaten. To find out how many chips ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Each cookie has 7 chocolate chips.
   * Danny made 4 dozen cookies in total.
   * The class will eat half of the cookies.

2. Calculate the total number of cookies Danny made:
   * 1 dozen = 12 cookies
   * 4 dozen = 4 × 12 = 48 cookies
   So, Danny made a total of 48 cookies.

3. Calculate the number of cookies the class will eat:
   * The class will eat half of the c...
