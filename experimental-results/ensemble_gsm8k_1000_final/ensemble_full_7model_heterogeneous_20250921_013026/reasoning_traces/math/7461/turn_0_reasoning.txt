=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the populations of black bears, white bears, and brown bears in the national park based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the number of black bears**: 
   We are given that the number of black bears in the park is 60.

   \[
   \text{Number of black bears} = 60
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of white bears**: 
   According to the problem, Christi saw twice as many black bears as white bears. This means that the number of white bears can be calculated by dividing the number of black bears by 2.

   \[
   \text{Number of white bears} = \frac{\text{Number of black bears}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of brown bears**: 
   The problem states that there are 40 more brown bears than black bears. Therefore, we can find the number of brown bears by adding 40 to the number of black bears.

   \[
   \text{Number of brown bears} = \text{Number of black bears} + 40 = 60 + 40 = 100
   \]

4. **Calculate the total population of bears in the park**: 
   Now that we have the number of each type of bear, we can find the total population by adding the number of black bears, white bears, and brown bears together.

   \[
   \text{Total population of bears} = \text{Number of black bears} + \text{Number of white bears} + \text{Number of brown bears}
   \]

   Substituting in the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Total population of bears} = 60 + 30 + 100 = 190
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   The total population of bears in the park is 

   \[
   \boxed{190}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Christi saw twice as many black bears as white bears.
- Christi saw 40 more brown bears than black bears.
- The number of black bears in the park is 60.

Step 1: Find the number of white bears.
Since Christi saw twice as many black bears as white bears, we can use the following equation:
Number of black bears = 2 × Number of white bears
60 = 2 × Number of white bears
Number of whi...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of bear in the park and then sum them to find the total bear population.

**Step 1: Determine the number of black bears.**

According to the problem, the number of black bears is given as 60.

\[
\text{Number of black bears} = 60
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of white bears.**

The problem states that Christi saw twice as many black bears as white bears. Let \( W \) represent the number of white bea...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Christi saw twice as many black bears as white bears. If the number of black bears is 60, the number of white bears is 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30.

Christi also saw 40 more brown bears than black bears. If the number of black bears is 60, the number of brown bears is 60+40 = <<60+40=100>>100.

The total population of bears in the park is the sum of the number of black, white, and brown bears. This is 60 black bears + 30 white bears + 100 brown bears = <<60+30+100=190>>190 bears...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given:
- Christi saw twice as many black bears as white bears.
- She saw 40 more brown bears than black bears.
- The number of black bears in the park is 60.

Step 1: Determine the number of white bears.
Since Christi saw twice as many black bears as white bears, we can express the number of white bears as:
White bears = Black bears ÷ 2
White bears = 60 ÷ 2 = 30

Step 2: Determine the numbe...
