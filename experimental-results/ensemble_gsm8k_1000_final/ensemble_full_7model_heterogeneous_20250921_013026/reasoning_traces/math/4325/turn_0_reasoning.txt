=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to break down the total time Jill spends on her journey to the library into parts: the waiting time for the first bus, the riding time on the first bus, and the time spent on the second bus.

1. **Waiting for the First Bus**: Jill waits for 12 minutes.
   \[
   \text{Waiting time for first bus} = 12 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Riding on the First Bus**: Jill rides the first bus for 30 minutes.
   \[
   \text{Riding time on first bus} = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculating the Combined Time for the First Bus**: We need to find the total time spent waiting and riding on the first bus.
   \[
   \text{Combined time for first bus} = \text{Waiting time} + \text{Riding time} = 12 + 30 = 42 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Time on the Second Bus**: According to the problem, the time Jill spends on the second bus is half of the combined wait and trip time on the first bus.
   \[
   \text{Time on second bus} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Combined time for first bus} = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the time Jill spends riding on her second bus is 21 minutes.

Finally, we state the answer:

**Final Answer**: Jill's second bus ride takes 21 minutes.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Jill spends 12 minutes waiting for her first bus.
- Jill spends 30 minutes riding on her first bus.
- Jill spends half the combined wait and trip time on her second bus.

Step 1: Calculate the total time spent on the first bus.
Time spent on the first bus = 12 minutes (waiting) + 30 minutes (riding) = 42 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the combined wait and trip time.
Combined wait and...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Jill spends riding on her second bus. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the time spent on the first bus:**
   - Jill waits for 12 minutes for her first bus.
   - She rides the first bus for 30 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time spent on the first bus (waiting and riding) is:
     \[
     12 \text{ minutes (waiting)} + 30 \text{ minutes (riding)} = 42 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Determine ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find the total time Jill spends waiting for and riding on her first bus. 

She spends 12 minutes waiting and 30 minutes riding, so the total time is 12 minutes + 30 minutes = 42 minutes.

The problem states that Jill spends half the combined wait and trip time on her first bus on her second bus. 

So, to find the time she spends on her second bus, we need to take half of the total time she spends on her first bus. 

Half of 42 minutes is 42 minutes / 2 =...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jill spends 12 minutes waiting for her first bus.
   * She spends 30 minutes riding on her first bus.
   * The time spent on her second bus is half the combined wait and trip time of the first bus.

2. Calculate the combined wait and trip time for the first bus:
   * Combined time = Waiting time + Trip time
   * Combined time = 12 minutes + 30 minutes
   * Combin...
