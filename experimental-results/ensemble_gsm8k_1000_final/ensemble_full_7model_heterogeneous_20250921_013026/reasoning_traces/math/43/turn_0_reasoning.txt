=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of buildings that collapsed after a series of earthquakes, starting with the first earthquake where 4 buildings collapsed. Each subsequent earthquake causes double the number of buildings to collapse compared to the previous earthquake.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Earthquake**: 
   - Number of buildings that collapsed = 4

2. **Second Earthquake**: 
   - According to the problem, the number of buildings that collapse doubles from the previous earthquake.
   - Therefore, buildings collapsed = \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \)

3. **Third Earthquake**: 
   - Again, the number of buildings that collapse doubles from the second earthquake.
   - Therefore, buildings collapsed = \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \)

4. **Fourth Earthquake**: 
   - The number of buildings that collapse doubles again from the third earthquake.
   - Therefore, buildings collapsed = \( 2 \times 16 = 32 \)

Now, we will sum the total number of buildings that collapsed from all four earthquakes:

\[
\text{Total buildings collapsed} = \text{First earthquake} + \text{Second earthquake} + \text{Third earthquake} + \text{Fourth earthquake}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total buildings collapsed} = 4 + 8 + 16 + 32
\]

Now, we perform the addition step-by-step:

- First, add the first two terms:
  \[
  4 + 8 = 12
  \]

- Next, add the result to the third term:
  \[
  12 + 16 = 28
  \]

- Finally, add the result to the fourth term:
  \[
  28 + 32 = 60
  \]

Thus, the total number of buildings that collapsed after all four earthquakes is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem.

We know that the first earthquake caused 4 buildings to collapse. 

According to the problem, each subsequent earthquake causes double the number of buildings to collapse compared to the previous one. 

So, for the second earthquake, the number of collapsed buildings would be 4 (from the first earthquake) * 2 = 8 buildings.

For the third earthquake, the number of collapsed buildings would be 8 (from the second earthquake) * 2 = 16 buildings...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll calculate the number of buildings that collapse in each earthquake and then sum them up to get the total number of collapsed buildings.

Given:
- In the first earthquake, 4 buildings collapsed.
- Each following earthquake causes double the number of collapsing buildings as the previous one.
- There are three more earthquakes after the first one.

Step 1: Calculate the number of buildings that collap...
