=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much Marsha gets paid per mile, we need to first calculate the total distance she drives for her deliveries and then divide her total pay by that distance.

### Step 1: Calculate the distances for each delivery

1. **First package:** 10 miles
2. **Second package:** 28 miles
3. **Third package:** Half the distance of the second package:
   \[
   \text{Distance for third package} = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance driven

Now, we add up all the distances:
\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance for first package} + \text{Distance for second package} + \text{Distance for third package}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance} = 10 + 28 + 14
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
\text{Total distance} = 52 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the pay per mile

Marsha gets paid $104 for the day. To find out how much she gets paid per mile, we divide her total pay by the total distance:
\[
\text{Pay per mile} = \frac{\text{Total pay}}{\text{Total distance}}
\]
\[
\text{Pay per mile} = \frac{104}{52}
\]

### Step 4: Perform the division

Calculating the division:
\[
\frac{104}{52} = 2
\]

### Final Answer

Marsha gets paid **$2 per mile**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance Marsha drove and then calculate the amount she gets paid per mile.

Given information:
- Marsha drives 10 miles to deliver the first package.
- Marsha drives 28 miles to deliver the second package.
- Marsha drives half the distance of the second package to deliver the third package, which is 14 miles.
- Marsha gets paid $104 for the day.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance Marsha drove.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many miles Marsha drives in total and then calculate how much she gets paid per mile.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance driven.**

1. **First package:** Marsha drives 10 miles.
2. **Second package:** Marsha drives 28 miles.
3. **Third package:** Marsha drives half the distance of the second package. Since the second package is 28 miles, half of that is:
   \[
   \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ miles}
   \]

Now, add up all t...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we first need to figure out the total miles Marsha drove. We know she drove 10 miles for the first package and 28 miles for the second package. 

For the third package, she drove half the distance of the second package. Half of 28 miles is 14 miles (28/2 = 14). 

So, to find the total miles, we add all these distances together: 10 miles + 28 miles + 14 miles = 52 miles.

Marsha gets paid $104 for driving 52 miles. To find out how much she gets paid ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Marsha drives 10 miles to deliver her first package.
   * She drives 28 miles to deliver her second package.
   * For her third package, she drives half the distance of the second package.
   * Marsha gets paid $104 for the day.

2. Calculate the distance Marsha drives to deliver her third package:
   * Distance for the third package = Half of the distance for the s...
