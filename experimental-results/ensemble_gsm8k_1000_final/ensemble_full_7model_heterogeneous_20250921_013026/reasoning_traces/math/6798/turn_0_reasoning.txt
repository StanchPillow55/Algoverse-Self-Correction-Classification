Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many minutes Lena and her brother played video games together last weekend.

1. **Convert Lena's playtime from hours to minutes**:
   Lena played for 3.5 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert hours to minutes by multiplying by 60.

   \[
   \text{Lena's playtime in minutes} = 3.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour}
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   3.5 \times 60 = 210 \text{ minutes}
   \]

   So, Lena played for **210 minutes**.

2. **Determine her brother's playtime**:
   According to the problem, her brother played 17 minutes more than Lena. Therefore, we add 17 minutes to Lena's playtime to find out how long her brother played.

   \[
   \text{Brother's playtime} = \text{Lena's playtime} + 17 \text{ minutes}
   \]

   Substituting in Lena's playtime:

   \[
   \text{Brother's playtime} = 210 \text{ minutes} + 17 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}
   \]

   So, her brother played for **227 minutes**.

3. **Calculate the total playtime together**:
   Now, we need to find the total playtime of both Lena and her brother by adding their individual playtimes together.

   \[
   \text{Total playtime} = \text{Lena's playtime} + \text{Brother's playtime}
   \]

   Substituting in the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Total playtime} = 210 \text{ minutes} + 227 \text{ minutes} = 437 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total amount of time that Lena and her brother played video games together last weekend is **437 minutes**.

\[
\boxed{437}

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to convert Lena's playing time from hours to minutes because her brother's playing time is given in minutes. We know that 1 hour equals 60 minutes. 

So, Lena's playing time in minutes is 3.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 210 minutes.

Her brother played 17 minutes more than she did, so her brother's playing time is 210 minutes + 17 minutes = 227 minutes.

To find out how many minutes together they played video games, we add Lena's playing time to her brother's...
