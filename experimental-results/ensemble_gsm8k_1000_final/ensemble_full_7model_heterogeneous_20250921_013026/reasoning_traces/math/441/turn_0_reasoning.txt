=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of people invited from each group:**
   - Martin invited **5 people from his hometown**.
   - He invited **twice as many people from his school**. Therefore, the number of people from his school is:
     \[
     2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ people}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of people invited from the hometown and school:**
   - The total number of people from both groups is:
     \[
     5 + 10 = 15 \text{ people}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of people invited from the sports club:**
   - Martin invited as many people from his sports club as the sum of people invited from his hometown and school. Therefore, the number of people from his sports club is also:
     \[
     15 \text{ people}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of people invited so far:**
   - The total number of people invited from all groups (hometown, school, and sports club) is:
     \[
     5 + 10 + 15 = 30 \text{ people}
     \]

5. **Determine the remaining invitations:**
   - The problem states that the remaining invitations represent **20% of the total previously mentioned**. To find the total number of invitations, we need to let \( x \) be the total number of invitations. The remaining invitations can be expressed as:
     \[
     0.2x
     \]
   - The total number of people invited (30) plus the remaining invitations (0.2x) equals the total number of invitations:
     \[
     30 + 0.2x = x
     \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Rearranging the equation gives:
     \[
     30 = x - 0.2x
     \]
     \[
     30 = 0.8x
     \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 0.8 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{30}{0.8} = 37.5
     \]

   Since the number of invitations must be a whole number, we round \( x \) to the nearest whole number, which is 38.

7. **Calculate the total number of people who can potentially come to the party:**
   - The total number of people who can potentially come to the party is the total number of invitations, which we found to be 38.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{38}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out how many people Martin invited from each group.

We know that Martin invited 5 people from his hometown. He invited twice as many people from his school, so that's 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 people from his school.

The number of people Martin invited from his sports club is equal to the sum of the people invited from his hometown and his school. So, that's 5 (hometown) + 10 (school) = <<5+10=15>>15 people from his sports club.

So far, Martin has in...
