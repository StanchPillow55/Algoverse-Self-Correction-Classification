=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of toes on the Popton school bus, which carries 7 Hoopit students and 8 Neglart students. We will break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of toes for one Hoopit

Each Hoopit has:
- 3 toes on each hand
- 4 hands

To find the total number of toes for one Hoopit, we multiply the number of toes per hand by the number of hands:

\[
\text{Toes per Hoopit} = \text{Toes per hand} \times \text{Number of hands} = 3 \text{ toes/hand} \times 4 \text{ hands} = 12 \text{ toes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of toes for all Hoopit students

Now, we need to find the total number of toes for 7 Hoopit students:

\[
\text{Total toes for Hoopits} = \text{Number of Hoopits} \times \text{Toes per Hoopit} = 7 \text{ Hoopits} \times 12 \text{ toes/Hoopit} = 84 \text{ toes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of toes for one Neglart

Each Neglart has:
- 2 toes on each hand
- 5 hands

To find the total number of toes for one Neglart, we multiply the number of toes per hand by the number of hands:

\[
\text{Toes per Neglart} = \text{Toes per hand} \times \text{Number of hands} = 2 \text{ toes/hand} \times 5 \text{ hands} = 10 \text{ toes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of toes for all Neglart students

Now, we need to find the total number of toes for 8 Neglart students:

\[
\text{Total toes for Neglarts} = \text{Number of Neglarts} \times \text{Toes per Neglart} = 8 \text{ Neglarts} \times 10 \text{ toes/Neglart} = 80 \text{ toes}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of toes on the school bus

Finally, we add the total number of toes from both the Hoopit and Neglart students to find the total number of toes on the school bus:

\[
\text{Total toes on the bus} = \text{Total toes for Hoopits} + \text{Total toes for Neglarts} = 84 \text{ toes} + 80 \text{ toes} = 164 \text{ toes}
\]

### Final Answer

The total number of toes on the Popton school bus is:

\[
\boxed{164}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of toes on the Popton school bus.

Given information:
- Each Hoopit has 3 toes on each of their 4 hands.
- Each Neglart has 2 toes on each of their 5 hands.
- The school bus carries 7 Hoopit students and 8 Neglart students.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of toes for the Hoopit students.
Number of toes per Hoopit = 3 toes per hand Ã— 4 hands = 12 toes
Total number of toes for Hoopit students =...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toes on the school bus by considering the number of toes each Hoopit and each Neglart has, and then multiplying by the number of each type of student on the bus.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of toes per Hoopit

- Each Hoopit has 4 hands.
- Each hand has 3 toes.

To find the total number of toes per Hoopit, multiply the number of hands by the number of toes per hand:

\[
4 \text{ hands/Hoopit} \times 3 \...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the number of toes for each race of beings.

Each Hoopit has 3 toes on each of their 4 hands. So, the total number of toes for one Hoopit is 3 toes/hand * 4 hands = 12 toes.

Each Neglart has 2 toes on each of their 5 hands. So, the total number of toes for one Neglart is 2 toes/hand * 5 hands = 10 toes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of toes on the bus.

The bus carries 7 Hoopit students and 8 Neglart students. So, the total number of Hoopi...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are two races on Popton: Hoopits and Neglarts.
   * Each Hoopit has 3 toes on each of their 4 hands.
   * Each Neglart has 2 toes on each of their 5 hands.
   * The Popton school bus always carries 7 Hoopit students and 8 Neglart students.

2. Calculate the total number of toes for one Hoopit:
   * Number of hands per Hoopit = 4
   * Number of toes on each hand o...
