=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time Dan takes to dig 5 adult graves and 1 child's grave.

1. **Determine the time taken for adult graves:**
   - Dan takes 3 hours to dig one adult grave.
   - Therefore, for 5 adult graves, the time taken is:
     \[
     \text{Time for 5 adult graves} = 5 \text{ graves} \times 3 \text{ hours/grave} = 15 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Determine the time taken for the child's grave:**
   - Dan takes 2 hours to dig one child's grave.
   - Therefore, for 1 child's grave, the time taken is:
     \[
     \text{Time for 1 child's grave} = 1 \text{ grave} \times 2 \text{ hours/grave} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   - Now, we add the time taken for the adult graves and the child's grave:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time for 5 adult graves} + \text{Time for 1 child's grave}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, the total time it takes Dan to dig 5 adult graves and 1 child's grave is **17 hours**.

Final answer: **17 hours**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total time it takes Dan to dig 5 adult graves and one child's grave.

Given information:
- It takes Dan 3 hours to dig an adult grave.
- It takes Dan 2 hours to dig a child's grave.
- Dan needs to dig 5 adult graves and one child's grave.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to dig the 5 adult graves.
Time to dig 1 adult grave = 3 hours
Time to dig 5 adult graves = 5 × 3 hours = 15 hours

Step 2: Calculate th...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Dan spends digging 5 adult graves and 1 child's grave. We will do this by calculating the time taken for each type of grave separately and then summing these times.

1. **Calculate the time for adult graves:**

   - Dan takes 3 hours to dig one adult grave.
   - He needs to dig 5 adult graves.

   To find the total time for the adult graves, we multiply the time per grave by the number of graves:

   \[
   \text{...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total time it takes Dan to dig an adult grave and a child's grave. 

According to the problem, it takes Dan 3 hours to dig an adult grave and 2 hours to dig a child's grave. 

So, if he needs to dig 5 adult graves, the total time he will spend is 5 graves * 3 hours/grave = 15 hours.

Next, he also needs to dig 1 child's grave, which takes him 2 hours. 

Therefore, the total time Dan will spend digging 5 adult graves and 1 child's grave is 1...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * It takes Dan 3 hours to dig an adult grave.
   * It takes Dan 2 hours to dig a child's grave.
   * Dan needs to dig 5 adult graves and 1 child's grave.

2. Calculate the time needed to dig the adult graves:
   * Time for one adult grave = 3 hours
   * Number of adult graves = 5
   * Time for adult graves = 3 hours × 5
   * Time for adult graves = 15 hours

3. Calculate t...
