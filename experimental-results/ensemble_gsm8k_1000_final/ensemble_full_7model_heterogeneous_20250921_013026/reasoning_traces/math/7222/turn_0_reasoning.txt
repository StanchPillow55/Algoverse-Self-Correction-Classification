=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of Black Copper Marans (BCM) chickens.**
2. **Calculate the number of BCM hens from the total BCM chickens.**

### Step 1: Calculate the number of Black Copper Marans

The problem states that 20 percent of the 100 chickens on the farm are Black Copper Marans. To find the number of BCM chickens, we can use the following calculation:

\[
\text{Number of BCM} = \text{Total chickens} \times \text{Percentage of BCM}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of BCM} = 100 \times 0.20 = 20
\]

So, there are 20 Black Copper Marans on the farm.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of BCM hens

Next, we know that 80 percent of the Black Copper Marans are hens. We will calculate the number of BCM hens using the same method:

\[
\text{Number of BCM hens} = \text{Number of BCM} \times \text{Percentage of hens}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of BCM hens} = 20 \times 0.80 = 16
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of Black Copper Marans hens on the farm is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The farm has 100 chickens.
- 20% of the chickens are Black Copper Marans (BCM).
- 80% of the BCM chickens are hens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of BCM chickens.
20% of 100 chickens = 0.20 × 100 = 20 BCM chickens

Step 2: Calculate the number of BCM hens.
80% of the BCM chickens are hens = 0.80 × 20 = 16 BCM hens

Therefore, the number of BCM hens on the farm is 16.

Final answer: There are 1...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Black Copper Marans (BCM) hens are on the farm.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of Black Copper Marans.**

The problem states that 20 percent of the chickens are Black Copper Marans. We know the total number of chickens on the farm is 100.

To find the number of Black Copper Marans, we calculate 20 percent of 100:

\[
\text{Number of BCM} = 0.20 \times 100 = 20
\]

So, there are 20 Black Copper Marans on the farm.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many Black Copper Marans (BCM) there are in total. 

We know that 20% of the chickens are BCM. To find this, we multiply the total number of chickens by 20% (or 0.20 in decimal form):

100 chickens * 0.20 = 20 BCM

Next, we need to find out how many of these BCM are hens. We know that 80% of the BCM are hens. To find this, we multiply the total number of BCM by 80% (or 0.80 in decimal form):

20 BCM * 0.80 = 16 BCM hens

So, there are 16 Black Co...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The farm has a total of 100 chickens.
   * 20% of the chickens are Black Copper Marans (BCM).
   * 80% of the BCM chickens are hens.

2. Calculate the number of BCM chickens:
   * Total chickens = 100
   * Percentage of BCM chickens = 20% = 0.20
   * Number of BCM chickens = Total chickens × Percentage of BCM chickens
   * Number of BCM chickens = 100 × 0.20 = 20
