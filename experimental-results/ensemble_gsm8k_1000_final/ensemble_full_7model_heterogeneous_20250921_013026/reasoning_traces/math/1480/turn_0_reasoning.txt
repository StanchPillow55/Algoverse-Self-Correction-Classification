Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many scoops of ice cream Victoria has compared to Oli and then find the difference between the two.

1. **Identify the number of scoops Oli has**: 
   - According to the problem, Oli has 4 scoops of ice cream.

2. **Determine how many scoops Victoria has**: 
   - The problem states that Victoria has "twice more scoops of ice cream than Oli's." This phrase can be interpreted as Victoria having twice the number of scoops that Oli has.
   - Therefore, we calculate the number of scoops Victoria has:
     \[
     \text{Victoria's scoops} = 2 \times \text{Oli's scoops} = 2 \times 4 = 8
     \]

3. **Calculate the difference in the number of scoops**: 
   - Now we need to find out how many more scoops Victoria has than Oli:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Victoria's scoops} - \text{Oli's scoops} = 8 - 4 = 4
     \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   - Victoria has 4 more scoops of ice cream than Oli.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Oli's banana split has 4 scoops of ice cream.
- Victoria has twice more scoops of ice cream than Oli.

Step 1: Determine how many scoops of ice cream Victoria has.
Since Victoria has twice more scoops of ice cream than Oli, we can calculate this as:
Victoria's scoops of ice cream = 2 × Oli's scoops of ice cream
Victoria's scoops of ice cream = 2 × 4 = 8 scoops

Step 2: Calculate the diffe...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more scoops of ice cream Victoria has compared to Oli.

1. **Identify the number of scoops Oli has:**
   - Oli's banana split has 4 scoops of ice cream.

2. **Determine how many scoops Victoria has:**
   - The problem states that Victoria has twice more scoops than Oli. This phrase "twice more" can be interpreted as Victoria having two times the number of scoops Oli has, plus the original amount Oli has.
   - Therefore...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's understand what "twice more" means. If Victoria has twice more scoops of ice cream than Oli, it means she has two times the amount of Oli's scoops plus Oli's scoops.

Oli has 4 scoops of ice cream.

Twice the amount of Oli's scoops is 2 * 4 = 8 scoops.

So, Victoria has 8 (twice Oli's scoops) + 4 (Oli's scoops) = 12 scoops of ice cream.

To find out how many more scoops Victoria has than Oli, we subtract Oli's scoops from Victoria's scoops.

So, Victoria has ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Oli's banana split has 4 scoops of ice cream.
- Victoria has twice as many scoops of ice cream as Oli.

Step 1: Determine the number of scoops of ice cream Victoria has.
Victoria's scoops = 2 × Oli's scoops
Victoria's scoops = 2 × 4 = 8 scoops

Explanation: Since Victoria has twice as many scoops as Oli, we multiply Oli's number of scoops by 2 to find Victoria's number of scoops.

Step ...
