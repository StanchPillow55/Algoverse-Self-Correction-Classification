=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much more expensive Mark's first TV was compared to his new TV, measured by cost per square inch, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the area of each TV in square inches.**
2. **Calculate the cost per square inch for each TV.**
3. **Compare the cost per square inch of the two TVs.**

### Step 1: Calculate the area of each TV

**First TV:**
- Width = 24 inches
- Height = 16 inches

Area of the first TV:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{first}} = \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 24 \, \text{inches} \times 16 \, \text{inches} = 384 \, \text{square inches}
\]

**New TV:**
- Width = 48 inches
- Height = 32 inches

Area of the new TV:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{new}} = \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 48 \, \text{inches} \times 32 \, \text{inches} = 1536 \, \text{square inches}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost per square inch for each TV

**Cost of the first TV:**
- Cost = $672

Cost per square inch for the first TV:
\[
\text{Cost per square inch}_{\text{first}} = \frac{\text{Cost}}{\text{Area}} = \frac{672}{384}
\]
Calculating this:
\[
\text{Cost per square inch}_{\text{first}} = \frac{672}{384} = 1.75 \, \text{dollars per square inch}
\]

**Cost of the new TV:**
- Cost = $1152

Cost per square inch for the new TV:
\[
\text{Cost per square inch}_{\text{new}} = \frac{\text{Cost}}{\text{Area}} = \frac{1152}{1536}
\]
Calculating this:
\[
\text{Cost per square inch}_{\text{new}} = \frac{1152}{1536} = 0.75 \, \text{dollars per square inch}
\]

### Step 3: Compare the cost per square inch of the two TVs

Now we can find out how much more expensive the first TV was compared to the new TV:
\[
\text{Difference in cost per square inch} = \text{Cost per square inch}_{\text{first}} - \text{Cost per square inch}_{\text{new}} = 1.75 - 0.75
\]
Calculating this:
\[
\text{Difference in cost per square inch} = 1.00 \, \text{dollars per square inch}
\]

### Final Answer
The first TV was **$1.00 more expensive per square inch** compared to the new TV.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the cost per square inch for both the first TV and the new TV, and then calculate the difference between them.

Given information:
- First TV: 24 inches wide, 16 inches tall, and cost $672.
- New TV: 48 inches wide, 32 inches tall, and cost $1152.

Step 1: Calculate the area of the first TV.
Area of the first TV = Width × Height
Area of the first TV = 24 inches × 16 inches = 384 square inches

Step 2: Calculate t...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost per square inch for both of Mark's TVs and then determine how much more expensive the first TV was compared to the second TV in terms of cost per square inch.

### Step 1: Calculate the area of each TV

**First TV:**
- Width = 24 inches
- Height = 16 inches

The area of the first TV is calculated as:
\[
\text{Area of first TV} = \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 24 \times 16 = 384 \text{ square inches}
\]

**Second T...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the area of each TV in square inches. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula width * height.

For the first TV, the area is 24 inches * 16 inches = 384 square inches.

For the second TV, the area is 48 inches * 32 inches = 1536 square inches.

Next, we need to calculate the cost per square inch for each TV. This is done by dividing the cost of the TV by the area of the TV.

For the first TV, the cost per square inch is $672 / 384 squar...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We need to find out how much more expensive the first TV was compared to the new TV in terms of cost per square inch.

Given:
- First TV: 24 inches wide, 16 inches tall, cost $672
- New TV: 48 inches wide, 32 inches tall, cost $1152

Step 1: Calculate the area of each TV in square inches.
First TV area = Width × Height = 24 inches × 16 inches = 384 square inches
New TV area = Width × Height = 48 inches × 32 ...
