Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.**
2. **Determine how many flowers Mr. Wells cuts.**
3. **Calculate the remaining number of flowers after cutting.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden

Mr. Wells has 50 rows of flowers, and each row contains 400 flowers. To find the total number of flowers, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers per row:

\[
\text{Total flowers} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Flowers per row}
\]

\[
\text{Total flowers} = 50 \times 400
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total flowers} = 20000
\]

So, there are 20,000 flowers in the garden.

### Step 2: Determine how many flowers Mr. Wells cuts

Mr. Wells cuts 60% of the flowers. To find out how many flowers this is, we need to calculate 60% of the total number of flowers:

\[
\text{Flowers cut} = 60\% \times \text{Total flowers}
\]

Converting 60% to a decimal gives us 0.60. Therefore, we can calculate:

\[
\text{Flowers cut} = 0.60 \times 20000
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Flowers cut} = 12000
\]

So, Mr. Wells cuts 12,000 flowers.

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining number of flowers after cutting

To find the number of flowers remaining in the garden, we subtract the number of flowers cut from the total number of flowers:

\[
\text{Remaining flowers} = \text{Total flowers} - \text{Flowers cut}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Remaining flowers} = 20000 - 12000
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Remaining flowers} = 8000
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of flowers remaining in the garden is:

\[
\boxed{8000}
\]

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.**
2. **Determine how many flowers Mr. Wells cuts.**
3. **Calculate the remaining number of flowers after cutting.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden

Mr. Wells has 50 rows of flowers, and each row contains 400 flowers. To find the total number of flowers, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers per row:

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mr. Wells has a garden with 50 rows of flowers.
- Each row has 400 flowers.
- Mr. Wells cuts 60% of the flowers.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.
Total number of flowers = Number of rows × Number of flowers per row
Total number of flowers = 50 × 400 = 20,000 flowers

Step 2: Calculate the number of flowers that Mr. Wells cuts.
Number of flowers cut = 60% of the tot...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many flowers are initially in the garden, how many flowers Mr. Wells cuts, and finally, how many flowers remain.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Flowers

Mr. Wells has a garden with 50 rows, and each row contains 400 flowers. To find the total number of flowers in the garden, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers per row:

\[
\text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Nu...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many flowers are in the garden in total. We do this by multiplying the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row. 

So, 50 rows * 400 flowers/row = 20,000 flowers

Next, we need to find out how many flowers Mr. Wells cuts. We know he cuts 60% of the flowers. To find out how many this is, we multiply the total number of flowers by 60% (or 0.60 in decimal form).

So, 20,000 flowers * 0.60 = 12,000 flowers

This is the number of flowe...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mr. Wells has a garden with 50 rows of flowers.
   * Each row has 400 flowers.
   * Mr. Wells cuts 60% of the flowers.

2. Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden:
   * Total flowers = Number of rows × Flowers per row
   * Total flowers = 50 × 400
   * Total flowers = 20,000
   So, initially, there are 20,000 flowers in the garden.

3. Calculate the n...
