=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many ounces one serving of Chicken Surprise would be, we first need to determine the total amount of Chicken Surprise in ounces and then divide that by the number of servings.

### Step 1: Convert the chicken and stuffing to ounces

1. **Convert chicken from pounds to ounces**:
   - We know that 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces.
   - Therefore, to convert 4.5 pounds of chicken to ounces:
     \[
     4.5 \text{ pounds} \times 16 \text{ ounces/pound} = 72 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Stuffing is already given in ounces**:
   - The amount of stuffing is 24 ounces.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of Chicken Surprise in ounces

Now, we add the ounces of chicken and the ounces of stuffing together to find the total amount of Chicken Surprise:
\[
\text{Total ounces} = \text{Ounces of chicken} + \text{Ounces of stuffing}
\]
\[
\text{Total ounces} = 72 \text{ ounces} + 24 \text{ ounces} = 96 \text{ ounces}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the amount per serving

Now, we need to divide the total ounces by the number of servings (12) to find out how many ounces are in one serving:
\[
\text{Ounces per serving} = \frac{\text{Total ounces}}{\text{Number of servings}} = \frac{96 \text{ ounces}}{12}
\]
\[
\text{Ounces per serving} = 8 \text{ ounces}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, one serving of Chicken Surprise is **8 ounces**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of Chicken Surprise and then divide it by the number of servings to get the amount of Chicken Surprise per serving.

Given information:
- For 12 servings of Chicken Surprise, you need 4.5 pounds of chicken and 24 ounces of stuffing.

Step 1: Convert the amount of chicken from pounds to ounces.
1 pound = 16 ounces
4.5 pounds of chicken = 4.5 × 16 = 72 ounces of chicken

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weight of the Chicken Surprise for 12 servings and then find out how much one serving would weigh in ounces.

### Step 1: Convert all measurements to the same unit

First, let's convert the weight of the chicken from pounds to ounces, since the stuffing is already in ounces. We know that:
\[ 1 \text{ pound} = 16 \text{ ounces} \]

So, for 4.5 pounds of chicken:
\[ 4.5 \text{ pounds} \times 16 \text{ ounces per pound} ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to convert the weight of the chicken from pounds to ounces since the weight of the stuffing is given in ounces. We know that 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces. 

So, 4.5 pounds of chicken is equal to 4.5 * 16 = 72 ounces.

The total weight of the ingredients for 12 servings is the sum of the weight of the chicken and the stuffing, which is 72 ounces (chicken) + 24 ounces (stuffing) = 96 ounces.

Therefore, one serving of Chicken Surprise, which is 1/12 of the t...
