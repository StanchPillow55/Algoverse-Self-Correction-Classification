=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's define the number of fish caught by each person using variables:

- Let \( P \) be the number of fish caught by Patrick.
- According to the problem, Angus caught 4 more fish than Patrick, so we can express the number of fish Angus caught as:
  \[
  A = P + 4
  \]
- The problem also states that Ollie caught 7 fewer fish than Angus. Since we know Ollie caught 5 fish, we can express this relationship as:
  \[
  O = A - 7
  \]
  where \( O = 5 \) (the number of fish Ollie caught).

Now we can substitute \( O \) into the equation:
\[
5 = A - 7
\]

Next, we solve for \( A \):
\[
A = 5 + 7
\]
\[
A = 12
\]

Now we know that Angus caught 12 fish. We can now substitute \( A \) back into the equation for Angus to find \( P \):
\[
A = P + 4
\]
Substituting \( A = 12 \):
\[
12 = P + 4
\]

Now, we solve for \( P \):
\[
P = 12 - 4
\]
\[
P = 8
\]

Thus, Patrick caught \( \boxed{8} \) fish. 

To summarize:
- Angus caught 12 fish.
- Patrick caught 8 fish.
- Ollie caught 5 fish.
- The relationships hold true: Angus caught 4 more than Patrick (12 = 8 + 4) and Ollie caught 7 fewer than Angus (5 = 12 - 7). 

Final answer: Patrick caught \( \boxed{8} \) fish.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Angus caught 4 more fish than Patrick.
- Ollie caught 7 fewer fish than Angus.
- Ollie caught 5 fish.

Step 1: Find how many fish Angus caught.
Since Ollie caught 7 fewer fish than Angus, and Ollie caught 5 fish, we can calculate Angus' catch:
Angus' catch = Ollie's catch + 7
Angus' catch = 5 + 7 = 12 fish

Step 2: Find how many fish Patrick caught.
We know that Angus caught 4 more fish t...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many fish Patrick caught, given the relationships between the number of fish caught by Angus, Patrick, and Ollie.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( P \) represent the number of fish Patrick caught.
- Let \( A \) represent the number of fish Angus caught.
- Let \( O \) represent the number of fish Ollie caught.

We are given the following information:
1. Ollie caught 5 fish. Therefore, \( O = 5 \).
2. Angus caught 4 more...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out how many fish Angus caught. Since Ollie caught 7 fewer fish than Angus and Ollie caught 5 fish, we can add 7 to Ollie's total to find out how many fish Angus caught. 

5 (Ollie's total) + 7 = 12 fish

So, Angus caught 12 fish. 

Now, we know that Angus caught 4 more fish than Patrick. So, to find out how many fish Patrick caught, we subtract 4 from Angus's total.

12 (Angus's total) - 4 = 8 fish

So, Patrick caught 8 fish. 

Therefore, the fina...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the information given to set up an equation and solve for the number of fish Patrick caught.

Given:
- Angus caught 4 more fish than Patrick.
- Ollie caught 7 fewer fish than Angus.
- Ollie caught 5 fish.

Step 1: Let's express the number of fish Angus caught in terms of Patrick's catch.
Angus's fish = Patrick's fish + 4

Step 2: Express the number of fish Ollie caught in terms of Angus's catch....
