=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first determine the current ages of all three siblings based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the age of the eldest sibling**: 
   The eldest sibling is currently 20 years old.

2. **Calculate the age of the second sibling**: 
   Since the siblings are born 5 years apart, the second sibling is 5 years younger than the eldest. 
   \[
   \text{Age of second sibling} = 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Calculate the age of the youngest sibling**: 
   The youngest sibling is also 5 years younger than the second sibling. 
   \[
   \text{Age of youngest sibling} = 15 - 5 = 10 \text{ years old}
   \]

Now we have the current ages of all three siblings:
- Eldest sibling: 20 years old
- Second sibling: 15 years old
- Youngest sibling: 10 years old

4. **Calculate the total current age of the three siblings**:
   \[
   \text{Total current age} = 20 + 15 + 10 = 45 \text{ years}
   \]

5. **Determine the ages of the siblings 10 years from now**:
   - The eldest sibling will be:
   \[
   20 + 10 = 30 \text{ years old}
   \]
   - The second sibling will be:
   \[
   15 + 10 = 25 \text{ years old}
   \]
   - The youngest sibling will be:
   \[
   10 + 10 = 20 \text{ years old}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total age of the siblings 10 years from now**:
   \[
   \text{Total age in 10 years} = 30 + 25 + 20 = 75 \text{ years}
   \]

Finally, the total of the ages of the three siblings 10 years from now is:
\[
\boxed{75}
\]

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will first determine the current ages of all three siblings based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the age of the eldest sibling**: 
   The eldest sibling is currently 20 years old.

2. **Calculate the age of the second sibling**: 
   Since the siblings are born 5 years apart, the second sibling is 5 years younger than the eldest.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The three siblings are born 5 years apart.
- The eldest child is 20 years old now.

Step 1: Find the ages of the three siblings now.
Eldest child: 20 years old
Middle child: 20 - 5 = 15 years old
Youngest child: 20 - 10 = 10 years old

Step 2: Find the ages of the three siblings 10 years from now.
Eldest child: 20 + 10 = 30 years old
Middle child: 15 + 10 = 25 years old
Youngest child: 10...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of the three siblings and then calculate their ages 10 years from now. Finally, we'll sum these future ages to get the total.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine the current ages of the siblings:**

   - We know the eldest sibling is currently 20 years old.
   - The siblings are born 5 years apart. Therefore, the second sibling is 5 years younger than the eldest, and the third sibling is 5 years younger...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out the current ages of all three siblings. 

We know that the eldest child is 20 years old now. Since each sibling is born 5 years apart, the second child would be 20 - 5 = 15 years old. Similarly, the youngest child would be 15 - 5 = 10 years old.

So, currently, the total age of the three siblings is 20 + 15 + 10 = 45 years.

The problem asks for the total age of the siblings 10 years from now. In 10 years, each sibling will be 10 years older th...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There are three siblings.
- The age difference between each sibling is 5 years.
- The eldest child is currently 20 years old.
- We need to find the total of the ages of the three siblings 10 years from now.

Step 1: Determine the current ages of the three siblings.
- Eldest child's age = 20 years old
- Middle child's age = Eldest child's age - 5 = 20 - 5 = 15 years old
- Youngest chi...
