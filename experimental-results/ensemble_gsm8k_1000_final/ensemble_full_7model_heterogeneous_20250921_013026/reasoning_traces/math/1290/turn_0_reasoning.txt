=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount of paint Andy uses based on the given ratio of blue, green, and white paint, which is 1 : 2 : 5.

1. **Understanding the Ratio**: 
   The ratio 1 : 2 : 5 means that for every 1 part of blue paint, there are 2 parts of green paint and 5 parts of white paint. We can represent the amounts of paint as follows:
   - Blue paint = 1x
   - Green paint = 2x
   - White paint = 5x
   where \( x \) is a common multiplier.

2. **Using the Given Information**:
   We know that Andy uses 6 gallons of green paint. According to our representation, the amount of green paint is given by:
   \[
   2x = 6
   \]

3. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   To find \( x \), we can solve the equation:
   \[
   x = \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]

4. **Calculating the Amounts of Each Color**:
   Now that we have \( x = 3 \), we can calculate the amounts of blue and white paint:
   - Blue paint:
     \[
     1x = 1 \times 3 = 3 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Green paint:
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ gallons} \quad (\text{as given})
     \]
   - White paint:
     \[
     5x = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ gallons}
     \]

5. **Calculating the Total Amount of Paint**:
   Now we can find the total amount of paint used by adding the amounts of each color together:
   \[
   \text{Total paint} = \text{Blue} + \text{Green} + \text{White} = 3 + 6 + 15
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total paint} = 24 \text{ gallons}
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, the total amount of paint that Andy uses is:
   \[
   \boxed{24} \text{ gallons}
   \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of paint used by Andy based on the given ratio of blue, green, and white paint.

Given information:
- The ratio of blue, green, and white paint is 1 : 2 : 5.
- Andy uses 6 gallons of green paint.

Step 1: Determine the total parts in the ratio.
Total parts = 1 + 2 + 5 = 8

Step 2: Find the amount of each color of paint used.
Green paint = 2 parts = 6 gallons (given)
Blue paint = 1 part = 6 gallon...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio of the paints and how it relates to the total amount of paint used. The ratio given is 1 : 2 : 5, which represents the parts of blue, green, and white paint, respectively.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Parts in the Ratio:**
   - Blue paint: 1 part
   - Green paint: 2 parts
   - White paint: 5 parts

2. **Determine the Total Number of Parts:**
   The total number of parts in the ratio is the sum of al...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem tells us that Andy is mixing blue, green, and white paint in a 1:2:5 ratio. This means that for every 1 part of blue paint, he uses 2 parts of green paint and 5 parts of white paint. 

We are told that Andy uses 6 gallons of green paint. According to the ratio, this represents 2 parts of the total mixture. 

To find out how many parts the total mixture is, we add up the parts of each color of paint. So, 1 (blue) + 2 (green) + 5 (white) = 8 parts in total.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Andy is mixing blue, green, and white paint in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 5.
   * He uses 6 gallons of green paint.

2. Determine the ratio parts:
   * Blue paint: 1 part
   * Green paint: 2 parts
   * White paint: 5 parts
   * Total parts: 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 parts

3. Find the value of one part:
   * Andy uses 6 gallons of green paint, which corresponds to 2 parts in the rat...
