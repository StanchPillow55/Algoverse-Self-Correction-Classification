=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pens Clara has.**
2. **Calculate the difference in the number of pens between Alice and Clara.**
3. **Establish the age difference based on the number of pens.**
4. **Calculate Clara's current age.**
5. **Determine Clara's age in 5 years.**

### Step 1: Determine the number of pens Clara has.

Alice has 60 pens. Clara has \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many pens as Alice.

\[
\text{Clara's pens} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the difference in the number of pens.

Now, we find the difference in the number of pens between Alice and Clara.

\[
\text{Difference in pens} = \text{Alice's pens} - \text{Clara's pens} = 60 - 24 = 36
\]

### Step 3: Establish the age difference.

According to the problem, the difference in the number of pens matches their age difference. Since Alice is 20 years old, and Clara is older than Alice, we can denote Clara's age as \( C \).

The age difference is:

\[
\text{Age difference} = C - 20
\]

Setting the age difference equal to the difference in pens:

\[
C - 20 = 36
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Clara's current age.

Now, we solve for Clara's age \( C \):

\[
C = 36 + 20 = 56
\]

### Step 5: Determine Clara's age in 5 years.

To find Clara's age in 5 years, we simply add 5 to her current age:

\[
\text{Clara's age in 5 years} = 56 + 5 = 61
\]

### Final Answer

Clara's age in 5 years will be \( \boxed{61} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The difference in the number of pens that Alice and Clara each have matches their age difference.
- Alice has 60 pens.
- Clara has 2/5 times as many pens as Alice.
- Alice's age is 20.
- Clara is older than Alice.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pens Clara has.
Clara's pens = 2/5 × Alice's pens
Clara's pens = 2/5 × 60 = 24 pens

Step 2: Calculate the difference in the number of p...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine Clara's current age and then calculate her age in 5 years.

### Step 1: Determine the Number of Pens Clara Has
Alice has 60 pens. Clara has \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many pens as Alice. Therefore, the number of pens Clara has can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pens Clara has} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Difference in the Number of Pens
The difference in the number of ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many pens Clara has. Clara has 2/5 times as many pens as Alice, who has 60 pens. 

To find out how many pens Clara has, we multiply Alice's number of pens by 2/5:

60 pens * 2/5 = 24 pens

So, Clara has 24 pens.

The difference in the number of pens that Alice and Clara each have matches their age difference. So, the age difference between Alice and Clara is:

60 pens - 24 pens = 36 years

Since Clara is older than Alice, and Alice is 20 yea...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Alice has 60 pens.
   * Clara has 2/5 times as many pens as Alice.
   * The difference in the number of pens Alice and Clara have is equal to their age difference.
   * Alice is 20 years old.
   * Clara is older than Alice.

2. Calculate the number of pens Clara has:
   * Clara's pens = 2/5 × Alice's pens
   * Clara's pens = 2/5 × 60
   * Clara's pens = 24

3. Ca...
