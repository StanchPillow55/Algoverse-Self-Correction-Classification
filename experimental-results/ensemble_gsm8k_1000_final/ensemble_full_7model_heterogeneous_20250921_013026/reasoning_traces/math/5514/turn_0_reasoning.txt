=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( c \) represent the number of cans of cherry soda.
   - Let \( o \) represent the number of cans of orange pop.

2. **Set Up Equations**:
   - We know from the problem that the total number of cans is 24. This gives us our first equation:
     \[
     c + o = 24
     \]
   - We are also told that there are twice as many cans of orange pop as there are of cherry soda. This gives us our second equation:
     \[
     o = 2c
     \]

3. **Substitute**:
   - We can substitute the expression for \( o \) from the second equation into the first equation. So, we replace \( o \) in the first equation:
     \[
     c + 2c = 24
     \]

4. **Combine Like Terms**:
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     3c = 24
     \]

5. **Solve for \( c \)**:
   - To find \( c \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
     \[
     c = \frac{24}{3} = 8
     \]

6. **Find \( o \)**:
   - Now that we have \( c \), we can find \( o \) using the second equation:
     \[
     o = 2c = 2 \times 8 = 16
     \]

7. **Check the Solution**:
   - We should verify that our values satisfy both original equations:
     - The total number of cans: \( c + o = 8 + 16 = 24 \) (correct)
     - The relationship between the cans: \( o = 2c = 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct)

Thus, the calculations are consistent with the problem statement.

**Final Answer**:
The number of cherry sodas is \( \boxed{8} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The cooler is filled with 24 cans of cherry soda and orange pop.
- There are twice as many cans of orange pop as there are of cherry soda.

Let's represent the number of cherry soda cans as x.

Since there are twice as many cans of orange pop as there are of cherry soda, the number of orange pop cans can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of cans in the cooler is 24, so ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of cherry soda cans as C and the number of orange pop cans as O. 

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information that can be translated into mathematical equations:

1) The total number of cans is 24, so C + O = 24.

2) There are twice as many cans of orange pop as there are of cherry soda, so O = 2C.

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for C. 

Substituting O from the second equation into the first equa...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The cooler contains a total of 24 cans.
   * The cans are either cherry soda or orange pop.
   * There are twice as many orange pop cans as cherry soda cans.

2. Let's define variables to represent the unknown quantities:
   * Let 'c' be the number of cherry soda cans.
   * Let 'o' be the number of orange pop cans.

3. Using the given information, we can set up an equati...
