=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of eggs required for both the chocolate cakes and the cheesecakes, and then find the difference between the two quantities.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs needed for 5 chocolate cakes.**

Each chocolate cake requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 5 chocolate cakes, we can calculate the total number of eggs needed as follows:

\[
\text{Eggs for chocolate cakes} = \text{Number of cakes} \times \text{Eggs per cake}
\]
\[
\text{Eggs for chocolate cakes} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ eggs}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs needed for 9 cheesecakes.**

Each cheesecake requires 8 eggs. Therefore, for 9 cheesecakes, we can calculate the total number of eggs needed as follows:

\[
\text{Eggs for cheesecakes} = \text{Number of cheesecakes} \times \text{Eggs per cheesecake}
\]
\[
\text{Eggs for cheesecakes} = 9 \times 8 = 72 \text{ eggs}
\]

**Step 3: Find the difference in the number of eggs needed.**

Now, we need to find out how many more eggs are needed for the cheesecakes compared to the chocolate cakes:

\[
\text{Difference in eggs} = \text{Eggs for cheesecakes} - \text{Eggs for chocolate cakes}
\]
\[
\text{Difference in eggs} = 72 - 15 = 57
\]

**Final Answer:**

The number of more eggs needed for 9 cheesecakes than for 5 chocolate cakes is \( \boxed{57} \).

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how many eggs are needed for 5 chocolate cakes. Since one chocolate cake requires 3 eggs, we multiply the number of cakes by the number of eggs per cake:

5 chocolate cakes * 3 eggs/chocolate cake = 15 eggs

Next, let's calculate how many eggs are needed for 9 cheesecakes. Since one cheesecake requires 8 eggs, we multiply the number of cakes by the number of eggs per cake:

9 cheesecakes * 8 eggs/cheesecake = 72 eggs

Finally, to find out how many m...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * A chocolate cake requires 3 eggs per cake.
   * A cheesecake requires 8 eggs per cake.
   * We need to find the difference in the number of eggs needed for 9 cheesecakes and 5 chocolate cakes.

2. Calculate the number of eggs needed for 5 chocolate cakes:
   * Eggs needed for 1 chocolate cake = 3 eggs
   * Eggs needed for 5 chocolate cakes = 3 eggs × 5
   * Eggs ...
