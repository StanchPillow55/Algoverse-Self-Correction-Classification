=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate how many jelly beans Thomas takes.**
2. **Determine the number of jelly beans left after Thomas takes his share.**
3. **Divide the remaining jelly beans between Barry and Emmanuel in the specified ratio.**
4. **Calculate how many jelly beans Emmanuel receives.**

### Step 1: Calculate how many jelly beans Thomas takes.

Thomas takes 10% of the total jelly beans. The total number of jelly beans is 200.

\[
\text{Thomas's share} = 10\% \times 200 = \frac{10}{100} \times 200 = 20
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of jelly beans left after Thomas takes his share.

Now, we subtract the number of jelly beans Thomas took from the total:

\[
\text{Remaining jelly beans} = 200 - 20 = 180
\]

### Step 3: Divide the remaining jelly beans between Barry and Emmanuel in the ratio 4:5.

Let the number of jelly beans Barry receives be \(4x\) and the number of jelly beans Emmanuel receives be \(5x\). The total number of jelly beans they share is:

\[
4x + 5x = 9x
\]

We know that this total must equal the remaining jelly beans:

\[
9x = 180
\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 9:

\[
x = \frac{180}{9} = 20
\]

### Step 4: Calculate how many jelly beans Emmanuel receives.

Now we can find out how many jelly beans Emmanuel gets:

\[
\text{Emmanuel's share} = 5x = 5 \times 20 = 100
\]

### Final Answer

Emmanuel will get **100 jelly beans**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 200 jelly beans in the jar.
- Thomas takes 10% of the jelly beans.
- Barry and Emmanuel share the remaining jelly beans in the ratio of 4:5 respectively.

Step 1: Calculate the number of jelly beans Thomas takes.
10% of 200 jelly beans = 0.10 × 200 = 20 jelly beans

Step 2: Calculate the number of jelly beans remaining after Thomas takes his share.
Remaining jelly beans = Total jelly...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many jelly beans each person receives based on the given conditions.

1. **Determine Thomas's Share:**
   - Thomas takes 10% of the total jelly beans.
   - The total number of jelly beans is 200.
   - Calculate 10% of 200:
     \[
     10\% \times 200 = \frac{10}{100} \times 200 = 20
     \]
   - Thomas takes 20 jelly beans.

2. **Calculate the Remaining Jelly Beans:**
   - After Thomas takes his share, we subtract the numb...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how many jelly beans Thomas gets. Since Thomas takes 10% of 200 jelly beans, we calculate this as:

200 * 10/100 = 20 jelly beans

This means that there are 200 - 20 = 180 jelly beans left for Barry and Emmanuel to share.

Barry and Emmanuel are to share the remaining jelly beans in the ratio 4:5. This means for every 9 (4+5) parts, Barry gets 4 parts and Emmanuel gets 5 parts.

To find out how many jelly beans Emmanuel gets, we first need to d...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 200 jelly beans in total.
   * Thomas takes 10% of the jelly beans.
   * Barry and Emmanuel share the remaining jelly beans in the ratio 4:5.

2. Calculate the number of jelly beans Thomas takes:
   * Thomas's share = 10% of 200
   * 10% = 10/100 = 0.1
   * Thomas's share = 0.1 × 200 = 20 jelly beans

3. Calculate the remaining jelly beans after Thomas ...
