=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let \( x \) be the amount Greg spent on the shirt. According to the problem, the amount spent on shoes can be expressed as \( 2x + 9 \) (which is 9 more than twice the amount spent on the shirt).

We know that the total amount spent on both the shirt and shoes is $300. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + (2x + 9) = 300
\]

Now, let's simplify the equation:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[
   x + 2x + 9 = 300
   \]
   \[
   3x + 9 = 300
   \]

2. Next, we will isolate \( 3x \) by subtracting 9 from both sides:
   \[
   3x = 300 - 9
   \]
   \[
   3x = 291
   \]

3. Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{291}{3}
   \]
   \[
   x = 97
   \]

Thus, Greg spent \( \boxed{97} \) dollars on the shirt.

To verify, we can calculate the amount spent on shoes:
- Shoes cost: \( 2x + 9 = 2(97) + 9 = 194 + 9 = 203 \) dollars.

Now, we check the total:
- Total spent: \( 97 + 203 = 300 \) dollars, which matches the given information.

Therefore, the solution is confirmed, and Greg spent \( \boxed{97} \) dollars on the shirt.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the amount Greg spent on the shirt.

Given information:
- Greg spent a total of $300 on a shirt and shoes.
- Greg spent 9 more than twice as much on shoes as he did on the shirt.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the amount Greg spent on the shirt.
- Then, the amount Greg spent on the shoes is 2x + 9.

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the total amount spent.
Total amount spent = Amount spent on the s...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Greg spent on the shirt. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Greg spent on the shirt.
   - Let \( y \) be the amount Greg spent on the shoes.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know from the problem that the total amount spent on the shirt and shoes is $300. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     x + y = 300
     \]
   - The problem also states ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the cost of the shirt as S and the cost of the shoes as Sh. We know from the problem that:

S + Sh = $300 (equation 1)

We also know that Greg spent 9 more than twice as much on shoes as he did a shirt, which can be written as:

Sh = 2S + $9 (equation 2)

We can substitute equation 2 into equation 1 to solve for S:

S + (2S + $9) = $300
3S + $9 = $300
3S = $300 - $9
3S = $291
S = $291 / 3
S = $97

So, Greg spent $97 on a shirt.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Greg spent a total of $300 on a shirt and shoes.
   * Greg spent 9 more than twice as much on shoes as he did on the shirt.

2. Let's define variables to represent the unknown values:
   * Let x = the amount Greg spent on the shirt.

3. Express the amount spent on shoes in terms of the amount spent on the shirt:
   * Amount spent on shoes = 2x + 9
   * This is be...
