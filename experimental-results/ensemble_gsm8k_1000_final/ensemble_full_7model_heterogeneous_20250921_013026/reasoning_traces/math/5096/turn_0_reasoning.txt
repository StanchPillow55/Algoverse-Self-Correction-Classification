=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many pages Sally's book has, we need to calculate the total number of pages she reads over the course of 2 weeks.

1. **Identify the reading pattern:**
   - On weekdays (Monday to Friday), Sally reads 10 pages per day.
   - On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), she reads 20 pages per day.

2. **Calculate the number of weekdays and weekends in 2 weeks:**
   - In 2 weeks, there are:
     - Weekdays: 5 days/week × 2 weeks = 10 weekdays
     - Weekends: 2 days/week × 2 weeks = 4 weekend days

3. **Calculate the total pages read on weekdays:**
   - Total pages read on weekdays = Number of weekdays × Pages read per weekday
   - Total pages read on weekdays = 10 weekdays × 10 pages/weekday = 100 pages

4. **Calculate the total pages read on weekends:**
   - Total pages read on weekends = Number of weekend days × Pages read per weekend day
   - Total pages read on weekends = 4 weekend days × 20 pages/weekend day = 80 pages

5. **Calculate the total pages read in 2 weeks:**
   - Total pages read = Total pages read on weekdays + Total pages read on weekends
   - Total pages read = 100 pages + 80 pages = 180 pages

Thus, the total number of pages in Sally's book is **180 pages**.

Final answer: **180 pages**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pages in the book that Sally is reading.

Given information:
- Sally reads 10 pages of the book on weekdays.
- Sally reads 20 pages of the book on weekends.
- It takes 2 weeks for Sally to finish the book.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pages Sally reads in a week.
Weekdays: 10 pages per day × 5 days = 50 pages
Weekends: 20 pages per day × 2 days = 40 pages
Total pages read in a week = 50 pa...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pages Sally reads in total over the course of 2 weeks, given her reading habits on weekdays and weekends.

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Identify the number of weekdays and weekend days in 2 weeks:**
   - A week consists of 7 days, with 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) and 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).
   - Therefore, in 2 weeks, there are:
     - \(5 \times 2 = 10\) weekdays
     - \(2 \times 2 = 4\) weeken...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Sally reads 10 pages on weekdays and 20 pages on weekends.

In a week, there are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.

So in a week, Sally reads (10 pages/day * 5 days) + (20 pages/day * 2 days) = 50 pages + 40 pages = 90 pages.

If it takes Sally 2 weeks to finish her book, then the total number of pages in the book is 90 pages/week * 2 weeks = 180 pages.

Therefore, the book that Sally reads has 180 pages.
