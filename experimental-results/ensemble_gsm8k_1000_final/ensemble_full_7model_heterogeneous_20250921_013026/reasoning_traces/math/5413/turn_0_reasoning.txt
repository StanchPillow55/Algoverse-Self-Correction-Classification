=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we first need to determine Ben's rate of picking sugar snap peas. We know that he can pick 56 sugar snap peas in 7 minutes. 

### Step 1: Calculate the rate of picking peas

To find the rate, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Total peas}}{\text{Total time (in minutes)}}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{56 \text{ peas}}{7 \text{ minutes}} = 8 \text{ peas per minute}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the time to pick 72 sugar snap peas

Now that we know Ben picks at a rate of 8 peas per minute, we can find out how long it will take him to pick 72 sugar snap peas. We can use the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total peas}}{\text{Rate}}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{72 \text{ peas}}{8 \text{ peas per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, it would take Ben **9 minutes** to pick 72 sugar snap peas.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which Ben is picking the sugar snap peas and then use that rate to calculate the time it would take him to pick 72 peas.

Given information:
- Ben wants to pick 56 sugar snap peas.
- It will take him 7 minutes to pick all 56 peas.

Step 1: Calculate the rate at which Ben is picking the sugar snap peas.
Rate of picking = Number of peas / Time taken
Rate of picking = 56 peas / 7 minutes
Rate of picking ...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine Ben's rate of picking sugar snap peas and then use that rate to find out how long it would take him to pick 72 sugar snap peas.

### Step 1: Determine Ben's Rate of Picking

Ben picks 56 sugar snap peas in 7 minutes. To find his rate of picking, we calculate the number of peas he picks per minute.

\[
\text{Rate of picking} = \frac{\text{Total peas}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{56 \text{ peas}}{7 \text{ minutes}} = 8 \text{ peas...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many sugar snap peas Ben can pick in one minute. 

Given that Ben can pick 56 sugar snap peas in 7 minutes, we can find his rate by dividing the total number of peas by the total time. 

So, 56 peas / 7 minutes = 8 peas per minute.

Now that we know Ben can pick 8 peas per minute, we can find out how long it would take him to pick 72 peas. 

We do this by dividing the total number of peas he needs to pick by his rate. 

So, 72 peas / 8 peas ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Ben wants to pick 56 sugar snap peas.
   * At his current rate, he can pick all 56 peas in 7 minutes.
   * We need to find out how long it would take Ben to pick 72 sugar snap peas.

2. Calculate Ben's current rate of picking sugar snap peas:
   * Rate = Number of peas รท Time
   * Rate = 56 peas รท 7 minutes
   * Rate = 8 peas per minute
   
   So, Ben is currently pick...
