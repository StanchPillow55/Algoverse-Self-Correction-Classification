=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first determine how many of each type of item Igor gathered and then use that information to find out how many beakers he lost.

1. **Identify the requested quantities:**
   - Test tubes: 16
   - Beakers: 7
   - Petri dishes: 14

2. **Determine what Igor actually gathered:**
   - Test tubes: Igor gathered half as many as requested, so:
     \[
     \text{Test tubes gathered} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
     \]
   - Petri dishes: Igor gathered two more than the number requested, so:
     \[
     \text{Petri dishes gathered} = 14 + 2 = 16
     \]
   - Beakers: Igor gathered the correct number, which is:
     \[
     \text{Beakers gathered} = 7
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of items Igor gathered before losing any beakers:**
   \[
   \text{Total items gathered} = \text{Test tubes} + \text{Beakers} + \text{Petri dishes}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total items gathered} = 8 + 7 + 16 = 31
   \]

4. **Determine how many items Igor actually placed on the lab bench:**
   Igor placed a total of 29 items on the lab bench.

5. **Calculate how many beakers Igor lost:**
   The difference between the total items gathered and the total items placed on the bench gives us the number of beakers lost:
   \[
   \text{Beakers lost} = \text{Total items gathered} - \text{Total items placed on bench}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Beakers lost} = 31 - 29 = 2
   \]

Thus, Igor lost **2 beakers**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of beakers that Igor lost on the way to the lab bench.

Given information:
- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes.
- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, two more than the number of Petri dishes requested.
- Igor had the correct number of beakers, but lost several on the way to the lab bench.
- The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many beakers Igor lost. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of each item Igor gathered:**

   - **Test Tubes:** Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many. 
     \[
     \text{Test Tubes gathered} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
     \]

   - **Petri Dishes:** Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how many test tubes and Petri dishes Igor gathered.

Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many. So, Igor gathered 16/2 = <<16/2=8>>8 test tubes.

Igor gathered two more beakers than the number of Petri dishes requested. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, so Igor gathered 14 + 2 = <<14+2=16>>16 beakers.

So, Igor gathered a total of 8 test tubes + 16 beakers = <<8+16=24>>24 items.

However, the total number of items Igor...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes.
   * Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested.
   * Igor gathered two more Petri dishes than requested.
   * Igor picked up the correct number of beakers but lost some on the way to the lab bench.
   * In total, Igor placed 29 items on the lab bench.

2. Calculate the number of test tu...
