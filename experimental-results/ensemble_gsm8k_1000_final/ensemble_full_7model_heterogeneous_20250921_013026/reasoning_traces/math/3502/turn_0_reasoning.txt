=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many crickets Spike the bearded dragon hunts per day, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of crickets hunted in the morning:**
   Spike hunts 5 crickets every morning.

   \[
   \text{Crickets in the morning} = 5
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of crickets hunted in the afternoon and evening:**
   According to the problem, Spike hunts three times the number of crickets he hunts in the morning during the afternoon and evening. 

   To find out how many crickets he hunts in the afternoon and evening, we multiply the number of crickets he hunts in the morning by 3:

   \[
   \text{Crickets in the afternoon and evening} = 3 \times \text{Crickets in the morning} = 3 \times 5 = 15
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of crickets hunted per day:**
   Now, we add the number of crickets hunted in the morning to the number of crickets hunted in the afternoon and evening:

   \[
   \text{Total crickets per day} = \text{Crickets in the morning} + \text{Crickets in the afternoon and evening}
   \]

   Substituting the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Total crickets per day} = 5 + 15 = 20
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of crickets Spike hunts per day is:

   \[
   \boxed{20}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of crickets Spike hunts per day.

Given information:
- Spike hunts 5 crickets every morning.
- Spike hunts three times as many crickets in the afternoon and evening as he does in the morning.

Step 1: Find the number of crickets Spike hunts in the afternoon and evening.
Crickets hunted in the afternoon and evening = 3 × 5 = 15 crickets

Step 2: Find the total number of crickets Spike hunts per da...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how many crickets Spike the bearded dragon hunts per day, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Morning Crickets:**
   - Spike hunts 5 crickets every morning.

2. **Afternoon and Evening Crickets:**
   - The problem states that Spike hunts "three times that" over the afternoon and evening. "Three times that" refers to three times the number of crickets he hunts in the morning.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Spike the bearded dragon hunts 5 crickets every morning. In the afternoon and evening, he hunts three times that amount. 

To find out how many crickets Spike hunts in the afternoon and evening, we need to multiply the number of crickets he hunts in the morning by 3. 

So, 5 crickets (morning) * 3 = 15 crickets (afternoon and evening)

Now, to find out how many crickets Spike hunts in a day, we need to add the number of crickets he hunts in the morning to the number he hu...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Spike hunts 5 crickets every morning.
   * In the afternoon and evening, he hunts three times the morning amount.

2. Calculate the number of crickets Spike hunts in the afternoon and evening:
   * Morning crickets = 5
   * Afternoon and evening crickets = 3 × Morning crickets
   * Afternoon and evening crickets = 3 × 5 = 15

3. Sum up the total number of crickets Spik...
