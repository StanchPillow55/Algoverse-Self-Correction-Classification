Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of milk produced by the cow:**
   Daisy's cow provides 16 cups of milk per day.

2. **Calculate the amount of milk consumed by Daisy's kids:**
   Daisy's kids consume 75% of the total milk. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Milk consumed by kids} = 75\% \text{ of } 16 \text{ cups} = 0.75 \times 16 = 12 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining milk after the kids have consumed their share:**
   To find out how much milk is left after the kids have consumed their portion, we subtract the amount consumed by the kids from the total milk:
   \[
   \text{Remaining milk} = \text{Total milk} - \text{Milk consumed by kids} = 16 \text{ cups} - 12 \text{ cups} = 4 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. **Determine how much of the remaining milk Daisy uses for cooking:**
   Daisy uses 50% of the remaining milk to cook with. We calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Milk used for cooking} = 50\% \text{ of } 4 \text{ cups} = 0.50 \times 4 = 2 \text{ cups}
   \]

5. **Calculate the amount of milk left over after cooking:**
   To find out how much milk is left after Daisy uses some for cooking, we subtract the amount used for cooking from the remaining milk:
   \[
   \text{Milk left over} = \text{Remaining milk} - \text{Milk used for cooking} = 4 \text{ cups} - 2 \text{ cups} = 2 \text{ cups}
   \]

Thus, the final amount of milk left over is:
\[
\boxed{2} \text{ cups}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Daisy's milk cow provides 16 cups of milk per day.
- 75% of the milk is consumed by Daisy's kids.
- Daisy uses 50% of the remaining milk to cook with.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of milk consumed by Daisy's kids.
75% of 16 cups = 0.75 × 16 = 12 cups

Step 2: Calculate the amount of milk remaining after Daisy's kids have consumed their share.
Total milk - Milk consumed by kids = ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much milk is left over after Daisy's kids consume some of it and Daisy uses some for cooking. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of milk consumed by Daisy's kids:**
   - Daisy's cow provides 16 cups of milk per day.
   - 75% of this milk is consumed by Daisy's kids.
   - To find out how much milk this is, we calculate 75% of 16 cups:
     \[
     0.75 \times 16 = 12 \text{ cups}
     \]
   - So, Da...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much milk is consumed by Daisy's kids. We know that they consume 75% of the 16 cups of milk. To find this, we multiply 16 cups by 75% (or 0.75 in decimal form):

16 cups * 0.75 = 12 cups

So, Daisy's kids consume 12 cups of milk per day.

Next, we subtract the amount of milk consumed by the kids from the total amount of milk to find out how much milk is left:

16 cups - 12 cups = 4 cups

So, after the kids have had their share, there are 4 c...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- Daisy's milk cow provides 16 cups of milk per day.
- 75% of the milk is consumed by Daisy's kids.
- Daisy uses 50% of the remaining milk to cook with.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of milk consumed by Daisy's kids.
Milk consumed by kids = 75% of 16 cups
0.75 × 16 = 12 cups

Step 2: Calculate the amount of milk remaining after Daisy's kids consume their share.
Remaining milk = Total milk - Milk cons...
