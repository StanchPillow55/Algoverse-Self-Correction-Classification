=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much each person spends on toys and then calculate the total expenditure over 4 years.

1. **Identify Trevor's Spending**:
   - We know that Trevor spends $80 every year.

2. **Determine Reed's Spending**:
   - According to the problem, Trevor spends $20 more than Reed. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Trevor's spending} = \text{Reed's spending} + 20
     \]
   - Plugging in Trevor's spending:
     \[
     80 = \text{Reed's spending} + 20
     \]
   - To find Reed's spending, we subtract 20 from both sides:
     \[
     \text{Reed's spending} = 80 - 20 = 60
     \]

3. **Determine Quinn's Spending**:
   - The problem states that Reed spends 2 times as much money as Quinn. We can express this relationship as:
     \[
     \text{Reed's spending} = 2 \times \text{Quinn's spending}
     \]
   - Substituting Reed's spending into the equation:
     \[
     60 = 2 \times \text{Quinn's spending}
     \]
   - To find Quinn's spending, we divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     \text{Quinn's spending} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
     \]

4. **Summarize Annual Spending**:
   - Now we have the spending for each person:
     - Trevor: $80
     - Reed: $60
     - Quinn: $30

5. **Calculate Total Spending for One Year**:
   - To find the total spending for all three in one year, we add their individual expenditures:
     \[
     \text{Total spending in one year} = \text{Trevor's spending} + \text{Reed's spending} + \text{Quinn's spending}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Total spending in one year} = 80 + 60 + 30 = 170
     \]

6. **Calculate Total Spending Over 4 Years**:
   - To find the total spending over 4 years, we multiply the total spending for one year by 4:
     \[
     \text{Total spending in 4 years} = \text{Total spending in one year} \times 4
     \]
   - Performing the calculation:
     \[
     \text{Total spending in 4 years} = 170 \times 4 = 680
     \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   - The total amount of money that Trevor, Reed, and Quinn spend in 4 years is \(\boxed{680}\).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Trevor spends $20 more than his friend Reed on toys.
- Reed spends 2 times as much money as their friend Quinn on the toys.
- Trevor spends $80 every year to buy his toys.
- We need to calculate the total amount of money the three spend in 4 years.

Step 1: Find how much Reed spends on toys.
Since Trevor spends $20 more than Reed, we can say that:
Trevor's spending = Reed's spendi...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much each person spends on toys each year and then calculate the total amount spent by all three over 4 years.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( T \) be the amount Trevor spends each year.
- Let \( R \) be the amount Reed spends each year.
- Let \( Q \) be the amount Quinn spends each year.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Trevor spends $80 every year, so \( T = 80 \).
2. Trevor spends $20 more t...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much Reed and Quinn spend.

Since Trevor spends $20 more than Reed, that means Reed spends $80 - $20 = $60.

Reed spends 2 times as much as Quinn, so Quinn spends $60 / 2 = $30.

So, in one year, the three friends spend $80 (Trevor) + $60 (Reed) + $30 (Quinn) = $170.

Therefore, in 4 years, the three friends spend $170/year * 4 years = $680. 

So, the three friends spend a total of $680 in 4 years.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- Trevor spends $20 more than Reed on toys.
- Reed spends 2 times as much as Quinn on toys.
- Trevor spends $80 every year on toys.
- We need to find the total amount spent by the three friends in 4 years.

Step 1: Let's express Trevor's and Reed's spending in terms of Quinn's.
Trevor's spending = Reed's spending + $20
Reed's spending = 2 Ã— Quinn's spending

Step 2: Calculate Quinn's spending using t...
