=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much money Tonya spent on paintbrushes, we will break down her total spending step by step.

1. **Total Amount Spent**: Tonya spent a total of $90.00 on art supplies.

2. **Cost of Canvases**: The cost of 4 canvases is given as $40.00.

3. **Cost of Mixed Set of Paints**: The mixed set of paints costs half the price of the canvases. Therefore, we calculate the cost of the paints as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost of paints} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of canvases} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40.00 = 20.00
   \]

4. **Cost of Easel**: Tonya spent $15.00 on an easel.

5. **Calculating Total Spent on Canvases, Paints, and Easel**: Now, we will sum the costs of the canvases, paints, and easel:
   \[
   \text{Total spent on canvases, paints, and easel} = \text{Cost of canvases} + \text{Cost of paints} + \text{Cost of easel}
   \]
   \[
   = 40.00 + 20.00 + 15.00 = 75.00
   \]

6. **Calculating Remaining Money for Paintbrushes**: To find out how much money she spent on paintbrushes, we subtract the total spent on canvases, paints, and easel from the total amount she spent:
   \[
   \text{Money spent on paintbrushes} = \text{Total amount spent} - \text{Total spent on canvases, paints, and easel}
   \]
   \[
   = 90.00 - 75.00 = 15.00
   \]

Thus, the amount Tonya spent on paintbrushes is **$15.00**.

Final answer: **$15.00**

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Tonya spent a total of $90.00 on art supplies.
- 4 canvases cost $40.00.
- A mixed set of paints cost 1/2 the cost of the canvases.
- Tonya spent $15.00 on an easel.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the mixed set of paints.
Cost of the mixed set of paints = 1/2 × $40.00 = $20.00

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the canvases and the mixed set of paints.
Total cost of canvases and...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Tonya spent on paintbrushes. We know the total amount she spent on art supplies and the costs of some of the items she purchased. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Amount Spent**: Tonya spent a total of $90.00 on art supplies.

2. **Cost of Canvases**: She bought 4 canvases for $40.00.

3. **Cost of Paints**: The mixed set of paints cost half as much as the canvases. Since the canvases cost $...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's figure out how much Tonya spent on the mixed set of paints. Since the paints cost half as much as the 4 canvases, we divide the cost of the canvases by 2:

$40.00 ÷ 2 = $20.00

So, Tonya spent $20.00 on the mixed set of paints.

Next, let's add up the cost of the canvases, the paints, and the easel to find out how much Tonya spent in total on these items:

$40.00 (canvases) + $20.00 (paints) + $15.00 (easel) = $75.00

Now, to find out how much Tonya spent on ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Tonya spent a total of $90.00 on art supplies.
   * 4 canvases cost $40.00.
   * A mixed set of paints cost 1/2 the price of the canvases.
   * She spent $15.00 on an easel.
   * The remaining money was spent on paintbrushes.

2. Calculate the cost of the mixed set of paints:
   * Cost of paints = 1/2 × Cost of canvases
   * Cost of paints = 1/2 × $...
