=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to analyze the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Courtney claims that the audience was 48 people.
   - Kelly states that Courtney overstated the number of attendees by 20%.

2. **Calculating the Overstatement**:
   - If Courtney overstated the number by 20%, we can express this mathematically. Let \( x \) be the actual number of attendees.
   - According to Kelly, the number reported by Courtney (48) is 20% more than the actual number \( x \).
   - This can be expressed as:
     \[
     48 = x + 0.2x
     \]
   - Simplifying the right side:
     \[
     48 = 1.2x
     \]

3. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we need to isolate it. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2:
     \[
     x = \frac{48}{1.2}
     \]

4. **Performing the Division**:
   - Now we calculate \( \frac{48}{1.2} \):
     \[
     x = \frac{48}{1.2} = 40
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \( 40 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, it means she counted 20% more people than were actually there. 

To find out the actual number of people at the concert, we need to figure out what number is 20% more than the actual number. 

Let's denote the actual number of people at the concert as X. 

According to Courtney's report, X + 20% of X = 48. 

To solve for X, we first need to express the equation in a more mathematical form. 

20% can be written as 0.20, s...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Courtney reported that 48 people attended the concert.
   * Kelly said that Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%.

2. To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to decrease Courtney's reported number by 20%.

3. Calculate 20% of 48:
   * 20% = 20 รท 100 = 0.2
   * 0.2 ร 48 = 9.6

4. Subtract the overstatement (20% of 48) from ...
