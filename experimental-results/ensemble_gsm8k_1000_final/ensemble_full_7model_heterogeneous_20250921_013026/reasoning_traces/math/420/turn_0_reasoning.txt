=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we first need to convert the total time Miriam spent on tasks from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total time in minutes:

\[
2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we will add up the time Miriam spent on the other tasks:

1. Time spent doing laundry: 30 minutes
2. Time spent cleaning the bathroom: 15 minutes
3. Time spent doing homework: 40 minutes

Now, we can calculate the total time spent on these tasks:

\[
\text{Total time on known tasks} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 15 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

\[
30 + 15 = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]
\[
45 + 40 = 85 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the total time spent on laundry, cleaning the bathroom, and doing homework is 85 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how much time she spent cleaning her room. We can do this by subtracting the total time spent on the known tasks from the total time she spent on all tasks:

\[
\text{Time spent cleaning her room} = \text{Total time} - \text{Total time on known tasks}
\]
\[
\text{Time spent cleaning her room} = 120 \text{ minutes} - 85 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we perform the subtraction:

\[
120 - 85 = 35 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the time Miriam spent cleaning her room is:

\[
\boxed{35} \text{ minutes}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Miriam spent 30 minutes doing laundry.
- Miriam spent 15 minutes cleaning the bathroom.
- Miriam spent a certain amount of time cleaning her room.
- Miriam spent 40 minutes doing homework.
- Miriam spent a total of two hours on these tasks.

To find the amount of time Miriam spent cleaning her room, we need to first calculate the total time spent on the other tasks, then subtract that fro...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time Miriam spent cleaning her room. We know the total time she spent on all tasks and the time spent on each of the other tasks. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Convert Total Time to Minutes:**
   Miriam spent a total of two hours on these tasks. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to minutes:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes}
  ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to convert the total time Miriam spent on these tasks from hours to minutes because the time she spent on individual tasks is given in minutes. We know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, so 2 hours is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

Next, we add up the time Miriam spent on laundry, cleaning the bathroom, and doing homework: 30 minutes (laundry) + 15 minutes (bathroom) + 40 minutes (homework) = 85 minutes.

To find out how long Miriam spent cleaning her roo...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Miriam spent 30 minutes doing laundry.
   * She spent 15 minutes cleaning the bathroom.
   * She spent an unknown amount of time cleaning her room.
   * She spent 40 minutes doing homework.
   * In total, she spent two hours on these tasks.

2. Convert the total time from hours to minutes:
   * 2 hours = 2 Ã— 60 minutes = 120 minutes

3. Calculate the total time s...
