=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Village Foods will receive in sales of lettuce and tomatoes per month, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of customers and their purchases**:
   - The store has **500 customers** per month.
   - Each customer purchases:
     - **2 heads of lettuce** at **$1 each**.
     - **4 tomatoes** at **$0.5 each**.

2. **Calculate the total sales from lettuce**:
   - Each customer buys 2 heads of lettuce.
   - The price per head of lettuce is $1.
   - Therefore, the total sales from lettuce per customer is:
     \[
     \text{Sales from lettuce per customer} = 2 \text{ heads} \times 1 \text{ dollar/head} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Now, we multiply this by the total number of customers:
     \[
     \text{Total sales from lettuce} = 500 \text{ customers} \times 2 \text{ dollars/customer} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total sales from tomatoes**:
   - Each customer buys 4 tomatoes.
   - The price per tomato is $0.5.
   - Therefore, the total sales from tomatoes per customer is:
     \[
     \text{Sales from tomatoes per customer} = 4 \text{ tomatoes} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/tomato} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Now, we multiply this by the total number of customers:
     \[
     \text{Total sales from tomatoes} = 500 \text{ customers} \times 2 \text{ dollars/customer} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total sales from both lettuce and tomatoes**:
   - Now we add the total sales from lettuce and tomatoes:
     \[
     \text{Total sales} = \text{Total sales from lettuce} + \text{Total sales from tomatoes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total sales} = 1000 \text{ dollars} + 1000 \text{ dollars} = 2000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total amount of money the store will receive in sales of lettuce and tomatoes per month is:
     \[
     \boxed{2000} \text{ dollars}
     \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total sales from the lettuce. Each customer buys 2 heads of lettuce at $1 each, so that's 2 * $1 = $2 per customer. If there are 500 customers, then the total sales from lettuce would be 500 * $2 = $1000.

Next, let's calculate the total sales from the tomatoes. Each customer buys 4 tomatoes at $0.5 each, so that's 4 * $0.5 = $2 per customer. If there are 500 customers, then the total sales from tomatoes would be 500 * $2 = $1000.
