=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many levels Jade can build with her Lego pieces, we start by analyzing the information given in the problem.

1. **Total Pieces**: Jade has a total of 100 Lego pieces.
2. **Pieces Left**: After building the tower, she has 23 pieces left.
3. **Pieces Used**: To find out how many pieces Jade used to build the tower, we subtract the pieces left from the total pieces:
   \[
   \text{Pieces Used} = \text{Total Pieces} - \text{Pieces Left} = 100 - 23 = 77
   \]

4. **Pieces per Level**: Each level of the tower requires 7 pieces.

5. **Calculating Levels**: To find out how many complete levels Jade can build with the pieces she used, we divide the total pieces used by the number of pieces per level:
   \[
   \text{Number of Levels} = \frac{\text{Pieces Used}}{\text{Pieces per Level}} = \frac{77}{7}
   \]

6. **Performing the Division**:
   \[
   77 \div 7 = 11
   \]
   This means Jade can build 11 complete levels.

7. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the number of levels in Jade's tower is:
   \[
   \boxed{11}
   \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of levels in Jade's Lego tower.

Given information:
- Jade has 100 Lego pieces.
- Each level of the tower has to be 7 pieces wide.
- Jade has 23 pieces left at the end.

Step 1: Calculate the number of Lego pieces used to build the tower.
Total Lego pieces - Lego pieces left at the end = Lego pieces used to build the tower
100 - 23 = 77 Lego pieces used

Step 2: Calculate the number of levels in the to...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many levels Jade can build with her Lego pieces, given that each level requires 7 pieces and she has 23 pieces left after building the tower.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of pieces used to build the tower:**
   - Jade starts with 100 pieces.
   - She has 23 pieces left after building the tower.
   - Therefore, the number of pieces used to build the tower is:
     \[
     100 - 23 = ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many pieces Jade used to build her tower. We know she started with 100 pieces and had 23 left at the end. So, she used 100 - 23 = 77 pieces to build her tower.

Next, we need to find out how many levels she built. We know each level requires 7 pieces. So, we divide the total number of pieces she used by the number of pieces per level. This gives us 77 รท 7 = 11 levels.

Therefore, Jade's tower is 11 levels high.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jade has a total of 100 lego pieces.
   * Each level of the tower must be 7 pieces wide.
   * After building the tower, Jade has 23 pieces left.

2. Calculate the number of pieces used in the tower:
   * Total pieces - Remaining pieces = Pieces used in the tower
   * 100 - 23 = 77 pieces used in the tower

3. Determine the number of levels in the tower:
   * Sinc...
