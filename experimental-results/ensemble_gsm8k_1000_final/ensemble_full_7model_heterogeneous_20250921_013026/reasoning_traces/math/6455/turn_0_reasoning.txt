=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Adam bought on his shopping trip. Let's break down the information given step by step.

1. **Calculate the total capacity of the bookcase:**
   Adam's bookcase has 4 shelves, and each shelf can hold an average of 20 books. Therefore, the total capacity of the bookcase can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = \text{Number of shelves} \times \text{Books per shelf} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ books}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of books Adam had before his shopping trip:**
   According to the problem, Adam had 56 books before he went shopping.

3. **Determine how many books Adam has after his shopping trip:**
   After buying new books, Adam realizes he has enough to completely fill his bookcase with 2 books left over. This means that the total number of books he has after shopping is:

   \[
   \text{Total books after shopping} = \text{Total capacity} + 2 = 80 + 2 = 82 \text{ books}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of books Adam bought:**
   To find out how many books Adam bought, we subtract the number of books he had before shopping from the total number of books he has after shopping:

   \[
   \text{Books bought} = \text{Total books after shopping} - \text{Books before shopping} = 82 - 56 = 26 \text{ books}
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Adam bought **26 books** on his shopping trip.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{26}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Adam's bookcase has 4 shelves and each shelf can hold 20 books. Therefore, his bookcase can hold a total of 4 shelves * 20 books/shelf = 80 books.

Before his shopping trip, Adam had 56 books in his bookcase. After his shopping trip, he had enough books to completely fill his bookcase with 2 books left over. This means that he had 80 books (to fill the bookcase) + 2 books (left over) = 82 books after his shopping trip.
