=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to analyze the information given about the students' preferences for dogs or cats and movies or video games.

1. **Total number of students**: There are 30 students in the class.

2. **Percentage of students who prefer dogs and video games**: 
   - 50% of the students chose dogs and video games.
   - To find the number of students who chose this option, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of students who prefer dogs and video games} = 50\% \times 30 = 0.50 \times 30 = 15 \text{ students}
     \]

3. **Percentage of students who prefer dogs and movies**: 
   - 10% of the students chose dogs and movies.
   - To find the number of students who chose this option, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of students who prefer dogs and movies} = 10\% \times 30 = 0.10 \times 30 = 3 \text{ students}
     \]

4. **Total number of students who prefer dogs**: 
   - To find the total number of students who prefer dogs (either with video games or movies), we add the two groups together:
     \[
     \text{Total students who prefer dogs} = \text{Students who prefer dogs and video games} + \text{Students who prefer dogs and movies}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total students who prefer dogs} = 15 + 3 = 18 \text{ students}
     \]

5. **Conclusion**: 
   - The total number of students in the class who prefer dogs over cats is 18.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of students who prefer dogs over cats.

Given information:
- There are 30 students in the class.
- 50% of the students chose dogs and video games as their two answers.
- 10% of the students chose dogs and movies as their two answers.

Step 1: Calculate the number of students who chose dogs and video games.

Step 2: Calculate the number of students who ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students prefer dogs over cats based on the given survey results.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Total Number of Students:**
   The total number of students in the class is given as 30.

2. **Students Preferring Dogs and Video Games:**
   We are told that 50% of the students chose dogs and video games. To find the number of students, we calculate:
   \[
   0.50 \times 30 = 15
   \]
   So, 15 students prefer dogs and...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem tells us that 50% of the students chose dogs and video games, and 10% chose dogs and movies. Since these are the only two categories that involve choosing dogs, we can add these percentages together to find the total percentage of students who prefer dogs over cats.

So, 50% + 10% = 60%

This means that 60% of the students in the class prefer dogs over cats.

To find out how many students this is, we can multiply the total number of students by this percentage...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 30 students in the class.
   * 50% of the students prefer dogs and video games.
   * 10% of the students prefer dogs and movies.

2. Calculate the number of students who prefer dogs and video games:
