=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many members ordered lemon juice.**
2. **Calculate the number of remaining members after lemon juice orders.**
3. **Determine how many of the remaining members ordered mango juice.**
4. **Calculate how many members ordered orange juice.**

### Step 1: Calculate the number of members who ordered lemon juice.

The total number of members in the club is 30. According to the problem, two-fifths of the members ordered lemon juice.

\[
\text{Number of members who ordered lemon juice} = \frac{2}{5} \times 30
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 30 = \frac{60}{5} = 12
\]

So, **12 members ordered lemon juice**.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining members.

Now, we need to find out how many members are left after the lemon juice orders:

\[
\text{Remaining members} = \text{Total members} - \text{Members who ordered lemon juice}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Remaining members} = 30 - 12 = 18
\]

So, **18 members are remaining**.

### Step 3: Determine how many of the remaining members ordered mango juice.

Next, we know that one-third of the remaining members ordered mango juice. 

\[
\text{Number of members who ordered mango juice} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

So, **6 members ordered mango juice**.

### Step 4: Calculate how many members ordered orange juice.

Now, we can find out how many members ordered orange juice. We subtract the number of members who ordered lemon juice and mango juice from the total number of members:

\[
\text{Members who ordered orange juice} = \text{Total members} - (\text{Members who ordered lemon juice} + \text{Members who ordered mango juice})
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Members who ordered orange juice} = 30 - (12 + 6) = 30 - 18 = 12
\]

So, **12 members ordered orange juice**.

### Final Answer

The number of members who ordered orange juice is **12**.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many members ordered each type of juice and ultimately find out how many ordered orange juice. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Members in the Club:**
   The club has a total of 30 members.

2. **Members Ordering Lemon Juice:**
   Two-fifths of the members ordered lemon juice. To find out how many members this is, we calculate:

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many members ordered lemon juice. 

Two-fifths of the club members ordered lemon juice. This means 2/5 * 30 = <<2/5*30=12>>12 members ordered lemon juice.

Subtracting the number of members who ordered lemon juice from the total number of members, we get 30 - 12 = <<30-12=18>>18 members who did not order lemon juice.

One-third of these remaining members ordered mango juice. This means 1/3 * 18 = <<1/3*18=6>>6 members ordered mango juice.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The club has 30 members in total.
   * 2/5 of the members ordered lemon juice.
   * 1/3 of the remaining members ordered mango juice.
   * The rest ordered orange juice.

2. Calculate the number of members who ordered lemon juice:
   * 2/5 of 30 = (2 × 30) ÷ 5 = 60 ÷ 5 = 12 members
   So, 12 members ordered lemon juice.

3. Calculate the number of remaining membe...
