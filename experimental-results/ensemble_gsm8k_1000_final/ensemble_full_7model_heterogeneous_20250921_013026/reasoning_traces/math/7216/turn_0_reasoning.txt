=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine James's initial height** based on the information given about his uncle's height.
2. **Calculate James's height after his growth spurt**.
3. **Find the difference in height between James and his uncle** after the growth spurt.

### Step 1: Calculate James's Initial Height

James is said to be \( \frac{2}{3} \) as tall as his uncle. His uncle's height is given as 72 inches. 

To find James's height, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{James's height} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Uncle's height}
\]

Substituting the uncle's height:

\[
\text{James's height} = \frac{2}{3} \times 72
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{James's height} = \frac{2 \times 72}{3} = \frac{144}{3} = 48 \text{ inches}
\]

So, James's initial height is 48 inches.

### Step 2: Calculate James's Height After Growth Spurt

James gains 10 inches due to a growth spurt. We add this to his initial height:

\[
\text{James's new height} = \text{James's initial height} + \text{growth}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{James's new height} = 48 + 10 = 58 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 3: Find the Difference in Height Between James and His Uncle

Now we need to find out how much taller James's uncle is than James after the growth spurt. We can calculate this by subtracting James's new height from his uncle's height:

\[
\text{Difference in height} = \text{Uncle's height} - \text{James's new height}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Difference in height} = 72 - 58
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Difference in height} = 14 \text{ inches}
\]

### Final Answer

James's uncle is 14 inches taller than James after the growth spurt. 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{14}
\]

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine James's initial height** based on the information given about his uncle's height.
2. **Calculate James's height after his growth spurt**.
3. **Find the difference in height between James and his uncle** after the growth spurt.

### Step 1: Calculate James's Initial Height

James is said to be \( \frac{2}{3} \) as tall as his uncle. His uncle's height is given as 72 inches. 

To find James's height, we...

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- James was 2/3 as tall as his uncle, who is 72 inches tall.
- James gained 10 inches in a growth spurt.

Step 1: Calculate James' original height.
James' original height = 2/3 × 72 inches = 48 inches

Step 2: Calculate James' new height after the growth spurt.
James' new height = James' original height + 10 inches = 48 inches + 10 inches = 58 inches

Step 3: Calculate the difference in height b...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine James's height before and after his growth spurt, and then compare it to his uncle's height to find out how much taller his uncle is now.

### Step 1: Determine James's initial height
James was initially \(\frac{2}{3}\) as tall as his uncle. His uncle's height is given as 72 inches.

To find James's initial height, we calculate:
\[
\text{James's initial height} = \frac{2}{3} \times 72
\]

Perform the multiplication:
\[
\frac{2}...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how tall James was before his growth spurt. Since he was 2/3 as tall as his uncle, we multiply 2/3 by his uncle's height.

2/3 * 72 inches = 48 inches

So, James was 48 inches tall.

Then, we add the 10 inches he gained from his growth spurt.

48 inches + 10 inches = 58 inches

So, James is now 58 inches tall.

Finally, we subtract James's current height from his uncle's height to find out how much taller his uncle is.

72 inches - 58 inches = 1...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * James' uncle is 72 inches tall.
   * Initially, James was 2/3 as tall as his uncle.
   * James gained 10 inches in height after a growth spurt.

2. Calculate James' initial height:
   * James' height = 2/3 × Uncle's height
   * James' height = 2/3 × 72 inches
   * James' height = 48 inches
   
   Explanation: Since James was 2/3 as tall as his uncle, we multiply his...
