=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of popcorn kernels Jenny dropped.**
2. **Determine how many kernels the squirrel ate.**
3. **Calculate the remaining kernels on the ground.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of popcorn kernels dropped

Jenny drops 1 kernel of popcorn every 25 feet. Since she walks 5000 feet to get home, we can find the total number of kernels dropped by dividing the total distance by the distance per kernel.

\[
\text{Total kernels dropped} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Distance per kernel}} = \frac{5000 \text{ feet}}{25 \text{ feet/kernel}}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total kernels dropped} = \frac{5000}{25} = 200
\]

So, Jenny dropped a total of **200 kernels** of popcorn.

### Step 2: Determine how many kernels the squirrel ate

The squirrel ate one-quarter of the popcorn that Jenny dropped. To find out how many kernels that is, we calculate:

\[
\text{Kernels eaten by squirrel} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total kernels dropped} = \frac{1}{4} \times 200
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Kernels eaten by squirrel} = 50
\]

So, the squirrel ate **50 kernels**.

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining kernels on the ground

To find the number of kernels remaining on the ground after the squirrel ate some, we subtract the number of kernels eaten from the total number of kernels dropped:

\[
\text{Remaining kernels} = \text{Total kernels dropped} - \text{Kernels eaten by squirrel} = 200 - 50
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Remaining kernels} = 150
\]

### Final Answer

Therefore, when Jenny walks to school the following morning and counts the popcorn on the ground, she will find a total of **150 kernels** remaining.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many popcorn kernels Jenny dropped on her way home, how many were eaten by the squirrel, and how many remain when she counts them the next morning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of popcorn kernels Jenny dropped.**

Jenny drops 1 kernel of popcorn every 25 feet. She walks a total distance of 5000 feet from her school to her home.

To find out how many kernels she dropped, we divide the total distance by the distance ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many kernels of popcorn Jenny dropped on her way home. To do this, we divide the total distance she walked (5000 feet) by the distance she dropped each kernel (25 feet). 

5000 feet รท 25 feet/kernel = 200 kernels

So, Jenny dropped 200 kernels of popcorn on her way home.

Next, we need to find out how many kernels the squirrel ate. We know the squirrel ate one-quarter of the popcorn, so we multiply the total number of kernels by one-quarter ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Find the total number of popcorn kernels Jenny dropped on her way home:
   * Jenny lives 5000 feet from her school.
   * She dropped 1 kernel of popcorn per 25 feet.
   * Total number of kernels dropped = 5000 feet รท 25 feet per kernel
   * 5000 รท 25 = 200 kernels

   So, Jenny dropped a total of 200 popcorn kernels on her way home.

2. Calculate the number of popcorn kernels the squirrel ate:
   * Th...
