=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many goals Mark and Anna scored based on the information given about Richie.

1. **Identify Richie's Goals**: 
   We know from the problem that Richie scored 80 goals.

2. **Set Up Equations for Mark and Anna**:
   - Let \( M \) represent the number of goals scored by Mark.
   - Let \( A \) represent the number of goals scored by Anna.

   According to the problem:
   - Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark:
     \[
     R = M + 20
     \]
   - Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna:
     \[
     R = A + 45
     \]

3. **Substituting Richie's Goals**:
   Since we know that Richie scored 80 goals, we can substitute \( R \) with 80 in both equations:
   - From the first equation:
     \[
     80 = M + 20
     \]
   - From the second equation:
     \[
     80 = A + 45
     \]

4. **Solve for Mark's Goals**:
   Rearranging the first equation to solve for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 80 - 20
   \]
   \[
   M = 60
   \]

5. **Solve for Anna's Goals**:
   Rearranging the second equation to solve for \( A \):
   \[
   A = 80 - 45
   \]
   \[
   A = 35
   \]

6. **Calculate Total Goals Scored**:
   Now that we have the number of goals scored by each teenager:
   - Richie: 80 goals
   - Mark: 60 goals
   - Anna: 35 goals

   We can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
   \[
   \text{Total Goals} = R + M + A
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Goals} = 80 + 60 + 35
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Goals} = 175
   \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is \( \boxed{175} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of goals scored by each teenager and then add them together to get the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers.

Given information:
- Richie scored 80 goals.
- Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
- Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.

Step 1: Find the number of goals scored by Mark.
Richie's goals - 20 = Mark's goals
80 - 20 = 60 goals

Step 2: Find the number of goals scored by Anna....

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many goals each teenager scored and then sum these amounts to find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers.

Let's define the variables based on the information given:

- Let \( R \) represent the number of goals Richie scored.
- Let \( M \) represent the number of goals Mark scored.
- Let \( A \) represent the number of goals Anna scored.

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Richie scored 80 goals....

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many goals Mark and Anna scored. 

According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, if Richie scored 80 goals, Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals.

The problem also states that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, if Richie scored 80 goals, Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we add up the number of goals each of them scored. 

So, Richie, Mark, and Anna scored 80 + 60...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers.

Given:
- Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
- Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.
- Richie scored 80 goals.

Step 1: Let's express Mark's and Anna's goals in terms of Richie's.
- Mark's goals = Richie's goals - 2...
