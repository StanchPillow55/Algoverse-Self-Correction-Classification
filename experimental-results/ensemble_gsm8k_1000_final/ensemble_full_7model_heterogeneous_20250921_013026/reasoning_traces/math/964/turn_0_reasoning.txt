=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many more wings Alan must eat per minute to beat Kevin's record, we first need to understand the details of both Kevin's and Alan's eating rates.

1. **Kevin's Record**:
   - Kevin can eat 64 wings in 8 minutes.
   - To find out how many wings he eats per minute, we divide the total number of wings by the total time in minutes:
     \[
     \text{Wings per minute (Kevin)} = \frac{64 \text{ wings}}{8 \text{ minutes}} = 8 \text{ wings per minute}
     \]

2. **Alan's Current Rate**:
   - Alan can currently eat 5 wings per minute.

3. **To Beat Kevin's Record**:
   - To beat Kevin's record, Alan needs to eat more than 64 wings in 8 minutes. This means he needs to eat at least 65 wings in that time frame.
   - To find out how many wings Alan needs to eat per minute to achieve this, we divide the total number of wings he needs to eat by the total time in minutes:
     \[
     \text{Wings per minute (needed by Alan)} = \frac{65 \text{ wings}}{8 \text{ minutes}} = 8.125 \text{ wings per minute}
     \]

4. **Calculating the Difference**:
   - Now, we need to find out how many more wings per minute Alan needs to eat compared to his current rate:
     \[
     \text{Additional wings per minute} = \text{Wings per minute (needed)} - \text{Wings per minute (current)}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Additional wings per minute} = 8.125 \text{ wings per minute} - 5 \text{ wings per minute} = 3.125 \text{ wings per minute}
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Since Alan cannot eat a fraction of a wing, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Alan must eat at least 4 more wings per minute to ensure he beats Kevin's record.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of wings Kevin can eat in 8 minutes and the number of wings Alan can eat in 8 minutes, and then determine how many more wings per minute Alan needs to eat to beat Kevin's record.

Given information:
- Kevin can eat 64 wings in 8 minutes.
- Alan can eat 5 wings per minute.

Step 1: Calculate the number of wings Alan can eat in 8 minutes.
Alan's wings per minute ร Number of minutes...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hot wings Alan needs to eat per minute to beat Kevin's record of 64 wings in 8 minutes. 

First, let's calculate the rate at which Kevin eats hot wings:

1. **Kevin's Rate:**
   - Kevin eats 64 wings in 8 minutes.
   - To find the rate per minute, divide the total number of wings by the total time in minutes:
     \[
     \text{Kevin's rate} = \frac{64 \text{ wings}}{8 \text{ minutes}} = 8 \text{ wings per minute}
    ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many wings Kevin eats per minute. We know that Kevin can eat 64 wings in 8 minutes. 

So, we divide the total number of wings by the total number of minutes to find the rate per minute:

64 wings / 8 minutes = 8 wings/minute

This means Kevin eats 8 wings per minute.

Alan currently eats 5 wings per minute, but he wants to beat Kevin's record. To do this, he needs to eat more than 8 wings per minute.

So, we subtract Alan's current rate from...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Kevin holds the world record by eating 64 hot wings in 8 minutes.
   * Alan can currently eat 5 hot wings per minute.
   * We need to find out how many more wings per minute Alan must eat to beat Kevin's record.

2. Calculate the number of wings Kevin eats per minute:
   * Kevin eats 64 wings in 8 minutes.
   * Wings per minute = Total wings รท Total minutes
   * ...
