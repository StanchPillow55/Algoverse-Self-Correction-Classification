=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Jared will earn in a year after graduating with a degree, given the pay for a diploma holder.

1. **Identify the monthly pay for a diploma holder**: 
   The problem states that a diploma holder earns $4000 per month.

2. **Determine the monthly pay for a degree holder**: 
   According to the problem, a person with a degree earns three times the amount paid to a diploma holder. Therefore, we can calculate the monthly pay for a degree holder as follows:

   \[
   \text{Monthly pay for degree holder} = 3 \times \text{Monthly pay for diploma holder}
   \]

   Substituting the known value:

   \[
   \text{Monthly pay for degree holder} = 3 \times 4000 = 12000
   \]

3. **Calculate the annual pay for a degree holder**: 
   To find out how much Jared will earn in a year, we need to multiply the monthly pay for a degree holder by the number of months in a year (12 months):

   \[
   \text{Annual pay for degree holder} = \text{Monthly pay for degree holder} \times 12
   \]

   Substituting the monthly pay we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Annual pay for degree holder} = 12000 \times 12 = 144000
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, Jared will earn $144,000 from the company in a year after graduating with a degree.

\[
\text{Final Answer: } 144000
\]
