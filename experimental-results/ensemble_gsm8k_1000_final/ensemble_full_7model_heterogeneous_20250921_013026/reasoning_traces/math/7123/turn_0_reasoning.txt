=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of students moving to the new school.**
2. **Determine how many students will remain at Harrison Elementary School.**
3. **Calculate the number of students in each grade level at the new school.**
4. **Determine the number of students in the advanced class and the remaining students for the normal classes.**
5. **Calculate the number of students in each normal class.**

### Step 1: Calculate the number of students moving to the new school.

Given that there are 1590 students at Harrison Elementary School and 40% of them will move to a new school, we can calculate the number of students moving as follows:

\[
\text{Number of students moving} = 1590 \times 0.40 = 636
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many students will remain at Harrison Elementary School.

To find out how many students will remain at Harrison Elementary School, we subtract the number of students moving from the total number of students:

\[
\text{Number of students remaining} = 1590 - 636 = 954
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of students in each grade level at the new school.

Since 636 students are moving to the new school and there are 3 grade levels, we divide the total number of students moving by the number of grade levels:

\[
\text{Students per grade level} = \frac{636}{3} = 212
\]

### Step 4: Determine the number of students in the advanced class and the remaining students for the normal classes.

Each grade level needs one 20-person advanced class. Therefore, for each grade level, we have:

\[
\text{Students in advanced class} = 20
\]

Now, we can find the number of students left for the normal classes:

\[
\text{Remaining students for normal classes} = 212 - 20 = 192
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of students in each normal class.

Each grade level has 6 additional normal classes. To find out how many students will be in each normal class, we divide the remaining students by the number of normal classes:

\[
\text{Students per normal class} = \frac{192}{6} = 32
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of students in each normal class at the new school is:

\[
\boxed{32}
\]

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students will be in each normal class at the new school after 40% of the students from Harrison Elementary School move there.

### Step 1: Calculate the Number of Students Moving to the New School

Harrison Elementary School has 1590 students. We are told that 40% of these students will move to the new school.

\[
\text{Number of students moving} = 0.40 \times 1590 = 636
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many students are going to move to the new school. We do this by multiplying the total number of students by 40%. 

1590 students * 40% = 636 students

Next, we need to divide these students into 3 grade levels. 

636 students / 3 grade levels = 212 students per grade level

Each grade level needs one 20-person advanced class, so we subtract these students from the total for each grade level.

212 students - 20 students = 192 students

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Find the number of students moving to the new school:
   * Total students at Harrison Elementary School = 1590
   * Percentage of students moving to the new school = 40%
   * Number of students moving = 1590 × 40% = 1590 × 0.4 = 636 students

2. Determine the number of students in each grade level at the new school:
   * Number of grade levels = 3
   * Students per grade level = 636 ÷ 3 = 212 students
