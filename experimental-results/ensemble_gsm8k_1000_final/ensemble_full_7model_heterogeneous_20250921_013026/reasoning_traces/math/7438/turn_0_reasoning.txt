=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much more money Logan must make each year to have at least $42,000 left after his expenses, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Logan's total annual expenses.**
2. **Determine how much money he has left after his current expenses.**
3. **Compare this amount with his desired amount of $42,000.**
4. **Calculate how much more he needs to earn to meet his goal.**

### Step 1: Calculate Logan's total annual expenses

Logan's expenses are as follows:
- Rent: $20,000
- Groceries: $5,000
- Gas: $8,000

Now, we will sum these expenses:

\[
\text{Total Expenses} = \text{Rent} + \text{Groceries} + \text{Gas}
\]
\[
\text{Total Expenses} = 20,000 + 5,000 + 8,000
\]
\[
\text{Total Expenses} = 33,000
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much money he has left after his current expenses

Logan's annual income is $65,000. We will subtract his total expenses from his income to find out how much he has left:

\[
\text{Money Left} = \text{Income} - \text{Total Expenses}
\]
\[
\text{Money Left} = 65,000 - 33,000
\]
\[
\text{Money Left} = 32,000
\]

### Step 3: Compare this amount with his desired amount of $42,000

Logan wants to have at least $42,000 left after his expenses. We will find out how much more he needs:

\[
\text{Additional Money Needed} = \text{Desired Amount} - \text{Money Left}
\]
\[
\text{Additional Money Needed} = 42,000 - 32,000
\]
\[
\text{Additional Money Needed} = 10,000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate how much more he needs to earn to meet his goal

Since Logan needs an additional $10,000 to have at least $42,000 left after his expenses, we conclude that he must earn this amount in addition to his current income.

### Final Answer

Logan must make **$10,000 more** each year to have at least $42,000 left after his expenses.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more money Logan must make each year to have at least $42,000 left after his expenses.

First, let's calculate Logan's total expenses for the year:

1. Rent: $20,000
2. Groceries: $5,000
3. Gas: $8,000

Add these expenses together to find the total annual expenses:

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Logan's total expenses per year are the sum of his rent, groceries, and gas costs. 

So, his total expenses = $20,000 (rent) + $5,000 (groceries) + $8,000 (gas) = $33,000.

Logan's current income is $65,000. After his expenses, he is left with $65,000 - $33,000 = $32,000.

However, Logan wants to have at least $42,000 left each year. This means he needs an additional $42,000 - $32,000 = $10,000 per year.

Therefore, Logan must make an additional $10,000 each year to meet ...
