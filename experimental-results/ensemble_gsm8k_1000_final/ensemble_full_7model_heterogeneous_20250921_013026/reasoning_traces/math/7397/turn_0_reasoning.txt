=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many people Ryan needs to recruit to fund his business idea, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total funding needed**: 
   Ryan needs a total of $1,000 for his business.

2. **Account for the funds Ryan already has**: 
   Ryan already has $200. We need to subtract this amount from the total funding needed:
   \[
   \text{Remaining funding needed} = \text{Total funding needed} - \text{Funds already available}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining funding needed} = 1000 - 200 = 800
   \]

3. **Determine the average contribution per person**: 
   The average person contributes $10 to the project.

4. **Calculate the number of people needed**: 
   To find out how many people Ryan needs to recruit to cover the remaining $800, we divide the remaining funding needed by the average contribution per person:
   \[
   \text{Number of people needed} = \frac{\text{Remaining funding needed}}{\text{Average contribution per person}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of people needed} = \frac{800}{10} = 80
   \]

Thus, Ryan will need to recruit **80 people** to fund the remaining amount of his business idea.

**Final Answer**: 80 people.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money Ryan still needs to raise and then calculate the number of people he needs to recruit to reach that goal.

Given information:
- The average person funds $10 to a project they're interested in.
- Ryan needs to raise $1,000 for his business.
- Ryan already has $200.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Ryan still needs to raise.
Total amount needed - Amount already raised = Amount still needed...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional people Ryan needs to recruit to fund his business idea, given that he already has some funds.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total amount needed:**
   Ryan's business requires a total of $1,000.

2. **Subtract the amount Ryan already has:**
   Ryan already has $200. Therefore, the additional amount he needs is:
   \[
   \text{Additional amount needed} = \text{Total amount nee...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241210): ANTHROPIC_API_ERROR: Error code: 404 - {'type': 'error', 'error': {'type': 'not_found_error', 'message': 'model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241210'}, 'request_id': 'req_011CTMLdACAV2ppz8LBEd6JP'}

Model 5 (replicate:meta/meta-llama-3-70b): REPLICATE_API_ERROR: ReplicateError Details:

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Ryan already has $200, so he needs to raise $1000 - $200 = $800 more.

If the average person funds $10, then to raise $800, Ryan will need to recruit $800 / $10 = 80 people.

So, Ryan will need to recruit 80 people to fund his $1,000 business if he has $200 already.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The average person funds $10 to a project they're interested in.
   * Ryan needs to raise $1,000 for his business.
   * Ryan already has $200.

2. Calculate the remaining amount Ryan needs to raise:
   * Remaining amount = Total needed - Amount already had
   * Remaining amount = $1,000 - $200
   * Remaining amount = $800

3. Calculate the number of people needed...
