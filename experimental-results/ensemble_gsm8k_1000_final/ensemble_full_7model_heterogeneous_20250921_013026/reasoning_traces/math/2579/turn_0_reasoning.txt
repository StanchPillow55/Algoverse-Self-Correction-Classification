Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of crayons Nori had initially.**
   Nori had 4 boxes of crayons, and each box contained 8 crayons. Therefore, the total number of crayons can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total crayons} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Crayons per box} = 4 \times 8 = 32
   \]

2. **Determine how many crayons Nori has after giving some away.**
   Nori gave 5 crayons to Mae and some unknown number of crayons to Lea. After giving away these crayons, she has 15 crayons left. We can set up the equation to find out how many crayons she gave away in total.

   Let \( x \) be the number of crayons Nori gave to Lea. The total number of crayons given away is \( 5 + x \). Since she has 15 crayons left, we can write the equation:

   \[
   \text{Initial crayons} - \text{Crayons given away} = \text{Crayons left}
   \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   32 - (5 + x) = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \).**
   Rearranging the equation gives:

   \[
   32 - 5 - x = 15
   \]

   Simplifying this:

   \[
   27 - x = 15
   \]

   Now, isolate \( x \):

   \[
   27 - 15 = x
   \]

   \[
   x = 12
   \]

   Thus, Nori gave 12 crayons to Lea.

4. **Determine how many more crayons Nori gave to Lea than Mae.**
   Nori gave 5 crayons to Mae and 12 crayons to Lea. To find out how many more crayons she gave to Lea than Mae, we subtract the number of crayons given to Mae from the number given to Lea:

   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Crayons given to Lea} - \text{Crayons given to Mae} = 12 - 5 = 7
   \]

5. **Final answer.**
   Therefore, Nori gave 7 more crayons to Lea than she gave to Mae.

\[
\boxed{7}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Nori had 4 boxes of crayons with 8 crayons in each box.
- Nori gave 5 crayons to Mae.
- Nori gave some crayons to Lea.
- Nori has only 15 crayons left.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of crayons Nori had initially.
Total crayons = Number of boxes × Crayons per box
Total crayons = 4 × 8 = 32 crayons

Step 2: Calculate the number of crayons Nori gave to Mae.
Crayons given to Mae = 5

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many crayons Nori gave to Lea and how many more crayons she gave to Lea than to Mae. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of crayons Nori initially had:**
   - Nori had 4 boxes of crayons, with each box containing 8 crayons.
   - Therefore, the total number of crayons is calculated as follows:
     \[

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Nori initially had 4 boxes of crayons with 8 crayons in each box. This means she had 4 * 8 = <<4*8=32>>32 crayons.

She gave 5 crayons to Mae, so she had 32 - 5 = <<32-5=27>>27 crayons left.

If she has only 15 crayons left now, this means she gave 27 - 15 = <<27-15=12>>12 crayons to Lea.

Therefore, Nori gave 12 - 5 = <<12-5=7>>7 more crayons to Lea than Mae. 

So, the final answer is 7.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by identifying the important information given in the problem.

Given:
- Nori had 4 boxes of crayons with 8 crayons in each box.
- She gave 5 crayons to Mae.
- She also gave some crayons to Lea.
- Nori has only 15 crayons left.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of crayons Nori had initially.
Total crayons = Number of boxes × Crayons per box
Total crayons = 4 × 8 = 32
So, Nori had 32 crayons in ...
