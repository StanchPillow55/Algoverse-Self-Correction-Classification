=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many uncommon cards John got, we can break the problem down into several steps.

1. **Determine the total number of cards John bought**:
   John buys 10 packs of magic cards, and each pack contains 20 cards. To find the total number of cards, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cards per pack:

   \[
   \text{Total cards} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Cards per pack}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cards} = 10 \times 20 = 200
   \]

   So, John has a total of 200 cards.

2. **Calculate the number of uncommon cards**:
   We know that 1/4 of the total cards are uncommon. To find the number of uncommon cards, we multiply the total number of cards by 1/4:

   \[
   \text{Uncommon cards} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total cards}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Uncommon cards} = \frac{1}{4} \times 200
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Uncommon cards} = 50
   \]

Thus, John got **50 uncommon cards**.

3. **Final Answer**:
   The total number of uncommon cards that John received is \( \boxed{50} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of uncommon cards in each pack and then multiply it by the total number of packs John bought.

Given information:
- John buys 10 packs of magic cards.
- Each pack has 20 cards.
- 1/4 of the cards in each pack are uncommon.

Step 1: Find the number of uncommon cards in each pack.
Number of uncommon cards per pack = 1/4 of 20 cards
Number of uncommon cards per pack = 1/4 × 20 = 5 uncommon cards

Step 2: ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many uncommon cards John gets from the 10 packs of magic cards he buys. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of cards John buys:**

   John buys 10 packs of magic cards, and each pack contains 20 cards. To find the total number of cards, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cards per pack:

   \[

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many cards John bought in total. Since each pack has 20 cards and he bought 10 packs, we multiply 20 by 10 to get the total number of cards. 

20 cards/pack * 10 packs = 200 cards

Next, we need to find out how many of these cards are uncommon. We know that 1/4 of the cards are uncommon, so we multiply the total number of cards by 1/4 to find out how many uncommon cards there are.

200 cards * 1/4 = 50 cards

So, John got 50 uncommon cards.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * John bought 10 packs of magic cards.
   * Each pack contains 20 cards.
   * 1/4 (one-fourth) of the cards in each pack are uncommon.

2. Calculate the total number of cards John bought:
   * Total cards = Number of packs × Cards per pack
   * Total cards = 10 × 20
   * Total cards = 200
   
   So, John bought a total of 200 magic cards.

3. Calculate the number of unco...
