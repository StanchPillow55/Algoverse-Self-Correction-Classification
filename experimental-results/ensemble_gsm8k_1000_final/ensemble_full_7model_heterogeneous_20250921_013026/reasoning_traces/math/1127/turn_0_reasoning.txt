=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of items in Marcus's attic based on the information provided about the percentages of useful items, valuable heirlooms, and junk items.

1. **Understanding the Percentages**:
   - Useful items: 20%
   - Valuable heirlooms: 10%
   - Junk items: 70%

   These percentages add up to 100%, which confirms that they represent all the items in the attic.

2. **Finding the Total Number of Items**:
   We know that Mason has 8 useful items, which represent 20% of the total items in the attic. We can set up the equation to find the total number of items (let's denote it as \( T \)):

   \[
   0.20T = 8
   \]

   To find \( T \), we can solve for it by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.20:

   \[
   T = \frac{8}{0.20}
   \]

   Calculating the right side:

   \[
   T = 8 \div 0.20 = 8 \div \frac{1}{5} = 8 \times 5 = 40
   \]

   So, the total number of items in the attic is \( T = 40 \).

3. **Calculating the Number of Junk Items**:
   Now that we know the total number of items, we can find the number of junk items. Since junk items make up 70% of the total items, we can calculate the number of junk items as follows:

   \[
   \text{Number of junk items} = 0.70T = 0.70 \times 40
   \]

   Calculating this:

   \[
   0.70 \times 40 = 28
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, the number of junk items in Marcus's attic is \( \boxed{28} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of items in the attic and then calculate the number of junk items based on the given percentages.

Given information:
- 20% of the items are useful.
- 10% of the items are valuable heirlooms.
- 70% of the items are junk.
- There are 8 useful items in the attic.

Step 1: Find the total number of items in the attic.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out the total number of items in Mason's attic. We know that the useful items represent 20% of the total. So, if 8 items represent 20%, we can find the total number of items by setting up the following proportion:

8 items / X total items = 20% / 100%

To solve for X, we can cross-multiply:

8 * 100 = 20 * X

800 = 20X

Then, divide both sides by 20 to solve for X:

X = 800 / 20

X = 40 items

So, there are 40 total items in Mason's attic.

Next, we...
