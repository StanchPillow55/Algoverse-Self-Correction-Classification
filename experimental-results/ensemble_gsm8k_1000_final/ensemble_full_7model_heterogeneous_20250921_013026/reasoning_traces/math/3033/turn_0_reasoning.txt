=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how far the birdhouse had flown based on the distances given for the car and the lawn chair. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Distance the car was transported**: The problem states that the tornado picked up the Smith's car and transported it 200 feet in the air. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   \text{Distance of the car} = 200 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Distance the lawn chair was blown**: The lawn chair was blown twice as far as the car. To find the distance the lawn chair was blown, we multiply the distance of the car by 2:
   \[
   \text{Distance of the lawn chair} = 2 \times \text{Distance of the car} = 2 \times 200 \text{ feet} = 400 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Distance the birdhouse flew**: The birdhouse flew three times farther than the lawn chair. To find the distance the birdhouse flew, we multiply the distance of the lawn chair by 3:
   \[
   \text{Distance of the birdhouse} = 3 \times \text{Distance of the lawn chair} = 3 \times 400 \text{ feet} = 1200 \text{ feet}
   \]

Now that we have calculated the distance the birdhouse flew, we can state the final answer.

**Final Answer**: The birdhouse had flown **1200 feet**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The tornado picked up the Smith's car and transported it 200 feet in the air before dropping it into the neighbors' pool.
- A lawn chair had been blown twice as far as the car had been transported.
- A birdhouse had flown through the air three times farther than the lawn chair had been blown.

Step 1: Calculate the distance the lawn chair had been blown.
Distance the car was transported =...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how far the birdhouse flew based on the distances given for the car and the lawn chair.

1. **Distance the car was transported:**
   - The problem states that the car was transported 200 feet.

2. **Distance the lawn chair was transported:**
   - The lawn chair was blown twice as far as the car.
   - Therefore, the distance the lawn chair was transported is:
     \[
     2 \times 200 \text{ feet} = 400 \text{ feet}
     \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem gives us three distances, each related to the previous one. 

First, we have the Smith's car, which was transported 200 feet in the air by the tornado. 

Second, we have a lawn chair that was blown twice as far as the car. To find out how far the lawn chair was blown, we multiply the distance the car was transported by 2:

200 feet * 2 = 400 feet

So, the lawn chair was blown 400 feet.

Finally, we have a birdhouse that was flown three times farther than the l...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the distance the birdhouse had flown.

Given:
- The Smith's car was transported 200 feet in the air by the tornado.
- The lawn chair was blown twice as far as the car.
- The birdhouse flew three times farther than the lawn chair.

Step 1: Calculate the distance the lawn chair was...
