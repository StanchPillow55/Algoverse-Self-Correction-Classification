=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how old you were when Billy was born, given that you are currently 4 times older than Billy and that Billy is currently 4 years old.

1. **Determine your current age**:
   - Since Billy is currently 4 years old, and you are 4 times older than him, we can calculate your age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Your age} = 4 \times \text{Billy's age} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **Calculate the age difference between you and Billy**:
   - The age difference between you and Billy can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Age difference} = \text{Your age} - \text{Billy's age} = 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Determine how old you were when Billy was born**:
   - Since the age difference is 12 years, this means that you were 12 years old when Billy was born. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{You were } 12 \text{ years old when Billy was born.}
\]

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to determine how old you were when Billy was born, given that you are currently 4 times older than Billy and that Billy is currently 4 years old.

1. **Determine your current age**:
   - Since Billy is currently 4 years old, and you are 4 times older than him, we can calculate your age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Your age} = 4 \times \text{Billy's age} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ years old}

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- You are 4 times older than Billy currently.
- Billy is 4 years old.

Step 1: Find your current age.
Since you are 4 times older than Billy, your current age can be represented as:
Your current age = 4 × Billy's current age
Your current age = 4 × 4 = 16 years old

Step 2: Find your age when Billy was born.
To find your age when Billy was born, we need to subtract Billy's current age from y...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine your current age and then use that information to find out how old you were when Billy was born.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Billy's Current Age:**
   - We are given that Billy is currently 4 years old.

2. **Determine Your Current Age:**
   - You are currently 4 times older than Billy.
   - Since Billy is 4 years old, we calculate your age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Your current age} = 4 \times \text{Billy'...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how old I am currently. Since I'm 4 times older than Billy, and Billy is 4 years old, I am 4 * 4 = 16 years old.

Next, we need to find out how old I was when Billy was born. Since Billy is currently 4 years old, that means he was born 4 years ago. So, 4 years ago, I was 16 - 4 = 12 years old.

So, when Billy was born, I was 12 years old.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the information given to determine your age when Billy was born.

Given:
- You are currently 4 times older than Billy.
- Billy is currently 4 years old.

Step 1: Determine your current age.
Your age = 4 × Billy's age
Your age = 4 × 4 = 16 years old

So, you are currently 16 years old.

Step 2: Calculate how old you were when Billy was born.
To find your age when Billy was born, we need to subtra...
