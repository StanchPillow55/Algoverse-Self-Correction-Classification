=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how long it will take Mike to save for a down payment on a house, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Mike's annual savings**:
   Mike saves 10% of his annual salary. His salary is $150,000.

   \[
   \text{Annual Savings} = 10\% \times 150,000 = 0.10 \times 150,000 = 15,000
   \]

2. **Determine the down payment required for the house**:
   The cost of the house is $450,000, and he needs to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.

   \[
   \text{Down Payment} = 20\% \times 450,000 = 0.20 \times 450,000 = 90,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the time required to save for the down payment**:
   Now that we know how much Mike saves each year and how much he needs for the down payment, we can find out how many years it will take him to save the required amount.

   \[
   \text{Time (in years)} = \frac{\text{Down Payment}}{\text{Annual Savings}} = \frac{90,000}{15,000}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \text{Time} = 6 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, it will take Mike **6 years** to save enough for the down payment on the house.

Final answer: **6 years**.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take Mike to save enough money for a downpayment on a house. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the Amount Needed for the Downpayment

Mike needs to save 20% of the cost of the house for the downpayment. The cost of the house is $450,000.

\[
\text{Downpayment} = 20\% \times 450,000 = 0.20 \times 450,000
\]

Calculating this:

\[
0.20 \times 450,000 = 90,000
\]

So, Mike needs to ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much Mike saves each year. He earns $150,000 a year and saves 10% of it. 

10% of $150,000 = 0.10 * $150,000 = $15,000 

So, Mike saves $15,000 each year.

Next, let's calculate how much Mike needs for a downpayment on the house. The house costs $450,000 and he needs to save 20% of that for a downpayment.

20% of $450,000 = 0.20 * $450,000 = $90,000

So, Mike needs $90,000 for a downpayment.

Finally, let's calculate how long it will take Mike t...
