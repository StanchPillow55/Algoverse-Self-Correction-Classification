=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much each watermelon was sold for, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost price per watermelon**:
   The vendor bought 50 watermelons for a total of $80. To find the cost price per watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons.

   \[
   \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of watermelons}} = \frac{80}{50}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \text{Cost price per watermelon} = 1.6
   \]

   So, the cost price per watermelon is $1.60.

2. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a profit of 25%**:
   The vendor wants to sell the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price, we first need to calculate 25% of the cost price and then add that to the cost price.

   First, calculate 25% of the cost price:

   \[
   \text{Profit per watermelon} = 25\% \times \text{Cost price per watermelon} = 0.25 \times 1.6
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Profit per watermelon} = 0.4
   \]

   Now, add the profit to the cost price to find the selling price:

   \[
   \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} + \text{Profit per watermelon} = 1.6 + 0.4
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 2.0
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

\[
\text{Final answer: Each watermelon was sold for } \boxed{2.00}.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.
- The vendor sold all the watermelons at a profit of 25%.

To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons.
Total cost price = $80
Profit percentage = 25%
Profit amount = Total cost price × Profit percentage
Profit amount = $80 × 0.25 = $20
Total sellin...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the selling price of each watermelon given that the vendor sold them at a 25% profit.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Cost Price of One Watermelon:**

   The vendor bought 50 watermelons for a total of $80. To find the cost price per watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons:

   \[
   \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of watermelons}} = \frac{80}{50...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The first step is to determine how much the fruit vendor spent on each watermelon. He bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost of each watermelon is $80 / 50 = $1.60.

The vendor then sold each watermelon at a profit of 25%. To find out how much he sold each watermelon for, we need to calculate 25% of the cost price and then add this to the cost price.

25% of $1.60 is $1.60 * 0.25 = $0.40.

So, the selling price of each watermelon is $1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00.

Therefore, ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons and then divide it by the number of watermelons.

Given:
- The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.
- He sold all of them at a profit of 25%.

Step 1: Calculate the cost price of each watermelon.
Cost price per watermelon = Total cost ÷ Number of watermelons
Cost price per watermelon ...
