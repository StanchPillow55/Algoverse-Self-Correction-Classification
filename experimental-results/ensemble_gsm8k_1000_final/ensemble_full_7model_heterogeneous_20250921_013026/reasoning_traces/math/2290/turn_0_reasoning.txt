=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of stickers Victor has, which includes both flower stickers and animal stickers.

1. **Identify the number of flower stickers**: 
   - According to the problem, Victor has 8 flower stickers.

2. **Determine the number of animal stickers**: 
   - The problem states that Victor has 2 fewer animal stickers than flower stickers. 
   - Since he has 8 flower stickers, we can calculate the number of animal stickers as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of animal stickers} = \text{Number of flower stickers} - 2
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of animal stickers} = 8 - 2 = 6
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of stickers**: 
   - Now that we know Victor has 8 flower stickers and 6 animal stickers, we can find the total number of stickers by adding the two amounts together:
     \[
     \text{Total number of stickers} = \text{Number of flower stickers} + \text{Number of animal stickers}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total number of stickers} = 8 + 6 = 14
     \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   - Therefore, the total number of stickers Victor has is \( \boxed{14} \).

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Victor has 8 flower stickers.

He has 2 fewer animal stickers than flower stickers. This means he has 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 animal stickers.

To find the total number of stickers Victor has, we add the number of flower stickers to the number of animal stickers. 

So, 8 (flower stickers) + 6 (animal stickers) = 14 stickers.

Therefore, Victor has 14 stickers in total.
