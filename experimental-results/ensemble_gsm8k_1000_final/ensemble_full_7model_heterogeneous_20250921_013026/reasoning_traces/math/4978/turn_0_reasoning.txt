=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many seeds Bob can plant in each row, we need to consider the length of the row and the space required for each seed.

1. **Convert the row length from feet to inches**: 
   Since the space requirement for each seed is given in inches, we should convert the length of the row from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

   \[
   \text{Length of the row in inches} = 120 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1440 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Determine the space required for each seed**: 
   Each seed requires 18 inches of space to its right. This means that for each seed planted, we need to account for the 18 inches of space it occupies.

3. **Calculate the number of seeds that can fit in the row**: 
   To find out how many seeds can fit in the row, we divide the total length of the row (in inches) by the space required for each seed (also in inches):

   \[
   \text{Number of seeds} = \frac{\text{Length of the row in inches}}{\text{Space required per seed in inches}} = \frac{1440 \text{ inches}}{18 \text{ inches/seed}}
   \]

   Now, we perform the division:

   \[
   \text{Number of seeds} = \frac{1440}{18}
   \]

   To simplify this division, we can perform the calculation:

   \[
   1440 \div 18 = 80
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, Bob can plant **80 seeds** in each row.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{80}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of seeds that can be planted in each row of the garden.

Given information:
- The rows are 120 feet long.
- Each seed needs a dedicated space of 18 inches to its right.

Step 1: Convert the row length from feet to inches.
120 feet × 12 inches/foot = 1,440 inches

Step 2: Determine the number of seed spaces in the row.
Number of seed spaces = Row length in inches / Space required for each seed
Number of...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of how many corn seeds Bob can plant in each row, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: 
   - Each row is 120 feet long.
   - Each seed requires 18 inches of space to its right.

2. **Convert units for consistency**:
   - Since the row length is given in feet and the space required per seed is given in inches, we need to convert one of these measurements so they are in the same unit. 
   - Let's convert the row length from fe...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to convert the length of the row from feet to inches because the space needed for each seed is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply the length of the row by 12.

120 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches

Next, we divide the total length of the row in inches by the space needed for each seed to find out how many seeds Bob can plant in each row.

1440 inches / 18 inches/seed = 80 seeds

So, Bob can plant 80 seeds in each row.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The rows in Bob's garden are 120 feet long.
   * Each seed needs its own dedicated space of 18 inches to its right.

2. Convert the length of the rows from feet to inches:
   * 1 foot = 12 inches
   * 120 feet = 120 × 12 inches
   * 120 feet = 1,440 inches

3. Determine the number of seeds that can fit in each row:
   * Each seed needs 18 inches of space to its r...
