=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many roses Hanna can buy with her budget.**
2. **Calculate how many roses are given to Jenna and Imma.**
3. **Sum the roses given to both friends.**

### Step 1: Calculate the number of roses Hanna can buy

Hanna has $300, and each rose costs $2. We can find the total number of roses she can buy by dividing her total money by the cost per rose.

\[
\text{Number of roses} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per rose}} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
\]

So, Hanna can buy **150 roses**.

### Step 2: Calculate how many roses are given to Jenna and Imma

Next, we need to determine how many roses each friend receives based on the fractions given in the problem.

- **Jenna receives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the roses.**
- **Imma receives \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the roses.**

First, we calculate the number of roses given to Jenna:

\[
\text{Roses for Jenna} = \frac{1}{3} \times 150 = 50
\]

Next, we calculate the number of roses given to Imma:

\[
\text{Roses for Imma} = \frac{1}{2} \times 150 = 75
\]

### Step 3: Sum the roses given to both friends

Now, we add the number of roses given to Jenna and Imma to find the total number of roses given away:

\[
\text{Total roses given} = \text{Roses for Jenna} + \text{Roses for Imma} = 50 + 75 = 125
\]

### Final Answer

Hanna gives a total of **125 roses** to her friends, Jenna and Imma.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of roses Hanna can buy with her $300, and then calculate the number of roses she gives to her friends Jenna and Imma.

Given information:
- Hanna has $300.
- Roses cost $2 each.
- Jenna will receive 1/3 of the roses.
- Imma will receive 1/2 of the roses.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses Hanna can buy.
Total number of roses = Hanna's money / Cost per rose
Total number of roses = $300 /...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many roses Hanna can buy with her $300, and then calculate how many roses she gives to her friends, Jenna and Imma.

**Step 1: Determine the number of roses Hanna can buy.**

Hanna has $300 and each rose costs $2. To find out how many roses she can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost per rose:

\[
\text{Number of roses} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per rose}} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
\]

So, Hanna ca...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many roses Hanna can buy with her $300. Since each rose costs $2, we divide her total amount of money by the cost of each rose.

$300 รท $2 = 150 roses

Next, we need to determine how many roses Jenna and Imma will receive. 

Jenna will receive 1/3 of the roses, so we multiply the total number of roses by 1/3.

150 roses * 1/3 = 50 roses

Imma will receive 1/2 of the roses, so we multiply the total number of roses by 1/2.

150 roses * 1/2 = ...
