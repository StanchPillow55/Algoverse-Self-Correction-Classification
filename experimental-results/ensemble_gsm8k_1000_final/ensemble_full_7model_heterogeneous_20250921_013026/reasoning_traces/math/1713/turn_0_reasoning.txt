=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many trading cards the hobby store sold in June and July combined.

1. **Identify the normal monthly sales**: 
   The hobby store normally sells 21,122 trading cards per month.

2. **Calculate the sales in June**:
   In June, the store sold 3,922 more trading cards than normal. Therefore, we can calculate the total sales for June as follows:

   \[
   \text{Sales in June} = \text{Normal sales} + \text{Additional sales}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Sales in June} = 21,122 + 3,922
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition:

   \[
   21,122 + 3,922 = 25,044
   \]

   So, the hobby store sold **25,044 trading cards in June**.

3. **Calculate the sales in July**:
   In July, the hobby store sold the regular number of trading cards, which is 21,122.

4. **Combine the sales from June and July**:
   To find the total number of trading cards sold in June and July combined, we add the sales from both months:

   \[
   \text{Total sales} = \text{Sales in June} + \text{Sales in July}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total sales} = 25,044 + 21,122
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition:

   \[
   25,044 + 21,122 = 46,166
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   The total number of trading cards sold in June and July combined is **46,166**.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{46,166}
\]
