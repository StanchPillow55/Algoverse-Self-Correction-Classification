=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many regular toenails Hilary can fit into the remainder of the jar after accounting for the toenails she has already collected.

1. **Understanding the capacity of the jar**:
   - The jar can hold a total of 100 toenails.
   - Big toenails (from her two big toes) are twice as big as regular toenails. This means that each big toenail takes up the space of 2 regular toenails.

2. **Calculating the space taken by the big toenails**:
   - Hilary has already filled the jar with 20 big toenails.
   - Since each big toenail takes up the space of 2 regular toenails, the total space taken by the big toenails is:
     \[
     20 \text{ big toenails} \times 2 = 40 \text{ regular toenail spaces}
     \]

3. **Calculating the space taken by the regular toenails**:
   - Hilary has also filled the jar with 40 regular toenails.
   - The total space taken by the regular toenails is simply:
     \[
     40 \text{ regular toenails} = 40 \text{ regular toenail spaces}
     \]

4. **Calculating the total space used in the jar**:
   - Now we add the space taken by both the big toenails and the regular toenails:
     \[
     \text{Total space used} = \text{Space taken by big toenails} + \text{Space taken by regular toenails}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total space used} = 40 \text{ (from big toenails)} + 40 \text{ (from regular toenails)} = 80 \text{ regular toenail spaces}
     \]

5. **Calculating the remaining space in the jar**:
   - The total capacity of the jar is 100 toenails. Therefore, the remaining space in the jar is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining space} = 100 - 80 = 20 \text{ regular toenail spaces}
     \]

6. **Final calculation**:
   - Since the remaining space can only be filled with regular toenails, Hilary can fit 20 regular toenails into the remainder of the jar.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The jar can fit 100 toenails in total.
- Toenails from the two big toes are twice as big as the regular toenails.
- Hilary has already filled the jar with 20 big toenails and 40 regular toenails.

Step 1: Calculate the total space taken up by the 20 big toenails and 40 regular toenails.
Space taken by 20 big toenails = 20 × 2 = 40 spaces
Space taken by 40 regular toenails = 40 spaces
Tota...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many regular toenails Hilary can still fit into the jar, given the constraints provided.

First, let's understand the capacity of the jar:
- The jar can hold 100 regular-sized toenails.

Next, let's consider the toenails that are already in the jar:
- Hilary has already placed 20 big toenails in the jar.
- Each big toenail is twice the size of a regular toenail.

Since each big toenail takes up the space of 2 regular toenai...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to understand that Hilary's big toenails are twice as big as her regular toenails. This means that each big toenail takes up the space of two regular toenails.

Hilary has already filled the jar with 20 big toenails. Since each big toenail takes up the space of two regular toenails, these 20 big toenails take up the space of 20 * 2 = 40 regular toenails.

In addition to the big toenails, Hilary has also put 40 regular toenails in the jar. 

So, in total, th...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The jar can hold 100 regular toenails.
   * Big toenails are twice as big as regular toenails.
   * Hilary has already put 20 big toenails and 40 regular toenails in the jar.

2. Calculate the space taken up by the big toenails:
   * Each big toenail is equivalent to 2 regular toenails in terms of space.
   * Space taken by big toenails = 20 × 2 = 40 regular toen...
