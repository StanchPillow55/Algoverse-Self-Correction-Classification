=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the variables**:
   - Let \( d \) be the cost of the dessert in dollars.
   - Since the entree costs $5 more than the dessert, we can express the cost of the entree as \( e = d + 5 \).

2. **Set up the equation based on the total cost**:
   - According to the problem, the total cost of the entree and dessert is $23. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   e + d = 23
   \]

3. **Substitute the expression for the entree into the equation**:
   - We can substitute \( e \) with \( d + 5 \) in the total cost equation:
   \[
   (d + 5) + d = 23
   \]

4. **Combine like terms**:
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   2d + 5 = 23
   \]

5. **Isolate the variable \( d \)**:
   - First, subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   2d = 23 - 5
   \]
   \[
   2d = 18
   \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   d = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]

6. **Find the cost of the entree**:
   - Now that we have the cost of the dessert, we can find the cost of the entree using the equation \( e = d + 5 \):
   \[
   e = 9 + 5 = 14
   \]

7. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the cost of the entree is \( \boxed{14} \) dollars. 

To verify:
- The dessert costs $9 and the entree costs $14. Together, they sum to \( 9 + 14 = 23 \), which matches the total given in the problem. Thus, the solution is confirmed to be correct.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Hannah spent a total of $23 on an entree and a dessert.
- The entree costs $5 more than the dessert.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the cost of the dessert
- Then, the cost of the entree = x + $5

Step 1: Set up the equation to represent the total cost.
Total cost = Cost of entree + Cost of dessert
$23 = (x + $5) + x
$23 = 2x + $5

Step 2: Solve the equation for x.
$23 = 2x + $5
$18 = ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( d \) as the cost of the dessert in dollars.
- \( e \) as the cost of the entree in dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the entree and the dessert is $23. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ e + d = 23 \]

The problem also states that the entree costs $5 more than the dessert. This gives us another equation:
\[ e = d + 5 \]

Now, we have a system...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the cost of the dessert as x (in dollars). According to the problem, the entree costs $5 more than the dessert, so we can denote the cost of the entree as x + $5.

The total cost of the entree and dessert is given as $23. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent this relationship:

x (dessert) + x + $5 (entree) = $23

This simplifies to:

2x + $5 = $23

Next, we can solve for x by first subtracting $5 from both sides of the equation:

2x =...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Hannah spent a total of $23 on an entree and a dessert.
   * The entree costs $5 more than the dessert.

2. Let's define variables to represent the unknown prices:
   * Let the price of the dessert be x dollars.
   * Since the entree costs $5 more than the dessert, the price of the entree is x + 5 dollars.

3. Set up an equation based on the total spent:
