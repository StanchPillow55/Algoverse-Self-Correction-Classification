=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To calculate how much money Watson made in April, we need to consider both his hourly wage and the bonus he receives for the month.

### Step 1: Calculate Weekly Earnings from Hourly Wage

Watson works 10 hours each day for 5 days a week. 

First, we calculate his weekly hours:
\[
\text{Weekly hours} = \text{Hours per day} \times \text{Days per week} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 50 \, \text{hours/week}
\]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings from his hourly wage:
\[
\text{Weekly earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Weekly hours} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 50 \, \text{hours/week} = 500 \, \text{dollars/week}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Weekly Bonus

Watson receives a bonus of $300 each week if the company performs well. Since the problem states that the company performed very well for the whole month, he will receive this bonus every week.

### Step 3: Calculate Total Weekly Earnings Including Bonus

Now, we add the bonus to his weekly earnings:
\[
\text{Total weekly earnings} = \text{Weekly earnings} + \text{Weekly bonus} = 500 \, \text{dollars/week} + 300 \, \text{dollars/week} = 800 \, \text{dollars/week}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Earnings for April

April has 4 weeks and 2 extra days (30 days total). However, since Watson works 5 days a week, we need to determine how many complete weeks he worked in April.

In April, Watson works:
- 4 complete weeks = 4 weeks × 5 days/week = 20 days
- The remaining 2 days do not complete another week, so he does not earn for those days.

Thus, he will earn for 4 weeks only.

Now, we calculate his total earnings for April:
\[
\text{Total earnings for April} = \text{Total weekly earnings} \times \text{Number of weeks worked} = 800 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 3200 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Therefore, Watson made a total of **$3200** in April.

10 hours/day * $10/hour = $100/day

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings. He works 5 days a week, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

$100/day * 5 days/week = $500/week

In addition to his hourly wage, Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. So, his total weekly earnings are:
