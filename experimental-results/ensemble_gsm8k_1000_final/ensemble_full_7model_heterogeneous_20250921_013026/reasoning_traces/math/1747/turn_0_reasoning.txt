=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of marbles that Mara and Markus have and then find the difference between Markus's total and Mara's total.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of marbles Mara has.**

Mara has 12 bags, and each bag contains 2 marbles. We can calculate the total number of marbles Mara has by multiplying the number of bags by the number of marbles per bag:

\[
\text{Total marbles Mara has} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Marbles per bag}
\]
\[
\text{Total marbles Mara has} = 12 \times 2 = 24
\]

So, Mara has a total of 24 marbles.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of marbles Markus has.**

Markus has 2 bags, and each bag contains 13 marbles. Similarly, we calculate the total number of marbles Markus has:

\[
\text{Total marbles Markus has} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Marbles per bag}
\]
\[
\text{Total marbles Markus has} = 2 \times 13 = 26
\]

So, Markus has a total of 26 marbles.

**Step 3: Find out how many more marbles Markus has than Mara.**

Now, we need to determine how many more marbles Markus has compared to Mara. We do this by subtracting the total number of marbles Mara has from the total number of marbles Markus has:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total marbles Markus has} - \text{Total marbles Mara has}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 26 - 24 = 2
\]

**Final Answer:**

Markus has 2 more marbles than Mara.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mara has 12 bags with 2 marbles in each bag.
- Markus has 2 bags with 13 marbles in each bag.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of marbles Mara has.
Mara's total marbles = Number of bags × Number of marbles per bag

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many marbles each person has. 

Mara has 12 bags with 2 marbles each. To find out how many marbles she has in total, we multiply the number of bags by the number of marbles in each bag. 

12 bags * 2 marbles/bag = 24 marbles

Markus has 2 bags with 13 marbles each. We do the same calculation for him.

2 bags * 13 marbles/bag = 26 marbles

Now we need to find out how many more marbles Markus has than Mara. We do this by subtracting the number...
