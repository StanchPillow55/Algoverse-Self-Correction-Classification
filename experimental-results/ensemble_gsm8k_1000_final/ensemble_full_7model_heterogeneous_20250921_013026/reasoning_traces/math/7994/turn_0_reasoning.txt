=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating how many math problems Chris has completed each day and how many he has left.

1. **Total Problems**: Chris starts with a total of 100 math problems.

2. **Problems Completed on Monday**: 
   - Chris completes 12 problems on Monday.
   - Remaining problems after Monday:
     \[
     100 - 12 = 88
     \]

3. **Problems Completed on Tuesday**: 
   - On Tuesday, Chris completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. 
   - Problems completed on Tuesday:
     \[
     3 \times 12 = 36
     \]
   - Remaining problems after Tuesday:
     \[
     88 - 36 = 52
     \]

4. **Problems Completed on Wednesday**: 
   - On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems.
   - Remaining problems before Wednesday:
     \[
     52
     \]
   - Problems completed on Wednesday:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13
     \]
   - Remaining problems after Wednesday:
     \[
     52 - 13 = 39
     \]

5. **Problems Left for Thursday**: 
   - After completing problems on Wednesday, Chris has 39 problems left to complete on Thursday.

Now, we can summarize the calculations:
- After Monday: 88 problems left.
- After Tuesday: 52 problems left.
- After Wednesday: 39 problems left.

Thus, the final answer is that Chris has **39 math problems left to complete on Thursday**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Chris has a total of 100 math problems to complete.
- On Monday, he completes 12 problems.
- On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday.
- On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems.

Step 1: Calculate the number of problems Chris completed on Tuesday.
Problems completed on Tuesday = 3 × 12 = 36 problems

Step 2: Calculate the ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to track the number of math problems Chris completes each day and determine how many are left by Thursday.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of problems completed on Monday.**

Chris completes 12 problems on Monday.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of problems completed on Tuesday.**

On Tuesday, Chris completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. Therefore, the number of problems completed on Tuesday is:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

**St...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Chris starts with 100 math problems.

On Monday, he completes 12 problems. This leaves him with 100 - 12 = 88 problems.

On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. This means he completes 3 * 12 = 36 problems on Tuesday. After Tuesday, he has 88 - 36 = 52 problems left.

On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems. This means he completes 52 / 4 = 13 problems on Wednesday. After Wednesday, he has 52 - 13 = 39 problems ...
