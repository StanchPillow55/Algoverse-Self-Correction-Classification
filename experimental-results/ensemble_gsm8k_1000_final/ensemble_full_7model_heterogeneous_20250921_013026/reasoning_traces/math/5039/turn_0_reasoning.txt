Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many large pizzas were sold given the total sales amount and the number of small pizzas sold.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( s \) be the number of small pizzas sold.
   - Let \( l \) be the number of large pizzas sold.
   - The price of a small pizza is $2.
   - The price of a large pizza is $8.
   - The total sales amount is $40.
   - We know that \( s = 8 \) (the number of small pizzas sold).

2. **Set up the equation for total sales:**
   The total revenue from selling small and large pizzas can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = (\text{Number of Small Pizzas} \times \text{Price of Small Pizza}) + (\text{Number of Large Pizzas} \times \text{Price of Large Pizza})
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   40 = (8 \times 2) + (l \times 8)
   \]

3. **Calculate the revenue from small pizzas:**
   \[
   8 \times 2 = 16
   \]
   So, the revenue from small pizzas is $16.

4. **Substitute this value back into the equation:**
   \[
   40 = 16 + (l \times 8)
   \]

5. **Isolate the term involving \( l \):**
   \[
   40 - 16 = l \times 8
   \]
   \[
   24 = l \times 8
   \]

6. **Solve for \( l \):**
   \[
   l = \frac{24}{8} = 3
   \]

Thus, the number of large pizzas sold is \( l = 3 \).

7. **Final answer:**
   The pizzeria sold **3 large pizzas**.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Small pizzas cost $2 each.
- Large pizzas cost $8 each.
- The total sales of pizzas is $40.
- 8 small pizzas were sold.

To find the number of large pizzas sold, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from the 8 small pizzas.
Revenue from small pizzas = 8 Ã— $2 = $16

Step 2: Calculate the remaining revenue that must have come from the large pizzas.
Remaining revenu...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how much money was made from the sale of the small pizzas. 

Since each small pizza is sold for $2 and 8 small pizzas were sold, the total amount of money made from the small pizzas is 2 * 8 = $16.

Next, we subtract the amount made from the small pizzas from the total amount made. 

So, $40 (total sales) - $16 (sales from small pizzas) = $24. 

This $24 is the amount of money made from the sale of the large pizzas.

Since each large pizza is s...
