=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of paint Mary used:**
   - Mary painted a dragon using 3 square feet of paint.

2. **Determine the amount of paint Mike used:**
   - Mike painted a castle using 2 square feet more paint than Mary used on her dragon.
   - Since Mary used 3 square feet, Mike used:
     \[
     3 \text{ square feet} + 2 \text{ square feet} = 5 \text{ square feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of paint used by Mary and Mike:**
   - Total paint used by both Mary and Mike is:
     \[
     3 \text{ square feet} + 5 \text{ square feet} = 8 \text{ square feet}
     \]

4. **Determine the total amount of paint available:**
   - The jar originally contained enough paint to cover 13 square feet.

5. **Calculate the remaining paint after Mary and Mike have painted:**
   - The remaining paint after they have painted is:
     \[
     13 \text{ square feet} - 8 \text{ square feet} = 5 \text{ square feet}
     \]

6. **Determine how much paint can be used to paint the sun:**
   - Since they can use the remaining paint to paint the sun, the amount of paint available for the sun is:
     \[
     5 \text{ square feet}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Mary and Mike can use **5 square feet** of paint to paint the sun.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Mary paints a dragon using 3 square feet of paint.
- Mike paints a castle using 2 square feet more paint than Mary used on her dragon.
- They both then work together to paint the biggest sun possible.
- The original jar of paint can cover 13 square feet.

Mike's paint usage = Mary's paint usage + 2 square feet
Mike's paint usage ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much paint is left for Mary and Mike to paint the sun after they have painted their respective objects.

1. **Determine the amount of paint Mary used:**
   - Mary paints a dragon using 3 square feet of paint.

2. **Determine the amount of paint Mike used:**
   - Mike paints a castle using 2 square feet more paint than Mary used.
   - Since Mary used 3 square feet, Mike uses \(3 + 2 = 5\) square feet of paint.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to figure out how much paint Mike used to paint his castle. We know that Mike used 2 square feet more paint than Mary, who used 3 square feet. So, Mike used 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 square feet of paint.

Next, we need to figure out how much paint was left in the jar after Mary and Mike painted their pictures. We know that the jar originally contained 13 square feet of paint, and that Mary used 3 square feet and Mike used 5 square feet. So, the amount of paint le...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Mary paints a dragon using 3 square feet of paint.
- Mike paints a castle using 2 square feet more paint than Mary used.
- The jar originally had enough paint to cover 13 square feet.
- They use the remaining paint to paint the biggest sun possible.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of paint Mike used for the castle.
Mike's paint usage = Mary's paint usage + 2 square feet
