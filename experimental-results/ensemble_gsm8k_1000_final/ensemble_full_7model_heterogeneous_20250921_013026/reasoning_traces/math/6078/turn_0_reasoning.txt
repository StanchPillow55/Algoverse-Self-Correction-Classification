=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate how many pages Cyrus has written over the four days and then determine how many more pages he needs to write to reach his goal of 500 pages.

**Step 1: Calculate pages written each day.**

- **Day 1:** Cyrus writes 25 pages.
  
  \[
  \text{Pages on Day 1} = 25
  \]

- **Day 2:** He writes twice the amount he wrote on the first day.
  
  \[
  \text{Pages on Day 2} = 2 \times 25 = 50
  \]

- **Day 3:** He writes twice the amount he wrote on the second day.
  
  \[
  \text{Pages on Day 3} = 2 \times 50 = 100
  \]

- **Day 4:** He gets writer's block and writes only 10 pages.
  
  \[
  \text{Pages on Day 4} = 10
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total pages written over the four days.**

Now we add the pages written each day to find the total:

\[
\text{Total pages written} = \text{Pages on Day 1} + \text{Pages on Day 2} + \text{Pages on Day 3} + \text{Pages on Day 4}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total pages written} = 25 + 50 + 100 + 10
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. \(25 + 50 = 75\)
2. \(75 + 100 = 175\)
3. \(175 + 10 = 185\)

Thus, the total number of pages Cyrus has written is:

\[
\text{Total pages written} = 185
\]

**Step 3: Calculate how many more pages he needs to write.**

Cyrus's goal is to write a total of 500 pages. To find out how many more pages he needs to write, we subtract the total pages he has already written from his goal:

\[
\text{Pages needed} = 500 - \text{Total pages written}
\]

Substituting the total pages written:

\[
\text{Pages needed} = 500 - 185
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Pages needed} = 315
\]

**Final Answer:**

Cyrus needs to write **315 more pages** to complete his book.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Cyrus has been contracted to write a 500-page book.
- On the first day, he writes 25 pages.
- On the second day, he writes twice the amount he wrote on the first day.
- On the third day, he writes twice the amount he wrote on the second day.
- On the fourth day, he writes 10 pages.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pages written on each day.
Day 1: 25 pages
Day 2: 2 × 25 = 50 pages...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pages Cyrus has written over the first four days and then subtract that total from the 500 pages he needs to complete. Let's go through each day step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - Cyrus writes 25 pages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - He writes twice the amount he wrote on the first day.
   - Calculation: \( 2 \times 25 = 50 \) pages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - He writes twice the amount he wrote on the second day.
   - Calcu...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how many pages Cyrus wrote each day.

On the first day, he wrote 25 pages.

On the second day, he wrote twice the amount of the first day, which is 2 * 25 = 50 pages.

On the third day, he wrote twice the amount of the second day, which is 2 * 50 = 100 pages.

On the fourth day, he wrote 10 pages.

So, in total, Cyrus has written 25 + 50 + 100 + 10 = 185 pages.

The total number of pages he needs to write is 500. So, to find out how many more pages ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Cyrus needs to write a 500-page book.
   * On the first day, he writes 25 pages.
   * On the second day, he writes twice the amount of the first day.
   * On the third day, he writes twice the amount of the second day.
   * On the fourth day, he writes only 10 pages.

2. Calculate the number of pages written on the second day:
   * Second day pages = 2 × First da...
