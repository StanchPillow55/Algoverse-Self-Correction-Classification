=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of pets Cindy has**: 
   According to the problem, Cindy has 4 pets.

   \[
   \text{Cindy's pets} = 4
   \]

2. **Determine the number of pets Marcia has**: 
   The problem states that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. Since Cindy has 4 pets, we can calculate Marcia's pets as follows:

   \[
   \text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of pets Jan has**: 
   The problem states that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Since we found that Marcia has 6 pets, we can calculate Jan's pets as follows:

   \[
   \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times \text{Marcia's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pets**: 
   Now that we have the number of pets for each person, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of pets each person has:

   \[
   \text{Total pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Jan's pets}
   \]

   Substituting the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Total pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have together is:

   \[
   \boxed{28}
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many pets Marcia has. Since Cindy has four pets and Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, we can add two to Cindy's number of pets to find out how many pets Marcia has. 

4 (Cindy's pets) + 2 = 6 pets (Marcia's pets)

Next, we need to find out how many pets Jan has. Since Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, we can multiply Marcia's number of pets by three to find out how many pets Jan has.

6 (Marcia's pets) * 3 = 18 pets (Jan's...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Cindy has 4 pets.
   * Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
   * Jan has 3 times the number of pets as Marcia.

2. Find the number of pets Marcia has:
   * Marcia's pets = Cindy's pets + 2
