=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many pages Melody will read tomorrow, we need to calculate one-fourth of the number of pages she needs to read for each class. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of pages for each class:**
   - English: 20 pages
   - Science: 16 pages
   - Civics: 8 pages
   - Chinese: 12 pages

2. **Calculate one-fourth of the pages for each class:**
   - For English:
     \[
     \text{Pages for English tomorrow} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ pages}
     \]
   - For Science:
     \[
     \text{Pages for Science tomorrow} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \text{ pages}
     \]
   - For Civics:
     \[
     \text{Pages for Civics tomorrow} = \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ pages}
     \]
   - For Chinese:
     \[
     \text{Pages for Chinese tomorrow} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ pages}
     \]

3. **Sum the pages she will read tomorrow:**
   Now, we add the pages she will read for each class:
   \[
   \text{Total pages tomorrow} = 5 + 4 + 2 + 3
   \]

   Let's perform the addition step-by-step:
   - First, add the pages for English and Science:
     \[
     5 + 4 = 9
     \]
   - Next, add the pages for Civics:
     \[
     9 + 2 = 11
     \]
   - Finally, add the pages for Chinese:
     \[
     11 + 3 = 14
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of pages Melody will read tomorrow is:
   \[
   \boxed{14}
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to find out one-fourth of the number of pages Melody needs to read for each class and then add them all together.

For her English class, she needs to read 20 pages. One-fourth of 20 is 20/4 = 5 pages.

For her Science class, she needs to read 16 pages. One-fourth of 16 is 16/4 = 4 pages.

For her Civics class, she needs to read 8 pages. One-fourth of 8 is 8/4 = 2 pages.

For her Chinese class, she needs to read 12 pages. One-fourth of 12 is...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Melody needs to read:
     - 20 pages for English
     - 16 pages for Science
     - 8 pages for Civics
     - 12 pages for Chinese
   * She will read one-fourth (1/4) of the pages for each class tomorrow.

2. Calculate the number of pages Melody will read for each class tomorrow:
   * English: 1/4 of 20 pages
     - 20 รท 4 = 5 pages
   * Science: 1/4 of 16 pages
