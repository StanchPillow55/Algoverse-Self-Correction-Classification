Final Answer: To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save for the down payment on a car, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total hourly earnings**:
   - Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips.
   - Total hourly earnings = Wages + Tips
   \[
   \text{Total hourly earnings} = 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

2. **Calculate weekly earnings**:
   - Janet works 40 hours a week.
   - Weekly earnings = Total hourly earnings × Hours worked per week
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week}
   \]

3. **Determine the down payment needed**:
   - The cost of the car is $10,000.
   - Janet wants to save 20% of the cost for the down payment.
   - Down payment = 20% of $10,000
   \[
   \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of weeks needed to save the down payment**:
   - To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings.
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Weekly earnings}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Thus, Janet needs to work for **2 weeks** to save the down payment for the car.

Final answer: **2 weeks**.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much Janet earns in total per hour. She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25.

Next, let's calculate how much she earns in a week. If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are $25 per hour * 40 hours = $1000.

Now, let's calculate how much she needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10000 car, so the down payment is 20/100 * $10000 = ...
