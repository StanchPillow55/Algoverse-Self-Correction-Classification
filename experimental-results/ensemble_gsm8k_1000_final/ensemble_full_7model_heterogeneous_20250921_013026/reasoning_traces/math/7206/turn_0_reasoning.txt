=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let \( x \) be the total number of chocolates in the box. According to the problem, half of the chocolates have nuts and half do not. Therefore, we can express the number of chocolates with nuts and without nuts as follows:

- Chocolates with nuts: \( \frac{x}{2} \)
- Chocolates without nuts: \( \frac{x}{2} \)

Next, we need to determine how many chocolates are eaten by the students. The problem states that:

- The students eat 80% of the chocolates with nuts.
- The students eat half of the chocolates without nuts.

Now, let's calculate the number of chocolates eaten:

1. **Chocolates with nuts eaten:**
   \[
   \text{Chocolates with nuts eaten} = 0.8 \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{0.8x}{2} = 0.4x
   \]

2. **Chocolates without nuts eaten:**
   \[
   \text{Chocolates without nuts eaten} = 0.5 \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{0.5x}{2} = 0.25x
   \]

Now, we can find the total number of chocolates eaten by adding the chocolates eaten with nuts and without nuts:

\[
\text{Total chocolates eaten} = 0.4x + 0.25x = 0.65x
\]

Next, we can determine how many chocolates are left after the students have eaten some. The total number of chocolates left is given as 28. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\text{Chocolates left} = \text{Total chocolates} - \text{Total chocolates eaten}
\]
\[
28 = x - 0.65x
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
28 = 0.35x
\]

To find \( x \), we can solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.35:

\[
x = \frac{28}{0.35}
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
x = 28 \div 0.35 = 28 \times \frac{100}{35} = 28 \times \frac{20}{7} = \frac{560}{7} = 80
\]

Thus, the total number of chocolates in the box is:

\[
\boxed{80}
\] 

To verify, we can check the calculations:

- Chocolates with nuts: \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \)
- Chocolates without nuts: \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \)

Chocolates eaten:

- With nuts: \( 0.8 \times 40 = 32 \)
- Without nuts: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \)

Total eaten:

\[
32 + 20 = 52
\]

Chocolates left:

\[
80 - 52 = 28
\]

The calculations confirm that the answer is correct. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{80}
\]

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): Let \( x \) be the total number of chocolates in the box. According to the problem, half of the chocolates have nuts and half do not. Therefore, we can express the number of chocolates with nuts and without nuts as follows:

- Chocolates with nuts: \( \frac{x}{2} \)
- Chocolates without nuts: \( \frac{x}{2} \)

Next, we need to determine how many chocolates are eaten by the students. The problem states that:

- The students eat 80% of the chocolates with nuts.
- The...

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the given information to find the total number of chocolates in the box.

Given information:
- Half of the chocolates have nuts, and half do not.
- The students eat 80% of the chocolates with nuts and half of the chocolates without nuts.
- There are 28 chocolates left.

Let's represent the total number of chocolates in the box as x.

Step 1: Find the number of chocolates with nuts and without nuts.
...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of chocolates in the box initially. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of chocolates in the box.
   - Since half of the chocolates have nuts and half do not, the number of chocolates with nuts is \( \frac{x}{2} \) and the number without nuts is also \( \frac{x}{2} \).

2. **Calculate Chocolates Eaten:**
   - **Chocolates with Nuts:**
     - ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the total number of chocolates as X. 

Since half of the chocolates have nuts and half do not, there are X/2 chocolates with nuts and X/2 chocolates without nuts.

According to the problem, the students eat 80% of the chocolates with nuts and half of the chocolates without nuts. This means that 20% of the chocolates with nuts and half of the chocolates without nuts are left uneaten.

So, the number of uneaten chocolates with nuts is 20% of X/2, which is 0.20 ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. To find out how many chocolates were originally in the box, we need to work backwards from the number of chocolates left.

Given:
- Half of the chocolates have nuts, and half do not.
- 80% of the chocolates with nuts were eaten.
- Half of the chocolates without nuts were eaten.
- There are 28 chocolates left.

Step 1: Let's express the remaining chocolates in terms of the original number of chocolates.
- ...
