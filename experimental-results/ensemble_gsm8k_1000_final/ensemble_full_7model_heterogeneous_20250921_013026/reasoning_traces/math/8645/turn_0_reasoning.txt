=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will calculate the number of clouds Alice counts each day from Monday to Friday, starting with the number of clouds she sees on Monday and doubling that number for each subsequent day.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
   \[
   \text{Clouds on Monday} = 3
   \]

2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Monday.
   \[
   \text{Clouds on Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Clouds on Monday} = 2 \times 3 = 6
   \]

3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Clouds on Wednesday} = 2 \times \text{Clouds on Tuesday} = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday.
   \[
   \text{Clouds on Thursday} = 2 \times \text{Clouds on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24
   \]

5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Thursday.
   \[
   \text{Clouds on Friday} = 2 \times \text{Clouds on Thursday} = 2 \times 24 = 48
   \]

Now, we will sum the total number of clouds counted from Monday to Friday:
\[
\text{Total clouds} = \text{Clouds on Monday} + \text{Clouds on Tuesday} + \text{Clouds on Wednesday} + \text{Clouds on Thursday} + \text{Clouds on Friday}
\]
Substituting the values we calculated:
\[
\text{Total clouds} = 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Now, we will perform the addition step by step:
- First, add Monday and Tuesday:
  \[
  3 + 6 = 9
  \]
- Next, add Wednesday:
  \[
  9 + 12 = 21
  \]
- Then, add Thursday:
  \[
  21 + 24 = 45
  \]
- Finally, add Friday:
  \[
  45 + 48 = 93
  \]

Thus, the total number of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is:
\[
\text{Total clouds} = 93
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{93}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On Monday, Alice counted 3 puffs of clouds.
- Each day after Monday through Friday, she saw double the number of clouds as the day before.

To find the total number of clouds she counted across all five days, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and then add them up.

Step 1: Calculate the number of clouds for each day.
Monday: 3 clouds
Tuesday: 3 × 2 = 6 clouds

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of clouds Alice counts each day from Monday to Friday and then sum these amounts to find the total number of clouds she counted over the week.

Let's break it down day by day:

1. **Monday:**
   - Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Each day, the number of clouds doubles from the previous day.
   - Therefore, on Tuesday, Alice counts \(2 \times 3 = 6\) puffs of clouds.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - The nu...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Alice sees 3 puffs of clouds on Monday. 

On Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds she saw on Monday. So, she sees 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 clouds on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds she saw on Tuesday. So, she sees 2 * 6 = <<2*6=12>>12 clouds on Wednesday.

On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds she saw on Wednesday. So, she sees 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 clouds on Thursday.

On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds she saw on...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find the total number of clouds Alice counted during her lunch breaks from Monday to Friday.

Given:
- On Monday, Alice counted 3 puffs of clouds.
- Each day after Monday, she saw double the number of clouds as the day before.

Step 1: Determine the number of clouds Alice counted each day.
Monday: 3 clouds
Tuesday: 3 × 2 = 6 clouds
Wednesday: 6 × 2 = 12 clouds
Thursday: 12 × 2 = 24 clouds
