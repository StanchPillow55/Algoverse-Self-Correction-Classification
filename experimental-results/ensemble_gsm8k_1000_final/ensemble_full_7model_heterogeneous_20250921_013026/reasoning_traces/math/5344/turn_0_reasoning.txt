=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of students who wish to go on both the skiing trip and the scavenger hunting trip.

1. **Identify the number of students for the scavenger hunting trip**: 
   We are given that there are 4000 students who wish to go on the scavenger hunting trip.

   \[
   \text{Number of students for scavenger hunting trip} = 4000
   \]

2. **Determine the number of students for the skiing trip**: 
   According to the problem, the number of students who wish to go on the skiing trip is twice the number of students who wish to go on the scavenger hunting trip. 

   To find the number of students for the skiing trip, we multiply the number of students for the scavenger hunting trip by 2:

   \[
   \text{Number of students for skiing trip} = 2 \times \text{Number of students for scavenger hunting trip}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of students for skiing trip} = 2 \times 4000 = 8000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of students**: 
   Now, we need to find the total number of students who wish to go on both trips. We do this by adding the number of students for the skiing trip to the number of students for the scavenger hunting trip:

   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of students for skiing trip} + \text{Number of students for scavenger hunting trip}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = 8000 + 4000 = 12000
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total number of students who wish to go on the skiing trip and the scavenger hunting trip is:

   \[
   \boxed{12000}
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that the number of students who wish to go on a skiing trip is twice as many as those who wish to go on a scavenger hunting trip. 

Given that there are 4000 students who wish to go on the scavenger hunting trip, we can find the number of students who wish to go on the skiing trip by multiplying this number by 2. 

So, the number of students who wish to go on the skiing trip is 4000 * 2 = 8000 students.

To find the total number of students, we add the ...
