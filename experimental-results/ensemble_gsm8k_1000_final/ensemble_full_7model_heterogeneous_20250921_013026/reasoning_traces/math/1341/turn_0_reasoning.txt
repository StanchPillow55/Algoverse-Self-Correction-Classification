=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many questions Sasha can complete in 2 hours and then find out how many questions she still needs to complete from the total of 60 questions.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of questions Sasha can complete in 2 hours.**

Sasha completes 15 questions in 1 hour. Therefore, in 2 hours, the number of questions she can complete is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Questions completed in 2 hours} = \text{Questions per hour} \times \text{Number of hours}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Questions completed in 2 hours} = 15 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many questions are left to complete.**

Sasha has a total of 60 questions to complete. After working for 2 hours, she has completed 30 questions. To find out how many questions she still needs to complete, we subtract the number of questions completed from the total number of questions:

\[
\text{Questions remaining} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Questions remaining} = 60 \, \text{questions} - 30 \, \text{questions} = 30 \, \text{questions}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Sasha still needs to complete **30 questions**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sasha can complete 15 questions per hour.
- Sasha has 60 questions to complete.
- Sasha works for 2 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of questions Sasha can complete in 2 hours.
Questions completed per hour × Number of hours = Total questions completed
15 questions/hour × 2 hours = 30 questions

Step 2: Calculate the number of questions Sasha still needs to complete.
Total questions t...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many questions Sasha can complete in the given time and then find out how many questions are left for her to complete.

**Step 1: Determine the number of questions Sasha can complete in one hour.**

Sasha can complete 15 questions in one hour.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of questions Sasha can complete in 2 hours.**

Since Sasha completes 15 questions per hour, in 2 hours she would complete:
\[ 15 \text{ questions/hour}...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many questions Sasha can complete in the given time. Since she can complete 15 questions in an hour, in 2 hours she can complete 15 questions/hour * 2 hours = 30 questions.

Next, we subtract the number of questions she has completed from the total number of questions to find out how many questions she still needs to complete. 

So, 60 questions - 30 questions = 30 questions.

Therefore, Sasha still needs to complete 30 questions.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. To find out how many questions Sasha still needs to complete, we need to calculate the number of questions she can complete in 2 hours and subtract that from the total number of questions she has.

Given:
- Sasha can complete 15 questions an hour.
- She has 60 questions to complete.
- She works for 2 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the number of questions Sasha can complete in 2 hours.
