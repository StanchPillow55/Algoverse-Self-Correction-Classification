=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the area of Bob's vegetable garden, we need to determine its dimensions based on the dimensions of his property.

1. **Determine the width of the garden:**
   - Bob wants the width of the garden to be about an eighth of the width of his property.
   - The width of his property is 1000 feet.
   - To find the width of the garden, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Width of garden} = \frac{1}{8} \times \text{Width of property} = \frac{1}{8} \times 1000 \text{ feet}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Width of garden} = 125 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the length of the garden:**
   - Bob wants the length of the garden to be about a tenth of the length of his property.
   - The length of his property is 2250 feet.
   - To find the length of the garden, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Length of garden} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Length of property} = \frac{1}{10} \times 2250 \text{ feet}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Length of garden} = 225 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the area of the garden:**
   - The area of a rectangle (which is the shape of the garden) is calculated by multiplying the width by the length.
   - Using the dimensions we found:
     \[
     \text{Area of garden} = \text{Width of garden} \times \text{Length of garden} = 125 \text{ feet} \times 225 \text{ feet}
     \]
   - Now we perform the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Area of garden} = 125 \times 225
     \]
   - To calculate \( 125 \times 225 \):
     \[
     125 \times 225 = 125 \times (200 + 25) = 125 \times 200 + 125 \times 25
     \]
     \[
     125 \times 200 = 25000
     \]
     \[
     125 \times 25 = 3125
     \]
     \[
     125 \times 225 = 25000 + 3125 = 28125
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - The area of Bob's vegetable garden is:
     \[
     \text{Area of garden} = 28125 \text{ square feet}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{28125} \text{ square feet}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bob's property is 1000 feet wide and 2250 feet long.
- He wants the width of the garden to be about an eighth (1/8) of the width of his property.
- He wants the length of the garden to be about a tenth (1/10) of the length of his property.

Step 1: Calculate the width of the garden.
Width of the garden = 1/8 of the width of the property
Width of the garden = 1/8 ร 1000 feet = 125 feet

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine the area of Bob's vegetable garden, we need to calculate both the width and the length of the garden based on the given dimensions of his property.

### Step 1: Calculate the Width of the Garden
Bob wants the width of the garden to be about an eighth of the width of his property. The width of his property is 1000 feet.

\[
\text{Width of the garden} = \frac{1}{8} \times 1000 \text{ feet}
\]

Perform the calculation:

\[
\text{Width of the garden} = \frac{100...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find the dimensions of the garden. 

Bob wants the width of the garden to be an eighth of the width of his property. His property is 1000 feet wide, so we divide 1000 by 8 to find the width of the garden. 

1000 รท 8 = 125 feet

So, the width of the garden is 125 feet. 

Next, Bob wants the length of the garden to be a tenth of the length of his property. His property is 2250 feet long, so we divide 2250 by 10 to find the length of the garden.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Bob's property is 1000 feet wide and 2250 feet long.
   * The garden's width will be about 1/8 of the property's width.
   * The garden's length will be 1/10 of the property's length.

2. Calculate the width of the garden:
   * Property width = 1000 feet
   * Garden width = 1/8 of the property width
   * Garden width = 1000 feet รท 8
   * Garden width = 125 feet
