=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break down the information given step by step and calculate the number of requests for each genre of music.

1. **Total Song Requests**: Ziggy gets 30 song requests every night.

2. **Electropop Requests**: Half of the total requests are for electropop.
   \[
   \text{Electropop requests} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]

3. **Dance Music Requests**: A third of the electropop requests are for dance music.
   \[
   \text{Dance music requests} = \frac{15}{3} = 5
   \]

4. **Rock Music Requests**: We know that there are 5 requests for rock music.
   \[
   \text{Rock requests} = 5
   \]

5. **Oldies Requests**: The requests for oldies are three less than the rock requests.
   \[
   \text{Oldies requests} = 5 - 3 = 2
   \]

6. **DJ’s Choice Requests**: Ziggy plays a DJ’s choice song half the number of times he plays an oldie.
   \[
   \text{DJ's choice requests} = \frac{2}{2} = 1
   \]

Now, we will sum up all the requests we have calculated so far:

- Electropop: 15
- Dance music: 5
- Rock: 5
- Oldies: 2
- DJ's choice: 1

Calculating the total of these requests:
\[
\text{Total requests accounted for} = 15 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 28
\]

Since Ziggy typically gets 30 requests, we can find the number of rap song requests by subtracting the total accounted requests from the total requests:
\[
\text{Rap requests} = 30 - 28 = 2
\]

Thus, the typical number of rap songs Ziggy gets requested every night is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's break down the problem and calculate the number of song requests for each genre.

Ziggy gets 30 song requests every night. Half of these are electropop. So, the number of electropop songs is 30/2 = 15 songs.

A third of the electropop songs are dance music. So, the number of dance songs is 15/3 = 5 songs.

Ziggy gets 5 song requests for rock music.

The number of oldies song requests is three less than the rock requests. So, the number of oldies songs is 5 - ...
