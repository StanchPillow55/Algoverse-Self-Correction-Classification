=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many nights Nelly needs to babysit to afford the pizza for herself and her 14 friends, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of people**: 
   Nelly has 14 friends, so the total number of people is:
   \[
   1 \text{ (Nelly)} + 14 \text{ (friends)} = 15 \text{ people}
   \]

2. **Determine how many pizzas are needed**: 
   Each pizza can feed 3 people. To find out how many pizzas are needed for 15 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can feed:
   \[
   \text{Number of pizzas} = \frac{15 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people per pizza}} = 5 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the pizzas**: 
   Each pizza costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 5 pizzas is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pizza} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how much Nelly earns from babysitting**: 
   Nelly earns $4 for each night she babysits.

5. **Calculate the number of nights Nelly needs to babysit**: 
   To find out how many nights she needs to babysit to earn $60, we divide the total cost by her earnings per night:
   \[
   \text{Number of nights} = \frac{60 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars per night}} = 15 \text{ nights}
   \]

Thus, Nelly will need to babysit for **15 nights** to afford the pizzas for herself and her friends.

Final answer: **15 nights**.

Given information:
- Nelly wants to buy pizza for herself and 14 friends, so 15 people total.
- Each pizza costs $12 and can feed 3 people.
- Nelly earns $4 per night babysitting the neighbors' kids.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizzas needed.
Total number of people / Number of people per pizza = Total number of pizzas needed
15 people / 3 people per pizza = 5 pizzas needed

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pizzas Nelly needs to buy and how much money she needs to earn to afford them. Then, we'll calculate how many nights she needs to babysit to earn that amount.

### Step 1: Determine the Total Number of People

Nelly wants to buy pizza for herself and her 14 friends. Therefore, the total number of people is:

\[ 1 \text{ (Nelly)} + 14 \text{ (friends)} = 15 \text{ people} \]

### Step 2: Determine the Number of Pizzas N...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many pizzas Nelly needs to buy. She has 14 friends and herself to feed, so there are 15 people in total. Each pizza can feed 3 people, so we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can feed.

15 people / 3 people per pizza = 5 pizzas

Next, we need to determine how much all the pizzas will cost. Each pizza costs $12, so we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost of each pizza.

5 pizzas * $12 per pizza = $60
