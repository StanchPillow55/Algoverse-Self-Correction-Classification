=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the selling price of the SUV**: 
   - We know that the SUV is sold for twice the price of the coupe.
   - The price of the coupe is $30,000.
   - Therefore, the price of the SUV is:
     \[
     \text{Price of SUV} = 2 \times \text{Price of Coupe} = 2 \times 30,000 = 60,000
     \]

2. **Calculate the total sales amount**:
   - Now we will add the selling prices of both vehicles to find the total sales amount.
   - Total sales amount is:
     \[
     \text{Total Sales} = \text{Price of Coupe} + \text{Price of SUV} = 30,000 + 60,000 = 90,000
     \]

3. **Calculate Melissa's commission**:
   - Melissa earns a commission of 2% on the total sales.
   - To find the commission, we will calculate 2% of the total sales amount.
   - The commission can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Commission} = 0.02 \times \text{Total Sales} = 0.02 \times 90,000
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Commission} = 0.02 \times 90,000 = 1,800
     \]

4. **State the final answer**:
   - Therefore, the amount of money Melissa made from these sales is:
     \[
     \boxed{1800}
     \] 

In conclusion, Melissa made $1,800 from her sales of the coupe and the SUV.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how much the SUV costs. Since it's twice as much as the coupe, we multiply the price of the coupe by 2:

$30,000 * 2 = $60,000

So, the SUV costs $60,000.

Next, let's find out the total cost of the coupe and the SUV. We add the price of the coupe and the SUV:

$30,000 + $60,000 = $90,000

So, the total cost of the coupe and the SUV is $90,000.
