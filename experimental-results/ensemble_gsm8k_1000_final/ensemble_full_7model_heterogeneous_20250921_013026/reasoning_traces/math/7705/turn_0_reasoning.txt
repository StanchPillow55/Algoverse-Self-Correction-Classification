=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of insects in the garden, which includes both ants and bugs.

1. **Identify the number of ants**: 
   The problem states that there are 50 ants in the garden.

   \[
   \text{Number of ants} = 50
   \]

2. **Determine the number of bugs**: 
   According to the problem, there are half as many bugs as there are ants. To find the number of bugs, we take half of the number of ants.

   \[
   \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50
   \]

   Now, we perform the calculation:

   \[
   \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of insects**: 
   The total number of insects in the garden is the sum of the number of ants and the number of bugs.

   \[
   \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs}
   \]

   Substituting the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Total number of insects} = 50 + 25
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition:

   \[
   \text{Total number of insects} = 75
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   The total number of insects in the garden is 

   \[
   \boxed{75}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden.
- There were 50 ants in the garden.

Step 1: Find the number of bugs in the garden.
Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can use the following equation:
Number of bugs = 1/2 × Number of ants
Number of bugs = 1/2 × 50 = 25 bugs

Step 2: Find the total number of insects in the garden.
Total number of insects = Number of ants + Numb...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of insects in the garden, which includes both ants and bugs.

1. **Identify the number of ants:**
   - We are given that there are 50 ants in the garden.

2. **Determine the number of bugs:**
   - The problem states that there are half as many bugs as there are ants. 
   - Since there are 50 ants, the number of bugs is half of 50.
   - Calculate the number of bugs:
     \[
     \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{50}...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden. This means that the number of bugs is half the number of ants. 

If there were 50 ants, to find the number of bugs, we divide the number of ants by 2. 

So, the number of bugs is 50/2 = 25 bugs.

The total number of insects in the garden is the sum of the number of ants and the number of bugs. 

So, the total number of insects is 50 ants + 25 bugs = 75 insects.

Therefore, there were 75 insects in the garden.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden.
- There were 50 ants in the garden.

Step 1: Determine the number of bugs in the garden.
Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can express the number of bugs as follows:
Number of bugs = 1/2 × Number of ants
Number of bugs = 1/2 × 50
Number of bugs = 25

Step 2: Calculate the total number of insects in the garden.
Total number o...
