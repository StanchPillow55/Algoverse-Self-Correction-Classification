=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many balls Matthias has without holes in them, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of each type of ball Matthias has:**
   - Soccer balls: 40
   - Basketballs: 15

2. **Identify how many of each type of ball has a hole:**
   - Soccer balls with holes: 30
   - Basketballs with holes: 7

3. **Calculate the number of balls without holes for each type:**
   - For soccer balls:
     \[
     \text{Soccer balls without holes} = \text{Total soccer balls} - \text{Soccer balls with holes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Soccer balls without holes} = 40 - 30 = 10
     \]

   - For basketballs:
     \[
     \text{Basketballs without holes} = \text{Total basketballs} - \text{Basketballs with holes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Basketballs without holes} = 15 - 7 = 8
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of balls without holes:**
   \[
   \text{Total balls without holes} = \text{Soccer balls without holes} + \text{Basketballs without holes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total balls without holes} = 10 + 8 = 18
   \]

Thus, the total number of balls Matthias has without holes in them is **18**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Matthias has 40 soccer balls and 15 basketballs.
- 30 soccer balls and 7 basketballs have a hole in them.

To find the total number of balls without holes, we need to subtract the number of balls with holes from the total number of balls.

Step 1: Find the total number of balls Matthias has.
Total number of balls = Number of soccer balls + Number of basketballs
Total number of balls = 40 + 15 ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how many balls Matthias has without holes, we need to consider both the soccer balls and the basketballs separately, and then combine the results.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of soccer balls without holes.**

- Matthias has a total of 40 soccer balls.
- Out of these, 30 soccer balls have a hole in them.

To find the number of soccer balls without holes, we subtract the number of soccer balls with holes from the total number of soccer balls:

\[
40 \text{...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Matthias has 40 soccer balls and 15 basketballs, which totals to 40 + 15 = <<40+15=55>>55 balls.

Out of these, 30 soccer balls and 7 basketballs have holes in them, which totals to 30 + 7 = <<30+7=37>>37 balls.

To find out how many balls Matthias has without holes, we subtract the number of balls with holes from the total number of balls. 

So, 55 - 37 = <<55-37=18>>18 balls.

Therefore, Matthias has 18 balls without holes in them.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Matthias has 40 soccer balls.
- Matthias has 15 basketballs.
- 30 soccer balls have a hole in them.
- 7 basketballs have a hole in them.

Step 1: Calculate the number of soccer balls without holes.
Soccer balls without holes = Total soccer balls - Soccer balls with holes
Soccer balls without holes = 40 - 30 = 10

Step 2: Calculate the number of basketballs without holes.
Basketballs ...
