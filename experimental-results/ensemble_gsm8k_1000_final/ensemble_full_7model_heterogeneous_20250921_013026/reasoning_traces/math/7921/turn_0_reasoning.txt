=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost per sneaker**:
   The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576. To find the cost per sneaker, we divide the total cost by the number of sneakers:

   \[
   \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of sneakers}} = \frac{576}{48} = 12
   \]

   So, each sneaker costs $12.

2. **Calculate the revenue from the flash sale**:
   The salesman sold 17 sneakers at a price of $20 each. To find the total revenue from this sale, we multiply the number of sneakers sold by the price per sneaker:

   \[
   \text{Revenue from flash sale} = \text{Number of sneakers sold} \times \text{Price per sneaker} = 17 \times 20 = 340
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sneakers sold to the department store**:
   After selling 17 sneakers, the number of sneakers remaining is:

   \[
   \text{Remaining sneakers} = \text{Total sneakers} - \text{Sneakers sold at flash sale} = 48 - 17 = 31
   \]

4. **Calculate the revenue from the department store**:
   The remaining 31 sneakers were sold to a department store for $25 each. To find the total revenue from this sale, we multiply the number of sneakers sold by the price per sneaker:

   \[
   \text{Revenue from department store} = \text{Number of sneakers sold} \times \text{Price per sneaker} = 31 \times 25 = 775
   \]

5. **Calculate the total revenue**:
   Now, we add the revenue from both sales to find the total revenue:

   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from flash sale} + \text{Revenue from department store} = 340 + 775 = 1115
   \]

6. **Calculate the total cost**:
   The total cost of the sneakers was $576, as given.

7. **Calculate the profit**:
   Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539
   \]

Thus, the salesman's profit is:

\[
\boxed{539}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. This means that each sneaker cost him $576 / 48 = $12.

On Monday, he sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so he made 17 * $20 = $<<17*20=340>>340.

The rest of the sneakers, which is 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers, were sold for $25 each. So he made 31 * $25 = $<<31*25=775>>775 from these sales.

So in total, the salesman made $340 + $775 = $<<340+775=1115>>1115 from selling the sneakers.

Since the sneakers cost him $576, his profit was $1115 ...
