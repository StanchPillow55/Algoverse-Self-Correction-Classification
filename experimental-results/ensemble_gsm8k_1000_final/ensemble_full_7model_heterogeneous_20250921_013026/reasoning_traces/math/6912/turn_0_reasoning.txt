Final Answer: To find out how much a can of tuna costs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount Sam spent**: 
   Sam paid $20 and received $5.50 in change. Therefore, the amount he actually spent is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent} = \text{Amount paid} - \text{Change received} = 20 - 5.50 = 14.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Convert the amount spent to cents**: 
   Since we want to find the cost per can in cents, we convert dollars to cents:
   \[
   14.50 \text{ dollars} = 14.50 \times 100 = 1450 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Determine the total discount from the coupons**: 
   Sam has 5 coupons, each giving a discount of 25 cents. Therefore, the total discount from the coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Total discount} = 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the cans before applying the discount**: 
   Let \( x \) be the cost of one can of tuna in cents. Since Sam bought 9 cans, the total cost before the discount is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 9x
   \]

   After applying the discount, the amount Sam actually spent (1450 cents) can be expressed as:
   \[
   9x - 125 = 1450
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**: 
   Rearranging the equation gives:
   \[
   9x = 1450 + 125
   \]
   \[
   9x = 1575
   \]
   Now, divide both sides by 9 to find \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{1575}{9} = 175
   \]

6. **Conclusion**: 
   The cost of one can of tuna is 175 cents.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{175}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sam got 9 cans of tuna at the supermarket.
- He had 5 coupons, each worth 25 cents off a single can.
- He paid $20 and got $5.50 in change.

To find the cost of a single can of tuna, we need to calculate the total amount Sam paid for the 9 cans, then subtract the discount from the coupons, and finally divide the remaining amount by the number of cans.

Step 1: Calculate the total ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of a single can of tuna in cents. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total amount Sam paid before using the coupons:**

   Sam paid $20 and received $5.50 in change. Therefore, the total amount he actually spent on the tuna cans is:
   \[
   20 - 5.50 = 14.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Convert the total amount spent to cents:**

   Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert $14.50 to ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how much Sam spent on the tuna. We know he paid $20 and received $5.50 in change, so we subtract the change from the amount paid to find the total spent:

$20 - $5.50 = $14.50

Next, we need to account for the coupons. Each coupon is worth 25 cents and he used 5 coupons, so we multiply the number of coupons by the value of each coupon to find the total value of the coupons:

5 coupons * $0.25/coupon = $1.25

Since the coupons reduced the amount...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Sam bought 9 cans of tuna.
   * He had 5 coupons, each giving a 25 cent discount on a single can.
   * He paid $20 and received $5.50 in change.

2. Calculate the total discount from the coupons:
   * Discount per coupon = 25 cents
   * Number of coupons = 5
   * Total discount = 25 cents Ã— 5
   * Total discount = 125 cents or $1.25

3. Calculate the total amount Sam s...
