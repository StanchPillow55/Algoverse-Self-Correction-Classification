=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of votes for the witch cake**:
   - We are given that 7 people voted for the witch cake.
   \[
   \text{Votes for witch cake} = 7
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of votes for the unicorn cake**:
   - According to the problem, three times as many people voted for the unicorn cake compared to the witch cake. Therefore, we can calculate the votes for the unicorn cake as follows:
   \[
   \text{Votes for unicorn cake} = 3 \times \text{Votes for witch cake} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of votes for the dragon cake**:
   - The problem states that the number of votes for the dragon cake was 25 more than the number of votes for the witch cake. Thus, we can calculate the votes for the dragon cake:
   \[
   \text{Votes for dragon cake} = \text{Votes for witch cake} + 25 = 7 + 25 = 32
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of votes cast**:
   - Now that we have the number of votes for each cake, we can find the total number of votes by adding the votes for all three cakes together:
   \[
   \text{Total votes} = \text{Votes for witch cake} + \text{Votes for unicorn cake} + \text{Votes for dragon cake}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total votes} = 7 + 21 + 32
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total votes} = 60
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - The total number of votes cast in the baking contest is:
   \[
   \boxed{60}
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by identifying the number of votes each cake received.

We know that 7 people voted for the witch cake.

According to the problem, the unicorn cake received three times as many votes as the witch cake. So, we multiply the number of votes for the witch cake by 3 to find the number of votes for the unicorn cake:

7 votes (for the witch cake) * 3 = 21 votes (for the unicorn cake)

The problem also tells us that the dragon cake received 25 more votes than the witc...
