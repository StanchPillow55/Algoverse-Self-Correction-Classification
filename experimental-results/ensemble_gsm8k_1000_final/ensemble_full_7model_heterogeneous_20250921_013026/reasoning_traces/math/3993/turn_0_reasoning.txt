=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To calculate James's weekly expenses for running his flower shop, we will break down the expenses into three main categories: rent, utilities, and employee wages.

### Step 1: Calculate Rent and Utilities

1. **Rent**: James pays $1200 per week for rent.
   
   \[
   \text{Rent} = 1200
   \]

2. **Utilities**: He pays an additional 20% of the rent for utilities. To find 20% of the rent, we calculate:

   \[
   \text{Utilities} = 0.20 \times \text{Rent} = 0.20 \times 1200
   \]

   \[
   \text{Utilities} = 240
   \]

3. **Total Rent and Utilities**: Now, we add the rent and utilities together:

   \[
   \text{Total Rent and Utilities} = \text{Rent} + \text{Utilities} = 1200 + 240
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total Rent and Utilities} = 1440
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Employee Wages

1. **Number of Employees**: James has 2 employees per shift.

2. **Hours Open per Day**: The store is open for 16 hours a day.

3. **Days Open per Week**: The store is open for 5 days a week.

4. **Total Hours Worked by Each Employee per Week**: To find the total hours worked by each employee in a week, we calculate:

   \[
   \text{Total Hours per Employee} = \text{Hours per Day} \times \text{Days Open} = 16 \times 5
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total Hours per Employee} = 80
   \]

5. **Wage per Hour**: Each employee is paid $12.50 per hour.

6. **Weekly Wage for Each Employee**: To find the weekly wage for each employee, we calculate:

   \[
   \text{Weekly Wage per Employee} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Total Hours per Employee} = 12.50 \times 80
   \]

   \[
   \text{Weekly Wage per Employee} = 1000
   \]

7. **Total Weekly Wages for All Employees**: Since there are 2 employees, we multiply the weekly wage of one employee by 2:

   \[
   \text{Total Weekly Wages} = \text{Weekly Wage per Employee} \times \text{Number of Employees} = 1000 \times 2
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total Weekly Wages} = 2000
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Weekly Expenses

Now, we can find the total weekly expenses by adding the total rent and utilities to the total weekly wages:

\[
\text{Total Weekly Expenses} = \text{Total Rent and Utilities} + \text{Total Weekly Wages}
\]

\[
\text{Total Weekly Expenses} = 1440 + 2000
\]

\[
\text{Total Weekly Expenses} = 3440
\]

### Final Answer

James's total weekly expenses to run the store are **$3440**.

Given information:
- Rent: $1,200 per week
- Utilities: 20% of rent
- Employees: 2 per shift
- Store hours: 16 hours per day, 5 days per week
- Employee hourly rate: $12.50

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine James's weekly expenses for running the flower shop, we need to calculate the total costs for rent, utilities, and employee wages. Let's break down each component step by step:

1. **Calculate the Rent:**
   - The weekly rent is given as $1200.

2. **Calculate the Utilities:**
   - Utilities are an additional 20% of the rent.
   - To find 20% of the rent, multiply the rent by 0.20:
     \[
     \text{Utilities} = 1200 \times 0.20 = 240
     \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the weekly rent and utilities cost. The utilities cost is 20% of the rent, so we multiply $1200 by 20% (or 0.20) to find the utilities cost:

$1200 * 0.20 = $240

Then we add this to the rent to find the total cost of rent and utilities:

$1200 + $240 = $1440

Next, let's calculate the weekly wages for the employees. Each employee is paid $12.50 an hour, and there are 2 employees per shift. So the cost per hour for both employees is:

$12.50 * 2 = $...

Given:
- Rent: $1200 per week
- Utilities: 20% of rent
- 2 employees per shift
- Store open 16 hours a day, 5 days a week
- Employee wage: $12.50 per hour
