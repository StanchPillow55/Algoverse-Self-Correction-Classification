=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of plants in Betty's herb garden, which consists of basil and oregano plants.

1. **Identify the number of basil plants**: 
   The problem states that there are 5 basil plants. 

   \[
   \text{Number of basil plants} = 5
   \]

2. **Determine the number of oregano plants**: 
   According to the problem, the number of oregano plants is "2 more than twice as many oregano plants as basil." We can express this mathematically. 

   Let \( b \) represent the number of basil plants and \( o \) represent the number of oregano plants. The relationship can be expressed as:

   \[
   o = 2b + 2
   \]

   Now, substituting the value of \( b \) (which is 5):

   \[
   o = 2(5) + 2
   \]

   Now, calculate \( 2(5) \):

   \[
   2(5) = 10
   \]

   Adding 2 to this result:

   \[
   o = 10 + 2 = 12
   \]

   So, the number of oregano plants is 12.

3. **Calculate the total number of plants**: 
   Now that we have the number of basil and oregano plants, we can find the total number of plants in the garden by adding the two quantities together:

   \[
   \text{Total number of plants} = \text{Number of basil plants} + \text{Number of oregano plants}
   \]

   Substituting the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Total number of plants} = 5 + 12
   \]

   Now, calculate the total:

   \[
   5 + 12 = 17
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total number of plants in Betty's herb garden is 

   \[
   \boxed{17}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Betty's herb garden has 2 more than twice as many oregano plants as basil plants.
- There are 5 basil plants.

Step 1: Find the number of oregano plants.
Number of oregano plants = (2 × Number of basil plants) + 2
Number of oregano plants = (2 × 5) + 2 = 12

Step 2: Find the total number of plants in the garden.
Total number of plants = Number of basil plants + Number of oregano plants
