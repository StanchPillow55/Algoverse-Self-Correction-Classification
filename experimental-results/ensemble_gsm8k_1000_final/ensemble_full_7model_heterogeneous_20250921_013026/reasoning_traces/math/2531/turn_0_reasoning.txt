=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the cost of Joe's new HVAC system per vent, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total cost of the HVAC system**: The total cost is given as $20,000.

2. **Determine the total number of vents**: The system has 2 conditioning zones, and each zone has 5 vents. To find the total number of vents, we multiply the number of zones by the number of vents per zone:

   \[
   \text{Total number of vents} = \text{Number of zones} \times \text{Number of vents per zone}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of vents} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost per vent**: To find the cost per vent, we divide the total cost of the HVAC system by the total number of vents:

   \[
   \text{Cost per vent} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Total number of vents}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per vent} = \frac{20000}{10} = 2000
   \]

4. **Final answer**: The cost of the system per vent is $2,000.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{2000}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of the HVAC system per vent.

Given information:
- The cost of Joe's new HVAC system is $20,000.
- The system includes 2 conditioning zones, each with 5 vents.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of vents in the HVAC system.
Total number of vents = Number of conditioning zones × Number of vents per zone
Total number of vents = 2 × 5 = 10 vents

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the HVAC system per vent.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To find the cost of Joe's new HVAC system per vent, we need to determine the total number of vents and then divide the total cost by this number.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Total Number of Vents:**
   - The HVAC system includes 2 conditioning zones.
   - Each zone has 5 vents.
   - To find the total number of vents, multiply the number of zones by the number of vents per zone:
     \[
     \text{Total number of vents} = 2 \text{ zones} \times 5 \text{...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find the total number of vents in Joe's new HVAC system. Since there are 2 conditioning zones, each with 5 vents, we multiply 2 by 5 to get 10 vents.

Next, we need to find the cost of the system per vent. To do this, we divide the total cost of the system by the total number of vents. 

So, we divide $20,000 by 10 to get $2,000.

Therefore, the cost of the system per vent is $2,000.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The total cost of Joe's HVAC system is $20,000.
   * The system includes 2 conditioning zones.
   * Each zone has 5 vents.

2. Calculate the total number of vents in the system:
   * Number of zones = 2
   * Number of vents per zone = 5
   * Total number of vents = Number of zones × Number of vents per zone
   * Total number of vents = 2 × 5 = 10 vents

3. Calculate th...
