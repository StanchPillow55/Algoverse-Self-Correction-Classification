=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of students in the chess program:**
   We know that one-third of the 24 students are in the after-school chess program. To find this number, we perform the following calculation:

   \[
   \text{Number of students in chess program} = \frac{1}{3} \times 24
   \]

   Calculating this gives:

   \[
   \frac{24}{3} = 8
   \]

   So, there are 8 students in the after-school chess program.

2. **Determine how many of those students will be absent for the tournament:**
   Next, we know that half of the students in the chess program will be absent for the regional chess tournament. To find this number, we calculate:

   \[
   \text{Number of students absent} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8
   \]

   Calculating this gives:

   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4
   \]

   Therefore, 4 students from the chess program will be absent for the tournament.

3. **Conclusion:**
   The problem asks how many students from the class are going to the tournament. Since the 4 students who are absent are the only ones participating in the tournament, we conclude that these 4 students are the ones going to the tournament.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many students are in the after-school chess program. Since one-third of the students are in the program, we can calculate this by dividing the total number of students by 3.

24 students / 3 = 8 students

So, 8 students are in the after-school chess program.

Next, we need to find out how many of these students will be absent from school on Friday for the regional chess tournament. Since half of the students in the chess program are going, w...
