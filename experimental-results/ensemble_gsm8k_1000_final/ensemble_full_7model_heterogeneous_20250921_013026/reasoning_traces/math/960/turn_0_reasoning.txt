=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will determine the ages of each person step by step, starting with Cindy.

1. **Cindy's Age**: 
   - Cindy is given to be 5 years old.

2. **Jan's Age**: 
   - Jan is 2 years older than Cindy. 
   - Therefore, Jan's age can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Jan's age} = \text{Cindy's age} + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Marcia's Age**: 
   - Marcia is twice as old as Jan. 
   - We can calculate Marcia's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Marcia's age} = 2 \times \text{Jan's age} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Greg's Age**: 
   - Greg is 2 years older than Marcia. 
   - Thus, we can find Greg's age by calculating:
     \[
     \text{Greg's age} = \text{Marcia's age} + 2 = 14 + 2 = 16 \text{ years old}
     \]

Now that we have calculated the ages of all individuals involved, we can summarize:

- Cindy is 5 years old.
- Jan is 7 years old.
- Marcia is 14 years old.
- Greg is 16 years old.

Finally, the question asks for Greg's age. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will determine the ages of each person step by step, starting with Cindy.

1. **Cindy's Age**: 
   - Cindy is given to be 5 years old.

2. **Jan's Age**: 
   - Jan is 2 years older than Cindy. 
   - Therefore, Jan's age can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Jan's age} = \text{Cindy's age} + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Marcia's Age**: 
   - Marcia is twice as old as Jan. 
   - We can calculate Marcia's age as follows:

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Cindy is 5 years old.
- Jan is 2 years older than Cindy.
- Marcia is twice as old as Jan.
- Greg is 2 years older than Marcia.

Step 1: Find Jan's age.
Jan's age = Cindy's age + 2 years
Jan's age = 5 + 2 = 7 years old

Step 2: Find Marcia's age.
Marcia's age = 2 × Jan's age
Marcia's age = 2 × 7 = 14 years old

Step 3: Find Greg's age.
Greg's age = Marcia's age + 2 years
Greg's age...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of each person mentioned, starting with Cindy and working our way up to Greg.

1. **Cindy's Age:**
   - Cindy is 5 years old.

2. **Jan's Age:**
   - Jan is 2 years older than Cindy.
   - Therefore, Jan's age = Cindy's age + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7 years old.

3. **Marcia's Age:**
   - Marcia is twice as old as Jan.
   - Therefore, Marcia's age = 2 × Jan's age = 2 × 7 = 14 years old.

4. **Greg's Age:**
   - Greg is 2 years older...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that Cindy was 5 years old.

Second, we know that Jan was 2 years older than Cindy. So, Jan was 5 years + 2 years = 7 years old.

Third, we know that Marcia was twice as old as Jan. So, Marcia was 2 * 7 years = 14 years old.

Finally, we know that Greg was two years older than Marcia. So, Greg was 14 years + 2 years = 16 years old.

Therefore, Greg was 16 years old.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start with the information given and work our way through to find Greg's age.

Given:
- Cindy is 5 years old.
- Jan is 2 years older than Cindy.
- Marcia is twice as old as Jan.
- Greg is 2 years older than Marcia.

Step 1: Calculate Jan's age.
Jan is 2 years older than Cindy, so:
Jan's age = Cindy's age + 2
Jan's age = 5 + 2 = 7 years old

Step 2: Calculate Marcia's age.
Marcia is twice as old as Jan,...
