=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many songs each person can still add to their portable media player, and then find the difference between those two amounts.

1. **Determine the number of songs Luri has:**
   - Gabriel has 20 songs.
   - Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel.
   \[
   \text{Luri's songs} = 3 \times \text{Gabriel's songs} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ songs}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many more songs each can add:**
   - The maximum capacity of each portable media player is 100 songs.
   - To find out how many more songs Gabriel can add:
   \[
   \text{Gabriel's remaining capacity} = 100 - \text{Gabriel's songs} = 100 - 20 = 80 \text{ songs}
   \]
   - To find out how many more songs Luri can add:
   \[
   \text{Luri's remaining capacity} = 100 - \text{Luri's songs} = 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ songs}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel:**
   - We need to find the difference between the number of songs Gabriel can add and the number of songs Luri can add:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Gabriel's remaining capacity} - \text{Luri's remaining capacity} = 80 - 40 = 40
   \]

Thus, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.

**Final Answer:**
Luri can add 40 fewer songs than Gabriel.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of songs that Gabriel and Luri can add to their respective portable media players, and then calculate the difference between them.

Given information:
- Gabriel's portable media player can store up to 100 songs.
- Gabriel has 20 songs on his player.
- Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel.

Step 1: Find the number of songs Luri has on his portable media player.
Luri's songs = 3 × Gabriel's songs
Lu...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many songs Luri has on his player. Since we know that Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, we multiply Gabriel's number of songs by 3.

20 songs * 3 = 60 songs

So, Luri has 60 songs on his player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each player can add to their player. Since each player's media player can store up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs each player currently has from 100.

For Gabriel: 100 songs - 20 ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Both Gabriel and Luri have portable media players that can store up to 100 songs each.
   * Gabriel has 20 songs on his player.
   * Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel.

2. Calculate the number of songs Luri has on his player:
   * Luri's songs = 3 × Gabriel's songs
   * Luri's songs = 3 × 20
   * Luri's songs = 60

3. Calculate the number of additional so...
