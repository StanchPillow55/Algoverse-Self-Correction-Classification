=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine Martha's current age based on the information given about Ellen's age.

1. **Identify Ellen's current age**: 
   - We know that Ellen is currently 10 years old.

2. **Calculate Ellen's age in six years**: 
   - In six years, Ellen's age will be:
     \[
     \text{Ellen's age in 6 years} = \text{Current age} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Understand the relationship between Martha's age and Ellen's future age**: 
   - The problem states that Martha is currently twice as old as Ellen will be in six years. Therefore, we can express Martha's current age (let's denote it as \( M \)) in terms of Ellen's future age:
     \[
     M = 2 \times (\text{Ellen's age in 6 years}) = 2 \times 16
     \]

4. **Calculate Martha's current age**: 
   - Now we can calculate Martha's age:
     \[
     M = 2 \times 16 = 32
     \]

5. **Conclusion**: 
   - Martha's current age is 32 years old.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Martha's age now is } 32 \text{ years old.}
\]

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to determine Martha's current age based on the information given about Ellen's age.

1. **Identify Ellen's current age**: 
   - We know that Ellen is currently 10 years old.

2. **Calculate Ellen's age in six years**: 
   - In six years, Ellen's age will be:
     \[

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Martha is twice as old as Ellen will be in six years.
- Ellen is 10 years old now.

Step 1: Find out how old Ellen will be in six years.
Ellen's age in six years = 10 + 6 = 16 years old

Step 2: Find out how old Martha is now.
Martha's age = Twice of Ellen's age in six years
Martha's age = 2 Ã— 16 = 32 years old

Therefore, the final answer is:
Martha's age now is 32 years old.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine Martha's current age based on the information given about Ellen's age.

1. **Understand the problem statement:**
   - Ellen is currently 10 years old.
   - Martha is twice as old as Ellen will be in six years.

2. **Calculate Ellen's age in six years:**
   - Ellen's current age = 10 years.
   - In six years, Ellen's age will be:
     \[
     10 + 6 = 16 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Determine Martha's age based on the informat...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote Ellen's age in six years as E. Since Ellen is currently 10 years old, in six years, she will be 10 + 6 = 16 years old. 

Martha is twice as old as Ellen will be in six years. Therefore, Martha's age, denoted as M, is 2 * E. Substituting E = 16, we find that M = 2 * 16 = 32 years old. 

So, Martha is currently 32 years old.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to set up an equation and solve for Martha's current age.

Given:
- Ellen is currently 10 years old.
- Martha is twice as old as Ellen will be in 6 years.

Step 1: Express Ellen's age in 6 years.
Ellen's age in 6 years = Ellen's current age + 6
Ellen's age in 6 years = 10 + 6 = 16

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the relationship between Martha's current age and Ell...
