=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many football players and cheerleaders are left after some of them quit.

1. **Identify the initial numbers**:
   - Initial number of football players = 13
   - Initial number of cheerleaders = 16

2. **Identify how many quit**:
   - Number of football players who quit = 10
   - Number of cheerleaders who quit = 4

3. **Calculate the remaining football players**:
   - Remaining football players = Initial football players - Football players who quit
   - Remaining football players = 13 - 10
   - Remaining football players = 3

4. **Calculate the remaining cheerleaders**:
   - Remaining cheerleaders = Initial cheerleaders - Cheerleaders who quit
   - Remaining cheerleaders = 16 - 4
   - Remaining cheerleaders = 12

5. **Summarize the results**:
   - Remaining football players = 3
   - Remaining cheerleaders = 12

6. **Final answer**:
   - The number of football players left is 3.
