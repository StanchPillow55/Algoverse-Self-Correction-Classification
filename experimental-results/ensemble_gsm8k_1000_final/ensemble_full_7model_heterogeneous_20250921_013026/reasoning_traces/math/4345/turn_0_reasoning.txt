=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many children's tickets were purchased based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the cost of tickets:**
   - The regular ticket for adults costs $9.
   - The children's ticket costs $2 less than the adult ticket, so:
     \[
     \text{Cost of children's ticket} = 9 - 2 = 7 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount paid:**
   - The family paid with two $20 bills, which totals:
     \[
     2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - They received $1 in change, so the total amount spent on tickets is:
     \[
     40 - 1 = 39 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Set up the equation for the total cost of tickets:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of children. The family consists of 2 adults and \( c \) children.
   - The total cost for the tickets can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = (\text{Cost of adult tickets}) + (\text{Cost of children's tickets})
     \]
   - The cost for 2 adult tickets is:
     \[
     2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The cost for \( c \) children's tickets is:
     \[
     c \times 7 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the equation for the total cost is:
     \[
     18 + 7c = 39
     \]

4. **Solve for \( c \):**
   - Subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     7c = 39 - 18
     \]
     \[
     7c = 21
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 7:
     \[
     c = \frac{21}{7} = 3
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The number of children in the family is \( \boxed{3} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of children in the family.

Given information:
- Regular ticket cost: $9
- Children's ticket cost: $2 less than regular ticket, which is $7
- The family paid with two $20 bills and received $1 in change.
- There are 2 adults in the family.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount paid by the family.
Total amount paid = 2 Ã— $20 - $1 = $39

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the tickets.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many children are in the family based on the information given about ticket prices and the total amount spent.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the ticket prices:**
   - The regular ticket (adult ticket) costs $9.
   - The children's ticket costs $2 less than the adult ticket, so it costs \(9 - 2 = 7\) dollars.

2. **Determine the total amount of money given and the change received:**
   - The fami...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The total amount the family gave to the cashier is $20 + $20 = $40.

Since they received a $1 change, the total cost of their movie tickets is $40 - $1 = $39.

The ticket for children is $9 - $2 = $7.

The cost of the tickets for the 2 adults is 2 x $9 = $18.

So, the cost of the tickets for the children is $39 - $18 = $21.

Therefore, there are $21/$7 = 3 children in the family. Answer: \boxed{3}.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Regular ticket price = $9
   * Children's ticket price = Regular ticket price - $2 = $9 - $2 = $7
   * The family gave the cashier two $20 bills, which is a total of $40.
   * They received $1 in change.
   * There are 2 adults in the family.

2. Calculate the total amount spent on tickets:
   * Total money given = $40
   * Change received = $1
   * Total amount ...
