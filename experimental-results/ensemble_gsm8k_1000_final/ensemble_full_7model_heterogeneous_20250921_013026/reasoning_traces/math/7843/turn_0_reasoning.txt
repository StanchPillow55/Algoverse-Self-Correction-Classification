=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Market Cost**: The market cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is given as $400.

2. **Calculate the Savings from DIY**: Ethan saves 20% of the market cost by making the wallpaper himself. To find out how much he saves, we need to calculate 20% of $400.

   \[
   \text{Savings} = 20\% \times 400
   \]

   To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:

   \[
   20\% = \frac{20}{100} = 0.20
   \]

   Now, we can calculate the savings:

   \[
   \text{Savings} = 0.20 \times 400 = 80
   \]

3. **Calculate the Total Cost for DIY**: Since Ethan saves $80 by making the wallpaper himself, we need to subtract this savings from the market cost to find out how much he actually spends on the DIY project.

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Market Cost} - \text{Savings}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 400 - 80 = 320
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is:

   \[
   \boxed{320}
   \]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that Ethan will save 20% if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper. 

First, we need to find out how much 20% of $400 is. We can do this by multiplying $400 by 20% (or 0.20 in decimal form).

$400 * 0.20 = $80

This means that Ethan will save $80 if he makes his own wallpaper.

To find out how much Ethan spent on making his own wallpaper, we subtract the amount he saved from the original cost of the wallpaper.

$400 - $80 = $320

Therefore, Ethan spent...
