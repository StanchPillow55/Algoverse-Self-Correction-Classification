=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many times Sarah and Ellie saw their reflections in the house of mirrors, we need to calculate the total reflections for each person based on the number of times they passed through the rooms with tall and wide mirrors.

### Step 1: Calculate Sarah's Reflections

**Tall Mirrors:**
- Sarah sees her reflection 10 times each time she is in the room with tall mirrors.
- She passed through the tall mirrors 3 times.

Calculating Sarah's reflections in the tall mirrors:
\[
\text{Reflections from tall mirrors} = 10 \text{ reflections} \times 3 \text{ times} = 30 \text{ reflections}
\]

**Wide Mirrors:**
- Sarah sees her reflection 5 times each time she is in the room with wide mirrors.
- She passed through the wide mirrors 5 times.

Calculating Sarah's reflections in the wide mirrors:
\[
\text{Reflections from wide mirrors} = 5 \text{ reflections} \times 5 \text{ times} = 25 \text{ reflections}
\]

**Total Reflections for Sarah:**
Now, we add the reflections from both types of mirrors:
\[
\text{Total reflections for Sarah} = 30 \text{ (tall)} + 25 \text{ (wide)} = 55 \text{ reflections}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Ellie's Reflections

**Tall Mirrors:**
- Ellie sees her reflection 6 times each time she is in the room with tall mirrors.
- She also passed through the tall mirrors 3 times.

Calculating Ellie's reflections in the tall mirrors:
\[
\text{Reflections from tall mirrors} = 6 \text{ reflections} \times 3 \text{ times} = 18 \text{ reflections}
\]

**Wide Mirrors:**
- Ellie sees her reflection 3 times each time she is in the room with wide mirrors.
- She passed through the wide mirrors 5 times.

Calculating Ellie's reflections in the wide mirrors:
\[
\text{Reflections from wide mirrors} = 3 \text{ reflections} \times 5 \text{ times} = 15 \text{ reflections}
\]

**Total Reflections for Ellie:**
Now, we add the reflections from both types of mirrors:
\[
\text{Total reflections for Ellie} = 18 \text{ (tall)} + 15 \text{ (wide)} = 33 \text{ reflections}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Reflections for Both

Finally, we add the total reflections from both Sarah and Ellie:
\[
\text{Total reflections for both} = 55 \text{ (Sarah)} + 33 \text{ (Ellie)} = 88 \text{ reflections}
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of times Sarah and Ellie saw their reflections is:
\[
\boxed{88}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how many times Sarah saw her reflection. 

In the room with tall mirrors, Sarah saw her reflection 10 times each time she passed through. Since she passed through this room 3 times, she saw her reflection 10 * 3 = 30 times in the tall mirror room.

In the room with wide mirrors, Sarah saw her reflection 5 times each time she passed through. Since she passed through this room 5 times, she saw her reflection 5 * 5 = 25 times in the wide mirror room.
