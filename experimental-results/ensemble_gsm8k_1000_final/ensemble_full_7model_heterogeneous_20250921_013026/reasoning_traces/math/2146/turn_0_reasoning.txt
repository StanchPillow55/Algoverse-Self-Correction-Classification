=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many coconuts Dante has initially.**
2. **Calculate how many coconuts Dante has after selling 10 coconuts.**

### Step 1: Calculate Dante's Initial Coconuts

We know that Paolo has 14 coconuts. The problem states that Dante has thrice as many coconuts as Paolo.

To find out how many coconuts Dante has, we can use the following calculation:

\[
\text{Dante's coconuts} = 3 \times \text{Paolo's coconuts}
\]

Substituting Paolo's coconuts:

\[
\text{Dante's coconuts} = 3 \times 14
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Dante's coconuts} = 42
\]

So, Dante initially has 42 coconuts.

### Step 2: Calculate Dante's Coconuts After Selling 10

Next, we need to find out how many coconuts Dante has left after he sells 10 of them. We can calculate this by subtracting the number of coconuts he sold from his initial amount:

\[
\text{Coconuts left} = \text{Dante's initial coconuts} - \text{Coconuts sold}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Coconuts left} = 42 - 10
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Coconuts left} = 32
\]

### Final Answer

After selling 10 coconuts, Dante has **32 coconuts left**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Paolo has 14 coconuts.
- Dante has thrice as many coconuts as Paolo.
- Dante sold 10 of his coconuts.

Step 1: Calculate the number of coconuts Dante had initially.
Dante's initial number of coconuts = 3 × Paolo's number of coconuts
Dante's initial number of coconuts = 3 × 14 = 42 coconuts

Step 2: Calculate the number of coconuts Dante had after selling 10.
Dante's number of coconuts after se...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many coconuts Dante has after selling some of them. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of coconuts Dante initially has:**

   - We know that Paolo has 14 coconuts.
   - Dante has thrice as many coconuts as Paolo. This means Dante has 3 times the number of coconuts Paolo has.

   \[
   \text{Number of coconuts Dante has} = 3 \times \text{Number of coconuts Paolo has}
   \]

   Substituting ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Paolo has 14 coconuts. Dante has thrice as many coconuts as Paolo. This means Dante has 14 coconuts * 3 = <<14*3=42>>42 coconuts.

If Dante sold 10 of his coconuts, then he would have 42 coconuts - 10 coconuts = <<42-10=32>>32 coconuts left.

So, Dante has 32 coconuts left after selling 10 of his coconuts.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Paolo has 14 coconuts.
   * Dante has thrice (3 times) as many coconuts as Paolo.
   * Dante sold 10 of his coconuts.

2. Calculate the number of coconuts Dante has:
   * Dante's coconuts = 3 × Paolo's coconuts
   * Dante's coconuts = 3 × 14
   * Dante's coconuts = 42

3. Subtract the number of coconuts Dante sold:
   * Remaining coconuts = Dante's coconuts - Sold c...
