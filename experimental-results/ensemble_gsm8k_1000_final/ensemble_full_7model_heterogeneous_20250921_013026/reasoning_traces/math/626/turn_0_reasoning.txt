=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it will take Jessica to finish answering all 80 questions at her current pace, and then calculate how much time will be left from the one hour she has for the exam.

### Step 1: Determine Jessica's current pace

Jessica has answered 16 questions in 12 minutes. To find her pace in terms of questions per minute, we can use the following calculation:

\[
\text{Pace} = \frac{\text{Number of questions answered}}{\text{Time used}} = \frac{16 \text{ questions}}{12 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ questions per minute}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time needed to answer all questions

Next, we need to find out how long it will take her to answer all 80 questions at this pace. First, we need to calculate how many questions she has left to answer:

\[
\text{Questions remaining} = 80 - 16 = 64 \text{ questions}
\]

Now, we can calculate the time required to answer the remaining 64 questions:

\[
\text{Time needed} = \frac{\text{Questions remaining}}{\text{Pace}} = \frac{64 \text{ questions}}{\frac{4}{3} \text{ questions per minute}} = 64 \times \frac{3}{4} = 48 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total time spent

Now, we need to find the total time Jessica will spend on the exam:

\[
\text{Total time spent} = \text{Time used} + \text{Time needed} = 12 \text{ minutes} + 48 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining time

Jessica has a total of 60 minutes for the exam. Since she will take exactly 60 minutes to finish answering all questions, we can calculate the remaining time:

\[
\text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time for the exam} - \text{Total time spent} = 60 \text{ minutes} - 60 \text{ minutes} = 0 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

When Jessica finishes the exam, she will have **0 minutes** left.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the time it will take Jessica to complete the remaining questions and then calculate the time left when she finishes the exam.

Given information:
- Jessica has one hour (60 minutes) to take the exam.
- She has answered 16 out of 80 questions.
- She has used 12 minutes of her time.

Step 1: Calculate the number of questions Jessica has left to answer.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take Jessica to finish the exam at her current pace and then calculate how much time will be left.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine Jessica's current pace:**
   - Jessica has answered 16 questions in 12 minutes.

2. **Calculate the time per question:**
   - The time taken per question is calculated by dividing the total time by the number of questions answered:
   \[
   \text{Time per question} = \fr...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many questions Jessica can answer per minute. She has answered 16 questions in 12 minutes, so the rate is 16 questions/12 minutes = 1.33 questions per minute.

Next, we need to find out how long it will take her to finish the rest of the exam at this rate. She has 80 questions in total and has already answered 16, so she has 80 - 16 = 64 questions left.

If she answers 1.33 questions per minute, it will take her 64 questions / 1.33 questions...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jessica has 1 hour (60 minutes) to complete the exam.
   * She has answered 16 questions out of a total of 80 questions.
   * She has used 12 minutes so far.

2. Calculate the rate at which Jessica is answering questions:
   * Questions answered = 16
   * Time used = 12 minutes
   * Rate = Questions answered รท Time used
   * Rate = 16 รท 12 = 1.333... questions per minu...
