Final Answer: Let's denote Cooper's age as \( C \), Dante's age as \( D \), and Maria's age as \( M \).

We are given the following information:

1. The sum of their ages is 31:
   \[
   C + D + M = 31
   \]

2. Dante is twice as old as Cooper:
   \[
   D = 2C
   \]

3. Maria is one year older than Dante:
   \[
   M = D + 1
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( D \) and \( M \) in terms of \( C \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( D = 2C \) into the equation for \( M \):
\[
M = D + 1 = 2C + 1
\]

Now we can substitute both \( D \) and \( M \) into the sum of ages equation:
\[
C + D + M = 31
\]
Substituting \( D \) and \( M \):
\[
C + 2C + (2C + 1) = 31
\]

Now, combine like terms:
\[
C + 2C + 2C + 1 = 31
\]
\[
5C + 1 = 31
\]

Next, we will isolate \( C \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:
\[
5C = 31 - 1
\]
\[
5C = 30
\]

Now, divide both sides by 5:
\[
C = \frac{30}{5} = 6
\]

So, Cooper's age is \( C = 6 \).

Now, let's find Dante's and Maria's ages to verify our solution:
1. Dante's age:
   \[
   D = 2C = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

2. Maria's age:
   \[
   M = D + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13
   \]

Now, let's check the sum of their ages:
\[
C + D + M = 6 + 12 + 13 = 31
\]

The sum is correct. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): Let's denote Cooper's age as \( C \), Dante's age as \( D \), and Maria's age as \( M \).

We are given the following information:

1. The sum of their ages is 31:
   \[
   C + D + M = 31
   \]

2. Dante is twice as old as Cooper:
   \[
   D = 2C
   \]

3. Maria is one year older than Dante:
   \[
   M = D + 1
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( D \) and \( M \) in terms of \( C \) into the first equation.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The sum of Cooper's, Dante's, and Maria's ages is 31.
- Dante is twice as old as Cooper.
- Maria is one year older than Dante.

Let's represent the ages as follows:
- Cooper's age = x
- Dante's age = 2x (since Dante is twice as old as Cooper)
- Maria's age = 2x + 1 (since Maria is one year older than Dante)

Step 1: Write an equation to represent the sum of their ages.
Cooper's age + Dante's a...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and then solve for Cooper's age.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( C \) represent Cooper's age.
- Let \( D \) represent Dante's age.
- Let \( M \) represent Maria's age.

We are given the following information:
1. The sum of their ages is 31: 
   \[
   C + D + M = 31
   \]

2. Dante is twice as old as Cooper:
   \[
   D = 2C
   \]

3. Maria is one year older than Dante:
   \[
   M = D +...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the ages of Cooper, Dante, and Maria as C, D, and M respectively.

From the problem, we have three pieces of information that we can translate into equations:

1. The sum of their ages is 31: C + D + M = 31
2. Dante is twice as old as Cooper: D = 2C
3. Maria is one year older than Dante: M = D + 1

We can substitute the second and third equations into the first one to solve for C:

C + D + M = 31
C + 2C + (2C + 1) = 31
5C + 1 = 31
5C = 30
C = 30 / 5
C = 6

So...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to set up equations and solve for Cooper's age.

Given:
- The sum of Cooper's, Dante's, and Maria's ages is 31.
- Dante is twice as old as Cooper.
- Maria is one year older than Dante.

Step 1: Let's express Dante's and Maria's ages in terms of Cooper's age.
Cooper's age: x
Dante's age: 2x (since Dante is twice as old as Cooper)
Maria's age: 2x + 1 (since Maria is one year ...
