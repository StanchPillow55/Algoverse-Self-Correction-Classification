=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let \( x \) be the price of a pint of frozen yogurt. According to the problem, the price of a pack of chewing gum is half the price of a pint of frozen yogurt, which can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Price of a pack of chewing gum} = \frac{x}{2}
\]

We know that Shannon bought:
- 5 pints of frozen yogurt
- 2 packs of chewing gum
- 5 trays of jumbo shrimp

The price of a tray of jumbo shrimp is given as $5. Therefore, the total cost of the items can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Total cost} = (\text{Cost of frozen yogurt}) + (\text{Cost of chewing gum}) + (\text{Cost of shrimp})
\]

Calculating each component:

1. **Cost of frozen yogurt**:
   \[
   \text{Cost of frozen yogurt} = 5 \times x = 5x
   \]

2. **Cost of chewing gum**:
   \[
   \text{Cost of chewing gum} = 2 \times \frac{x}{2} = x
   \]

3. **Cost of shrimp**:
   \[
   \text{Cost of shrimp} = 5 \times 5 = 25
   \]

Now, we can combine these costs into the total cost equation:

\[
5x + x + 25 = 55
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
6x + 25 = 55
\]

Next, we will isolate \( x \) by subtracting 25 from both sides:

\[
6x = 55 - 25
\]
\[
6x = 30
\]

Now, divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{30}{6} = 5
\]

Thus, the price of a pint of frozen yogurt is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\] 

To verify, we can check the total cost with \( x = 5 \):
- Cost of frozen yogurt: \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \)
- Cost of chewing gum: \( 2 \times \frac{5}{2} = 5 \)
- Cost of shrimp: \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \)

Adding these together:

\[
25 + 5 + 25 = 55
\]

The calculations confirm that the total is indeed $55, validating that the price of a pint of frozen yogurt is correctly determined as \( \boxed{5} \).

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): Let \( x \) be the price of a pint of frozen yogurt. According to the problem, the price of a pack of chewing gum is half the price of a pint of frozen yogurt, which can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Price of a pack of chewing gum} = \frac{x}{2}
\]

We know that Shannon bought:
- 5 pints of frozen yogurt
- 2 packs of chewing gum
- 5 trays of jumbo shrimp

The price of a tray of jumbo shrimp is given as $5. Therefore, the total cost of the items can be expressed as:

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Shannon bought 5 pints of frozen yogurt, two packs of chewing gum, and five trays of jumbo shrimp.
- The total cost of the purchase was $55.
- The price of a tray of jumbo shrimp is $5.
- The price of a pack of chewing gum is half the price of a pint of frozen yogurt.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the jumbo shrimp.
Total cost of jumbo shrimp = 5 trays Ã— $5 per tray = $25

S...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the price of a pint of frozen yogurt. Let's break down the information given and set up equations to find the solution.

1. **Identify Variables:**
   - Let \( y \) be the price of a pint of frozen yogurt.
   - Let \( g \) be the price of a pack of chewing gum.
   - We know that the price of a tray of jumbo shrimp is $5.

2. **Translate the Problem into Equations:**
   - Shannon bought 5 pints of frozen yogurt, so the total cos...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the price of a pint of frozen yogurt as F and the price of a pack of chewing gum as G. 

From the problem, we know that:

1) Shannon bought 5 pints of frozen yogurt, so the total cost for the frozen yogurt is 5F.

2) She also bought two packs of chewing gum, so the total cost for the chewing gum is 2G.

3) She bought five trays of jumbo shrimp, each costing $5, so the total cost for the shrimp is 5 * $5 = $25.

4) The total cost of all these items is $55.

So...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- Shannon bought 5 pints of frozen yogurt, 2 packs of chewing gum, and 5 trays of jumbo shrimp.
- The total cost is $55.
- The price of a tray of jumbo shrimp is $5.
- A pack of chewing gum costs half as much as a pint of frozen yogurt.

Let's define some variables:
- Let x be the price of a pint of frozen yogurt.
- Since a pack of chewing gum costs half as much as a pint of frozen yogurt, the price ...
