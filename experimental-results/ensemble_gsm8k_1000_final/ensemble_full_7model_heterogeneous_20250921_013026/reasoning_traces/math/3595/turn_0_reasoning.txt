=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Mr. Sergio made from selling his fruits. We will start by determining the total produce of apples, mangoes, and oranges based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the produce of mangoes**:
   - We know from the problem that Mr. Sergio produced 400 kg of mangoes.

2. **Calculate the produce of apples**:
   - The problem states that the total produce of apples was twice the total produce of mangoes. Therefore, we can calculate the total produce of apples as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total produce of apples} = 2 \times \text{Total produce of mangoes} = 2 \times 400 \text{ kg} = 800 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Calculate the produce of oranges**:
   - The problem also states that the total produce of oranges was 200 kg more than that of mangoes. We can calculate the total produce of oranges as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total produce of oranges} = \text{Total produce of mangoes} + 200 \text{ kg} = 400 \text{ kg} + 200 \text{ kg} = 600 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total produce of all fruits**:
   - Now we can find the total produce of all fruits by adding the produce of apples, mangoes, and oranges:
   \[
   \text{Total produce} = \text{Total produce of apples} + \text{Total produce of mangoes} + \text{Total produce of oranges}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total produce} = 800 \text{ kg} + 400 \text{ kg} + 600 \text{ kg} = 1800 \text{ kg}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of money earned**:
   - Mr. Sergio sold the fruits at $50 per kg. Therefore, the total amount of money he earned can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total money earned} = \text{Total produce} \times \text{Price per kg} = 1800 \text{ kg} \times 50 \text{ dollars/kg}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total money earned} = 90000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Mr. Sergio earned a total of **$90,000** in that season.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that Mr. Sergio's apple production was twice that of his mango production. Since he produced 400 kg of mangoes, his apple production would be 2 * 400 kg = 800 kg.

The problem also states that his orange production was 200 kg more than his mango production. So, his orange production would be 400 kg + 200 kg = 600 kg.

To find the total amount of fruit he produced, we add up the amounts of each type of fruit: 800 kg (apples) + 600 kg (oranges) + 400 kg (...
