=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many boxes of cookies Sonny has left after giving some away, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of boxes Sonny received**: 
   Sonny received a total of 45 boxes of cookies.

2. **Calculate the total number of boxes given away**: 
   Sonny gave away cookies to three people:
   - He gave 12 boxes to his brother.
   - He gave 9 boxes to his sister.
   - He gave 7 boxes to his cousin.

   We need to add these amounts together to find the total number of boxes given away:
   \[
   \text{Total given away} = 12 + 9 + 7
   \]

   Now, let's perform the addition step-by-step:
   - First, add 12 and 9:
     \[
     12 + 9 = 21
     \]
   - Next, add the result to 7:
     \[
     21 + 7 = 28
     \]

   So, Sonny gave away a total of 28 boxes of cookies.

3. **Calculate the number of boxes left**: 
   To find out how many boxes Sonny has left, we subtract the total number of boxes given away from the total number of boxes he received:
   \[
   \text{Boxes left} = \text{Total received} - \text{Total given away}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Boxes left} = 45 - 28
   \]

   Now, let's perform the subtraction:
   \[
   45 - 28 = 17
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the number of boxes of cookies left for Sonny is:
   \[
   \boxed{17}
   \]
