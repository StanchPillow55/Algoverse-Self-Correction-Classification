=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many m&m's Cheryl gave to her sister, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial amount of m&m's Cheryl had**: 
   Cheryl started with 25 m&m's.

2. **Calculate the total number of m&m's Cheryl ate**:
   - After lunch, she ate 7 m&m's.
   - After dinner, she ate 5 m&m's.
   
   We can add these two amounts together:
   \[
   7 + 5 = 12
   \]
   So, Cheryl ate a total of 12 m&m's.

3. **Calculate the remaining m&m's after Cheryl ate**:
   We subtract the total number of m&m's she ate from the initial amount she had:
   \[
   25 - 12 = 13
   \]
   After eating, Cheryl has 13 m&m's left.

4. **Determine how many m&m's Cheryl gave to her sister**:
   Since the problem does not specify how many m&m's she gave to her sister, we can conclude that the number of m&m's she gave to her sister is simply the amount she has left after eating, which is 13.

Thus, Cheryl gave her sister **13 m&m's**.

Final answer:
\[
\text{Cheryl gave her sister } 13 \text{ m&m's.}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Cheryl ate 7 m&m's after lunch.
- Cheryl ate 5 m&m's after dinner.
- Cheryl had 25 m&m's at the beginning.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of m&m's Cheryl ate.
Cheryl ate 7 m&m's after lunch + 5 m&m's after dinner = 7 + 5 = 12 m&m's

Step 2: Calculate the number of m&m's Cheryl had left after eating.
Cheryl had 25 m&m's at the beginning - 12 m&m's eaten = 25 - 12 = 13 m&m's left

Step 3: C...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many m&m's Cheryl gave to her sister. We know the following:

1. Cheryl started with 25 m&m's.
2. She ate 7 m&m's after lunch.
3. She ate 5 m&m's after dinner.
4. We need to find out how many m&m's she gave to her sister.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of m&m's Cheryl ate.**

Cheryl ate 7 m&m's after lunch and 5 m&m's after dinner. To find the total number of m&m's she ate,...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Cheryl started with 25 m&m's. After lunch, she ate 7 m&m's, so we subtract 7 from 25.

25 - 7 = 18 m&m's

Then, after dinner, she ate 5 more m&m's. So, we subtract 5 from the 18 m&m's she had left.

18 - 5 = 13 m&m's

At this point, Cheryl has 13 m&m's left. However, she gave some to her sister. To find out how many she gave to her sister, we need to subtract the number of m&m's she has left from the number she started with.

So, Cheryl gave her sister 25 - 13 = 12 m&m's....

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Cheryl had 25 m&m's at the beginning.
   * She ate 7 m&m's after lunch.
   * She ate 5 m&m's after dinner.
   * She gave some m&m's to her sister.

2. Calculate the total number of m&m's Cheryl ate:
   * M&m's eaten = M&m's after lunch + M&m's after dinner
   * M&m's eaten = 7 + 5
   * M&m's eaten = 12

3. Calculate the number of m&m's Cheryl gave to her sister:
