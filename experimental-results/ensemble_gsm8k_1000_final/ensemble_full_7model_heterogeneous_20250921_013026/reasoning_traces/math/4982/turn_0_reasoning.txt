=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much change Lee and his friend should have received in total after their meal, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the meal.**
   - Cost of chicken wings: $6
   - Cost of chicken salad: $4
   - Cost of sodas: 2 sodas at $1.00 each = 2 * $1.00 = $2
   - Tax: $3

   Now, we will sum these amounts to find the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of chicken wings} + \text{Cost of chicken salad} + \text{Cost of sodas} + \text{Tax}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6 + 4 + 2 + 3
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 15
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Lee and his friend had.**
   - Lee had $10 and his friend had $8.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = \text{Lee's money} + \text{Friend's money}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 10 + 8
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 18
   \]

3. **Calculate the change they should receive.**
   To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the meal from the total amount of money they had.
   \[
   \text{Change} = \text{Total money} - \text{Total cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Change} = 18 - 15
   \]
   \[
   \text{Change} = 3
   \]

4. **Final answer.**
   The total change that Lee and his friend should have received is **$3**. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much money Lee and his friend had in total. 

Lee had $10 and his friend had $8. 

So, $10 (Lee's money) + $8 (friend's money) = $18

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the food and drinks they ordered.

They ordered chicken wings for $6, a chicken salad for $4, and 2 sodas for $1.00 each. 

So, $6 (chicken wings) + $4 (chicken salad) + $2 (sodas) = $12

Then, we need to add the tax to the total cost of the food and drinks.
