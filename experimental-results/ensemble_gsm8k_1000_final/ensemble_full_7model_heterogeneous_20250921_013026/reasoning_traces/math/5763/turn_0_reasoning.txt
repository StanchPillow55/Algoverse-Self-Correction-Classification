=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will calculate the earnings for each day (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) and then sum them up to find the total earnings over the three days.

1. **Earnings on Friday**:
   The problem states that the 5th graders raised $147 on Friday.
   \[
   \text{Earnings on Friday} = 147
   \]

2. **Earnings on Saturday**:
   The problem states that on Saturday, they made $7 more than twice their Friday earnings. We can express this mathematically as:
   \[
   \text{Earnings on Saturday} = 2 \times \text{Earnings on Friday} + 7
   \]
   Substituting the earnings from Friday:
   \[
   \text{Earnings on Saturday} = 2 \times 147 + 7
   \]
   Calculating this step-by-step:
   \[
   2 \times 147 = 294
   \]
   Now adding 7:
   \[
   294 + 7 = 301
   \]
   Therefore, the earnings on Saturday are:
   \[
   \text{Earnings on Saturday} = 301
   \]

3. **Earnings on Sunday**:
   The problem states that their earnings on Sunday are $78 more than their earnings on Friday. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Earnings on Sunday} = \text{Earnings on Friday} + 78
   \]
   Substituting the earnings from Friday:
   \[
   \text{Earnings on Sunday} = 147 + 78
   \]
   Calculating this:
   \[
   147 + 78 = 225
   \]
   Therefore, the earnings on Sunday are:
   \[
   \text{Earnings on Sunday} = 225
   \]

4. **Total Earnings**:
   Now we will sum the earnings from all three days:
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings on Friday} + \text{Earnings on Saturday} + \text{Earnings on Sunday}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = 147 + 301 + 225
   \]
   Calculating this step-by-step:
   \[
   147 + 301 = 448
   \]
   Now adding Sunday’s earnings:
   \[
   448 + 225 = 673
   \]

Thus, the total earnings over the three days is:
\[
\boxed{673}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that the 5th graders raised $147 on Friday.

Second, we're told that on Saturday, they made $7 more than twice their Friday earnings. To find out how much they made on Saturday, we need to double their Friday earnings and then add $7. 

So, 2 * $147 = $294. Then, $294 + $7 = $301. So, they made $301 on Saturday.

Third, we're told that their earnings on Sunday are $78 more than their earnings on Friday. So, we add...
