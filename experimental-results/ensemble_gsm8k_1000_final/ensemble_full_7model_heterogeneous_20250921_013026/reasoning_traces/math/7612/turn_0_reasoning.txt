=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of pink gumballs in the candy machine based on the information given about the blue gumballs.

1. **Identify the number of blue gumballs**: 
   We are told that there are 12 blue gumballs.

2. **Set up the relationship for pink gumballs**: 
   According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is described as "22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs." We can express this relationship mathematically.

   Let \( b \) represent the number of blue gumballs, and \( p \) represent the number of pink gumballs. The relationship can be written as:
   \[
   p = 4b + 22
   \]

3. **Substitute the number of blue gumballs into the equation**:
   Since we know \( b = 12 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:
   \[
   p = 4(12) + 22
   \]

4. **Calculate the value**:
   First, calculate \( 4 \times 12 \):
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48
   \]
   Now, add 22 to this result:
   \[
   p = 48 + 22 = 70
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   The number of pink gumballs in the candy machine is \( 70 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{70}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs.
- There are 12 blue gumballs.

Step 1: Find the relationship between the number of pink gumballs and the number of blue gumballs.
Let x = the number of blue gumballs
Then, the number of pink gumballs = 4x + 22

Step 2: Substitute the given value for the number of blue gumballs.
x = 12

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of pink gumballs as P and the number of blue gumballs as B.

According to the problem, we have the following relationship:

P = 4B + 22

We know that there are 12 blue gumballs, so we can substitute B = 12 into the equation:

P = 4*12 + 22
P = 48 + 22
P = 70

So, there are 70 pink gumballs in the candy machine.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to set up an equation and solve for the number of pink gumballs.

Given:
- There are 12 blue gumballs.
- The number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs.

Step 1: Let's define a variable for the number of pink gumballs.
Let x = the number of pink gumballs

Step 2: Express the number of pink gumballs in terms of the number of blue gumballs....
