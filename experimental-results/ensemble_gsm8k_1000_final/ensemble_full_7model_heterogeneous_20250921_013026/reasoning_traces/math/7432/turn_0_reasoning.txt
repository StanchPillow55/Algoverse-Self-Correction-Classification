=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many hours Mike worked, we need to calculate the total time he spent on each task and then convert that time into hours.

### Step 1: Calculate the time spent washing cars
Mike washes 9 cars, and it takes him 10 minutes to wash each car. 

\[
\text{Time for washing cars} = \text{Number of cars} \times \text{Time per car}
\]
\[
\text{Time for washing cars} = 9 \text{ cars} \times 10 \text{ minutes/car} = 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time spent changing oil
Mike changes the oil on 6 cars, and it takes him 15 minutes to change the oil on each car.

\[
\text{Time for changing oil} = \text{Number of cars} \times \text{Time per car}
\]
\[
\text{Time for changing oil} = 6 \text{ cars} \times 15 \text{ minutes/car} = 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the time spent changing tires
Mike changes 2 sets of tires, and it takes him 30 minutes to change each set.

\[
\text{Time for changing tires} = \text{Number of sets} \times \text{Time per set}
\]
\[
\text{Time for changing tires} = 2 \text{ sets} \times 30 \text{ minutes/set} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total time spent
Now we add the time spent on all tasks:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time for washing cars} + \text{Time for changing oil} + \text{Time for changing tires}
\]
\[
\text{Total time} = 90 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Convert total time from minutes to hours
To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[
\text{Total time in hours} = \frac{\text{Total time in minutes}}{60}
\]
\[
\text{Total time in hours} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer
Mike worked a total of **4 hours**.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total time Mike spent on each task. 

For washing cars, since it takes 10 minutes to wash one car and he washed 9 cars, he spent 10 minutes/car * 9 cars = 90 minutes washing cars.

For changing oil, since it takes 15 minutes to change oil on one car and he changed oil on 6 cars, he spent 15 minutes/car * 6 cars = 90 minutes changing oil.

For changing tires, since it takes 30 minutes to change a set of tires and he changed two sets of tires...
