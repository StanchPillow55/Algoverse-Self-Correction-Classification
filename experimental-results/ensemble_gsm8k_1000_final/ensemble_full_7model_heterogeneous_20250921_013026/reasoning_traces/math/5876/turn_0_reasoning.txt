=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will calculate the height of each stack of blocks step by step and then sum them up to find the total number of blocks Thomas used.

1. **First Stack**: 
   - The first stack has 7 blocks.
   \[
   \text{First Stack} = 7 \text{ blocks}
   \]

2. **Second Stack**: 
   - The second stack is 3 blocks taller than the first stack.
   \[
   \text{Second Stack} = \text{First Stack} + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10 \text{ blocks}
   \]

3. **Third Stack**: 
   - The third stack is 6 blocks shorter than the second stack.
   \[
   \text{Third Stack} = \text{Second Stack} - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4 \text{ blocks}
   \]

4. **Fourth Stack**: 
   - The fourth stack is 10 blocks taller than the third stack.
   \[
   \text{Fourth Stack} = \text{Third Stack} + 10 = 4 + 10 = 14 \text{ blocks}
   \]

5. **Fifth Stack**: 
   - The fifth stack has twice as many blocks as the second stack.
   \[
   \text{Fifth Stack} = 2 \times \text{Second Stack} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ blocks}
   \]

Now, we will sum the number of blocks in all five stacks to find the total number of blocks Thomas used.

6. **Total Blocks**:
   \[
   \text{Total Blocks} = \text{First Stack} + \text{Second Stack} + \text{Third Stack} + \text{Fourth Stack} + \text{Fifth Stack}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Blocks} = 7 + 10 + 4 + 14 + 20
   \]

Now, we will perform the addition step by step:
- First, add the first two stacks:
  \[
  7 + 10 = 17
  \]
- Next, add the third stack:
  \[
  17 + 4 = 21
  \]
- Then, add the fourth stack:
  \[
  21 + 14 = 35
  \]
- Finally, add the fifth stack:
  \[
  35 + 20 = 55
  \]

Thus, the total number of blocks Thomas used is:
\[
\boxed{55}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

1. The first stack was 7 blocks tall.
2. The second stack was 3 blocks taller than the first, so it was 7 + 3 = 10 blocks tall.
3. The third stack was 6 blocks shorter than the second stack, so it was 10 - 6 = 4 blocks tall.
4. The fourth stack was 10 blocks taller than the third stack, so it was 4 + 10 = 14 blocks tall.
5. The fifth stack has twice as many blocks as the second stack, so it was 10 x 2...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of blocks in each stack and then sum them all up.

1. **First Stack:**
   - The first stack is given as 7 blocks tall.
   - Therefore, the number of blocks in the first stack is \(7\).

2. **Second Stack:**
   - The second stack is 3 blocks taller than the first stack.
   - Therefore, the number of blocks in the second stack is \(7 + 3 = 10\).

3. **Third Stack:**
   - The third stack is 6 blocks shorter than the sec...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that the first stack is 7 blocks tall.

Second, the second stack is 3 blocks taller than the first stack. So, the second stack is 7 blocks + 3 blocks = 10 blocks tall.

Third, the third stack is 6 blocks shorter than the second stack. So, the third stack is 10 blocks - 6 blocks = 4 blocks tall.

Fourth, the fourth stack is 10 blocks taller than the third stack. So, the fourth stack is 4 blocks + 10 blocks = 14 blocks ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by finding the number of blocks in each stack and then add them together to get the total number of blocks Thomas used.

Given:
- The first stack is 7 blocks tall.
- The second stack is 3 blocks taller than the first stack.
- The third stack is 6 blocks shorter than the second stack.
- The fourth stack is 10 blocks taller than the third stack.
- The fifth stack has twice as many blocks as the sec...
