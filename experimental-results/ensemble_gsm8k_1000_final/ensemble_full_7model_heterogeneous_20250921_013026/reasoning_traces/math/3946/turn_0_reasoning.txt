=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Quantity of Brownies**:
   Mother made 2 dozen brownies. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we calculate the total number of brownies made:
   \[
   2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. **Brownies Eaten by Father**:
   Father ate 8 brownies. We need to subtract this from the initial quantity:
   \[
   24 \text{ brownies} - 8 \text{ brownies} = 16 \text{ brownies remaining}
   \]

3. **Brownies Eaten by Mooney**:
   Next, Mooney ate 4 brownies. We subtract this from the remaining brownies:
   \[
   16 \text{ brownies} - 4 \text{ brownies} = 12 \text{ brownies remaining}
   \]

4. **Brownies Made the Next Morning**:
   The next morning, Mother made another 2 dozen brownies. Again, we calculate the total:
   \[
   2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ brownies}
   \]

5. **Total Brownies on the Counter**:
   Now, we add the brownies remaining from the previous day to the new batch made:
   \[
   12 \text{ brownies remaining} + 24 \text{ new brownies} = 36 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Thus, the total number of brownies on the counter after Mother made the new batch is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Mother made 2 dozen brownies and placed them on the kitchen counter to cool.
- Father ate 8 of the brownies.
- Mooney ate 4 of the brownies.
- The next day, Mother made another 2 dozen brownies and added them to the remaining brownies.

Step 1: Calculate the number of brownies Mother made initially.
2 dozen brownies = 2 × 12 = 24 brownies

Step 2: Calculate the number of brownies ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of brownies at each step of the scenario described. Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Batch of Brownies:**
   - Mother made 2 dozen brownies. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen brownies is:
     \[
     2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ brownies}
     \]

2. **Father Eats Brownies:**
   - Father ate 8 brownies. So, we subtract 8 from the initial 24 brownies:
     \[
     24 - 8 = 16 \text{ brownies r...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's figure out how many brownies Mother originally made. A dozen is 12, so two dozen is 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 brownies.

Father ate 8 brownies, so there were 24 - 8 = <<24-8=16>>16 brownies left.

Then, Mooney ate 4 brownies, so there were 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 brownies left.

The next morning, Mother made another two dozen brownies. Again, two dozen is 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 brownies.

So, after adding the new batch of brownies to those remaining from the day ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mother made 2 dozen brownies initially.
   * Father ate 8 brownies.
   * Mooney ate 4 brownies.
   * The next morning, Mother made another 2 dozen brownies and added them to the remaining ones.

2. Convert 2 dozen brownies to a number:
   * 1 dozen = 12
   * 2 dozen = 2 × 12 = 24 brownies

3. Calculate the number of brownies left after Father and Mooney ate some:
