=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let \( x \) be the number of clownfish in the aquarium. Since the number of clownfish is equal to the number of blowfish, we also have \( x \) blowfish.

The total number of fish in the aquarium is given as 100. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
x + x = 100
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x = 100
\]

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

\[
x = 50
\]

So, there are 50 clownfish and 50 blowfish in the aquarium.

Next, we know that 26 of the blowfish stay in their own tank. Therefore, the number of blowfish that swim into the display tank is:

\[
50 - 26 = 24
\]

Now, an equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank, which means 24 clownfish also swim into the display tank.

At this point, the total number of fish in the display tank is:

\[
24 \text{ (blowfish)} + 24 \text{ (clownfish)} = 48 \text{ fish}
\]

Next, we are told that a third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank. The number of clownfish in the display tank is 24, so a third of this number is:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 24 = 8
\]

Thus, 8 clownfish swim back to their own tank. Therefore, the number of clownfish remaining in the display tank is:

\[
24 - 8 = 16
\]

Finally, the number of clownfish now in the display tank is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): Let \( x \) be the number of clownfish in the aquarium. Since the number of clownfish is equal to the number of blowfish, we also have \( x \) blowfish.

The total number of fish in the aquarium is given as 100. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
x + x = 100
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x = 100
\]

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

\[
x = 50
\]

So, there are 50 clownfish and 50 blowfish in the aquarium.

Next, we know that 26 of the blowfish stay in their own...

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The aquarium holds an equal number of clownfish and blowfish.
- 26 of the blowfish stay in their own tank.
- The remaining blowfish swim into a display tank.
- An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank.
- Then, a third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank.
- The aquarium holds a combined total of 100 fish.

Step 1: Find the total number of blow...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and solve for the number of clownfish in the display tank.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( C \) be the number of clownfish.
   - Let \( B \) be the number of blowfish.

2. **Set Up Initial Conditions:**
   - We know from the problem that the aquarium holds an equal number of clownfish and blowfish, so:
     \[
     C = B
     \]

3. **Total Number of Fish:**
   - The total number of f...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the total number of clownfish and blowfish as C and B respectively. 

According to the problem, the aquarium holds an equal number of clownfish and blowfish, so we can say that C = B. 

The problem also states that the aquarium holds a combined total of 100 fish, so we can write this as C + B = 100. 

Since C = B, we can substitute B for C in the equation, giving us 2B = 100. 

Solving for B, we find that B = 100 / 2 = 50. 

So, there are 50 blowfish and 50 c...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The aquarium has an equal number of clownfish and blowfish.
   * The total number of fish in the aquarium is 100.
   * 26 blowfish stay in their own tank, and the rest swim into the display tank.
   * An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank.
   * One-third of the clownfish in the display tank swim back to their own tank.

2. Find the to...
