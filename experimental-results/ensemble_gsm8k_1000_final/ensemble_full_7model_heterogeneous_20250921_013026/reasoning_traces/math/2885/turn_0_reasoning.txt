Final Answer: To find out how much money Tina has left after her savings and expenses, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Savings**: We will add up the amounts Tina saved in June, July, and August.
2. **Calculate Total Expenses**: We will add up the amounts Tina spent on books and shoes.
3. **Calculate Remaining Amount**: We will subtract the total expenses from the total savings to find out how much money Tina has left.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Savings

Tina saved the following amounts:
- June: $27
- July: $14
- August: $21

Now, we will add these amounts together:

\[
\text{Total Savings} = 27 + 14 + 21
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

- First, add June and July:
  \[
  27 + 14 = 41
  \]

- Next, add the result to August's savings:
  \[
  41 + 21 = 62
  \]

So, Tina's total savings is **$62**.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Expenses

Tina spent the following amounts:
- Books: $5
- Shoes: $17

Now, we will add these expenses together:

\[
\text{Total Expenses} = 5 + 17
\]

Calculating this:

\[
5 + 17 = 22
\]

So, Tina's total expenses are **$22**.

### Step 3: Calculate Remaining Amount

Now, we will subtract the total expenses from the total savings to find out how much money Tina has left:

\[
\text{Remaining Amount} = \text{Total Savings} - \text{Total Expenses}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Remaining Amount} = 62 - 22
\]

Calculating this:

\[
62 - 22 = 40
\]

Thus, Tina has **$40** left after her savings and expenses.

### Final Answer

Tina has **$40** left.
