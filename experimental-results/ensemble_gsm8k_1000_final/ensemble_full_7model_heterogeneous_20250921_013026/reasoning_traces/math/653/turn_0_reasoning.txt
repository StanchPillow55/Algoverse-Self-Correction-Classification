=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find Fred's weekly allowance, we can set up an equation based on the information provided in the problem.

1. **Define Variables**:
   Let \( A \) be Fred's weekly allowance.

2. **Understand the Spending and Earnings**:
   - Fred spent half of his allowance going to the movies. This can be expressed as \( \frac{A}{2} \).
   - He earned 6 dollars from washing the family car.

3. **Calculate Fred's Remaining Money**:
   After spending half of his allowance and earning money from washing the car, Fred's remaining money can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Money} = \text{Allowance} - \text{Spent Money} + \text{Earnings}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Money} = A - \frac{A}{2} + 6
   \]

4. **Simplify the Expression**:
   - The term \( A - \frac{A}{2} \) simplifies to \( \frac{A}{2} \) (because \( A \) is the same as \( \frac{2A}{2} \)):
   \[
   \text{Remaining Money} = \frac{A}{2} + 6
   \]

5. **Set Up the Equation**:
   We know that Fred ended up with 14 dollars, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{A}{2} + 6 = 14
   \]

6. **Solve for \( A \)**:
   - First, subtract 6 from both sides:
   \[
   \frac{A}{2} = 14 - 6
   \]
   \[
   \frac{A}{2} = 8
   \]
   - Next, multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( A \):
   \[
   A = 8 \times 2
   \]
   \[
   A = 16
   \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   Fred's weekly allowance is \( \boxed{16} \) dollars. 

This solution is verified by checking the calculations:
- If Fred's allowance is 16 dollars, he spends half (8 dollars) on movies, earns 6 dollars from washing the car, and ends up with:
\[
16 - 8 + 6 = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]
This confirms that our solution is correct.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote Fred's weekly allowance as A. 

According to the problem, Fred spent half of his allowance on the movies. This means he was left with half of his allowance. 

Then, Fred earned 6 dollars by washing the car. So, we add this amount to the remaining half of his allowance. 

Finally, we know that Fred ended up with 14 dollars. 

We can express all this information in a single equation:

1/2 * A + 6 = 14

To solve for A, we first subtract 6 from both sides of the ...
