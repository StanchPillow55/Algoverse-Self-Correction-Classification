=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out what percentage of the flyers Belinda passed out, we first need to determine how many flyers she distributed. We know the total number of flyers and how many each of her friends passed out.

1. **Total Flyers**: 200
2. **Flyers Distributed by Friends**:
   - Ryan: 42
   - Alyssa: 67
   - Scott: 51

3. **Calculate the Total Flyers Distributed by Friends**:
   \[
   \text{Total by Friends} = \text{Ryan} + \text{Alyssa} + \text{Scott}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total by Friends} = 42 + 67 + 51
   \]

   Now, let's perform the addition step-by-step:
   - First, add Ryan's and Alyssa's flyers:
     \[
     42 + 67 = 109
     \]
   - Next, add Scott's flyers to this total:
     \[
     109 + 51 = 160
     \]

   So, the total number of flyers distributed by Ryan, Alyssa, and Scott is 160.

4. **Calculate the Number of Flyers Belinda Passed Out**:
   To find out how many flyers Belinda passed out, we subtract the total flyers distributed by her friends from the total number of flyers:
   \[
   \text{Flyers by Belinda} = \text{Total Flyers} - \text{Total by Friends}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Flyers by Belinda} = 200 - 160 = 40
   \]

5. **Calculate the Percentage of Flyers Belinda Passed Out**:
   To find the percentage of flyers that Belinda passed out, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Flyers by Belinda}}{\text{Total Flyers}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{40}{200} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Now, calculate the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{40}{200} = 0.2
   \]

   Now multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
   \[
   0.2 \times 100 = 20
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   Belinda passed out **20%** of the flyers.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20\%}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of flyers Belinda passed out and then calculate the percentage of the total flyers that she passed out.

Given information:
- Belinda made 200 flyers.
- Ryan passed out 42 flyers.
- Alyssa passed out 67 flyers.
- Scott passed out 51 flyers.

Step 1: Find the total number of flyers passed out by Ryan, Alyssa, and Scott.
Total flyers passed out by Ryan, Alyssa, and Scott = 42 + 67 + 51 = 160 flyers

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many flyers Belinda passed out and then calculate what percentage of the total flyers this represents.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of flyers passed out by Ryan, Alyssa, and Scott.**

- Ryan passed out 42 flyers.
- Alyssa passed out 67 flyers.
- Scott passed out 51 flyers.

To find the total number of flyers passed out by these three friends, we add their individual contributions:

\[
42 + 67 + 51 = 160
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many flyers Belinda passed out. We do this by subtracting the number of flyers that Ryan, Alyssa, and Scott passed out from the total number of flyers. 

The total number of flyers passed out by Ryan, Alyssa, and Scott is 42 + 67 + 51 = 160 flyers.

So, Belinda passed out 200 - 160 = 40 flyers.

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the total number of flyers this is. We do this by dividing the number of flyers Belinda passed out by t...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Belinda made a total of 200 flyers.
   * Ryan passed out 42 flyers.
   * Alyssa passed out 67 flyers.
   * Scott passed out 51 flyers.
   * Belinda passed out the remaining flyers.

2. Calculate the total number of flyers passed out by Ryan, Alyssa, and Scott:
