=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many customers are in the group that arrived at the café, given the total number of bacon sandwiches ordered and made.

1. **Calculate the total number of bacon sandwiches ordered by the local offices:**
   - There are 3 local offices, and each has ordered 10 bacon sandwiches.
   - Total sandwiches ordered by offices = Number of offices × Sandwiches per office
   \[
   \text{Total sandwiches from offices} = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of bacon sandwiches made by the café:**
   - The café made a total of 54 bacon sandwiches.

3. **Calculate the number of bacon sandwiches requested by the group of customers:**
   - To find out how many sandwiches were made for the group, we subtract the number of sandwiches ordered by the offices from the total made.
   \[
   \text{Sandwiches for the group} = \text{Total sandwiches made} - \text{Total sandwiches from offices}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Sandwiches for the group} = 54 - 30 = 24
   \]

4. **Determine how many sandwiches each customer in the group ordered:**
   - It is given that half of the group has asked for 4 bacon sandwiches each. Let \( x \) be the total number of customers in the group. Therefore, half of the group is \( \frac{x}{2} \).
   - The total number of sandwiches requested by the group can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total sandwiches for the group} = \left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \times 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total sandwiches for the group} = 2x
   \]

5. **Set up the equation:**
   - We know from step 3 that the total sandwiches for the group is 24. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x = 24
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{24}{2} = 12
   \]

Thus, the total number of customers in the group that arrived at the café is \( \boxed{12} \).

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The café has received orders from 3 local offices, each ordering 10 bacon sandwiches. This means that the café needs to make 3 * 10 = <<3*10=30>>30 bacon sandwiches for the offices.

The café has made a total of 54 bacon sandwiches, so the number of sandwiches made for the group that arrived is 54 - 30 = <<54-30=24>>24 bacon sandwiches.

Half of the group that arrived has asked for 4 bacon sandwiches each. This means that the number of customers in this half of the group ...
