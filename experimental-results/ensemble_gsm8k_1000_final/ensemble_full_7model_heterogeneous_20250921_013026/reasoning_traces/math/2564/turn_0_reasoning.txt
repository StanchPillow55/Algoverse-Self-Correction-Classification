=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money John made from fixing the racecar and winning the race, we will break the problem down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of fixing the racecar after the discount.

The original cost to fix the racecar is $20,000. John receives a 20% discount on this cost.

First, we calculate the amount of the discount:
\[
\text{Discount} = 20\% \text{ of } 20,000 = 0.20 \times 20,000 = 4,000
\]

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to find the final cost:
\[
\text{Final cost} = 20,000 - 4,000 = 16,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the amount John keeps from the prize money.

John wins a prize of $70,000 but only keeps 90% of this amount. We calculate how much he keeps:
\[
\text{Amount kept} = 90\% \text{ of } 70,000 = 0.90 \times 70,000 = 63,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate John's profit from the racecar.

To find out how much money John made from the car, we need to subtract the final cost of fixing the racecar from the amount he keeps from the prize money:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Amount kept} - \text{Final cost}
\]
Substituting the values we calculated:
\[
\text{Profit} = 63,000 - 16,000 = 47,000
\]

### Final Answer

John made **$47,000** from the car after fixing it and winning the race.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- The cost to fix the racecar is $20,000.
- John gets a 20% discount on the cost to fix the racecar.
- John wins a race with a prize of $70,000.
- John only keeps 90% of the prize money.

Step 1: Calculate the discounted cost to fix the racecar.
Original cost to fix the racecar = $20,000
Discount rate = 20%
Discounted cost = Original cost - (Original cost × Discount rate)
Discounted...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how much money John made from the car, we need to consider both the cost of fixing the car and the prize money he received from winning the race. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost of fixing the car with the discount:**

   The original cost to fix the car is $20,000. John receives a 20% discount on this cost. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $20,000:

   \[
   \text{Discount} = 20\% \times 20,000 = 0.20 \time...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how much John paid to fix the racecar after receiving a 20% discount. 

The discount amount is calculated by multiplying the original cost by the discount rate. 

So, the discount amount is $20,000 * 20/100 = $4,000.

Subtracting the discount from the original cost, we find that John paid $20,000 - $4,000 = $16,000 to fix the racecar.

Next, we need to calculate how much money John kept after winning the race. 

He keeps 90% of the $70,000 priz...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step by step and solve it:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The cost to fix the racecar is $20,000.
   * John gets a 20% discount on the fixing cost.
   * John wins the race and the prize is $70,000.
   * John keeps 90% of the prize money.

2. Calculate the discounted cost of fixing the racecar:
   * Discount amount = 20% of $20,000
   * Discount amount = 0.20 × $20,000 = $4,000
   * Discounted cost = Origi...
