Final Answer: Let's denote the total number of pieces of bread thrown into the pond as \( x \).

According to the problem, we have three ducks that eat the bread in the following manner:

1. The first duck eats half of all the pieces of bread, which is \( \frac{x}{2} \).
2. The second duck eats 13 pieces of bread.
3. The third duck eats 7 pieces of bread.

After these ducks have eaten, there are 30 pieces of bread left in the pond. Therefore, we can set up the equation based on the total pieces of bread eaten and the pieces left:

\[
\text{Total pieces eaten} + \text{Pieces left} = \text{Total pieces thrown}
\]

Substituting the values we know:

\[
\left( \frac{x}{2} + 13 + 7 \right) + 30 = x
\]

Now, simplify the left side:

\[
\frac{x}{2} + 20 + 30 = x
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x}{2} + 50 = x
\]

Next, we want to isolate \( x \). To do this, we can subtract \( \frac{x}{2} \) from both sides:

\[
50 = x - \frac{x}{2}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
50 = \frac{2x}{2} - \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{2}
\]

Now, to solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2:

\[
100 = x
\]

Thus, the total number of pieces of bread thrown into the pond is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]

To verify our solution, we can check the calculations:

1. Total pieces of bread thrown: \( 100 \)
2. First duck eats: \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \)
3. Second duck eats: \( 13 \)
4. Third duck eats: \( 7 \)

Total eaten:

\[
50 + 13 + 7 = 70
\]

Pieces left in the pond:

\[
100 - 70 = 30
\]

Since this matches the problem statement, our solution is confirmed. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pieces of bread thrown into the pond.

Given information:
- There are 3 ducks in the pond.
- One duck eats half of all the pieces of bread.
- Another duck eats 13 pieces of bread.
- The last duck eats 7 pieces of bread.
- There are 30 pieces of bread left in the water.

Step 1: Find the number of pieces of bread eaten by the duck that ate half of all the pieces.
Let's assume the total number o...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pieces of bread that were initially thrown into the pond. Let's denote the total number of pieces of bread as \( x \).

We know the following from the problem statement:
1. One duck eats half of all the pieces of bread.
2. Another duck eats 13 pieces of bread.
3. The last duck eats 7 pieces of bread.
4. There are 30 pieces of bread left in the water.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Duck 1**...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the total number of pieces of bread thrown in the pond as X.

According to the problem, one duck eats half of all the pieces of bread, another duck eats 13 pieces, the third duck eats 7 pieces, and there are still 30 pieces left in the pond.

This can be represented by the equation:

X/2 + 13 + 7 + 30 = X

Solving this equation will give us the total number of pieces of bread thrown in the pond.

First, let's simplify the right side of the equation:

X/2 + 50...
