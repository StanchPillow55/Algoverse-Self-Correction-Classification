=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's define the variables for the number of passes thrown by the quarterback:

- Let \( L \) be the number of passes thrown to the left side of the field.
- Let \( R \) be the number of passes thrown to the right side of the field.
- Let \( C \) be the number of passes thrown to the center of the field.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The total number of passes thrown is 50:
   \[
   L + R + C = 50
   \]

2. The quarterback throws twice as many passes to the right than to the left:
   \[
   R = 2L
   \]

3. He throws 2 more passes to the center than he does to the left:
   \[
   C = L + 2
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( R \) and \( C \) into the total passes equation.

Substituting \( R \) and \( C \) into the first equation:
\[
L + R + C = 50
\]
becomes:
\[
L + 2L + (L + 2) = 50
\]

Now, simplify the equation:
\[
L + 2L + L + 2 = 50
\]
\[
4L + 2 = 50
\]

Next, we will isolate \( L \) by first subtracting 2 from both sides:
\[
4L = 50 - 2
\]
\[
4L = 48
\]

Now, divide both sides by 4:
\[
L = \frac{48}{4}
\]
\[
L = 12
\]

Now that we have \( L \), we can find \( R \) and \( C \) using the relationships we established earlier.

Calculating \( R \):
\[
R = 2L = 2 \times 12 = 24
\]

Calculating \( C \):
\[
C = L + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14
\]

Now, let's verify that these values satisfy the total number of passes:
\[
L + R + C = 12 + 24 + 14 = 50
\]

Since the total is indeed 50, our calculations are correct.

Thus, the number of passes thrown to the left side of the field is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many passes the quarterback threw to the left side of the field. Let's define some variables to help us set up the equations:

- Let \( L \) represent the number of passes thrown to the left side of the field.
- According to the problem, the quarterback throws twice as many passes to the right as he does to the left. Therefore, the number of passes thrown to the right side of the field is \( 2L \).

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of passes the quarterback throws to the left side of the field as L. According to the problem, he throws twice as many passes to the right side of the field, so we can denote the number of passes to the right as 2L. He also throws 2 more passes to the center of the field than he did to the left, so we can denote the number of passes to the center as L + 2.

The total number of passes is 50, so we can set up the following equation:

L (left) + 2L (r...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to set up an equation and solve for the number of passes thrown to the left side of the field.

Given:
- The quarterback throws a total of 50 passes in the game.
- He throws twice as many passes to the right of the field than to the left.
- He throws 2 more passes to the center of the field than to the left.
