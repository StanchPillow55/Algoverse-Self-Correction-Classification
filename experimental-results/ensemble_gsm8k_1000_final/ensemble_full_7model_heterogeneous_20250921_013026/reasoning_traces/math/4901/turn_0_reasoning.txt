=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine your current age based on the information provided about your dog.

1. **Understanding the dog's age**: We know that in two years, your dog will be 4 years old. This means that currently, your dog is:
   \[
   4 \text{ years} - 2 \text{ years} = 2 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **Relating your age to your dog's age**: The problem states that you were 15 years old when your dog was born. Since your dog is currently 2 years old, we can calculate your current age by adding the age of your dog to your age when the dog was born:
   \[
   \text{Your current age} = \text{Your age when dog was born} + \text{Dog's current age}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \text{Your current age} = 15 \text{ years} + 2 \text{ years} = 17 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Final answer**: Therefore, your current age is:
   \[
   \boxed{17}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Your dog was born when you were 15 years old.
- Two years from now, your dog will turn 4 years old.

To find your current age, we need to work backwards from the information provided.

Step 1: Determine how old your dog is now.
Since your dog will turn 4 years old two years from now, that means your dog is currently 2 years old.

Step 2: Determine how old you were when your dog was born.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine your current age based on the information provided about your dog's age and your age when the dog was born.

Let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Determine the dog's current age:**
   - We know that two years from now, your dog will be 4 years old.
   - Therefore, to find the dog's current age, we subtract 2 years from 4 years:
     \[
     \text{Dog's current age} = 4 \text{ years} - 2 \text{ years} = 2 \text{ ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that the dog was born when the person was 15 years old. It also states that two years from now, the dog will be 4 years old. 

This means that the dog is currently 2 years old (since 4 years - 2 years = 2 years). 

Since the dog was born when the person was 15 years old, and the dog is now 2 years old, this means that the person is now 17 years old (since 15 years + 2 years = 17 years). 

So, the person is 17 years old now.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * You were 15 years old when your dog was born.
   * Two years from now, your dog will be 4 years old.

2. Determine how old your dog is now:
   * Your dog will be 4 years old two years from now.
   * So, your dog's current age = 4 years - 2 years = 2 years old

3. Calculate how many years have passed since your dog was born:
   * Your dog's current age is 2 years ...
