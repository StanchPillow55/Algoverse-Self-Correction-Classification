=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine the total cost of sending John’s son to prep school for 13 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost per year**: 
   Since there are 2 semesters in a year and each semester costs $20,000, we can calculate the total cost for one year as follows:

   \[
   \text{Cost per year} = \text{Cost per semester} \times \text{Number of semesters per year}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per year} = 20,000 \times 2 = 40,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for 13 years**: 
   Now that we know the cost per year, we can find the total cost for 13 years:

   \[
   \text{Total cost for 13 years} = \text{Cost per year} \times \text{Number of years}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 13 years} = 40,000 \times 13
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   40,000 \times 13 = 520,000
   \]

Thus, the total cost to send John’s son to prep school for 13 years is **$520,000**.

Final answer: **$520,000**.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of sending the kid to prep school for 13 years.

Given information:
- The cost of prep school is $20,000 per semester.
- There are 2 semesters in a year.
- The kid will attend prep school for 13 years.

Step 1: Calculate the cost per year.
Cost per semester × Number of semesters per year = Cost per year
$20,000 × 2 = $40,000 per year

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for 13 years.
Cost per year × N...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of sending John's son to prep school for 13 years, given that the cost per semester is $20,000 and there are 2 semesters in each year.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the cost per year:**
   - Since there are 2 semesters in a year and each semester costs $20,000, the cost per year is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost per year} = 2 \times \$20,000 = \$40,000
   \]

2. **Calcula...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The cost of sending John's son to prep school for one year is the cost per semester multiplied by the number of semesters in a year. 

So, the cost for one year is $20,000 * 2 = $40,000.

To find the total cost for 13 years of school, we multiply the cost for one year by the number of years. 

So, the total cost for 13 years is $40,000 * 13 = $520,000.

Therefore, it costs $520,000 to send John's son to 13 years of prep school.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The cost of prep school is $20,000 per semester.
   * There are 2 semesters in a year.
   * John wants to send his son to school for 13 years.

2. Calculate the cost per year:
   * Cost per year = Cost per semester × Number of semesters in a year
   * Cost per year = $20,000 × 2
   * Cost per year = $40,000

3. Calculate the total cost for 13 years:
   * Total cost = C...
