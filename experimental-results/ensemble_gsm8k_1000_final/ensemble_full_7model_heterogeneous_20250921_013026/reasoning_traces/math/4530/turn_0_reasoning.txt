=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine Marion's score based on the information given about Ella's performance on the exam.

1. **Determine Ella's score:**
   - Ella answered 4 questions incorrectly on a 40-item exam. 
   - To find Ella's score, we first calculate how many questions she answered correctly:
     \[
     \text{Correct answers by Ella} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Incorrect answers} = 40 - 4 = 36
     \]
   - Therefore, Ella's score is 36.

2. **Determine Marion's score:**
   - According to the problem, Marion's score is 6 more than half of Ella's score.
   - First, we need to calculate half of Ella's score:
     \[
     \text{Half of Ella's score} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
     \]
   - Now, we add 6 to this value to find Marion's score:
     \[
     \text{Marion's score} = 18 + 6 = 24
     \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - Marion's score is \( \boxed{24} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find Marion's score on the 40-item Statistics exam.

Given information:
- The exam has 40 items.
- Ella got 4 incorrect answers.
- Marion got 6 more than half the score of Ella.

Step 1: Find Ella's score.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine Marion's score on the 40-item Statistics exam based on the information given about Ella's performance.

1. **Determine Ella's Score:**
   - The exam consists of 40 items.
   - Ella got 4 incorrect answers.
   - Therefore, Ella's score is the total number of items minus the number of incorrect answers.
   \[
   \text{Ella's score} = 40 - 4 = 36
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Ella got 4 incorrect answers in a 40-item exam. This means she got 40 - 4 = 36 correct answers.

Half of Ella's score is 36 / 2 = 18.

Marion got 6 more than half the score of Ella. This means Marion got 18 + 6 = 24 correct answers.

Therefore, Marion's score is 24.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The exam has 40 items in total.
   * Ella got 4 incorrect answers.
   * Marion got 6 more than half the score of Ella.

2. Calculate Ella's score:
