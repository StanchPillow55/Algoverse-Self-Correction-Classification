=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate how many slices of bread Tony used throughout the week and then determine how many slices are left from the original 22-slice loaf.

1. **Determine the number of sandwiches Tony made during the week:**
   - Tony made a sandwich every day from Monday to Friday (5 days).
   - Each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread.
   - Therefore, the total number of sandwiches made during the week is:
     \[
     5 \text{ sandwiches}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total slices of bread used from Monday to Friday:**
   - Since each sandwich uses 2 slices of bread, the total number of slices used from Monday to Friday is:
     \[
     5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 2 \text{ slices/sandwich} = 10 \text{ slices}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of sandwiches made on Saturday:**
   - On Saturday, Tony was extra hungry and made 2 sandwiches.
   - The total slices of bread used on Saturday is:
     \[
     2 \text{ sandwiches} \times 2 \text{ slices/sandwich} = 4 \text{ slices}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total slices of bread used for the entire week:**
   - Now, we add the slices used from Monday to Friday and the slices used on Saturday:
     \[
     10 \text{ slices (Mon-Fri)} + 4 \text{ slices (Sat)} = 14 \text{ slices}
     \]

5. **Determine how many slices of bread are left:**
   - Tony started with a 22-slice loaf of bread. To find out how many slices are left after making the sandwiches, we subtract the total slices used from the original number of slices:
     \[
     22 \text{ slices} - 14 \text{ slices} = 8 \text{ slices}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that there are **8 slices of bread left** from the 22-slice loaf.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tony made 1 sandwich per day for 5 days (Monday through Friday)
- Each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread
- On Saturday, Tony made 2 sandwiches
- Tony started with a 22-slice loaf of bread

Step 1: Calculate the number of slices of bread used for the sandwiches made Monday through Friday.
Sandwiches made per day = 1
Slices of bread per sandwich = 2
Number of days = 5 (Monday through Frid...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices of bread Tony used throughout the week and then subtract that from the total number of slices in the loaf he started with.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of days Tony made sandwiches:**
   - Tony made a sandwich every day this week. A week has 7 days.

2. **Calculate the number of slices used per day:**
   - Each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread.
   - Therefore, for eac...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Tony makes a sandwich with two slices of bread. So, for one sandwich, he uses 2 slices of bread.

From Monday to Friday, he makes one sandwich each day. That's 5 days * 2 slices = 10 slices of bread.

On Saturday, he makes two sandwiches, which is 2 sandwiches * 2 slices = 4 slices of bread.

So, from Monday to Saturday, he uses 10 slices + 4 slices = 14 slices of bread.

He started with a 22-slice loaf. So, the number of slices left is 22 slices - 14 slices = 8 slices.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Tony made a sandwich with two slices of bread every day this week, except Saturday.
   * On Saturday, he made two sandwiches.
   * Tony started with a 22-slice loaf of bread.

2. Determine the number of days in a week:
   * There are 7 days in a week.

3. Calculate the number of slices used for sandwiches from Monday to Friday:
   * Tony used 2 slices per day for...
