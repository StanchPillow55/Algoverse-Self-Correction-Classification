=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many slices of pizza are available initially and then subtract the number of slices eaten by the guests.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices of pizza.**

We know that there are 4 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 12 slices. To find the total number of slices, we can use the following multiplication:

\[
\text{Total slices} = \text{Number of pizzas} \times \text{Slices per pizza}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Total slices} = 4 \times 12
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total slices} = 48
\]

So, there are 48 slices of pizza in total.

**Step 2: Determine how many slices are left after the guests eat.**

The guests eat 39 slices of pizza. To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

\[
\text{Slices left} = \text{Total slices} - \text{Slices eaten}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Slices left} = 48 - 39
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Slices left} = 9
\]

**Final Answer:**

There are 9 slices of pizza left after the guests eat.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 4 pizzas
- Each pizza is cut into 12 slices
- The guests eat 39 slices

Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices available.
Total number of slices = Number of pizzas × Number of slices per pizza
Total number of slices = 4 × 12 = 48 slices

Step 2: Calculate the number of slices left.
Number of slices left = Total number of slices - Number of slices eaten
Number of slices left = 4...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pizza slices are left after the guests have eaten some of them. Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Slices:**
   - We are given that there are 4 pizzas.
   - Each pizza is cut into 12 slices.
   - To find the total number of slices from all the pizzas, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:
     \[
     \text{Total slices} = 4 \text{ pizzas} \times...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out the total number of pizza slices available at the party. Since there are 4 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 12 slices, we can find the total number of slices by multiplying the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza. 

4 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 48 slices

Next, we know that the guests ate 39 slices. To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices.

48 slices - 39 slices...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 4 pizzas at the pool party.
   * Each pizza is cut into 12 slices.
   * The guests ate 39 slices.

2. Calculate the total number of pizza slices:
   * Total slices = Number of pizzas × Slices per pizza
   * Total slices = 4 × 12
   * Total slices = 48
   
   So, there were 48 slices of pizza in total.

3. Calculate the number of slices left:
   * Slices...
