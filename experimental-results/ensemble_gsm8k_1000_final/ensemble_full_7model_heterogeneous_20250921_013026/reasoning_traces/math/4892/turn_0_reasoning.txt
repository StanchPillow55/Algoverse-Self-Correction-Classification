=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Liam will have left after paying his bills, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount Liam has saved.**
   - Liam saves $500 per month.
   - He has been saving for 2 years.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, he has saved for:
     \[
     2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months}
     \]
   - Now, we can calculate the total savings:
     \[
     \text{Total savings} = \text{Monthly savings} \times \text{Number of months}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total savings} = 500 \text{ dollars/month} \times 24 \text{ months} = 12,000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total expenses for the trip and bills.**
   - The cost of the trip to Paris is $7,000.
   - The cost of his bills is $3,500.
   - We can find the total expenses by adding these two amounts:
     \[
     \text{Total expenses} = \text{Cost of trip} + \text{Cost of bills}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total expenses} = 7,000 \text{ dollars} + 3,500 \text{ dollars} = 10,500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate how much money Liam will have left after paying his bills.**
   - We subtract the total expenses from his total savings:
     \[
     \text{Money left} = \text{Total savings} - \text{Total expenses}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Money left} = 12,000 \text{ dollars} - 10,500 \text{ dollars} = 1,500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, after paying his bills and the cost of the trip, Liam will have **$1,500 left**.

Final answer: **$1,500**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Liam's trip to Paris costs $7,000
- Liam's bills cost $3,500
- Liam has saved $500 per month for 2 years

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Liam has saved over 2 years.
Savings per month = $500
Months in 2 years = 24 months
Total savings = $500 × 24 months = $12,000

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Liam needs to pay for his bills and trip.
Total expenses = Trip cost + Bills cost
Total...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Liam has saved, how much he needs to pay for his bills, and then calculate how much money he will have left after paying his bills.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Savings

Liam saves $500 per month. He has been saving for 2 years. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of months in 2 years:
\[ 
2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months} 
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of mone...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how much money Liam has saved over the 2 years. 

We know that he has saved $500 per month and there are 12 months in a year. So, for one year, he would have saved:

$500/month * 12 months/year = $6,000/year

Since he has been saving for 2 years, we multiply this yearly saving by 2:

$6,000/year * 2 years = $12,000

So, Liam has saved a total of $12,000 over the 2 years.

Next, we need to subtract the cost of his bills from his total savings to...

1. Understand the given information:
   * Liam's trip to Paris costs $7,000.
   * His bills cost $3,500.
   * Liam has been saving $500 per month for 2 years.
