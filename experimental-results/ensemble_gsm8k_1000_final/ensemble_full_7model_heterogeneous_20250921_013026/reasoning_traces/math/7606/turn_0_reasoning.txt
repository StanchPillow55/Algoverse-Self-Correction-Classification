=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, given the information about his walking on Monday and Tuesday.

1. **Determine Monday's mileage**:
   - On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

2. **Calculate Tuesday's mileage**:
   - On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. 
   - Therefore, Tuesday's mileage can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Tuesday's mileage} = 6 \times \text{Monday's mileage} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Set up the equation for total mileage**:
   - We know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. Let \( W \) represent the miles walked on Wednesday.
   - The equation for total mileage can be set up as follows:
     \[
     \text{Monday's mileage} + \text{Tuesday's mileage} + \text{Wednesday's mileage} = 41
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     4 + 24 + W = 41
     \]

4. **Solve for Wednesday's mileage**:
   - Combine the known miles:
     \[
     28 + W = 41
     \]
   - To isolate \( W \), subtract 28 from both sides:
     \[
     W = 41 - 28 = 13
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday is \( \boxed{13} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
- On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday.
- The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.

Step 1: Calculate the number of miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
Miles walked on Tuesday = 6 × Miles walked on Monday
Miles walked on Tuesday = 6 × 4 = 24 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total mileage from Monday and Tuesday.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. Since he walked 4 miles on Monday, this means he walked 6 * 4 = <<6*4=24>>24 miles on Tuesday.

So, on Monday and Tuesday combined, Walt walked 4 + 24 = <<4+24=28>>28 miles.

His total mileage Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. If he walked 28 miles on Monday and Tuesday combined, this means he walked 41 - 28 = <<41-28=13>>13 miles on Wednesday.

So, Walt walked 13 mil...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
   * On Tuesday, he walked 6 times the miles he walked on Monday.
   * The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.

2. Calculate the miles Walt walked on Tuesday:
   * Tuesday miles = 6 × Monday miles
   * Tuesday miles = 6 × 4 = 24 miles

3. Calculate the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday:
   * Monday and ...
