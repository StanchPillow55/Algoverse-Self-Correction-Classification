=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many hours of sleep Corveus lacks in a week, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify Corveus's current sleep duration**: Corveus currently sleeps 4 hours a day.

2. **Identify the recommended sleep duration**: The doctor recommends that Corveus sleep 6 hours a day.

3. **Calculate the daily sleep deficit**: 
   \[
   \text{Daily sleep deficit} = \text{Recommended sleep} - \text{Current sleep}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Daily sleep deficit} = 6 \text{ hours} - 4 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the weekly sleep deficit**: Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily sleep deficit by 7:
   \[
   \text{Weekly sleep deficit} = \text{Daily sleep deficit} \times 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weekly sleep deficit} = 2 \text{ hours} \times 7 = 14 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, Corveus lacks a total of 14 hours of sleep in a week.

**Final Answer**: Corveus lacks 14 hours of sleep in a week.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the recommended sleep duration and the actual sleep duration of Corveus in a week.

Given information:
- Corveus sleeps 4 hours a day.
- The doctor recommended Corveus to sleep 6 hours a day.

Step 1: Calculate the actual sleep duration of Corveus in a week.
Actual sleep duration per day = 4 hours
Actual sleep duration in a week = 4 hours Ã— 7 days = 28 hours

Step 2: Calculate the recommend...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how many hours of sleep Corveus lacks in a week, we need to compare the amount of sleep he currently gets with the amount recommended by his doctor.

1. **Current Sleep Schedule:**
   - Corveus sleeps 4 hours per day.

2. **Recommended Sleep Schedule:**
   - The doctor recommends that Corveus should sleep 6 hours per day.

3. **Difference in Daily Sleep:**
   - To find out how many hours of sleep Corveus lacks each day, subtract the hours he currently sleeps...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Corveus currently sleeps 4 hours a day, but his doctor recommended him to sleep 6 hours a day. 

To find out how many hours of sleep Corveus lacks in a week, we first need to find out how many hours he lacks in a day. 

This can be calculated by subtracting the number of hours he currently sleeps from the number of hours his doctor recommended. 

So, 6 hours (recommended) - 4 hours (current) = 2 hours. 

This means Corveus lacks 2 hours of sleep each day. 

To find out ho...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Corveus currently sleeps 4 hours a day.
   * His doctor recommends that he should sleep 6 hours a day.
   * We need to find out how many hours of sleep Corveus lacks in a week.

2. Calculate the total hours Corveus sleeps in a week with his current schedule:
   * Hours of sleep per day = 4
   * Number of days in a week = 7
   * Total hours of sleep in a week = Ho...
