=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the meals for Billy and Jenny, determine the total tip amount based on the given percentages, and then find out how much Billy needs to pay in tips.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the meals

1. **Cost of the steak for each person**: $20
2. **Cost of the drink for each person**: $5

Now, we calculate the total cost for one person:
\[
\text{Total cost for one person} = \text{Cost of steak} + \text{Cost of drink} = 20 + 5 = 25
\]

Since there are two people (Billy and Jenny), we multiply the total cost for one person by 2:
\[
\text{Total cost for two people} = 2 \times 25 = 50
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total tip amount

Next, we need to calculate a 20% tip on the total cost of the meals:
\[
\text{Tip amount} = 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the amount Billy wants to tip

Billy wants to cover 80% of the 20% tip. Therefore, we need to calculate 80% of the total tip amount:
\[
\text{Billy's tip} = 80\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.80 \times 10 = 8
\]

### Final Answer

Billy will have to pay **$8** in tips.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Calculate the total cost of the meal:
   * Billy and Jenny each order a $20 steak and a $5 drink
   * Total cost of the meal = (2 x $20) + (2 x $5) = $50

2. Calculate the total tip amount:
   * The tip is 20% of the total cost of the meal
   * Tip amount = 20% of $50 = 0.20 x $50 = $10

3. Calculate the amount that Billy wants to pay for the tip:
   * Billy wants to cover 80% of the tip
   * Billy's porti...

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost of the Meal

Billy and Jenny each order a $20 steak and a $5 drink. Therefore, the cost for one person is:

\[
\text{Cost per person} = \$20 + \$5 = \$25
\]

Since there are two people, the total cost for both is:

\[
\text{Total cost for two peop...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total cost of the meal for Billy and Jenny. They each ordered a $20 steak and a $5 drink, so the total cost is:

2 * ($20 + $5) = 2 * $25 = $50

Next, we need to calculate the total tip amount. The tip is 20% of the total cost, so the total tip is:

$50 * 20% = $50 * 0.20 = $10

Billy wants to cover 80% of the total tip. So, the amount Billy needs to pay in tips is:

$10 * 80% = $10 * 0.80 = $8

So, Billy will have to pay $8 in tips if he w...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Calculate the total cost of the meal (before tip):
   * Each steak costs $20, and they ordered two steaks. So, the total cost for steaks is: $20 × 2 = $40
   * Each drink costs $5, and they ordered two drinks. So, the total cost for drinks is: $5 × 2 = $10
   * The total cost of the meal is the sum of the steaks and drinks: $40 + $10 = $50

2. Calculate the total tip amount:
   * The tip percentage is 20% o...
