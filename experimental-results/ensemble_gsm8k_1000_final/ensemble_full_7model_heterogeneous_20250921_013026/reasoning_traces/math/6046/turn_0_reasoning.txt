=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many calories Ellen has left for dinner, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calories Ellen has consumed so far.**
   - Breakfast: 353 calories
   - Lunch: 885 calories
   - Afternoon snack: 130 calories

   We will add these amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total calories consumed} = \text{Breakfast} + \text{Lunch} + \text{Afternoon snack}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Total calories consumed} = 353 + 885 + 130
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition step-by-step:

   - First, add breakfast and lunch:
     \[
     353 + 885 = 1238
     \]

   - Next, add the afternoon snack:
     \[
     1238 + 130 = 1368
     \]

   So, Ellen has consumed a total of **1,368 calories**.

2. **Calculate how many calories she has left for dinner.**
   - Ellen's total daily calorie allowance is 2,200 calories. To find out how many calories she has left, we subtract the total calories consumed from her daily allowance:

   \[
   \text{Calories left for dinner} = \text{Total daily calories} - \text{Total calories consumed}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Calories left for dinner} = 2200 - 1368
   \]

   Now, we perform the subtraction:

   \[
   2200 - 1368 = 832
   \]

Thus, Ellen has **832 calories** left for dinner.

**Final Answer: 832 calories**

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ellen's daily calorie target is 2,200 calories.
- For breakfast, she ate 353 calories.
- For lunch, she had 885 calories.
- She had an afternoon snack of 130 calories.

To find the number of calories she has left for dinner, we need to subtract the total calories she has consumed so far from her daily calorie target.

Step 1: Calculate the total calories consumed so far.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how many calories Ellen has left for dinner, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total daily calorie allowance**:  
   Ellen's doctor instructed her to consume a total of 2,200 calories per day.

2. **Calculate the total calories consumed so far**:  
   We need to add up the calories Ellen has already consumed for breakfast, lunch, and her afternoon snack.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Ellen's total calorie intake for the day should be 2,200 calories. She has already consumed 353 calories for breakfast, 885 calories for lunch, and 130 calories for an afternoon snack. 

To find out how many calories she has left for dinner, we need to subtract the calories she has already consumed from her total daily allowance.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. To find out how many calories Ellen has left for dinner, we need to:
1. Add up the calories she has eaten so far
2. Subtract that total from her daily calorie allowance of 2,200

Step 1: Add up the calories Ellen has eaten so far
* Breakfast: 353 calories
* Lunch: 885 calories 
* Afternoon snack: 130 calories
* Total calories eaten = 353 + 885 + 130 = 1,368 calories

Step 2: Subtract the total calories eaten...
