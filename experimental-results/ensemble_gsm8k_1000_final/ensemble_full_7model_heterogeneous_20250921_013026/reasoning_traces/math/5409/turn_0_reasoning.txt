=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Bruce has left after his purchases, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the shirts:**
   Bruce bought 5 shirts, and each shirt costs $5. We can calculate the total cost of the shirts as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total cost of shirts} = \text{Number of shirts} \times \text{Cost per shirt} = 5 \times 5 = 25
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the pants:**
   Bruce bought one pair of pants that costs $26. Therefore, the total cost of the pants is simply:

   \[
   \text{Total cost of pants} = 26
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   Now we will add the total cost of the shirts and the total cost of the pants to find out how much Bruce spent in total:

   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of shirts} + \text{Total cost of pants} = 25 + 26 = 51
   \]

4. **Calculate how much money Bruce has left:**
   Bruce started with $71. To find out how much he has left after his purchases, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

   \[
   \text{Money left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total amount spent} = 71 - 51 = 20
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the amount of money Bruce has left to buy more clothes is:

   \[
   \boxed{20}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bruce's aunt gave him $71 to spend on clothes at the mall.
- He bought 5 shirts that cost $5 each.
- He also bought a pair of pants that cost $26.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 5 shirts.
Cost of 5 shirts = 5 × $5 = $25

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the clothes Bruce bought.
Total cost of clothes = Cost of 5 shirts + Cost of pants
Total cost of clothes = $25 + $26 = $51

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how much money Bruce has left after his purchases, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and then subtract that from the initial amount he had.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the shirts.**

Bruce bought 5 shirts, and each shirt costs $5. To find the total cost of the shirts, we multiply the number of shirts by the cost per shirt:

\[
5 \text{ shirts} \times \$5/\text{shirt} = \$25
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the pants.**

Bruce bought one ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Bruce started with $71. 

He spent $5 each on 5 shirts, so that's 5 * $5 = $<<5*5=25>>25.

He also bought a pair of pants for $26.

So, in total, he spent $25 (for shirts) + $26 (for pants) = $<<25+26=51>>51.

To find out how much money Bruce has left, we subtract the total amount he spent from the amount he started with. 

So, $71 (starting amount) - $51 (amount spent) = $<<71-51=20>>20.

Therefore, Bruce has $20 left to buy more clothes.
