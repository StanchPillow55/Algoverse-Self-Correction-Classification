=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine the total amount of paint the artist has used, we need to calculate the paint used for both the large canvases and the small canvases separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the paint used for large canvases:**
   - The artist uses 3 ounces of paint for each large canvas.
   - The artist has completed 3 large paintings.
   - Therefore, the total paint used for large canvases can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Paint for large canvases} = \text{Number of large canvases} \times \text{Paint per large canvas}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Paint for large canvases} = 3 \text{ large canvases} \times 3 \text{ ounces/canvas} = 9 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Calculate the paint used for small canvases:**
   - The artist uses 2 ounces of paint for each small canvas.
   - The artist has completed 4 small paintings.
   - Therefore, the total paint used for small canvases can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Paint for small canvases} = \text{Number of small canvases} \times \text{Paint per small canvas}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Paint for small canvases} = 4 \text{ small canvases} \times 2 \text{ ounces/canvas} = 8 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total paint used:**
   - Now, we sum the paint used for large canvases and small canvases:

   \[
   \text{Total paint used} = \text{Paint for large canvases} + \text{Paint for small canvases}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total paint used} = 9 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} = 17 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of paint the artist has used is **17 ounces**. 

Final answer: **17 ounces**.
