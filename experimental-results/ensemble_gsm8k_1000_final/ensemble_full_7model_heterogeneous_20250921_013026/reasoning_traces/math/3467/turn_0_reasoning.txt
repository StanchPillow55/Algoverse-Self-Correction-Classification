Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many special $1 bills George has left after spending 20% of them, and then calculate how much money he will receive from his parents based on the remaining bills.

1. **Determine the total number of special $1 bills George has:**
   Since George has been receiving one special $1 bill every year since his 15th birthday, we can calculate the total number of bills he has by considering the number of years from his 15th birthday to his 25th birthday.

   \[
   \text{Total years} = 25 - 15 = 10 \text{ years}
   \]

   Therefore, George has a total of 10 special $1 bills.

2. **Calculate the number of bills George spent:**
   George spent 20% of his special bills. To find out how many bills that is, we calculate 20% of 10 bills.

   \[
   \text{Number of bills spent} = 0.20 \times 10 = 2 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of bills George has left:**
   Now we subtract the number of bills spent from the total number of bills.

   \[
   \text{Number of bills left} = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ bills}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount George will receive from his parents:**
   For every bill he has left, his parents will give him $1.5 in exchange. Therefore, we multiply the number of bills left by the amount he will receive per bill.

   \[
   \text{Amount received} = 8 \text{ bills} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/bill} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   George will receive a total of **$12** from his parents when he exchanges his remaining special $1 bills.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how many special $1 bills George received from his 15th to his 25th birthday. Since he received one bill each year, and there are 10 years between his 15th and 25th birthday, he received 10 special $1 bills.

Next, we need to calculate how many bills George spent. Since he spent 20% of his bills, he spent 20/100 * 10 = 2 bills.

This means George has 10 - 2 = <<10-2=8>>8 special $1 bills left.

Finally, we need to calculate how much George will...
