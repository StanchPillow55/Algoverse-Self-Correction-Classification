=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pages DeShaun read.**
2. **Determine how many books the second person read.**
3. **Calculate the total number of pages the second person read.**
4. **Find the average number of pages the second person read per day.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages DeShaun read.

DeShaun read 60 books, and each book averaged 320 pages long. 

To find the total number of pages he read, we multiply the number of books by the number of pages per book:

\[
\text{Total pages read by DeShaun} = \text{Number of books} \times \text{Pages per book}
\]

\[
\text{Total pages read by DeShaun} = 60 \times 320
\]

Calculating this:

\[
60 \times 320 = 19200 \text{ pages}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many books the second person read.

The second person read 75% as many books as DeShaun did. To find out how many books the second person read, we calculate:

\[
\text{Books read by the second person} = 0.75 \times \text{Books read by DeShaun}
\]

\[
\text{Books read by the second person} = 0.75 \times 60
\]

Calculating this:

\[
0.75 \times 60 = 45 \text{ books}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of pages the second person read.

Now, we find out how many pages the second person read. Since each book is still 320 pages, we calculate:

\[
\text{Total pages read by the second person} = \text{Books read by the second person} \times \text{Pages per book}
\]

\[
\text{Total pages read by the second person} = 45 \times 320
\]

Calculating this:

\[
45 \times 320 = 14400 \text{ pages}
\]

### Step 4: Find the average number of pages the second person read per day.

To find the average number of pages read per day, we divide the total number of pages read by the number of days in summer break:

\[
\text{Average pages per day} = \frac{\text{Total pages read by the second person}}{\text{Number of days}}
\]

\[
\text{Average pages per day} = \frac{14400}{80}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\frac{14400}{80} = 180 \text{ pages per day}
\]

### Final Answer

The second person read an average of **180 pages per day** during the summer break.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pages DeShaun read over the summer.
2. Calculate the total number of pages the second person read over the summer.
3. Calculate the average number of pages the second person read per day.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages DeShaun read over the summer.
* DeShaun read 60 books.
* Each book averaged 320 pages.
* Total pages read by DeShaun = 60 books × 320 ...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pages the second person read on average each day of the summer break.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of books the second person read:**

   DeShaun read 60 books. The person closest to him read 75% as many books as DeShaun did. To find out how many books the second person read, we calculate:

   \[
   \text{Number of books read by the second person} = 60 \times 0.75 = 45 \text{ b...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how many pages DeShaun read over the summer. He read 60 books, each averaging 320 pages, so he read 60 * 320 = 19200 pages.

The person closest to him read 75% as much as DeShaun did, so they read 0.75 * 19200 = 14400 pages.

Summer break is 80 days long, so to find out how many pages the second person read on average each day, we divide the total number of pages they read by the number of days in the break. 

So, 14400 pages / 80 days = 180 pages/d...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Summer break is 80 days long.
   * DeShaun read 60 books over the summer.
   * Each book DeShaun read averaged 320 pages long.
   * The person closest to DeShaun read 75% as much as he did.

2. Calculate the total number of pages DeShaun read:
   * Total pages DeShaun read = Number of books × Average pages per book
   * Total pages DeShaun read = 60 × 320
   * ...
