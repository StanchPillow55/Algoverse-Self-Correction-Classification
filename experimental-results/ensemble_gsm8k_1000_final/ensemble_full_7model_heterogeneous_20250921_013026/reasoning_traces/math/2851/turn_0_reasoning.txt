=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify Aaron's Age**: 
   - We know from the problem that Aaron is 15 years old.

2. **Calculate Henry's Sister's Age**: 
   - The problem states that Henry's sister is three times as old as Aaron. 
   - Since Aaron is 15 years old, we can calculate Henry's sister's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Sister's Age} = 3 \times \text{Aaron's Age} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Calculate Henry's Age**: 
   - The problem also states that Henry is four times as old as his sister.
   - We can calculate Henry's age using the sister's age we just found:
     \[
     \text{Henry's Age} = 4 \times \text{Sister's Age} = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Combined Age of the Siblings**: 
   - Now we need to find the combined age of Aaron, Henry, and Henry's sister. We will add their ages together:
     \[
     \text{Combined Age} = \text{Aaron's Age} + \text{Sister's Age} + \text{Henry's Age}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Combined Age} = 15 + 45 + 180
     \]
     \[
     \text{Combined Age} = 240 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Final Answer**: 
   - The combined age of the siblings is \( \boxed{240} \) years old.

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify Aaron's Age**: 
   - We know from the problem that Aaron is 15 years old.

2. **Calculate Henry's Sister's Age**: 
   - The problem states that Henry's sister is three times as old as Aaron. 
   - Since Aaron is 15 years old, we can calculate Henry's sister's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Sister's Age} = 3 \times \text{Aaron's Age} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ years old}

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Aaron, Henry's brother, is 15 years old.
- Henry's sister is three times as old as Aaron.
- Henry is four times as old as his sister.

Step 1: Find the age of Henry's sister.
Henry's sister's age = 3 × Aaron's age
Henry's sister's age = 3 × 15 = 45 years old

Step 2: Find Henry's age.
Henry's age = 4 × Henry's sister's age
Henry's age = 4 × 45 = 180 years old

Step 3: Find the combined ag...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of Aaron, Henry's sister, and Henry, and then sum these ages to find the combined age of the siblings.

1. **Identify Aaron's age:**
   - Aaron is given to be 15 years old.

2. **Determine Henry's sister's age:**
   - The problem states that Henry's sister is three times as old as Aaron.
   - Since Aaron is 15 years old, we calculate Henry's sister's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Sister's age} = 3 \times \text{Aaro...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that Aaron is 15 years old.

Second, we know that Henry's sister is three times as old as Aaron. So, we multiply Aaron's age by 3 to find out how old Henry's sister is.

15 years * 3 = 45 years

So, Henry's sister is 45 years old.

Third, we know that Henry is four times as old as his sister. So, we multiply the sister's age by 4 to find out how old Henry is.

45 years * 4 = 180 years

So, Henry is 180 years old.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the combined age of the siblings.

Given:
- Aaron is 15 years old.
- Henry's sister is three times as old as Aaron.
- Henry is four times as old as his sister.

Step 1: Calculate Henry's sister's age.
Henry's sister's age = 3 × Aaron's age
Henry's sister's age = 3 × 15 = 45 years...
