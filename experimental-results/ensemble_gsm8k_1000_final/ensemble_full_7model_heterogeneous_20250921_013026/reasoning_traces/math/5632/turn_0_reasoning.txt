=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many days it will take Tom to finish watching the show, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to watch all episodes**:
   - The show has 90 episodes, and each episode is 20 minutes long.
   - Total time in minutes = Number of episodes × Duration of each episode
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 90 \text{ episodes} \times 20 \text{ minutes/episode} = 1800 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours**:
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we convert the total time to hours.
   \[
   \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine how many hours Tom can watch per day**:
   - Tom can spend 2 hours a day watching the show.

4. **Calculate the number of days required to finish the show**:
   - To find the number of days, we divide the total hours by the hours Tom can watch per day.
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total time in hours}}{\text{Hours per day}} = \frac{30 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/day}} = 15 \text{ days}
   \]

Thus, it will take Tom **15 days** to finish watching the show.

**Final Answer**: 15 days

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find out how many minutes of the show Tom can watch per day and then calculate the number of days it will take him to finish watching the entire show.

Given information:
- The show has 90 episodes.
- Each episode is 20 minutes long.
- Tom can spend two hours a day watching the show.

Step 1: Convert the time Tom can spend watching the show per day from hours to minutes.
2 hours per day = 2 × 60 minutes = 120 minutes ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take Tom to watch all 90 episodes of the show, given that he can watch for two hours each day.

### Step 1: Calculate the total viewing time for all episodes

Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are 90 episodes. To find the total viewing time, we multiply the number of episodes by the duration of each episode:

\[
90 \text{ episodes} \times 20 \text{ minutes per episode} = 1800 \text{ minutes}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find the total time Tom needs to watch all the episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 90 episodes, we multiply 20 minutes by 90 to get the total time in minutes. 

20 minutes/episode * 90 episodes = 1800 minutes

Next, we need to convert the time Tom can spend watching the show each day from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and Tom can watch for 2 hours a day, we multiply 60 minutes by 2 to get the total time...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The show has 90 episodes.
   * Each episode is 20 minutes long.
   * Tom can spend 2 hours a day watching the show.

2. Calculate the total number of minutes the show lasts:
   * Total minutes = Number of episodes × Minutes per episode
   * Total minutes = 90 × 20
   * Total minutes = 1,800 minutes

3. Convert Tom's daily watching time from hours to minutes:
   * 2 hou...
