=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much Nina spends in total on the presents for her children, we will calculate the cost of each type of item she bought and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate the cost of the toys:**
   - Nina buys 3 toys, and each toy costs $10.
   - The total cost for the toys can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of toys} = \text{Number of toys} \times \text{Cost per toy} = 3 \times 10 = 30
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the basketball cards:**
   - Nina buys 2 packs of basketball cards, and each pack costs $5.
   - The total cost for the basketball cards can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of basketball cards} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Cost per pack} = 2 \times 5 = 10
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the shirts:**
   - Nina buys 5 shirts, and each shirt costs $6.
   - The total cost for the shirts can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of shirts} = \text{Number of shirts} \times \text{Cost per shirt} = 5 \times 6 = 30
     \]

4. **Sum the total costs:**
   - Now, we will add the total costs of the toys, basketball cards, and shirts to find the overall total expenditure.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of toys} + \text{Cost of basketball cards} + \text{Cost of shirts}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 30 + 10 + 30 = 70
   \]

Thus, the total amount Nina spends on presents for her children is **$70**.

Final answer: **$70**.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its price and then add all the results together.

First, let's calculate the total cost for each type of item:

- For the toys: Nina buys 3 toys at $10 each, so the total cost for the toys is 3 * $10 = $30.
- For the basketball cards: Nina buys 2 packs at $5 each, so the total cost for the basketball cards is 2 * $5 = $10.
- For the shirts: Nina buys 5 shirts at $6 each, so the total cost for the shir...
