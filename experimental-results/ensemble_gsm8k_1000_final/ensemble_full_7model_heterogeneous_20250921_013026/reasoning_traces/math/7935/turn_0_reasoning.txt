=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Ali has after receiving money from Leila.

1. **Initial Amount Ali Has**: 
   - Ali starts with $21.

2. **Amount Leila Gives to Ali**:
   - Leila has $100.
   - She gives Ali half of her $100.
   - To find out how much half of $100 is, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Half of } 100 = \frac{100}{2} = 50
     \]
   - Therefore, Leila gives Ali $50.

3. **Total Amount Ali Has After Receiving from Leila**:
   - Now we need to add the amount Ali had initially to the amount he received from Leila:
     \[
     \text{Total Amount} = \text{Initial Amount} + \text{Amount Received from Leila}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Amount} = 21 + 50
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     21 + 50 = 71
     \]

4. **Final Amount**:
   - After receiving the money from Leila, Ali now has $71.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{71}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ali had $21 initially.
- Leila gave him half of her $100.

Step 1: Calculate how much Leila gave to Ali.
Leila's total amount = $100
Leila gave Ali half of her $100, so:
Amount Leila gave to Ali = $100 รท 2 = $50

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Ali has now.
Ali's initial amount = $21
Amount Leila gave to Ali = $50
Total amount Ali has now = Ali's initial amount + Amount Leila gave to Ali
To...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Ali has after receiving half of Leila's $100.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Amount Ali Has:**
   - Ali initially has $21.

2. **Amount Leila Has:**
   - Leila has $100.

3. **Amount Leila Gives to Ali:**
   - Leila gives Ali half of her $100.
   - To find half of $100, we perform the following calculation:
     \[
     \frac{100}{2} = 50
     \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much money Leila gave to Ali. Since Leila gave him half of her $100, we calculate this by dividing 100 by 2.

100 รท 2 = $50

So, Leila gave Ali $50.

Next, we need to add this amount to the money Ali already had. Ali originally had $21, so we add this to the $50 Leila gave him.

21 + 50 = $71

So, Ali now has $71.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Ali had $21 initially.
- Leila gave Ali half of her $100.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Leila gave to Ali.
Leila's total money = $100
Half of Leila's money = $100 รท 2 = $50
So, Leila gave Ali $50.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Ali has now.
Ali's initial money = $21
Money received from Leila = $50
Total money Ali has now = Ali's initial money + Money received from...
