=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first establish the heights of each person based on the information given. 

1. **Identify Zora's height**:
   - We know that Zara is 64 inches tall. The problem states that Zora is 8 inches shorter than Brixton. 
   - Since Zara and Brixton are the same height, we can conclude that Brixton is also 64 inches tall.

2. **Calculate Zora's height**:
   - If Brixton is 64 inches tall and Zora is 8 inches shorter than Brixton, we can calculate Zora's height as follows:
   \[
   \text{Zora's height} = \text{Brixton's height} - 8 \text{ inches} = 64 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 56 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate Itzayana's height**:
   - The problem states that Itzayana is 4 inches taller than Zora. Therefore, we can find Itzayana's height:
   \[
   \text{Itzayana's height} = \text{Zora's height} + 4 \text{ inches} = 56 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 60 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Summarize the heights**:
   - Now we have the heights of all four individuals:
     - Zara: 64 inches
     - Brixton: 64 inches
     - Zora: 56 inches
     - Itzayana: 60 inches

5. **Calculate the average height**:
   - To find the average height of the four people, we will sum their heights and then divide by the number of people (which is 4):
   \[
   \text{Total height} = \text{Zara's height} + \text{Brixton's height} + \text{Zora's height} + \text{Itzayana's height}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total height} = 64 + 64 + 56 + 60 = 244 \text{ inches}
   \]
   - Now, we calculate the average:
   \[
   \text{Average height} = \frac{\text{Total height}}{4} = \frac{244 \text{ inches}}{4} = 61 \text{ inches}
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - The average height of the four people is \( \boxed{61} \) inches.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Itzayana is 4 inches taller than Zora.
- Zora is 8 inches shorter than Brixton.
- Zara is 64 inches tall and has the same height as Brixton.

Step 1: Find Brixton's height.
Zara's height = Brixton's height = 64 inches

Step 2: Find Zora's height.
Zora is 8 inches shorter than Brixton.
Zora's height = Brixton's height - 8 inches
Zora's height = 64 inches - 8 inches = 56 inches

Step 3: Fin...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the heights of Itzayana, Zora, Brixton, and Zara, and then calculate their average height.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Zara is 64 inches tall.
   - Zara has the same height as Brixton, so Brixton is also 64 inches tall.

2. **Determine Zora's height:**
   - Zora is 8 inches shorter than Brixton.
   - Since Brixton is 64 inches tall, Zora's height is:
     \[
     \text{Zora's height} = 64 \, \text{inches} - 8 \...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by finding out the height of each person.

We know that Zara and Brixton are the same height, which is 64 inches.

Zora is 8 inches shorter than Brixton, so Zora's height is 64 inches - 8 inches = 56 inches.

Itzayana is 4 inches taller than Zora, so Itzayana's height is 56 inches + 4 inches = 60 inches.

Now that we have the height of each person, we can calculate the average height. The average height is the sum of all heights divided by the number of people...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by identifying the given information and then calculate the heights of each person.

Given:
- Itzayana is 4 inches taller than Zora.
- Zora is 8 inches shorter than Brixton.
- Zara is 64 inches tall and has the same height as Brixton.

Step 1: Determine Brixton's height.
Brixton's height = Zara's height = 64 inches
