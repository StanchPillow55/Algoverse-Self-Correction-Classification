=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Stephanie still needs to pay for her bills, we will calculate the total amount she owes for each bill and then subtract the amounts she has already paid. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Electricity Bill**:
   - Total cost: $60
   - Amount paid: $60 (paid in full)
   - Remaining balance: $60 - $60 = $0

2. **Gas Bill**:
   - Total cost: $40
   - Amount paid so far: 
     - She has paid three-quarters of the bill: 
       \[
       \text{Amount paid} = \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
       \]
     - She makes an additional payment of $5:
       \[
       \text{Total amount paid} = 30 + 5 = 35
       \]
   - Remaining balance:
   \[
   \text{Remaining balance} = 40 - 35 = 5
   \]

3. **Water Bill**:
   - Total cost: $40
   - Amount paid: Half of the bill:
   \[
   \text{Amount paid} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20
   \]
   - Remaining balance:
   \[
   \text{Remaining balance} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Internet Bill**:
   - Total cost: $25
   - Amount paid: She has made 4 payments of $5:
   \[
   \text{Amount paid} = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]
   - Remaining balance:
   \[
   \text{Remaining balance} = 25 - 20 = 5
   \]

Now, we will sum up all the remaining balances to find out how much Stephanie still needs to pay:

- Remaining balance for electricity: $0
- Remaining balance for gas: $5
- Remaining balance for water: $20
- Remaining balance for internet: $5

Total remaining balance:
\[
\text{Total remaining} = 0 + 5 + 20 + 5 = 30
\]

Therefore, the total amount Stephanie still needs to pay to finish paying her bills is **$30**. 

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To determine how much Stephanie still needs to pay for her bills, we will calculate the total amount she owes for each bill and then subtract the amounts she has already paid. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Electricity Bill**:
   - Total cost: $60
   - Amount paid: $60 (paid in full)
   - Remaining balance: $60 - $60 = $0

2. **Gas Bill**:
   - Total cost: $40
   - Amount paid so far: 
     - She has paid three-quarters of the bill:

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the remaining amounts Stephanie needs to pay for each of her bills and then add them up to find the total amount she still needs to pay.

Given information:
- Electricity bill: $60, paid in full
- Gas bill: $40, paid three-quarters ($30) and another $5 payment
- Water bill: $40, paid half ($20)
- Internet bill: $25, paid 4 payments of $5 ($20)

Step 1: Calculate the remaining amount for the gas bill.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how much Stephanie still needs to pay to finish paying her bills, we need to analyze each bill separately and calculate the remaining balance for each.

1. **Electricity Bill:**
   - Total cost: $60
   - Paid in full: $60
   - Remaining balance: $60 - $60 = $0

2. **Gas Bill:**
   - Total cost: $40
   - Paid three-quarters of the bill: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\)
   - Remaining balance before the additional payment: $40 - $30 = $10
   - Additional payment...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Stephanie has already paid her electricity bill in full, so she doesn't owe anything more for that. 

For her gas bill, she initially owed $40. She has paid three-quarters of this, which is 3/4 * $40 = $30. After making another payment of $5, she has paid a total of $30 + $5 = $35 towards her gas bill. So, she still owes $40 - $35 = $5 for her gas bill.

For her water bill, she initially owed $40. She has paid half of this, which is 1/2 * $40 = $20. So, she still owes $40...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

1. Electricity bill:
   - Total cost: $60
   - Paid in full, so no remaining amount to pay.

2. Gas bill:
   - Total cost: $40
   - Already paid three-quarters: 3/4 Ã— $40 = $30
   - Remaining amount before additional payment: $40 - $30 = $10
   - Additional payment made: $5
   - Remaining amount after additional payment: $10 - $5 = $5

3. Water bill:
   - Total cost: $40
   - Already paid h...
