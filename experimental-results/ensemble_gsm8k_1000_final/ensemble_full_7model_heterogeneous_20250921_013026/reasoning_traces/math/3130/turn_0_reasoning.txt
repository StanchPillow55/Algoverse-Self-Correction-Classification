=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many miles Jace will travel, we can break the problem down into parts based on his driving time and speed.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled during the first driving period:**
   - Jace drives for 4 hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour.
   - The formula for distance is:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Consider the break:**
   - Jace takes a 30-minute break. This break does not affect the distance traveled, so we do not need to calculate anything for this part.

3. **Calculate the distance traveled during the second driving period:**
   - Jace drives for another 9 hours at the same speed of 60 miles per hour.
   - Using the same distance formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_2 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 9 \, \text{hours} = 540 \, \text{miles}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - To find the total distance, we add the distances from both driving periods:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 240 \, \text{miles} + 540 \, \text{miles} = 780 \, \text{miles}
     \]

Thus, the total distance Jace will travel is \( \boxed{780} \) miles.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jace drives 60 miles per hour.
- Jace drives for 4 hours straight, takes a 30-minute break, and then drives for another 9 hours straight.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Jace travels in the first 4 hours.
Distance traveled in the first 4 hours = Speed × Time
Distance traveled in the first 4 hours = 60 miles/hour × 4 hours = 240 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance Jace travels in the rem...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Jace travels during his driving sessions. We know that distance is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Jace drives at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. We need to consider the two separate driving sessions and then sum the distances from each session.

### First Driving Session

1. **Speed:** 60 miles per hour
2. **Time:** 4 hours

Using the formula for...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Jace's total driving time is the sum of the two driving periods, which is 4 hours plus 9 hours, equalling 13 hours in total.

Since Jace drives at a speed of 60 miles per hour, we can calculate the total distance he travels by multiplying his speed by the total time he drives.

This can be calculated as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour x 13 hours

Multiplying 60 by 13 gives us 780.

So, Jace will travel a total of 780 miles.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jace drives at a speed of 60 miles per hour.
   * He drives for 4 hours straight, takes a 30-minute break, and then drives for another 9 hours straight.

2. Calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 hours:
   * Distance = Speed × Time
   * Distance = 60 miles/hour × 4 hours
   * Distance = 240 miles
   So, Jace travels 240 miles in the first 4 hours.
