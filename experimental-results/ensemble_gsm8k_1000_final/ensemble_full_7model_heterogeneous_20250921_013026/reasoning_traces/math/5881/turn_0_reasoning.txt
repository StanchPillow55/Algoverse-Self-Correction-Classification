=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many gallons of gas John uses in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in a week and then convert that distance into gallons based on his car's fuel efficiency.

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance John drives to work in a week.

John drives 20 miles to work each way. Therefore, the round trip distance to work is:

\[
\text{Distance to work (round trip)} = 20 \text{ miles (to work)} + 20 \text{ miles (back home)} = 40 \text{ miles}
\]

Since he drives to work 5 days a week, the total distance he drives to work in a week is:

\[
\text{Total distance to work in a week} = 40 \text{ miles (round trip)} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance John drives for leisure travel.

John also drives an additional 40 miles a week for leisure travel. Therefore, the total distance he drives in a week is:

\[
\text{Total distance in a week} = \text{Total distance to work} + \text{Leisure travel distance}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance in a week} = 200 \text{ miles (to work)} + 40 \text{ miles (leisure)} = 240 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the gallons of gas used.

John's car gets 30 miles per gallon (mpg). To find out how many gallons of gas he uses in a week, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Gallons of gas used} = \frac{\text{Total distance driven}}{\text{Miles per gallon}}
\]
\[
\text{Gallons of gas used} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ mpg}} = 8 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Final Answer

John uses **8 gallons of gas** in a week.

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To determine how many gallons of gas John uses in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in a week and then convert that distance into gallons based on his car's fuel efficiency.

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance John drives to work in a week.

John drives 20 miles to work each way. Therefore, the round trip distance to work is:

\[
\text{Distance to work (round trip)} = 20 \text{ miles (to work)} + 20 \text{ miles (back home)} = 40 \text{...

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance John drives in a week and then calculate the total amount of gas he uses.

Given information:
- John's car gets 30 miles per gallon (mpg).
- He drives 20 miles to work each way, 5 days a week.
- He also drives another 40 miles a week for leisure travel.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance John drives to work in a week.
Distance to work and back each day = 20 miles + 20 miles = 40 miles
Total ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how many gallons of gas John uses in a week, we need to calculate the total number of miles he drives in a week and then use his car's fuel efficiency to find out how many gallons are consumed.

### Step 1: Calculate the total miles driven to work

John drives 20 miles to work and 20 miles back home each day. Therefore, the round trip distance for one day is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles (to work)} + 20 \text{ miles (back home)} = 40 \text{ miles} \]

Since he drives...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how many miles John drives to work in a week. He drives 20 miles each way, so that's 20 miles * 2 = 40 miles a day. 

Since he works 5 days a week, he drives 40 miles * 5 = 200 miles a week for work.

Adding the 40 miles he drives for leisure, John drives a total of 200 miles + 40 miles = 240 miles a week.

Since his car gets 30 miles per gallon (mpg), we can calculate how many gallons of gas he uses in a week by dividing the total miles he drives b...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * John's car gets 30 miles per gallon (mpg).
   * He drives 20 miles to work each way, 5 days a week.
   * He drives an additional 40 miles per week for leisure.

2. Calculate the total miles driven for work per week:
   * One-way distance to work = 20 miles
   * Round trip distance per day = 20 miles Ã— 2 = 40 miles
   * Number of workdays per week = 5 days
   * Total wo...
