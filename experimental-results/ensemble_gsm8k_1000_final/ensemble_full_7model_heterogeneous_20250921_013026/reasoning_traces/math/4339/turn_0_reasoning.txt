=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine the percentage of the initial cost that Matilda lost when she sold her smartphone, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial cost and the selling price**:
   - Initial cost of the smartphone: \( C = 300 \) dollars
   - Selling price of the smartphone: \( S = 255 \) dollars

2. **Calculate the loss**:
   The loss is the difference between the initial cost and the selling price. We can calculate it using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Loss} = C - S
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Loss} = 300 - 255 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the percentage loss**:
   To find the percentage loss relative to the initial cost, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Loss} = \left( \frac{\text{Loss}}{C} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Loss} = \left( \frac{45}{300} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform the division**:
   \[
   \frac{45}{300} = 0.15
   \]

5. **Multiply by 100 to convert to percentage**:
   \[
   0.15 \times 100 = 15\%
   \]

Thus, Matilda lost **15%** of the initial cost of the smartphone.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage of the initial cost that Matilda lost when she sold the smartphone.

Given information:
- Matilda bought a smartphone for $300.
- Matilda sold the smartphone for $255.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Matilda lost.
Initial cost of the smartphone - Selling price of the smartphone = Amount of money lost
$300 - $255 = $45

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of the initial cost that Matilda lost.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine the percentage of the initial cost that Matilda lost when she sold the smartphone, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Loss in Dollar Amount:**

   Matilda bought the smartphone for $300 and sold it for $255. The loss in dollar amount is the difference between the purchase price and the selling price.

   \[
   \text{Loss} = \text{Purchase Price} - \text{Selling Price} = 300 - 255 = 45
   \]

   So, Matilda lost $45.

2. **Calculate the Percen...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money Matilda lost on the sale of the smartphone. This can be done by subtracting the selling price from the purchase price.

So, $300 (purchase price) - $255 (selling price) = $45 (loss)

Next, we need to calculate what percentage of the initial cost this loss represents. We can do this by dividing the loss by the initial cost and then multiplying by 100 to convert the decimal to a percentage.

So, ($45 (loss) / ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step to determine the percentage of the initial cost Matilda lost.

Given:
- Matilda bought a smartphone for $300.
- She sold the smartphone for $255.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Matilda lost.
Money lost = Initial cost - Selling price
Money lost = $300 - $255 = $45

Step 2: To find the percentage of the initial cost Matilda lost, we need to divide the money lost by the initial cost and multiply by 10...
