=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many bottles of champagne Ashley will need for her wedding toast, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of glasses of champagne needed**:
   - Ashley has 120 guests, and she wants to serve 2 glasses of champagne to each guest.
   - Therefore, the total number of glasses needed is:
     \[
     \text{Total glasses} = \text{Number of guests} \times \text{Glasses per guest} = 120 \times 2 = 240 \text{ glasses}
     \]

2. **Determine how many servings are in one bottle of champagne**:
   - We know that 1 bottle of champagne has 6 servings.

3. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed**:
   - To find out how many bottles are required for 240 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of servings per bottle:
     \[
     \text{Number of bottles} = \frac{\text{Total glasses}}{\text{Servings per bottle}} = \frac{240}{6}
     \]
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     \frac{240}{6} = 40
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Ashley will need a total of **40 bottles of champagne** for her wedding toast.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many servings of champagne Ashley needs in total. Since she wants to serve 2 glasses to each of her 120 guests, we multiply 2 by 120:

2 glasses/guest * 120 guests = 240 glasses

Next, we need to convert this number of glasses into bottles. Since 1 bottle of champagne has 6 servings, we divide the total number of glasses by 6:

240 glasses ÷ 6 glasses/bottle = 40 bottles

Therefore, Ashley will need 40 bottles of champagne for her wedding to...
