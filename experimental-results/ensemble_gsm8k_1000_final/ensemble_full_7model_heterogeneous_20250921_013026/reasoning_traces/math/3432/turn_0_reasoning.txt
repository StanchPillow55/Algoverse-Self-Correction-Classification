=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and perform the necessary calculations.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of water balloons

Milly and Floretta use:
- 3 packs of their own water balloons
- 2 packs of the neighbor's water balloons

Each pack contains 6 balloons. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of balloons as follows:

\[
\text{Total packs} = 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ packs}
\]

Now, we calculate the total number of balloons:

\[
\text{Total balloons} = \text{Total packs} \times \text{Balloons per pack} = 5 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ balloons/pack} = 30 \text{ balloons}
\]

### Step 2: Split the balloons evenly between Milly and Floretta

Since they split the balloons evenly, we divide the total number of balloons by 2:

\[
\text{Balloons per person} = \frac{\text{Total balloons}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ balloons}}{2} = 15 \text{ balloons}
\]

### Step 3: Account for the extra balloons Milly takes

Milly takes an extra 7 balloons when Floretta isn't looking. Therefore, we need to calculate how many balloons Milly ends up with:

\[
\text{Milly's total} = \text{Balloons per person} + \text{Extra balloons} = 15 + 7 = 22 \text{ balloons}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate how many balloons Floretta is left with

Since Milly has taken 22 balloons, we can find out how many balloons Floretta has left by subtracting the number of balloons Milly has from the total:

\[
\text{Floretta's total} = \text{Total balloons} - \text{Milly's total} = 30 - 22 = 8 \text{ balloons}
\]

### Final Answer

Floretta is left with **8 water balloons**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Milly and Floretta use 3 packs of their own water balloons
- They also use 2 packs of a neighbor's water balloons
- Each pack of water balloons contains 6 balloons
- They fill all of the balloons and split them evenly
- But Milly takes an extra 7 balloons when Floretta isn't looking

Step 1: Calculate the total number of water balloons they have.
Total number of their own water balloons =...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of water balloons Milly and Floretta have, how they are initially divided, and then account for the extra balloons Milly takes.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of water balloons.**

Milly and Floretta use 3 packs of their own water balloons and 2 packs of their neighbor's water balloons. Each pack contains 6 balloons.

First, calculate the number of balloons from their own packs:
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many water balloons in total Milly and Floretta have. They have 3 packs of their own and 2 packs from their neighbor. Each pack contains 6 balloons. 

So, the total number of balloons is (3 packs + 2 packs) * 6 balloons/pack = 5 packs * 6 balloons/pack = 30 balloons.

Next, we know that Milly and Floretta were supposed to split the balloons evenly, but Milly took an extra 7. This means that Milly has half of the total number of balloons plus...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Milly and Floretta use 3 packs of their own water balloons.
   * They also use 2 packs of their neighbor's water balloons.
   * Each pack contains 6 balloons.
   * They fill all the balloons and split them evenly.
   * Milly takes an extra 7 balloons without Floretta knowing.

2. Calculate the total number of water balloons:
   * Total packs of water balloons = 3 (t...
