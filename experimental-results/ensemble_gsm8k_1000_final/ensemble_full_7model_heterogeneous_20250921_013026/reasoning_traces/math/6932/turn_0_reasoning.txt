=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial video game time Diana earns for her reading.**
2. **Calculate the increase in her video game time due to the 20% raise.**
3. **Find the total additional video game time she will receive as a result of the raise.**

### Step 1: Calculate Initial Video Game Time

Diana earns 30 minutes of video game time for every hour she reads. Since she read for 12 hours this week, we can calculate her initial video game time as follows:

\[
\text{Initial Video Game Time} = \text{Hours Read} \times \text{Video Game Time per Hour}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Initial Video Game Time} = 12 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Increase Due to the Raise

Diana's dad decided to raise her reward by 20%. To find out how much her video game time increases, we first calculate 20% of her initial video game time:

\[
\text{Increase} = \text{Initial Video Game Time} \times 0.20
\]

Substituting the initial video game time:

\[
\text{Increase} = 360 \text{ minutes} \times 0.20 = 72 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Find the Total Additional Video Game Time

The additional video game time Diana will get as a result of her raise is 72 minutes. 

### Final Answer

Thus, the total additional video game time that Diana will receive as a result of her raise is:

\[
\boxed{72 \text{ minutes}}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Diana gets 30 minutes of video game time for every hour she reads.
- Her dad decided to raise her reward by 20%.
- Diana read for 12 hours this week.

Step 1: Calculate the original amount of video game time Diana would have received.
Original video game time = 30 minutes per hour × 12 hours = 360 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the new reward after the 20% increase.
Increase in reward...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional minutes of video game time Diana will receive due to the 20% increase in her reward.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Original Reward:**
   - Diana gets 30 minutes of video game time for every hour she reads.
   - She read for 12 hours this week.
   - Calculate the total video game time she would originally receive:
     \[
     \text{Original Video Game Time} = 30 \text{ minutes/hour} \times ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Diana initially gets 30 minutes of video game time for every hour she reads. 

So, if she reads for 12 hours, she would normally get 12 hours * 30 minutes/hour = 360 minutes of video game time.

Her dad decided to raise her reward by 20%. 

So, the increase in her video game time is 20/100 * 360 minutes = 72 minutes.

Therefore, as a result of her raise, Diana will get an additional 72 minutes of video game time.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Diana initially gets 30 minutes of video game time for every hour she reads.
   * Her dad raised her reward by 20%.
   * Diana read for 12 hours this week.

2. Calculate the initial video game time Diana would get for 12 hours of reading:
   * Video game time = 30 minutes × 12 hours
   * Video game time = 360 minutes

3. Calculate the additional video game time d...
