=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much the civic league raised from the pancake breakfast fundraiser, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from the sales of stacks of pancakes and slices of bacon.

### Step 1: Calculate the revenue from stacks of pancakes

The price of one stack of pancakes is $4.00. They sold 60 stacks of pancakes. 

To find the total revenue from pancakes, we multiply the number of stacks sold by the price per stack:

\[
\text{Revenue from pancakes} = \text{Number of stacks} \times \text{Price per stack}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Revenue from pancakes} = 60 \times 4.00 = 240.00
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the revenue from slices of bacon

The price of one slice of bacon is $2.00. They sold 90 slices of bacon.

To find the total revenue from bacon, we multiply the number of slices sold by the price per slice:

\[
\text{Revenue from bacon} = \text{Number of slices} \times \text{Price per slice}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Revenue from bacon} = 90 \times 2.00 = 180.00
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total revenue raised

Now, we add the revenue from pancakes and the revenue from bacon to find the total amount raised:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from pancakes} + \text{Revenue from bacon}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 240.00 + 180.00 = 420.00
\]

### Final Answer

The civic league raised a total of **$420.00** from the pancake breakfast fundraiser.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from the pancake breakfast fundraiser.

Given information:
- A stack of pancakes costs $4.00.
- Adding bacon costs $2.00.
- They sold 60 stacks of pancakes.
- They sold 90 slices of bacon.

Step 1: Calculate the revenue from selling the stacks of pancakes.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money raised from selling stacks of pancakes and slices of bacon separately, and then sum these amounts to find the total fundraising revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the revenue from pancake sales.**

Each stack of pancakes is sold for $4.00. The problem states that 60 stacks of pancakes were sold. To find the total revenue from pancakes, we multiply the number of stacks sold by the price per stack:

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The first step is to calculate the total amount of money raised from selling the pancakes. To do this, we multiply the number of stacks sold (60) by the price per stack ($4.00). 

60 stacks * $4.00/stack = $240.00

Next, we calculate the total amount of money raised from selling the bacon. We do this by multiplying the number of slices sold (90) by the price per slice ($2.00).

90 slices * $2.00/slice = $180.00

Finally, we add the total amount of money raised from the pa...
