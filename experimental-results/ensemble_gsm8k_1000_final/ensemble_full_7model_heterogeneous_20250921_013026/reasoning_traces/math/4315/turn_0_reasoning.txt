=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Farmer Kent would make from selling 18 watermelons, each weighing 23 pounds, at a price of $2 per pound.

**Step 1: Calculate the weight of one watermelon.**
The problem states that each watermelon weighs 23 pounds.

**Step 2: Calculate the total weight of 18 watermelons.**
To find the total weight of 18 watermelons, we multiply the weight of one watermelon by the number of watermelons:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of one watermelon} \times \text{Number of watermelons}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 23 \text{ pounds} \times 18
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
23 \times 18 = 414 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the watermelons.**
Farmer Kent sells the watermelons for $2 per pound. To find the total revenue, we multiply the total weight of the watermelons by the price per pound:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = \text{Total weight} \times \text{Price per pound}
\]
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 414 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pound}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
414 \times 2 = 828 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**
Farmer Kent would make **$828** for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight.
