=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of letters in Elida's name.**
   - Elida has 5 letters.

2. **Calculate the number of letters in Adrianna's name.**
   - According to the problem, Adrianna has 2 less than twice the number of letters Elida has.
   - First, we calculate twice the number of letters Elida has:
     \[
     2 \times 5 = 10
     \]
   - Now, we subtract 2 from this result to find the number of letters in Adrianna's name:
     \[
     10 - 2 = 8
     \]
   - Therefore, Adrianna has 8 letters.

3. **Calculate the average number of letters in both names.**
   - To find the average, we first need to sum the number of letters in both names:
     \[
     5 + 8 = 13
     \]
   - Next, we divide this sum by the number of names (which is 2):
     \[
     \text{Average} = \frac{13}{2} = 6.5
     \]

4. **Calculate 10 times the average number of letters.**
   - Finally, we multiply the average by 10:
     \[
     10 \times 6.5 = 65
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{65}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Elida has 5 letters.
- Adrianna has 2 less than twice the number of letters Elida has.

Step 1: Find the number of letters in Adrianna's name.
Adrianna's letters = 2 × Elida's letters - 2
Adrianna's letters = 2 × 5 - 2 = 8 letters

Step 2: Find the total number of letters in both names.
Total letters = Elida's letters + Adrianna's letters
Total letters = 5 + 8 = 13 letters

Step 3: Find the av...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of letters in each name:**
   - Elida has 5 letters.
   - Adrianna has 2 less than twice the number of letters Elida has. First, calculate twice the number of letters Elida has:
     \[
     2 \times 5 = 10
     \]
   - Now, subtract 2 from this result to find the number of letters in Adrianna's name:
     \[
     10 - 2 = 8
     \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many letters Adrianna has. According to the problem, Adrianna has 2 less than twice the number of letters Elida has. Elida has 5 letters, so twice that number is 5*2 = 10. Subtracting 2 gives us 10-2 = 8 letters for Adrianna.

Next, we need to find the average number of letters in both names. To do this, we add the number of letters in both names and divide by 2 (since there are 2 names). So, (5+8)/2 = 6.5 is the average number of letters.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Elida has 5 letters.
   * Adrianna has 2 less than twice the number of letters Elida has.

2. Calculate the number of letters in Adrianna's name:
   * Adrianna's letters = (2 × Elida's letters) - 2
   * Adrianna's letters = (2 × 5) - 2
   * Adrianna's letters = 10 - 2
   * Adrianna's letters = 8

3. Calculate the average number of letters in both names:
   * Aver...
