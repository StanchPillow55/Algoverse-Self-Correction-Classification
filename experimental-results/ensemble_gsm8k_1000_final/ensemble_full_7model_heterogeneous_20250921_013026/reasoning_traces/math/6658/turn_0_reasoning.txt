=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break down the number of apples Anna ate each day and then sum them up to find the total.

1. **Tuesday**: 
   - Anna ate 4 apples.
   - So, the number of apples eaten on Tuesday = 4.

2. **Wednesday**: 
   - On Wednesday, Anna ate double the apples she ate on Tuesday.
   - Since she ate 4 apples on Tuesday, on Wednesday she ate:
     \[
     2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ apples}
     \]

3. **Thursday**: 
   - On Thursday, Anna ate half the apples she ate on Tuesday.
   - Since she ate 4 apples on Tuesday, on Thursday she ate:
     \[
     \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ apples}
     \]

4. **Total Apples Eaten**: 
   - Now, we will sum the apples eaten over the three days:
     \[
     \text{Total} = \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} + \text{Thursday}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total} = 4 + 8 + 2
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total} = 14
     \]

Thus, by the end of these three days, Anna has eaten a total of **14 apples**.

Final answer: **14 apples**.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem:

On Tuesday, Anna ate 4 apples.

On Wednesday, she ate double the apples she ate on Tuesday. To find out how many apples she ate on Wednesday, we multiply the number of apples she ate on Tuesday by 2. 

4 apples * 2 = 8 apples

So, Anna ate 8 apples on Wednesday.

On Thursday, Anna ate half the apples she ate on Tuesday. To find out how many apples she ate on Thursday, we divide the number of apples she ate on Tuesday by 2.

4 apples / 2 = 2 ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll calculate the number of apples Anna ate each day and then add them together to find the total number of apples she ate over the three days.

Given:
- On Tuesday, Anna ate 4 apples.
- On Wednesday, she ate double the apples she ate on Tuesday.
- On Thursday, Anna ate half the apples she ate on Tuesday.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apples Anna ate on Tuesday.
