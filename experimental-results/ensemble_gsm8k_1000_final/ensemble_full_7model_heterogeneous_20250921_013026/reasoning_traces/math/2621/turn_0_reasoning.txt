=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of colored hangers in Fifi's closet, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of hangers by color:**
   - Pink hangers: Fifi has 7 pink hangers.
   - Green hangers: Fifi has 4 green hangers.
   - Blue hangers: The problem states that there is one less blue hanger than there are green hangers. Since there are 4 green hangers, the number of blue hangers is:
     \[
     \text{Number of blue hangers} = \text{Number of green hangers} - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3
     \]
   - Yellow hangers: The problem states that there is one less yellow hanger than there are blue hangers. Since there are 3 blue hangers, the number of yellow hangers is:
     \[
     \text{Number of yellow hangers} = \text{Number of blue hangers} - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of hangers:**
   Now we will add the number of hangers of each color together:
   - Pink hangers: 7
   - Green hangers: 4
   - Blue hangers: 3
   - Yellow hangers: 2

   The total number of hangers is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total hangers} = \text{Pink hangers} + \text{Green hangers} + \text{Blue hangers} + \text{Yellow hangers}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total hangers} = 7 + 4 + 3 + 2
   \]

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add the pink and green hangers:
     \[
     7 + 4 = 11
     \]
   - Next, add the blue hangers:
     \[
     11 + 3 = 14
     \]
   - Finally, add the yellow hangers:
     \[
     14 + 2 = 16
     \]

Thus, the total number of colored hangers in Fifi's closet is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's look at the number of hangers for each color that Fifi has in her closet.

She has 7 pink hangers and 4 green hangers. 

The problem states that she has one less blue hanger than there are green hangers. Since she has 4 green hangers, this means she has 4 - 1 = 3 blue hangers.

Similarly, the problem states that she has one less yellow hanger than there are blue hangers. Since she has 3 blue hangers, this means she has 3 - 1 = 2 yellow hangers.
