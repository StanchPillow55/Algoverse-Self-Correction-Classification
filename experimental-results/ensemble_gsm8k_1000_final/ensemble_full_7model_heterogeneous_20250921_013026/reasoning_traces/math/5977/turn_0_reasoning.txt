=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much the private school teacher will earn after the raise and then calculate how much each parent has to pay based on the number of children.

### Step 1: Calculate the Teacher's New Salary

The teacher's former salary is $45,000 per year. He is offered a 20% raise. To find the amount of the raise, we can calculate 20% of $45,000.

\[
\text{Raise} = 20\% \times 45,000
\]

To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:

\[
20\% = \frac{20}{100} = 0.20
\]

Now we can calculate the raise:

\[
\text{Raise} = 0.20 \times 45,000 = 9,000
\]

Now, we add the raise to the original salary to find the new salary:

\[
\text{New Salary} = \text{Original Salary} + \text{Raise}
\]
\[
\text{New Salary} = 45,000 + 9,000 = 54,000
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Total Cost for the Parents

The total cost for hiring the teacher is his new salary, which is $54,000 per year.

### Step 3: Calculate the Cost Per Child

There are 9 kids in total. To find out how much each parent has to pay, we divide the total salary by the number of kids:

\[
\text{Cost per child} = \frac{\text{Total Salary}}{\text{Number of Kids}}
\]
\[
\text{Cost per child} = \frac{54,000}{9}
\]

Now we perform the division:

\[
\text{Cost per child} = 6,000
\]

### Final Answer

Each parent has to pay **$6,000** per child per year.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The teacher's former job paid $45,000 per year.
- The parents offered the teacher a 20% raise.
- There are 9 kids in the group.

Step 1: Calculate the teacher's new salary with the 20% raise.
New salary = Former salary + (Former salary × Raise percentage)
New salary = $45,000 + ($45,000 × 0.20)
New salary = $45,000 + $9,000
New salary = $54,000 per year

Step 2: Calculate the tota...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total salary the teacher will receive with the 20% raise and then divide that amount by the number of children (or parents, assuming each child has one parent paying) to find out how much each parent has to pay.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the teacher's original salary:**
   - The teacher's original salary is $45,000 per year.

2. **Calculate the raise amount:**
   - The raise is 20% of the original salary.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The first step is to calculate how much the teacher will earn with the 20% raise. 

To do this, we multiply his former salary by 20% (or 0.20 in decimal form):

45,000 * 0.20 = 9,000

This means the teacher will earn an additional 9,000 per year. 

We then add this to his former salary to find out his new salary:

45,000 + 9,000 = 54,000

So, the teacher will earn 54,000 per year with the raise. 

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of kids to find out how m...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The teacher's former job paid $45,000 per year.
   * The parents offered him a 20% raise.
   * There are 9 kids in the group.

2. Calculate the teacher's new salary with the 20% raise:
   * A 20% raise means his new salary will be 120% of his old salary.
   * New salary = Old salary × 120%
   * New salary = $45,000 × 1.20
   * New salary = $54,000 per year

3. Determin...
