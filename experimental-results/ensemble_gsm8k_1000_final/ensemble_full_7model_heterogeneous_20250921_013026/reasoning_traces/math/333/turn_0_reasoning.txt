=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many chocolates Kantana bought for the month, we need to break down her purchases step by step.

1. **Determine the weekly chocolate purchases**:
   - Every Saturday, Kantana buys:
     - 2 chocolates for herself
     - 1 chocolate for her sister
   - Total chocolates bought each Saturday:
     \[
     2 \text{ (for herself)} + 1 \text{ (for her sister)} = 3 \text{ chocolates}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of Saturdays in a month**:
   - Typically, there are 4 Saturdays in a month, but some months can have 5 Saturdays. For this calculation, we will assume there are 4 Saturdays in the month.

3. **Calculate the total chocolates bought in 4 Saturdays**:
   - Total chocolates for 4 Saturdays:
   \[
   3 \text{ chocolates/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ chocolates}
   \]

4. **Add the additional chocolates for Charlie**:
   - Kantana also bought an additional 10 chocolates as a birthday gift for her friend Charlie.
   - Total chocolates including the gift:
   \[
   12 \text{ (chocolates for herself and sister)} + 10 \text{ (for Charlie)} = 22 \text{ chocolates}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of chocolates Kantana bought for the month is:
   \[
   \boxed{22}
   \]
