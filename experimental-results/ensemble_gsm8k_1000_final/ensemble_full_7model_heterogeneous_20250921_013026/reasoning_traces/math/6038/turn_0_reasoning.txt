=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to find out how much candy Mary has initially and then how much she has after adding 10 more pieces.

1. **Identify the amount of candy Megan has**: 
   We know from the problem that Megan has 5 pieces of candy.

2. **Determine how much candy Mary has initially**: 
   The problem states that Mary has 3 times as much candy as Megan. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of candy Mary has using the following formula:
   \[
   \text{Mary's candy} = 3 \times \text{Megan's candy}
   \]
   Substituting the amount of candy Megan has:
   \[
   \text{Mary's candy} = 3 \times 5 = 15
   \]
   So, initially, Mary has 15 pieces of candy.

3. **Calculate the total amount of candy Mary has after adding 10 pieces**:
   Now, we need to add the 10 pieces of candy that Mary adds to her collection:
   \[
   \text{Total candy Mary has after adding} = \text{Mary's initial candy} + 10
   \]
   Substituting the amount of candy Mary has:
   \[
   \text{Total candy Mary has after adding} = 15 + 10 = 25
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, after adding the 10 pieces of candy, Mary has a total of 25 pieces of candy.

In conclusion, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mary has 3 times as much candy as Megan.
- Mary then adds 10 more pieces of candy to her collection.
- Megan has 5 pieces of candy.

Step 1: Find how much candy Mary had initially.
Since Mary has 3 times as much candy as Megan, and Megan has 5 pieces of candy, we can calculate Mary's initial amount of candy.
Mary's initial candy = 3 × Megan's candy
Mary's initial candy = 3 × 5 = 15 pieces

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pieces of candy Mary has in total after adding 10 more pieces to her collection.

1. **Determine how much candy Megan has:**
   - We are given that Megan has 5 pieces of candy.

2. **Calculate how much candy Mary initially has:**
   - According to the problem, Mary has 3 times as much candy as Megan.
   - Since Megan has 5 pieces, we calculate Mary's initial amount of candy as follows:
     \[
     \text{Mary's initial ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much candy Mary initially has. Since Mary has 3 times as much candy as Megan, and Megan has 5 pieces of candy, we multiply Megan's amount by 3.

5 pieces * 3 = 15 pieces

So, Mary initially has 15 pieces of candy.

Next, Mary adds 10 more pieces of candy to her collection. To find out how much candy Mary has now, we add the 10 pieces to her initial amount.

15 pieces + 10 pieces = 25 pieces

So, Mary now has 25 pieces of candy in total.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- Mary has 3 times as much candy as Megan.
- Mary adds 10 more pieces of candy to her collection.
- Megan has 5 pieces of candy.

Step 1: Determine how many pieces of candy Mary had initially.
Mary's initial candy = 3 × Megan's candy
Mary's initial candy = 3 × 5 = 15 pieces
