=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the weights of Wanda and Yola based on the information given.

1. **Current Weight of Yola**: We know that Yola currently weighs 220 pounds.

2. **Current Weight of Wanda**: According to the problem, Wanda weighs 30 pounds more than Yola. Therefore, we can calculate Wanda's current weight as follows:
   \[
   \text{Wanda's current weight} = \text{Yola's current weight} + 30
   \]
   Substituting Yola's current weight:
   \[
   \text{Wanda's current weight} = 220 + 30 = 250 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Weight of Yola 2 Years Ago**: The problem states that Wanda also weighs 80 pounds more than Yola did 2 years ago. Let \( Y \) represent Yola's weight 2 years ago. According to the information provided:
   \[
   \text{Wanda's current weight} = Y + 80
   \]
   We already calculated Wanda's current weight to be 250 pounds. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   250 = Y + 80
   \]

4. **Solving for Y**: To find Yola's weight 2 years ago, we need to isolate \( Y \) in the equation:
   \[
   Y = 250 - 80
   \]
   \[
   Y = 170 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, Yola weighed 170 pounds 2 years ago.

5. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{170}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find out how much Yola weighed 2 years ago.

Given information:
- Wanda weighs 30 pounds more than Yola currently.
- Wanda also weighs 80 pounds more than Yola did 2 years ago.
- Yola currently weighs 220 pounds.

Step 1: Find Wanda's current weight.
Wanda's current weight = Yola's current weight + 30 pounds
Wanda's current weight = 220 pounds + 30 pounds = 250 pounds

Step 2: Find Yola's weight 2 years ago.
Wanda's c...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Yola weighed 2 years ago given the information about Wanda's and Yola's current weights and the relationship between their weights.

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Yola's current weight is 220 pounds.
2. Wanda currently weighs 30 pounds more than Yola. Therefore, Wanda's current weight is:
   \[
   \text{Wanda's current weight} = \text{Yola's current weight} + 30 = 220 + 30 = 250 \text{ poun...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote Wanda's current weight as W and Yola's current weight as Y. We also denote Yola's weight two years ago as Y2.

From the problem, we have two equations:

1) W = Y + 30 (Wanda weighs 30 pounds more than Yola currently)

2) W = Y2 + 80 (Wanda also weighs 80 pounds more than Yola did 2 years ago)

We know that Yola currently weighs 220 pounds, so we can substitute Y = 220 into the first equation to find Wanda's current weight:

W = 220 + 30 = 250 pounds

Now we c...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to set up equations and solve for Yola's weight 2 years ago.

Given:
- Wanda weighs 30 pounds more than Yola currently.
- Wanda weighs 80 pounds more than Yola did 2 years ago.
- Yola currently weighs 220 pounds.

Step 1: Let's express Wanda's current weight in terms of Yola's current weight.
Wanda's current weight = Yola's current weight + 30
Wanda's current weight = 220 +...
