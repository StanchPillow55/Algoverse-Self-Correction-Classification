=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total allowance Francie receives for the first 8 weeks.**
   - Francie receives $5 per week for 8 weeks.
   - Total allowance for the first 8 weeks = \( 5 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 40 \, \text{dollars} \).

2. **Calculate the total allowance Francie receives for the next 6 weeks.**
   - After 8 weeks, her dad raises her allowance to $6 per week for the next 6 weeks.
   - Total allowance for the next 6 weeks = \( 6 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 6 \, \text{weeks} = 36 \, \text{dollars} \).

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Francie has after 14 weeks.**
   - Total money = Total from first 8 weeks + Total from next 6 weeks
   - Total money = \( 40 \, \text{dollars} + 36 \, \text{dollars} = 76 \, \text{dollars} \).

4. **Determine how much money Francie uses to buy new clothes.**
   - Francie uses half of her total money to buy new clothes.
   - Money spent on clothes = \( \frac{76 \, \text{dollars}}{2} = 38 \, \text{dollars} \).

5. **Calculate how much money Francie has left after buying clothes.**
   - Remaining money = Total money - Money spent on clothes
   - Remaining money = \( 76 \, \text{dollars} - 38 \, \text{dollars} = 38 \, \text{dollars} \).

6. **Determine how much money Francie spends on the video game.**
   - The video game costs $35.

7. **Calculate how much money Francie has left after buying the video game.**
   - Money remaining after buying the video game = Remaining money - Cost of video game
   - Money remaining = \( 38 \, \text{dollars} - 35 \, \text{dollars} = 3 \, \text{dollars} \).

Finally, the amount of money Francie has remaining after buying the video game is:

\[
\boxed{3 \, \text{dollars}}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Francie receives an allowance of $5 a week for 8 weeks.
- Then her dad raises her allowance to $6 a week for 6 weeks.
- Francie uses half of the total money to buy new clothes.
- Francie buys a video game that costs $35 with the remaining money.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Francie receives from her allowance.
Allowance for the first 8 weeks: $5 × 8 = $40

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Francie saves over the weeks, determine how much she spends, and then find out how much she has left.

**Step 1: Calculate the total savings from her allowance.**

1. **Allowance for the first 8 weeks:**
   - Francie receives $5 per week.
   - For 8 weeks, her total allowance is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Allowance for the next 6 weeks...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much money Francie saved from her allowance.

For the first 8 weeks, she received $5 a week. So, she saved 8 weeks * $5/week = $<<8*5=40>>40.

Then, her allowance was raised to $6 a week for the next 6 weeks. So, she saved 6 weeks * $6/week = $<<6*6=36>>36.

In total, Francie saved $40 + $36 = $<<40+36=76>>76 from her allowance.

Next, let's calculate how much money Francie spent on new clothes. She used half of her savings, so she spent $76 / 2...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Calculate the amount Francie saved during the first 8 weeks:
   * Francie received $5 per week for 8 weeks
   * Total savings for the first 8 weeks = $5 × 8 = $40

2. Calculate the amount Francie saved during the next 6 weeks:
   * Francie received $6 per week for 6 weeks
   * Total savings for the next 6 weeks = $6 × 6 = $36

3. Calculate Francie's total savings:
   * Total savings = Savings from first 8 w...
