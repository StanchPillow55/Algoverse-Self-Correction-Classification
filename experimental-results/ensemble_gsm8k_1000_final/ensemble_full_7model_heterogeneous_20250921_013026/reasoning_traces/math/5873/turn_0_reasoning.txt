=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many total students can be placed in each of the 4 first-grade classrooms, given the number of boys and girls.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of boys and girls.

- Total number of boys: 56
- Total number of girls: 44

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of students.

To find the total number of students, we add the number of boys and girls together:

\[
\text{Total students} = \text{Total boys} + \text{Total girls} = 56 + 44 = 100
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many students can be in each classroom.

Since there are 4 classrooms, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms to find out how many students will be in each classroom:

\[
\text{Students per classroom} = \frac{\text{Total students}}{\text{Number of classrooms}} = \frac{100}{4} = 25
\]

### Step 4: Check the distribution of boys and girls.

To have an equal number of boys and girls in each classroom, we need to determine how many boys and girls can be placed in each classroom.

1. **Boys per classroom**:
   \[
   \text{Boys per classroom} = \frac{\text{Total boys}}{\text{Number of classrooms}} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
   \]

2. **Girls per classroom**:
   \[
   \text{Girls per classroom} = \frac{\text{Total girls}}{\text{Number of classrooms}} = \frac{44}{4} = 11
   \]

### Step 5: Verify the total number of students per classroom.

Now, we can verify the total number of students in each classroom:

\[
\text{Total students per classroom} = \text{Boys per classroom} + \text{Girls per classroom} = 14 + 11 = 25
\]

### Conclusion

Each classroom will have a total of 25 students, consisting of 14 boys and 11 girls.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Total students in each classroom} = 25
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find the total number of students. We do this by adding the number of boys and girls together.

56 boys + 44 girls = 100 students

The principal wants to divide these students equally among the 4 classrooms. To find out how many students should be in each classroom, we divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms.

100 students รท 4 classrooms = 25 students per classroom

So, there should be 25 students in each classroom. However, since the ...
