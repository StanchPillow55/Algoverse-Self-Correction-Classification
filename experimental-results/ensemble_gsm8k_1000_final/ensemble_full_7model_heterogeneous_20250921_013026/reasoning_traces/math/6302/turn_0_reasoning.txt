=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many convertibles Pauline has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of regular cars**:
   - Pauline has a total of 125 matchbox cars.
   - According to the problem, 64% of these cars are regular cars.
   - To find the number of regular cars, we calculate 64% of 125.

   \[
   \text{Number of regular cars} = 0.64 \times 125
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   0.64 \times 125 = 80
   \]

   So, Pauline has 80 regular cars.

2. **Determine the number of trucks**:
   - The problem states that 8% of the cars are trucks.
   - To find the number of trucks, we calculate 8% of 125.

   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = 0.08 \times 125
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   0.08 \times 125 = 10
   \]

   So, Pauline has 10 trucks.

3. **Calculate the number of convertibles**:
   - Now we can find the number of convertibles by subtracting the number of regular cars and trucks from the total number of cars.

   \[
   \text{Number of convertibles} = \text{Total cars} - (\text{Number of regular cars} + \text{Number of trucks})
   \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   \text{Number of convertibles} = 125 - (80 + 10)
   \]

   First, calculate the sum of regular cars and trucks:

   \[
   80 + 10 = 90
   \]

   Now, subtract this from the total number of cars:

   \[
   \text{Number of convertibles} = 125 - 90 = 35
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Pauline owns **35 convertibles**.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of convertibles Pauline owns based on the given information.

Given information:
- Pauline has a total of 125 matchbox cars.
- 64% of the cars are regular cars.
- 8% of the cars are trucks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of regular cars.
64% of 125 cars = 0.64 × 125 = 80 regular cars

Step 2: Calculate the number of trucks.
8% of 125 cars = 0.08 × 125 = 10 trucks

Step 3: Calculate the number of convert...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of Pauline's 125 matchbox cars are convertibles. We know the percentages of regular cars and trucks, and we can use this information to find the number of convertibles.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of regular cars.**

We are given that 64% of the cars are regular cars. To find the number of regular cars, we calculate 64% of 125:

\[
\text{Number of regular cars} = 0.64 \times 125
\]

Calculating this:

\[
0.64 \time...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many regular cars and trucks Pauline has.

To find the number of regular cars, we multiply the total number of cars by the percentage of regular cars. 

125 cars * 64% = 80 regular cars

To find the number of trucks, we multiply the total number of cars by the percentage of trucks.

125 cars * 8% = 10 trucks

Now, to find the number of convertibles, we subtract the number of regular cars and trucks from the total number of cars.

125 cars - ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Pauline has a total of 125 matchbox cars.
   * The cars are categorized into convertibles, trucks, and regular cars.
   * 64% of the cars are regular cars.
   * 8% of the cars are trucks.

2. Calculate the number of regular cars:
   * 64% of 125 = 0.64 × 125
   * 0.64 × 125 = 80
   * So, Pauline has 80 regular cars.

3. Calculate the number of trucks:
   * 8% of 125 = ...
