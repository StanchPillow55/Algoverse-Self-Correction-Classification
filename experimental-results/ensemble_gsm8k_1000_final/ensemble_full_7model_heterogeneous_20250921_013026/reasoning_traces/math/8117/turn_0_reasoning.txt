=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the ages of each person mentioned in the problem.

1. **Determine Steve's age:**
   - Steve is given to be 60 years old.

2. **Determine Steve's wife's age:**
   - Steve's wife is 4 years older than him.
   - Therefore, Steve's wife's age = Steve's age + 4 years = 60 + 4 = 64 years old.

3. **Determine their son's age:**
   - The son is currently half as old as his mom.
   - Therefore, the son's age = (Steve's wife's age) / 2 = 64 / 2 = 32 years old.

4. **Determine the son's wife's age:**
   - The son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband (the son).
   - Therefore, the son's wife's age = Son's age - 3 years = 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

Now, we have calculated the ages as follows:
- Steve: 60 years old
- Steve's wife: 64 years old
- Their son: 32 years old
- Son's wife: 29 years old

Finally, we need to answer the question: How old is Steve's son's wife?

The answer is:
**Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.**

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Steve is 60 years old.
- Steve's wife is 4 years older than him.
- Their son is currently half as old as his mom.
- Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband.

Step 1: Find the age of Steve's wife.
Steve's wife's age = Steve's age + 4 years
Steve's wife's age = 60 + 4 = 64 years old

Step 2: Find the age of Steve's son.
Steve's son's age = Steve's wife's age / 2
Steve's son's a...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Steve's son's wife. We'll break down the information given and solve step by step.

1. **Determine Steve's wife's age:**
   - Steve is 60 years old.
   - His wife is 4 years older than him.
   - Therefore, Steve's wife is \(60 + 4 = 64\) years old.

2. **Determine the son's age:**
   - The son is currently half as old as his mom.
   - Steve's wife (the son's mom) is 64 years old.
   - Therefore, the son is \(\frac{64...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Step 1: Determine the age of Steve's wife.
Since Steve's wife is 4 years older than him, we add 4 to Steve's age of 60.
60 + 4 = 64 years old.

Step 2: Determine the age of their son.
Since their son is half as old as his mom, we divide the mother's age by 2.
64 รท 2 = 32 years old.

Step 3: Determine the age of the son's wife.
Since the son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, we subtract 3 from the son's age.
32 - 3 = 29 years old.

So, Steve's son's wife is 29 ye...
