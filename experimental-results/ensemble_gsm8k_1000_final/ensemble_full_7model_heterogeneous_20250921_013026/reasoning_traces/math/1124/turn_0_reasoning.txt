=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many pieces of clothing Brie needs to put in the washer, we first need to calculate how many of each type of clothing she has in her hamper based on the percentages given.

1. **Calculate the number of blouses in the hamper:**
   - Total blouses = 12
   - Percentage in hamper = 75%
   - Number of blouses in hamper = \( 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \)

2. **Calculate the number of skirts in the hamper:**
   - Total skirts = 6
   - Percentage in hamper = 50%
   - Number of skirts in hamper = \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \)

3. **Calculate the number of slacks in the hamper:**
   - Total slacks = 8
   - Percentage in hamper = 25%
   - Number of slacks in hamper = \( 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \)

4. **Total pieces of clothing in the hamper:**
   - Total in hamper = Number of blouses + Number of skirts + Number of slacks
   - Total in hamper = \( 9 + 3 + 2 = 14 \)

Thus, Brie needs to put **14 pieces of clothing** in the washer.
