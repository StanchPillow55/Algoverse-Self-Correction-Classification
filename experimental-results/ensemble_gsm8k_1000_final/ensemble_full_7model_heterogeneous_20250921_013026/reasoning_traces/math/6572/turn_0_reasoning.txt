=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Josh has left after his shopping trip, we will follow these steps:

1. **Initial Amount**: Josh starts with $20.

2. **Cost of the Hat**: He buys a hat for $10.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after hat} = 20 - 10 = 10
   \]

3. **Cost of the Pencil**: He then buys a pencil for $2.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after pencil} = 10 - 2 = 8
   \]

4. **Cost of the Cookies**: Next, he buys four cookies, with each cookie costing $1.25. First, we need to calculate the total cost for the four cookies.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cookies} = 4 \times 1.25 = 5
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount After Buying Cookies**: Now we subtract the cost of the cookies from the amount he had left after buying the hat and pencil.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after cookies} = 8 - 5 = 3
   \]

Thus, after buying the hat, pencil, and cookies, Josh has $3 left.

**Final Answer**: Josh has $3 left.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Josh starts with $20. 

First, he buys a hat for $10. 

So, $20 - $10 = $10 left.

Then, he buys a pencil for $2. 

So, $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Then, he buys four cookies. Each cookie costs $1.25. 

So, 4 cookies * $1.25/cookie = $5.

So, $8 - $5 = $3 left.

Therefore, Josh has $3 left after his shopping.
