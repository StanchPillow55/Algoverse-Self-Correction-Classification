=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Information**:
   - Rick starts with 130 cards.
   - He decides to keep 15 cards.

2. **Calculating Cards Given Away**:
   - The total number of cards Rick gives away can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cards given away} = \text{Total cards} - \text{Cards kept} = 130 - 15 = 115
     \]

3. **Cards Given to Friends**:
   - Rick gives 12 cards to each of his 8 friends. The total number of cards given to friends is:
     \[
     \text{Cards given to friends} = 12 \times 8 = 96
     \]

4. **Remaining Cards After Giving to Friends**:
   - After giving cards to his friends, we need to find out how many cards Rick has left:
     \[
     \text{Remaining cards} = \text{Cards given away} - \text{Cards given to friends} = 115 - 96 = 19
     \]

5. **Cards Given to Sisters**:
   - Rick has 2 sisters and he gives the remaining cards equally to them. Each sister receives 3 cards, so the total number of cards given to his sisters is:
     \[
     \text{Total cards given to sisters} = 3 \times 2 = 6
     \]

6. **Calculating Cards Given to Miguel**:
   - Now we can find out how many cards Rick gave to Miguel. We know that Rick gave away a total of 115 cards, and we can express this as:
     \[
     \text{Cards given to Miguel} = \text{Total cards given away} - \text{Cards given to friends} - \text{Cards given to sisters}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Cards given to Miguel} = 115 - 96 - 6 = 115 - 102 = 13
     \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of cards Rick gave to Miguel is:
     \[
     \boxed{13}
     \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Rick initially had 130 cards and decided to keep 15 cards. So, he gave away 130 - 15 = <<130-15=115>>115 cards.

He gave 12 cards each to his 8 friends, which totals to 12 * 8 = <<12*8=96>>96 cards.

He also gave 3 cards each to his 2 sisters, which totals to 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 cards.

So, the total number of cards he gave to his friends and sisters is 96 + 6 = <<96+6=102>>102 cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Rick gave to Miguel is the total number of cards he gave ...
