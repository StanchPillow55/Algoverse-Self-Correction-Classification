=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of chairs in Rodrigo's classroom in the morning, and then account for the chairs borrowed by Lisa in the afternoon.

1. **Identify the number of red chairs:**
   - According to the problem, there are 4 red chairs.
   \[
   \text{Red chairs} = 4
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of yellow chairs:**
   - The problem states that there are 2 times as many yellow chairs as red chairs. Therefore, we can calculate the number of yellow chairs as follows:
   \[
   \text{Yellow chairs} = 2 \times \text{Red chairs} = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of blue chairs:**
   - The problem also states that there are 2 fewer blue chairs than yellow chairs. Thus, we can find the number of blue chairs:
   \[
   \text{Blue chairs} = \text{Yellow chairs} - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of chairs in the morning:**
   - Now, we can find the total number of chairs by adding the number of red, yellow, and blue chairs together:
   \[
   \text{Total chairs} = \text{Red chairs} + \text{Yellow chairs} + \text{Blue chairs} = 4 + 8 + 6 = 18
   \]

5. **Account for the chairs borrowed by Lisa:**
   - In the afternoon, Lisa borrows 3 chairs. We need to subtract these from the total number of chairs:
   \[
   \text{Chairs left} = \text{Total chairs} - \text{Chairs borrowed} = 18 - 3 = 15
   \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the number of chairs left in Rodrigo's classroom after Lisa borrows 3 chairs is:
   \[
   \boxed{15}
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many chairs there are in total in Rodrigo's classroom in the morning.

We know that there are 4 red chairs. 

The problem tells us that there are 2 times as many yellow chairs as red chairs. So, we multiply the number of red chairs by 2 to find out the number of yellow chairs: 4 red chairs * 2 = 8 yellow chairs.

The problem also tells us that there are 2 fewer blue chairs than yellow chairs. So, we subtract 2 from the number of yellow chairs to ...
