=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete on both tests, we need to calculate how many questions he was able to complete during the time he had for each test.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the first test.**

- The first test had 75 questions.
- Mark completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.

First, we calculate the total number of questions he could complete in 8 hours:

\[
\text{Total questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions}
\]

Now, we compare the number of questions he completed to the total number of questions on the test:

\[
\text{Questions left incomplete on the first test} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 75 - 40 = 35 \, \text{questions}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the second test.**

- The second test had 100 questions.
- He completed the test at the same rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.

Now, we calculate the total number of questions he could complete in 6 hours:

\[
\text{Total questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions}
\]

Next, we compare the number of questions he completed to the total number of questions on the second test:

\[
\text{Questions left incomplete on the second test} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 100 - 30 = 70 \, \text{questions}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of incomplete questions from both tests.**

Now, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:

\[
\text{Total incomplete questions} = \text{Incomplete questions on first test} + \text{Incomplete questions on second test} = 35 + 70 = 105 \, \text{questions}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Mark left a total of **105 questions incomplete** across both tests.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many questions Mark completed in the given time for each test and then calculate how many questions he left incomplete.

### Test 1:
- **Total questions:** 75
- **Rate of completion:** 5 questions per hour
- **Time available:** 8 hours

First, calculate how many questions Mark can complete in 8 hours:

\[
\text{Questions completed in Test 1} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many questions Mark was able to complete in the given time for each test.

For the first test, Mark was able to complete 5 questions per hour. Given that he had 8 hours to complete the test, we can calculate the total number of questions he completed by multiplying the rate by the time. 

5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions

So, Mark was able to complete 40 questions on the first test.

For the second test, Mark also worked at a rate ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find out how many questions Mark left incomplete in total from both tests.

Given:
- Yesterday's test had 75 questions.
- Today's test had 100 questions.
- Mark completed questions at a rate of 5 per hour.
- He had 8 hours for the first test and 6 hours for the second test.

Step 1: Calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the first test.
Questions completed in the first test = Rate ...
