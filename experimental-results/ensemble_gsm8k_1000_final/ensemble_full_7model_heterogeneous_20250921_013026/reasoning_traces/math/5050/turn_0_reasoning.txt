=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Loisa will save by buying the tablet in cash instead of through the installment plan, we need to calculate the total cost of the tablet using the installment plan and then compare it to the cash price.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the installment plan

1. **Down Payment**: Loisa makes a down payment of $100.
   
2. **Monthly Payments**:
   - For the first 4 months, she pays $40 per month:
     \[
     4 \text{ months} \times 40 \text{ dollars/month} = 160 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - For the next 4 months, she pays $35 per month:
     \[
     4 \text{ months} \times 35 \text{ dollars/month} = 140 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - For the last 4 months, she pays $30 per month:
     \[
     4 \text{ months} \times 30 \text{ dollars/month} = 120 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Payments**: Now, we sum all the payments:
   \[
   \text{Total Payments} = \text{Down Payment} + \text{First 4 months} + \text{Next 4 months} + \text{Last 4 months}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Payments} = 100 + 160 + 140 + 120
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Payments} = 100 + 160 = 260
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Payments} = 260 + 140 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Payments} = 400 + 120 = 520
   \]

### Step 2: Compare the total installment cost with the cash price

- The cash price of the tablet is $450.
- The total cost of the installment plan is $520.

### Step 3: Calculate the savings

To find out how much Loisa saves by paying in cash instead of using the installment plan, we subtract the cash price from the total installment cost:
\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Total Installment Cost} - \text{Cash Price}
\]
\[
\text{Savings} = 520 - 450
\]
\[
\text{Savings} = 70
\]

### Final Answer

Loisa will save **$70** if she buys the tablet in cash instead of on installment.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total amount Loisa would pay if she buys the tablet on installment.

She will pay $100 as a down payment. 

For the first 4 months, she will pay $40 each month, which totals to 4 * $40 = $<<4*40=160>>160.

For the next 4 months, she will pay $35 each month, which totals to 4 * $35 = $<<4*35=140>>140.

For the last 4 months, she will pay $30 each month, which totals to 4 * $30 = $<<4*30=120>>120.

So, the total amount she will pay on installment ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given:
- The tablet costs $450 in cash.
- Loisa will pay $100 as a down payment.
- She will pay $40 for the first 4 months, $35 for the next 4 months, and $30 for the last 4 months.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Loisa will pay with the installment plan.
Down payment: $100
First 4 months: 4 × $40 = $160
Next 4 months: 4 × $35 = $140
Last 4 months: 4 × $30 = $120
