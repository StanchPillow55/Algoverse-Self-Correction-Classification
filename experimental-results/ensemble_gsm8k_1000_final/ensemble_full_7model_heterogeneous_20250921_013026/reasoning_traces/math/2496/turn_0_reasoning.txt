=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many designer scarves are included in the Oscar swag bags, we can start by calculating the total value of the items we already know.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the diamond earrings:**
   - There are 2 diamond earrings, each costing $6,000.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of earrings} = 2 \times 6000 = 12000
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the iPhone:**
   - The iPhone costs $2,000.
   \[
   \text{Cost of iPhone} = 2000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total value of the earrings and the iPhone:**
   \[
   \text{Total value of earrings and iPhone} = 12000 + 2000 = 14000
   \]

4. **Determine the remaining value for the scarves:**
   - The total value of the swag bag is $20,000. We can find the remaining value that must be accounted for by subtracting the total value of the earrings and the iPhone from the total swag bag value.
   \[
   \text{Remaining value for scarves} = 20000 - 14000 = 6000
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of scarves:**
   - Each designer scarf costs $1,500. To find the number of scarves, we divide the remaining value by the cost of one scarf.
   \[
   \text{Number of scarves} = \frac{6000}{1500} = 4
   \]

Thus, the number of designer scarves in the swag bag is \( \boxed{4} \).

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many designer scarves are included in the Oscar swag bag. We are given the total value of the swag bag and the individual costs of the items included. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Known Costs

1. **Diamond Earrings**: There are two diamond earrings, each costing $6,000.
   - Total cost for earrings = \(2 \times 6,000 = 12,000\) dollars.

2. **iPhone**: The cost of the iPhone is $2,000...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The total cost of the two diamond earrings is 2 * $6,000 = $12,000.

The total cost of the diamond earrings and the iPhone is $12,000 + $2,000 = $14,000.

The total value of the swag bag is $20,000, so the value of the scarves is $20,000 - $14,000 = $6,000.

Each scarf costs $1,500, so the number of scarves is $6,000 / $1,500 = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 designer scarves in the swag bag.
