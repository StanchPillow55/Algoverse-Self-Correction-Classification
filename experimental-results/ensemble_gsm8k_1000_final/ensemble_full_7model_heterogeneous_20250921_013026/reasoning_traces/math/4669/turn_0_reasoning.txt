=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total cost of Tom's deck of trading cards, we need to calculate the cost of each type of card separately and then sum those costs.

1. **Calculate the cost of the rare cards:**
   - Tom has 19 rare cards.
   - Each rare card costs $1.
   - The total cost for the rare cards can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of rare cards} = \text{Number of rare cards} \times \text{Cost per rare card} = 19 \times 1 = 19 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the uncommon cards:**
   - Tom has 11 uncommon cards.
   - Each uncommon card costs $0.50.
   - The total cost for the uncommon cards can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of uncommon cards} = \text{Number of uncommon cards} \times \text{Cost per uncommon card} = 11 \times 0.50 = 5.50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the common cards:**
   - Tom has 30 common cards.
   - Each common card costs $0.25.
   - The total cost for the common cards can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of common cards} = \text{Number of common cards} \times \text{Cost per common card} = 30 \times 0.25 = 7.50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Sum the costs of all types of cards:**
   - Now, we add the costs of the rare, uncommon, and common cards together:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of rare cards} + \text{Cost of uncommon cards} + \text{Cost of common cards}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 19 + 5.50 + 7.50
     \]

5. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add the cost of the rare cards and the uncommon cards:
     \[
     19 + 5.50 = 24.50
     \]
   - Then, add the cost of the common cards:
     \[
     24.50 + 7.50 = 32.00
     \]

Thus, the total cost of Tom's deck is:
\[
\boxed{32.00} \text{ dollars}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We have the following information:
   - Tom's deck has 19 rare cards
   - Tom's deck has 11 uncommon cards
   - Tom's deck has 30 common cards
   - Rare cards cost $1 each
   - Uncommon cards cost $0.50 each
   - Common cards cost $0.25 each

2. To calculate the total cost of the rare cards, we multiply the number of rare cards by the cost per rare card:
   - 19 rare cards x $1 per card = $19

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to multiply the number of each type of card by their respective costs and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the rare cards. There are 19 rare cards and each costs $1. So, the total cost of the rare cards is 19 * $1 = $19.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the uncommon cards. There are 11 uncommon cards and each costs $.50. So, the total cost of the uncommon cards is 11 * $.50 = $5.50.

Finally, let's calcu...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Tom's deck has 19 rare cards, 11 uncommon cards, and 30 common cards.
   * Rare cards cost $1 each.
   * Uncommon cards cost $0.50 each.
   * Common cards cost $0.25 each.

2. Calculate the total cost of the rare cards:
   * Number of rare cards = 19
   * Cost per rare card = $1
   * Total cost of rare cards = 19 Ã— $1 = $19

3. Calculate the total cost of the u...
