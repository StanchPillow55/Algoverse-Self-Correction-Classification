Final Answer: To find out how much the school spent in total on pencils and markers, we will break down the costs step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the pencils.

1. **Determine the number of boxes of pencils:**
   - Each carton of pencils contains 10 boxes.
   - The school bought 20 cartons of pencils.
   - Therefore, the total number of boxes of pencils is:
     \[
     20 \text{ cartons} \times 10 \text{ boxes/carton} = 200 \text{ boxes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the boxes of pencils:**
   - Each box of pencils costs $2.
   - The total cost for the boxes of pencils is:
     \[
     200 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the markers.

1. **Determine the number of boxes of markers:**
   - Each carton of markers contains 5 boxes.
   - The school bought 10 cartons of markers.
   - Therefore, the total number of boxes of markers is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cartons} \times 5 \text{ boxes/carton} = 50 \text{ boxes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the boxes of markers:**
   - Each box of markers costs $4.
   - The total cost for the boxes of markers is:
     \[
     50 \text{ boxes} \times 4 \text{ dollars/box} = 200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost.

Now, we will add the total costs of the pencils and markers together:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of pencils} + \text{Cost of markers}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 400 \text{ dollars} + 200 \text{ dollars} = 600 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer:
The school spent a total of **$600**.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the cost of the pencils.

Each carton of pencils contains 10 boxes, and each box costs $2. So, the cost of one carton of pencils is 10 boxes/carton * $2/box = $20/carton.

The school bought 20 cartons of pencils, so the total cost of the pencils is 20 cartons * $20/carton = $400.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the markers.

Each carton of markers contains 5 boxes, and each box costs $4. So, the cost of one carton of markers is 5 boxes/carton * $...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step and solve it:

Given information:
- The school bought 20 cartons of pencils.
- Each carton of pencils has 10 boxes.
- Each box of pencils costs $2.
- The school also bought 10 cartons of markers.
- Each carton of markers has 5 boxes.
