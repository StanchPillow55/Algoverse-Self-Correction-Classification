=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Will has left after his shopping trip, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount spent on the items he bought.**
2. **Calculate the refund he receives for returning the shoes.**
3. **Calculate the total amount of money he has after the refund.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent

Will bought the following items:
- Sweater: $9
- T-shirt: $11
- Shoes: $30

Now, we will add these amounts together to find the total amount spent:

\[
\text{Total spent} = \text{Sweater} + \text{T-shirt} + \text{Shoes}
\]
\[
\text{Total spent} = 9 + 11 + 30
\]
\[
\text{Total spent} = 50
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the refund for the shoes

Will returned his shoes for a 90% refund. First, we need to calculate 90% of the price of the shoes:

\[
\text{Price of shoes} = 30
\]
\[
\text{Refund} = 90\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.90 \times 30
\]
\[
\text{Refund} = 27
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Will has left

Initially, Will had $74. After spending $50 on his shopping, we will subtract the total spent from his initial amount and then add the refund he received for the shoes:

\[
\text{Money left after spending} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total spent}
\]
\[
\text{Money left after spending} = 74 - 50
\]
\[
\text{Money left after spending} = 24
\]

Now, we will add the refund he received for the shoes:

\[
\text{Total money left} = \text{Money left after spending} + \text{Refund}
\]
\[
\text{Total money left} = 24 + 27
\]
\[
\text{Total money left} = 51
\]

### Final Answer

Will has **$51** left after his shopping trip.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how much money Will spent on shopping. He bought a sweater for $9, a T-shirt for $11 and a pair of shoes for $30. 

So, the total amount of money he spent is $9 (sweater) + $11 (T-shirt) + $30 (shoes) = $50.

Then, he returned his shoes and got a 90% refund. To find out how much money he got back, we need to calculate 90% of the price of the shoes. 

90% of $30 is (90/100) * $30 = $27.

So, Will got $27 back when he returned his shoes.

Now, we...
