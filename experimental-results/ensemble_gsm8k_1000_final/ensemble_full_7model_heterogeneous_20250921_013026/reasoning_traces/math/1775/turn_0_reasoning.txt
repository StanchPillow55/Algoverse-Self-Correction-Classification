=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many squirrels each student counted and then find the total number of squirrels counted by both students.

1. **Identify the number of squirrels counted by the first student**:
   - The first student counted 12 squirrels.

2. **Calculate the number of squirrels counted by the second student**:
   - The second student counted a third more squirrels than the first student. 
   - To find out how many squirrels this is, we first need to calculate one third of the number of squirrels counted by the first student:
     \[
     \text{One third of 12} = \frac{12}{3} = 4
     \]
   - Now, we add this amount to the number of squirrels counted by the first student:
     \[
     \text{Squirrels counted by the second student} = 12 + 4 = 16
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of squirrels counted by both students**:
   - Now we add the number of squirrels counted by the first student and the second student:
     \[
     \text{Total squirrels} = 12 + 16 = 28
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - The total number of squirrels counted by both students combined is \( \boxed{28} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The first student counted 12 squirrels.
- The second student counted a third more squirrels than the first student.

Step 1: Calculate the number of squirrels counted by the second student.
Since the second student counted a third more squirrels than the first student, we can calculate this as follows:
- A third of 12 is 4 (12 รท 3 = 4)
- So the second student counted 12 + 4 = 16 squirrels...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many squirrels both students counted combined. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of squirrels counted by the first student:**
   - The first student counted 12 squirrels.

2. **Determine how many squirrels the second student counted:**
   - The problem states that the second student counted a third more squirrels than the first student.
   - A third more than 12 squirrels can be calculated...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many squirrels the second student counted. The problem states that the second student counted a third more squirrels than the first student. 

To find out how many squirrels the second student counted, we need to calculate a third of the number of squirrels the first student counted, which is 12. 

A third of 12 is calculated as follows: 12 รท 3 = 4

So, the second student counted 4 more squirrels than the first student. 

To find out the tot...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The first student counted 12 squirrels.
   * The second student counted a third more squirrels than the first student.

2. Calculate the number of squirrels the second student counted:
   * The first student counted 12 squirrels.
   * One-third of 12 is: 12 รท 3 = 4
   * The second student counted 4 more squirrels than the first student.
   * So, the second studen...
