=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many flowers have bloomed in Arianna's garden. We can break this down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.

Arianna has 10 rows of flowers, and each row contains 20 flowers. To find the total number of flowers, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers per row:

\[
\text{Total flowers} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Flowers per row}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total flowers} = 10 \times 20 = 200
\]

### Step 2: Determine the fraction of flowers that have bloomed.

According to the problem, \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the planted flowers have bloomed. To find out how many flowers this represents, we multiply the total number of flowers by \( \frac{4}{5} \):

\[
\text{Bloomed flowers} = \text{Total flowers} \times \frac{4}{5}
\]

Substituting the total number of flowers:

\[
\text{Bloomed flowers} = 200 \times \frac{4}{5}
\]

### Step 3: Perform the multiplication.

To calculate \( 200 \times \frac{4}{5} \), we can first divide 200 by 5 and then multiply the result by 4:

\[
200 \div 5 = 40
\]

Now, multiply by 4:

\[
40 \times 4 = 160
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is:

\[
\boxed{160}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of flowers in Arianna's garden and then calculate how many of them have bloomed.

Given information:
- Arianna's garden has 10 rows of flowers.
- Each row has 20 flowers.
- Only 4/5 of the planted flowers have bloomed.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of flowers in Arianna's garden.
Total number of flowers = Number of rows × Number of flowers per row
Total number of flowers = 10 × 20 = 200 flo...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of determining how many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Flowers Planted:**
   - Arianna's garden has 10 rows of flowers.
   - Each row contains 20 flowers.
   - To find the total number of flowers, multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers per row:
     \[
     \text{Total flowers} = 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers/row} = 200 \text{ flowers}
     \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many flowers Arianna has planted in total. We can do this by multiplying the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row. 

10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Next, we need to find out how many of these flowers have bloomed. We know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, so we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5.

200 flowers * 4/5 = 160 flowers

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Arianna's garden has 10 rows of flowers.
   * Each row has 20 flowers.
   * Currently, 4/5 (four-fifths) of the planted flowers have bloomed.

2. Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden:
   * Total flowers = Number of rows × Flowers in each row
   * Total flowers = 10 × 20
   * Total flowers = 200
   
   So, there are 200 flowers in Arianna's garden.
