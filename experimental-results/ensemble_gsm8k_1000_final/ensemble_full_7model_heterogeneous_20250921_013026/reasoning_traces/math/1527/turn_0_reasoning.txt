=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of balloons the clown has initially.**
   The clown has 3 dozen balloons. Since one dozen equals 12, we can calculate the total number of balloons as follows:
   \[
   3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ balloons}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of children who buy balloons.**
   There are 3 boys and 12 girls who each buy one balloon. We can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys and girls:
   \[
   \text{Total children} = 3 \text{ boys} + 12 \text{ girls} = 15 \text{ children}
   \]

3. **Determine how many balloons are left after the children buy them.**
   Since each of the 15 children buys one balloon, we need to subtract the number of balloons sold from the initial number of balloons:
   \[
   \text{Balloons remaining} = \text{Initial balloons} - \text{Balloons sold}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Balloons remaining} = 36 - 15 = 21
   \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   The clown is still holding 21 balloons after the children have bought their balloons.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The clown has 3 dozen balloons on a string in his hand.
- 3 boys and 12 girls buy a balloon each.

Step 1: Convert 3 dozen balloons to the total number of balloons.
1 dozen = 12 balloons
3 dozen = 3 × 12 = 36 balloons

Step 2: Calculate the number of balloons sold.
Number of balloons sold = 3 boys + 12 girls = 15 balloons

Step 3: Calculate the number of balloons the clown is still holding.
Nu...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many balloons the clown is still holding after selling some to the boys and girls.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the initial number of balloons:**
   - The clown starts with 3 dozen balloons.
   - A dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen balloons is calculated as follows:
     \[
     3 \times 12 = 36
     \]
   - Therefore, the clown initially has 36 balloons.

2. **Calculate the total number of bal...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many balloons the clown started with. Since a dozen is 12, and the clown has 3 dozen balloons, we multiply 3 by 12 to find the total number of balloons. 

3 dozen * 12 = 36 balloons

Next, we need to find out how many balloons were bought. We know that 3 boys and 12 girls each bought a balloon, so we add these two numbers together.

3 boys + 12 girls = 15 balloons bought

Finally, we subtract the number of balloons bought from the total numb...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. To find out how many balloons the clown is still holding, we need to calculate the total number of balloons he started with and subtract the number of balloons sold.

Given:
- The clown has 3 dozen balloons on a string.
- 3 boys and 12 girls buy a balloon each.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of balloons the clown started with.
1 dozen = 12 balloons
3 dozen = 3 × 12 = 36 balloons
So, the clown started wi...
