=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps.

1. **Determine the total number of pies baked**:
   Marcus can fit 5 pies in his oven at once. He bakes 7 batches of pies. To find the total number of pies baked, we multiply the number of pies per batch by the number of batches:

   \[
   \text{Total pies baked} = \text{Pies per batch} \times \text{Number of batches}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total pies baked} = 5 \text{ pies/batch} \times 7 \text{ batches} = 35 \text{ pies}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of pies dropped**:
   According to the problem, Marcus slips and drops 8 of the pies.

3. **Calculate the number of pies left**:
   To find out how many pies are left after dropping some, we subtract the number of pies dropped from the total number of pies baked:

   \[
   \text{Pies left} = \text{Total pies baked} - \text{Pies dropped}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Pies left} = 35 \text{ pies} - 8 \text{ pies} = 27 \text{ pies}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   After performing the calculations, we find that the number of pies left is:

   \[
   \boxed{27}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Marcus can fit 5 pies in his oven at once.
- He bakes 7 batches of pies.
- He then drops 8 of the pies.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pies baked.
Number of pies per batch × Number of batches = Total pies baked
5 pies × 7 batches = 35 pies

Step 2: Calculate the number of pies dropped.
Number of pies dropped = 8 pies

Step 3: Calculate the number of pies left.
Total pies baked - N...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pies Marcus has left after baking and dropping some of them. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of pies Marcus bakes:**
   - Marcus can fit 5 pies in his oven at once.
   - He bakes 7 batches of pies.
   - To find the total number of pies baked, we multiply the number of pies per batch by the number of batches:

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many pies Marcus baked in total. Since he can fit 5 pies in his oven at once and he baked 7 batches, we multiply 5 pies/batch * 7 batches = 35 pies.

Next, we need to subtract the pies that Marcus dropped. So, we take the total number of pies he baked and subtract the ones he dropped: 35 pies - 8 pies = 27 pies.

Therefore, Marcus has 27 pies left.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Marcus can fit 5 pies in his oven at once.
   * He bakes 7 batches of pies.
   * He accidentally drops 8 pies.

2. Calculate the total number of pies Marcus baked:
   * Pies per batch = 5
   * Number of batches = 7
   * Total pies baked = Pies per batch × Number of batches
   * Total pies baked = 5 × 7 = 35 pies

3. Subtract the number of dropped pies from the to...
