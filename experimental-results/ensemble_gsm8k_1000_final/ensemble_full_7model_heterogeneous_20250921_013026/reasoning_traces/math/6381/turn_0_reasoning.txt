=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the heights of the three types of poodles: standard, miniature, and toy.

1. **Define the heights**:
   - Let \( S \) be the height of the standard poodle.
   - Let \( M \) be the height of the miniature poodle.
   - Let \( T \) be the height of the toy poodle.

2. **Given information**:
   - The standard poodle is 28 inches tall, so \( S = 28 \) inches.
   - The standard poodle is 8 inches taller than the miniature poodle, which gives us the equation:
     \[
     S = M + 8
     \]
   - The miniature poodle is 6 inches taller than the toy poodle, leading to the equation:
     \[
     M = T + 6
     \]

3. **Substituting the known height**:
   Since we know \( S = 28 \), we can substitute this value into the first equation:
   \[
   28 = M + 8
   \]

4. **Solving for \( M \)**:
   Rearranging the equation to solve for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 28 - 8
   \]
   \[
   M = 20 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Finding the height of the toy poodle**:
   Now that we have \( M = 20 \), we can substitute this value into the second equation:
   \[
   20 = T + 6
   \]

6. **Solving for \( T \)**:
   Rearranging this equation to solve for \( T \):
   \[
   T = 20 - 6
   \]
   \[
   T = 14 \text{ inches}
   \]

7. **Final answer**:
   The height of the toy poodle is \( \boxed{14} \) inches.

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the heights of the three types of poodles: standard, miniature, and toy.

1. **Define the heights**:
   - Let \( S \) be the height of the standard poodle.
   - Let \( M \) be the height of the miniature poodle.
   - Let \( T \) be the height of the toy poodle.

2. **Given information**:
   - The standard poodle is 28 inches tall, so \( S = 28 \) inches.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The standard poodle is 8 inches taller than the miniature poodle.
- The miniature poodle is 6 inches taller than the toy poodle.
- The standard poodle is 28 inches tall.

Step 1: Find the height of the miniature poodle.
Since the standard poodle is 8 inches taller than the miniature poodle, we can subtract 8 inches from the standard poodle's height to find the miniature poodle's height.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the height of the toy poodle given the heights of the standard and miniature poodles in relation to each other.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) represent the height of the standard poodle.
- Let \( M \) represent the height of the miniature poodle.
- Let \( T \) represent the height of the toy poodle.

We are given the following information:
1. The standard poodle is 28 inches tall. Therefore, \( S = 28 \).
2. The st...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem gives us three pieces of information:

1. The standard poodle is 8 inches taller than the miniature poodle.
2. The miniature poodle is 6 inches taller than the toy poodle.
3. The standard poodle is 28 inches tall.

We can use this information to set up a series of equations to solve for the height of the toy poodle.

First, let's denote the height of the standard poodle as S, the height of the miniature poodle as M, and the height of the toy poodle as T.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to find the height of the toy poodle.

Given:
- The standard poodle is 8 inches taller than the miniature poodle.
- The miniature poodle is 6 inches taller than the toy poodle.
- The standard poodle is 28 inches tall.

Step 1: Let's express the height of the miniature poodle in terms of the toy poodle.
Miniature poodle height = Toy poodle height + 6 inches

Step 2: Express the...
