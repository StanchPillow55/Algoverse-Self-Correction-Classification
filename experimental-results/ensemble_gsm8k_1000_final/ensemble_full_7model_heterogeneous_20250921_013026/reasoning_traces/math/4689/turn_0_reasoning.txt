=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first determine how many dozen eggs each person collects and then sum those amounts to find the total.

1. **Calculate the number of eggs Benjamin collects:**
   Benjamin collects 6 dozen eggs a day. 
   \[
   \text{Benjamin's collection} = 6 \text{ dozen}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of eggs Carla collects:**
   Carla collects 3 times the number of eggs that Benjamin collects. 
   \[
   \text{Carla's collection} = 3 \times \text{Benjamin's collection} = 3 \times 6 \text{ dozen} = 18 \text{ dozen}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of eggs Trisha collects:**
   Trisha collects 4 dozen less than Benjamin. 
   \[
   \text{Trisha's collection} = \text{Benjamin's collection} - 4 \text{ dozen} = 6 \text{ dozen} - 4 \text{ dozen} = 2 \text{ dozen}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of eggs collected by all three:**
   Now we will add the collections of Benjamin, Carla, and Trisha together.
   \[
   \text{Total collection} = \text{Benjamin's collection} + \text{Carla's collection} + \text{Trisha's collection}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total collection} = 6 \text{ dozen} + 18 \text{ dozen} + 2 \text{ dozen}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total collection} = 26 \text{ dozen}
   \]

Thus, the total number of dozen eggs collected by Benjamin, Carla, and Trisha is \( \boxed{26} \).

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will first determine how many dozen eggs each person collects and then sum those amounts to find the total.

1. **Calculate the number of eggs Benjamin collects:**
   Benjamin collects 6 dozen eggs a day. 
   \[
   \text{Benjamin's collection} = 6 \text{ dozen}

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Benjamin collects 6 dozen eggs a day.
- Carla collects 3 times the number of eggs that Benjamin collects.
- Trisha collects 4 dozen less than Benjamin.

Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Carla collects.
Carla collects 3 times the number of eggs that Benjamin collects.
Benjamin collects 6 dozen eggs a day.
1 dozen = 12 eggs
6 dozen = 6 × 12 = 72 eggs
Carla collects 3 × 72 = 216 ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many dozen eggs each person collects and then find the total number of dozen eggs collected by all three.

1. **Determine how many dozen eggs Benjamin collects:**
   - Benjamin collects 6 dozen eggs a day.

2. **Determine how many dozen eggs Carla collects:**
   - Carla collects 3 times the number of eggs that Benjamin collects.
   - Since Benjamin collects 6 dozen eggs, Carla collects:
     \[
     3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ d...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Benjamin collects 6 dozen eggs a day.

Carla collects 3 times the number of eggs that Benjamin collects. So, Carla collects 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dozen eggs a day.

Trisha collects 4 dozen less than Benjamin. So, Trisha collects 6 - 4 = <<6-4=2>>2 dozen eggs a day.

To find the total number of dozen eggs the three collect, we add the number of dozen eggs each person collects. So, the total number of dozen eggs collected is 6 (Benjamin) + 18 (Carla) + 2 (Trisha) = <<6+18+2=...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given:
- Benjamin collects 6 dozen eggs a day.
- Carla collects 3 times the number of eggs that Benjamin collects.
- Trisha collects 4 dozen less than Benjamin.

Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Carla collects.
Carla's eggs = 3 × Benjamin's eggs
Carla's eggs = 3 × 6 dozen = 18 dozen

Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs Trisha collects.
Trisha's eggs = Benjamin's eggs - 4 dozen
Trisha's...
