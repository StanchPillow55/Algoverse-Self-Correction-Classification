=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial number of apples**: 
   At the beginning of the day, there are 74 apples in the basket.

2. **Determine how many apples Ricki removes**: 
   Ricki removes 14 apples.

3. **Calculate how many apples Samson removes**: 
   Samson removes twice as many apples as Ricki. Since Ricki removes 14 apples, we calculate the number of apples Samson removes as follows:
   \[
   \text{Samson's apples} = 2 \times \text{Ricki's apples} = 2 \times 14 = 28
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of apples removed**: 
   To find the total number of apples removed from the basket, we add the apples removed by Ricki and Samson:
   \[
   \text{Total apples removed} = \text{Ricki's apples} + \text{Samson's apples} = 14 + 28 = 42
   \]

5. **Determine the number of apples left in the basket**: 
   We subtract the total number of apples removed from the initial number of apples:
   \[
   \text{Apples left} = \text{Initial apples} - \text{Total apples removed} = 74 - 42 = 32
   \]

Thus, the number of apples left in the basket by the end of the day is \( \boxed{32} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- At the beginning of the day, there were 74 apples in the basket.
- Ricki removes 14 apples.
- Samson removes twice as many apples as Ricki.

Step 1: Calculate how many apples Samson removed.
Samson removed twice as many apples as Ricki.
Ricki removed 14 apples.
Samson removed 2 × 14 = 28 apples.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of apples removed from the basket.
Ricki removed 14 apples.
Sam...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many apples are removed from the basket and then subtract that number from the initial total of apples to find out how many are left.

1. **Initial Number of Apples:**
   - We start with 74 apples in the basket.

2. **Apples Removed by Ricki:**
   - Ricki removes 14 apples from the basket.

3. **Apples Removed by Samson:**
   - Samson removes twice as many apples as Ricki. Since Ricki removed 14 apples, Samson removes \(2 \...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's solve this step by step.

Step 1: Determine the number of apples Ricki removed. We know from the problem that Ricki removed 14 apples.

Step 2: Determine the number of apples Samson removed. We know from the problem that Samson removed twice as many apples as Ricki. So, Samson removed 14 * 2 = 28 apples.

Step 3: Determine the total number of apples removed. We add the number of apples Ricki removed to the number of apples Samson removed. So, the total number of app...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * At the beginning of the day, there were 74 apples in the basket.
   * Ricki removes 14 apples from the basket.
   * Samson removes twice as many apples as Ricki.

2. Calculate the number of apples Samson removes:
   * Ricki removes 14 apples
   * Samson removes twice as many as Ricki
   * So, Samson removes: 14 × 2 = 28 apples

3. Calculate the total number of apple...
