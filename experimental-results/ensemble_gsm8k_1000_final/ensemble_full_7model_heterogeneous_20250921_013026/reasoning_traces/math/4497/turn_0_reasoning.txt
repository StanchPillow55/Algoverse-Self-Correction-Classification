=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cans of stew are required to feed 30% fewer people than the original 40 people.

**Step 1: Calculate 30% of 40 people.**

To find 30% of 40, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
30\% \text{ of } 40 = \frac{30}{100} \times 40
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
30\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.3 \times 40 = 12
\]

**Step 2: Determine the new number of people to be fed.**

Now, we subtract the 30% (which is 12 people) from the original 40 people:

\[
\text{New number of people} = 40 - 12 = 28
\]

**Step 3: Determine the number of cans needed for 28 people.**

We know that 600 cans are required to feed 40 people. To find out how many cans are needed per person, we divide the total number of cans by the number of people:

\[
\text{Cans per person} = \frac{600 \text{ cans}}{40 \text{ people}} = 15 \text{ cans per person}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of cans needed for 28 people.**

Now, we multiply the number of cans per person by the new number of people (28):

\[
\text{Cans needed for 28 people} = 15 \text{ cans per person} \times 28 \text{ people} = 420 \text{ cans}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Thus, the number of cans needed to feed 30% fewer people (28 people) is:

\[
\boxed{420}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cans required to feed 30% fewer people.

Given information:
- Paddy's Confidential has 600 cans of stew required to feed 40 people.
- We need to find the number of cans required to feed 30% fewer people.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cans per person.
Number of cans per person = Total number of cans / Number of people
Number of cans per person = 600 cans / 40 people
Number of cans per person = 15 ...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cans of stew are required to feed 30% fewer people than the original 40 people.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Number of People After a 30% Reduction:**

   We start with 40 people. We need to find out what 30% fewer people would be.

   \[
   \text{Number of people reduced} = 40 \times 0.30 = 12
   \]

   Subtract the reduced number from the original number of people:

   \[
   \text{New number of peo...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many cans of stew are required to feed one person. We can do this by dividing the total number of cans by the total number of people. 

600 cans ÷ 40 people = 15 cans per person

Next, we need to calculate how many people 30% fewer than 40 people would be. We can do this by multiplying 40 by 30% (or 0.30) and then subtracting that number from 40. 

40 people × 0.30 = 12 people

40 people - 12 people = 28 people

Finally, we need to determin...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Paddy's Confidential has 600 cans of stew.
   * These 600 cans are required to feed 40 people.
   * We need to find the number of cans needed to feed 30% fewer people.

2. Calculate the number of people that is 30% fewer than 40:
   * 30% of 40 = 0.3 × 40 = 12
   * 40 - 12 = 28
   So, we need to find the number of cans needed to feed 28 people.

3. Set up a propo...
