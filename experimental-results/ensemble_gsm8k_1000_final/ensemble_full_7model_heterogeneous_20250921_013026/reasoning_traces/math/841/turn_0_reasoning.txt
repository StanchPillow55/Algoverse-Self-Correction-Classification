=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of dogs and cats Heloise has based on the given ratio of 10:17. 

Let:
- \( d \) = number of dogs
- \( c \) = number of cats

According to the problem, the ratio of dogs to cats is given as:

\[
\frac{d}{c} = \frac{10}{17}
\]

This can be expressed in terms of a common variable \( x \):

\[
d = 10x \quad \text{and} \quad c = 17x
\]

Next, we know that the total number of pets (dogs + cats) is 189:

\[
d + c = 189
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( d \) and \( c \) in terms of \( x \):

\[
10x + 17x = 189
\]

Combining the terms gives:

\[
27x = 189
\]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{189}{27} = 7
\]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of dogs and cats:

\[
d = 10x = 10 \times 7 = 70
\]
\[
c = 17x = 17 \times 7 = 119
\]

So, Heloise has 70 dogs and 119 cats.

Next, we need to determine how many dogs she has after giving 10 dogs to her friend Janet. 

Calculating the remaining number of dogs:

\[
\text{Remaining dogs} = d - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Heloise remains with } 60 \text{ dogs.}
\]

Final answer: **60 dogs**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The ratio of dogs to cats is 10:17.
- The total number of pets is 189.
- Heloise gives 10 dogs to her friend Janet.

Step 1: Find the number of dogs and cats Heloise has initially.
Total pets = 189
Ratio of dogs to cats = 10:17
Let's represent the number of dogs as 10x and the number of cats as 17x, where x is a common factor.

Total pets = 10x + 17x = 27x
27x = 189
x = 7

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many dogs Heloise originally has and then calculate how many she has after giving some away.

### Step 1: Understand the Ratio
Heloise has dogs and cats in the ratio of 10:17. This means for every 10 dogs, there are 17 cats.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
Let the number of dogs be \( 10x \) and the number of cats be \( 17x \). The total number of pets is given as 189.

The equation representing the total number of pets is...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem tells us that Heloise has dogs and cats in the ratio of 10:17 and the total number of pets is 189. 

The first step is to find out the total parts of the ratio. We add the two parts of the ratio together, 10 + 17 = 27 parts.

The next step is to find out what each part of the ratio represents. We do this by dividing the total number of pets by the total parts of the ratio. So, 189 รท 27 = 7. This means that each part of the ratio represents 7 pets.

Since the r...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Heloise has dogs and cats in the ratio of 10:17.
   * The total number of pets is 189.
   * Heloise gives 10 dogs to her friend Janet.

2. Find the total number of parts in the ratio:
   * Parts of dogs = 10
   * Parts of cats = 17
   * Total parts = 10 + 17 = 27

3. Calculate the number of pets per part:
   * Total pets = 189
   * Total parts = 27
   * Pets per ...
