=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first determine the current ages of Rachel's grandfather, mother, and father based on Rachel's current age of 12 years.

1. **Calculate Grandfather's Age:**
   - Rachel's age = 12 years
   - Grandfather's age = 7 times Rachel's age
   \[
   \text{Grandfather's age} = 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Calculate Mother's Age:**
   - Mother's age = half of grandfather's age
   \[
   \text{Mother's age} = \frac{84}{2} = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Calculate Father's Age:**
   - Father's age = mother's age + 5 years
   \[
   \text{Father's age} = 42 + 5 = 47 \text{ years}
   \]

Now we have the current ages:
- Rachel: 12 years
- Grandfather: 84 years
- Mother: 42 years
- Father: 47 years

Next, we need to determine how old Rachel's father will be when Rachel is 25 years old.

4. **Calculate the Age Difference:**
   - The difference in age between Rachel and her father is:
   \[
   \text{Age difference} = 47 - 12 = 35 \text{ years}
   \]

5. **Calculate Father's Age When Rachel is 25:**
   - When Rachel is 25, the father will be:
   \[
   \text{Father's age when Rachel is 25} = 25 + 35 = 60 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, Rachel's father will be 60 years old when Rachel is 25 years old.

**Final Answer:**
Rachel's father will be 60 years old when she is 25 years old.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the ages of Rachel's grandfather, mother, and father, and then calculate the age of her father when she is 25 years old.

Given information:
- Rachel is 12 years old.
- Rachel's grandfather is 7 times her age.
- Rachel's mother is half of her grandfather's age.
- Rachel's father is 5 years older than her mother.

Step 1: Find the age of Rachel's grandfather.
Rachel's grandfather's age = 7 × Rachel's age
Rachel's ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Rachel's grandfather, mother, and father, and then calculate how old Rachel's father will be when Rachel is 25 years old.

**Step 1: Determine Rachel's grandfather's age.**

Rachel is currently 12 years old. According to the problem, her grandfather is 7 times her age.

\[
\text{Grandfather's age} = 7 \times \text{Rachel's age} = 7 \times 12 = 84
\]

Rachel's grandfather is currently 84 years old.

**Step 2:...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out the ages of each person.

Rachel is 12 years old. Her grandfather is 7 times her age, so her grandfather is 7 * 12 = 84 years old.

Rachel's mother is half her grandfather's age, so her mother is 84 / 2 = 42 years old.

Rachel's father is 5 years older than her mother, so her father is 42 + 5 = 47 years old.

Now, we need to figure out how old Rachel's father will be when she is 25. 

Rachel will be 25 in 25 - 12 = 13 years.

So, Rachel's fathe...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- Rachel is 12 years old.
- Her grandfather is 7 times her age.
- Her mother is half her grandfather's age.
- Her father is 5 years older than her mother.

Step 1: Calculate Rachel's grandfather's age.
Grandfather's age = 7 × Rachel's age
Grandfather's age = 7 × 12 = 84 years old

Step 2: Calculate Rachel's mother's age.
Mother's age = 1/2 × Grandfather's age
Mother's age = 1/2 × 84 = 42 years old
