=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of pups born to James's dogs and then compare that to the total number of adult dogs. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of adult dogs
James has:
- 5 huskies
- 2 pitbulls
- 4 golden retrievers

Now, we calculate the total number of adult dogs:

\[
\text{Total adult dogs} = \text{Number of huskies} + \text{Number of pitbulls} + \text{Number of golden retrievers}
\]
\[
\text{Total adult dogs} = 5 + 2 + 4 = 11
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of pups from each breed
1. **Huskies and Pitbulls**:
   - Each husky has 3 pups.
   - Each pitbull also has 3 pups.

   Now, we calculate the total number of pups from huskies:
   \[
   \text{Pups from huskies} = \text{Number of huskies} \times \text{Pups per husky} = 5 \times 3 = 15
   \]

   Next, we calculate the total number of pups from pitbulls:
   \[
   \text{Pups from pitbulls} = \text{Number of pitbulls} \times \text{Pups per pitbull} = 2 \times 3 = 6
   \]

   Now, we add the pups from both breeds:
   \[
   \text{Total pups from huskies and pitbulls} = 15 + 6 = 21
   \]

2. **Golden Retrievers**:
   - Each golden retriever has 2 more pups than each husky. Since each husky has 3 pups, each golden retriever has:
   \[
   \text{Pups per golden retriever} = 3 + 2 = 5
   \]

   Now, we calculate the total number of pups from golden retrievers:
   \[
   \text{Pups from golden retrievers} = \text{Number of golden retrievers} \times \text{Pups per golden retriever} = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of pups
Now, we can find the total number of pups from all breeds:
\[
\text{Total pups} = \text{Total pups from huskies and pitbulls} + \text{Total pups from golden retrievers}
\]
\[
\text{Total pups} = 21 + 20 = 41
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the difference between pups and adult dogs
Finally, we need to find out how many more pups there are than adult dogs:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total pups} - \text{Total adult dogs}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 41 - 11 = 30
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of pups is 30 more than the number of adult dogs. 

\[
\boxed{30}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- James has 5 huskies, 2 pitbulls, and 4 golden retrievers, all female.
- Each golden retriever had 2 more pups than each husky.
- The huskies and pitbulls had 3 pups each.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of adult dogs.
Number of adult huskies = 5
Number of adult pitbulls = 2
Number of adult golden retrievers = 4
Total number of adult dogs = 5 + 2 + 4 = 11

Step 2: Calculate the number ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pups and compare it to the total number of adult dogs.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of adult dogs.

James has:
- 5 huskies
- 2 pitbulls
- 4 golden retrievers

Total number of adult dogs = 5 (huskies) + 2 (pitbulls) + 4 (golden retrievers) = 11 adult dogs.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of pups each type of dog has.

- **Huskies:** Each husky has 3 pups. Since there are 5 huskies, the total numb...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total number of adult dogs. James has 5 huskies, 2 pitbulls, and 4 golden retrievers, so the total number of adult dogs is 5 + 2 + 4 = 11.

Next, let's calculate the total number of pups. Each husky and pitbull had 3 pups, so the huskies had 5 * 3 = 15 pups and the pitbulls had 2 * 3 = 6 pups. 

Each golden retriever had two more pups than each husky, so each golden retriever had 3 + 2 = 5 pups. Therefore, the golden retrievers had 4 * 5 = 20 pu...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * James has 5 huskies, 2 pitbulls, and 4 golden retrievers.
   * Each husky and pitbull had 3 pups.
   * Each golden retriever had 2 more pups than each husky.

2. Calculate the total number of adult dogs:
   * Total adult dogs = Huskies + Pitbulls + Golden Retrievers
   * Total adult dogs = 5 + 2 + 4
