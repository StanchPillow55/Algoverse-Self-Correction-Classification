Final Answer: To determine how many pills Jeremy will take over the course of 2 weeks, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total dosage per day**: 
   Jeremy takes 1000 mg every 6 hours. In one day, there are 24 hours. To find out how many doses he takes in a day, we divide 24 hours by 6 hours per dose:

   \[
   \text{Number of doses per day} = \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{6 \text{ hours/dose}} = 4 \text{ doses/day}
   \]

   Now, we can calculate the total amount of Tylenol he takes in a day:

   \[
   \text{Total dosage per day} = 1000 \text{ mg/dose} \times 4 \text{ doses/day} = 4000 \text{ mg/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total dosage over 2 weeks**: 
   There are 14 days in 2 weeks. We can find the total dosage over this period by multiplying the daily dosage by the number of days:

   \[
   \text{Total dosage over 2 weeks} = 4000 \text{ mg/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56000 \text{ mg}
   \]

3. **Determine how many pills are needed**: 
   Each pill contains 500 mg of Tylenol. To find out how many pills Jeremy needs to take to reach the total dosage of 56000 mg, we divide the total dosage by the amount in each pill:

   \[
   \text{Number of pills} = \frac{56000 \text{ mg}}{500 \text{ mg/pill}} = 112 \text{ pills}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Jeremy will take **112 pills** over the course of 2 weeks.

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To determine how many pills Jeremy will take over the course of 2 weeks, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total dosage per day**: 
   Jeremy takes 1000 mg every 6 hours. In one day, there are 24 hours. To find out how many doses he takes in a day, we divide 24 hours by 6 hours per dose:

   \[
   \text{Number of doses per day} = \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{6 \text{ hours/dose}} = 4 \text{ doses/day}
   \]

   Now, we can calculate the tota...

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of Tylenol pills Jeremy will take over the 2-week period.

Given information:
- Jeremy takes 1000 mg of Tylenol every 6 hours.
- Each Tylenol pill is 500 mg.
- The duration is 2 weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of times Jeremy takes Tylenol per day.
Number of hours in a day / Interval between doses = Number of doses per day
24 hours / 6 hours = 4 doses per day

Step 2: Calculate the total num...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many 500 mg pills Jeremy takes over the course of 2 weeks, given that he takes 1000 mg every 6 hours.

**Step 1: Determine the total daily dosage in mg.**

Jeremy takes 1000 mg every 6 hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so we need to find out how many 6-hour periods are in one day:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ hours}}{6 \text{ hours/period}} = 4 \text{ periods/day}
\]

Since Jeremy takes 1000 mg every 6 hours, the total daily dosag...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many doses Jeremy will take in a day. Since there are 24 hours in a day and he takes a dose every 6 hours, he will take 24/6 = 4 doses in a day.

Next, we need to determine how many doses he will take in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week and he takes 4 doses a day, he will take 7*4 = 28 doses in a week.

Since he is taking these doses for 2 weeks, he will take 28*2 = 56 doses in 2 weeks.

Each dose is 1000 mg and each pill is 500 mg,...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jeremy takes 1000 mg of Tylenol every 6 hours.
   * He will continue this for 2 weeks.
   * Each pill contains 500 mg of Tylenol.

2. Calculate the number of doses Jeremy takes per day:
   * There are 24 hours in a day.
   * He takes a dose every 6 hours.
   * Number of doses per day = 24 hours รท 6 hours per dose
   * Number of doses per day = 4 doses

3. Calculate the...
