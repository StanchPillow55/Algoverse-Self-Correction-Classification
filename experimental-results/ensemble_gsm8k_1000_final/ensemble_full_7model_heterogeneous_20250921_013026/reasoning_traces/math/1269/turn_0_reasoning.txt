=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total revenue for the Kwik-e-Tax Center for one day, we need to calculate the revenue generated from each type of tax return they sold and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the revenue from federal returns:**
   - The charge for a federal return is $50.
   - They sold 60 federal returns.
   - Revenue from federal returns = Number of federal returns sold × Price per federal return
   \[
   \text{Revenue from federal returns} = 60 \times 50 = 3000
   \]

2. **Calculate the revenue from state returns:**
   - The charge for a state return is $30.
   - They sold 20 state returns.
   - Revenue from state returns = Number of state returns sold × Price per state return
   \[
   \text{Revenue from state returns} = 20 \times 30 = 600
   \]

3. **Calculate the revenue from quarterly business taxes:**
   - The charge for quarterly business taxes is $80.
   - They sold 10 quarterly returns.
   - Revenue from quarterly business taxes = Number of quarterly returns sold × Price per quarterly return
   \[
   \text{Revenue from quarterly business taxes} = 10 \times 80 = 800
   \]

4. **Calculate the total revenue for the day:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from federal returns + Revenue from state returns + Revenue from quarterly business taxes
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 3000 + 600 + 800
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 4400
   \]

Thus, the total revenue for the Kwik-e-Tax Center for that day is **$4,400**. 

Final answer: **$4,400**.
