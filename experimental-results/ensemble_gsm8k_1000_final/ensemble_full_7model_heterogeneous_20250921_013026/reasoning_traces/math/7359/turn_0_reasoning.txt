=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of one pair of jeans that Mary bought for her son James. 

Let's break down the information given:

1. Mary bought:
   - A coat for James: $40
   - Two pairs of jeans for James: Let the cost of one pair of jeans be \( x \). Therefore, the cost for two pairs of jeans is \( 2x \).
   - A pair of shoes for Jamie: $30

2. The total cost of all items is $110.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total cost:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Coat} + \text{Cost of Jeans} + \text{Cost of Shoes}
\]

Substituting the known values into the equation:

\[
110 = 40 + 2x + 30
\]

Now, we can simplify the right side:

\[
110 = 70 + 2x
\]

Next, we will isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 70 from both sides:

\[
110 - 70 = 2x
\]
\[
40 = 2x
\]

Now, we will solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[
x = \frac{40}{2}
\]
\[
x = 20
\]

Thus, the cost of one pair of jeans is \( \boxed{20} \). 

To verify, we can check the total cost:
- Cost of coat: $40
- Cost of two pairs of jeans: \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \)
- Cost of shoes: $30

Adding these together:

\[
40 + 40 + 30 = 110
\]

The total matches the given total of $110, confirming our solution is correct. Therefore, the final answer is that one pair of jeans costs \( \boxed{20} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mary bought a coat for her son James for $40.
- Mary bought two pairs of jeans for James.
- Mary bought a pair of shoes for her daughter Jamie for $30.
- The total cost of all the items was $110.

We need to find the cost of one pair of jeans for James.

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the total cost.
Total cost = Cost of coat + Cost of two pairs of jeans + Cost of shoes

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of one pair of jeans. Let's break down the information given and set up an equation to find the solution.

1. **Identify the known costs:**
   - The cost of the coat for James is $40.
   - The cost of the shoes for Jamie is $30.

2. **Identify the unknown cost:**
   - The cost of one pair of jeans, which we'll denote as \( x \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - Mary bought two pairs of jeans for James, so the total co...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's add up the cost of the items we know: the coat for James and the pair of shoes for Jamie. 

$40 (coat for James) + $30 (shoes for Jamie) = $70

We know that the total cost of all the items was $110. So, to find out how much the two pairs of jeans cost, we subtract the cost of the known items from the total cost:

$110 (total cost) - $70 (cost of known items) = $40

So, the two pairs of jeans cost $40 in total. 

Since the two pairs of jeans cost the same pric...
