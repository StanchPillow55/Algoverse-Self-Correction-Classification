=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much Paula and Olive spend in total, we will calculate the cost of the items each of them buys and then sum those amounts.

**Step 1: Calculate Paula's total spending.**

Paula buys:
- 2 bracelets
- 1 keychain

The cost of each item is as follows:
- Bracelets: $4 each
- Keychains: $5 each

Now, we calculate the total cost for Paula:

1. Cost of 2 bracelets:
   \[
   \text{Cost of bracelets} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Cost of 1 keychain:
   \[
   \text{Cost of keychain} = 1 \times 5 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Total cost for Paula:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Paula} = \text{Cost of bracelets} + \text{Cost of keychain} = 8 + 5 = 13 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Step 2: Calculate Olive's total spending.**

Olive buys:
- 1 coloring book
- 1 bracelet

The cost of each item is as follows:
- Coloring books: $3 each
- Bracelets: $4 each

Now, we calculate the total cost for Olive:

1. Cost of 1 coloring book:
   \[
   \text{Cost of coloring book} = 1 \times 3 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Cost of 1 bracelet:
   \[
   \text{Cost of bracelet} = 1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Total cost for Olive:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Olive} = \text{Cost of coloring book} + \text{Cost of bracelet} = 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total spending for both Paula and Olive.**

Now, we add the total costs for Paula and Olive:
\[
\text{Total spending} = \text{Total cost for Paula} + \text{Total cost for Olive} = 13 + 7 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**
Paula and Olive spend a total of **$20**.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we first need to calculate how much each person spends and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate how much Paula spends. She buys two bracelets and a keychain. The bracelets cost $4 each, so two bracelets cost 2 * $4 = $<<2*4=8>>8. The keychain costs $5. So, in total, Paula spends $8 + $5 = $<<8+5=13>>13.

Next, let's calculate how much Olive spends. She buys a coloring book and a bracelet. The coloring book costs $3 and the bracel...
