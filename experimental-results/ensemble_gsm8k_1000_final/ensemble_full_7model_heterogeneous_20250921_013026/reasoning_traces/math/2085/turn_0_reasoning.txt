=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much the NES was on sale for, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the trade-in value of the Super Nintendo (SNES)**:
   - The SNES is worth $150.
   - The store gives Tom 80% of that value.
   \[
   \text{Trade-in value} = 150 \times 0.80 = 120
   \]
   So, Tom receives $120 for trading in his SNES.

2. **Calculate the total amount Tom spends on the NES**:
   - Tom gives $80 in cash.
   - He receives $10 in change.
   - Therefore, the effective amount he spends in cash is:
   \[
   \text{Cash spent} = 80 - 10 = 70
   \]

3. **Determine the total value Tom has after the trade-in**:
   - The total value Tom has after trading in the SNES and spending cash is:
   \[
   \text{Total value} = \text{Trade-in value} + \text{Cash spent} = 120 + 70 = 190
   \]

4. **Account for the game Tom receives**:
   - Tom receives a game worth $30. This means the NES price must account for this game.
   - Therefore, the total amount Tom effectively spends on the NES (including the game) is:
   \[
   \text{Total spent on NES} = \text{Cash spent} + \text{Value of game} = 70 + 30 = 100
   \]

5. **Calculate the sale price of the NES**:
   - The NES was sold for the total amount Tom effectively spent, which is $100.

Thus, the NES was on sale for **$100**.

Final answer: The NES was on sale for **$100**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Tom trades in his Super Nintendo (SNES) for an original NES.
- The SNES is worth $150.
- The store gives him 80% of the SNES value.
- Tom gives $80 and gets back $10 change and a game worth $30.

Step 1: Calculate the amount Tom received for the SNES.
SNES value = $150
Store gives 80% of the SNES value
Amount received for SNES = $150 × 0.80 = $120

Step 2: Calculate the total amou...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the sale price of the NES based on the transactions described. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Value of the Super Nintendo (SNES):**
   - The SNES is worth $150.

2. **Trade-in Value:**
   - The store gives Tom 80% of the SNES's value.
   - Calculate 80% of $150:
     \[
     0.80 \times 150 = 120
     \]
   - So, Tom receives $120 in trade-in value for the SNES.

3. **Additional Cash Transaction:**
   - Tom gi...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how much the store gave Tom for his Super Nintendo (SNES). The store gave him 80% of the SNES's value, which was $150. 

80% of $150 is calculated as follows:

0.80 * $150 = $120

So, the store gave Tom $120 for his SNES.

Next, we need to figure out how much Tom paid in total for the NES. He gave the store $80 and got back $10 in change. 

$80 - $10 = $70

So, Tom paid $70 out of his pocket for the NES.

But, we also know that he got a game wo...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Tom trades in his SNES, which is worth $150.
   * The store gives him 80% of the SNES value.
   * Tom gives the store $80 in cash.
   * He gets back $10 in change and a game worth $30.

2. Calculate the trade-in value of the SNES:
   * Trade-in value = 80% of $150
   * Trade-in value = 0.8 × $150 = $120

3. Calculate the total value Tom receives from the store:
   *...
