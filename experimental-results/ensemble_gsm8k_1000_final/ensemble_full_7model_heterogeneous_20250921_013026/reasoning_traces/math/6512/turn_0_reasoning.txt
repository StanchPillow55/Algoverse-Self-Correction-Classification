=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many cookies Clara sells in total, we need to calculate the number of cookies for each type of box she sells and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies from the first type:**
   - The first type has 12 cookies per box.
   - Clara sells 50 boxes of the first type.
   - Total cookies from the first type = Number of boxes × Cookies per box
   \[
   \text{Total cookies from first type} = 50 \text{ boxes} \times 12 \text{ cookies/box} = 600 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of cookies from the second type:**
   - The second type has 20 cookies per box.
   - Clara sells 80 boxes of the second type.
   - Total cookies from the second type = Number of boxes × Cookies per box
   \[
   \text{Total cookies from second type} = 80 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ cookies/box} = 1600 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cookies from the third type:**
   - The third type has 16 cookies per box.
   - Clara sells 70 boxes of the third type.
   - Total cookies from the third type = Number of boxes × Cookies per box
   \[
   \text{Total cookies from third type} = 70 \text{ boxes} \times 16 \text{ cookies/box} = 1120 \text{ cookies}
   \]

4. **Sum the total cookies from all types:**
   - Now we add the total cookies from each type to find the overall total.
   \[
   \text{Total cookies sold} = \text{Total cookies from first type} + \text{Total cookies from second type} + \text{Total cookies from third type}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cookies sold} = 600 + 1600 + 1120
   \]

5. **Perform the final addition:**
   \[
   600 + 1600 = 2200
   \]
   \[
   2200 + 1120 = 3320
   \]

Thus, the total number of cookies Clara sells is **3320**.

Final answer: Clara sells **3320 cookies**.
