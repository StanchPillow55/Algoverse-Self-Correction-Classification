=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much John spends on memory cards, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pictures John has taken over the past 3 years.**
   - John takes 10 pictures every day.
   - There are 365 days in a year, so in 3 years, the total number of days is:
     \[
     3 \text{ years} \times 365 \text{ days/year} = 1095 \text{ days}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of pictures taken is:
     \[
     10 \text{ pictures/day} \times 1095 \text{ days} = 10950 \text{ pictures}
     \]

2. **Determine how many memory cards are needed to store all the pictures.**
   - Each memory card can store 50 images. To find out how many memory cards are needed, we divide the total number of pictures by the capacity of one memory card:
     \[
     \frac{10950 \text{ pictures}}{50 \text{ pictures/card}} = 219 \text{ cards}
     \]
   - Since we cannot have a fraction of a memory card, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, 219 is already a whole number, so John needs 219 memory cards.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the memory cards.**
   - Each memory card costs $60. Therefore, the total cost for 219 memory cards is:
     \[
     219 \text{ cards} \times 60 \text{ dollars/card} = 13140 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - John spends a total of **$13,140** on memory cards.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{13140}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pictures John has taken, the number of memory cards he needs to store those pictures, and the total cost of the memory cards.

Given information:
- John takes 10 pictures every day.
- John has been taking pictures for the past 3 years.
- Each memory card can store 50 images.
- Each memory card costs $60.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pictures John has taken.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many memory cards John needs to store all the pictures he has taken over the past 3 years, and then calculate the total cost based on the price of each memory card.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Days in 3 Years:**

   - A year typically has 365 days. However, we need to consider leap years. 
   - In a 3-year period, there is usually 1 leap year. For example, if we consider the years 2020, 2...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many pictures John has taken over the past 3 years.

We know that he takes 10 pictures every day, and there are 365 days in a year. Therefore, in one year, he takes 10 * 365 = 3,650 pictures.

Since he has been doing this for 3 years, the total number of pictures he has taken is 3,650 * 3 = 10,950 pictures.

Next, we need to find out how many memory cards he needs to store all these pictures.

We know that each memory card can store 50 image...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Calculate the total number of days in 3 years:
   * 1 year = 365 days (assuming non-leap years)
   * 3 years = 365 days × 3 = 1,095 days

2. Calculate the total number of pictures taken in 3 years:
   * John takes 10 pictures every day
   * Total pictures = 10 pictures per day × 1,095 days = 10,950 pictures

3. Determine the number of memory cards needed:
   * Each memory card can store 50 images
   * Numbe...
