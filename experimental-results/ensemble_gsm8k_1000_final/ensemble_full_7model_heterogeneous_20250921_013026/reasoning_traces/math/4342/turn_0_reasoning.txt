=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of stickers on all pages before losing one page.**
2. **Calculate the number of stickers on the lost page.**
3. **Subtract the stickers on the lost page from the total stickers.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of stickers on all pages

We know that there are 20 stickers on each page and there are 12 pages in total. To find the total number of stickers, we multiply the number of stickers per page by the number of pages:

\[
\text{Total stickers} = \text{Number of stickers per page} \times \text{Number of pages}
\]
\[
\text{Total stickers} = 20 \times 12
\]
\[
\text{Total stickers} = 240
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of stickers on the lost page

Since we have 12 pages and each page contains 20 stickers, the number of stickers on one page (the lost page) is simply:

\[
\text{Stickers on the lost page} = 20
\]

### Step 3: Subtract the stickers on the lost page from the total stickers

Now, we need to subtract the number of stickers on the lost page from the total number of stickers:

\[
\text{Stickers remaining} = \text{Total stickers} - \text{Stickers on the lost page}
\]
\[
\text{Stickers remaining} = 240 - 20
\]
\[
\text{Stickers remaining} = 220
\]

### Final Answer

After losing one page of stickers, the total number of stickers remaining is:

\[
\boxed{220}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 20 stickers on a page.
- You have 12 pages of stickers.
- You lose one of the pages.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of stickers before losing a page.
Total number of stickers = Number of stickers per page × Number of pages
Total number of stickers = 20 × 12 = 240 stickers

Step 2: Calculate the number of stickers lost when one page is lost.
Number of stickers lost = Numbe...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many stickers you have after losing one page of stickers.

1. **Determine the total number of pages initially:**
   - You start with 12 pages of stickers.

2. **Calculate the total number of stickers initially:**
   - Each page contains 20 stickers.
   - Therefore, the total number of stickers initially is calculated by multiplying the number of pages by the number of stickers per page:
     \[
     \text{Total stickers ini...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how many stickers there are in total when you have all 12 pages. 

Since there are 20 stickers on each page, and you have 12 pages, you would multiply the number of stickers per page by the number of pages to find the total number of stickers. 

So, 20 stickers/page * 12 pages = 240 stickers.

Now, if you lose one page of stickers, you would subtract the number of stickers on one page from the total number of stickers.

So, 240 stickers - 20 sticker...
