=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate how many burritos were consumed during the picnic and then determine how many burritos are left over from the original order of 600 burritos.

1. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students:**
   - There are 50 students at the picnic.
   - Each student is given 10 burritos.
   - Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by the students can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total burritos consumed by students} = \text{Number of students} \times \text{Burritos per student}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total burritos consumed by students} = 50 \times 10 = 500
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by Mr. George:**
   - Mr. George eats 20 burritos.
   - Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by Mr. George is simply:

   \[
   \text{Total burritos consumed by Mr. George} = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed at the picnic:**
   - Now, we add the burritos consumed by the students and Mr. George:

   \[
   \text{Total burritos consumed} = \text{Total burritos consumed by students} + \text{Total burritos consumed by Mr. George}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total burritos consumed} = 500 + 20 = 520
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of leftover burritos:**
   - We started with 600 burritos and consumed 520. To find the leftover burritos, we subtract the total consumed from the total ordered:

   \[
   \text{Total leftover burritos} = \text{Total burritos ordered} - \text{Total burritos consumed}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total leftover burritos} = 600 - 520 = 80
   \]

Thus, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:

\[
\boxed{80}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total number of burritos eaten by the students. Since each student was given ten burritos, and there were 50 students, the total number of burritos eaten by the students is 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos.

Next, we add the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George, which is 20 burritos. So, the total number of burritos eaten at the picnic is 500 burritos + 20 burritos = 520 burritos.

Finally, we subtract the total number of ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- George ordered 600 burritos for the picnic.
- There were 50 students at the picnic.
- Each student was given 10 burritos.
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of burritos given to the students.
Number of students × Burritos per student = Total burritos given to students
50 × 10 = 500
So, the students were given a total of 500 burritos.

Step 2: Calculate the to...
