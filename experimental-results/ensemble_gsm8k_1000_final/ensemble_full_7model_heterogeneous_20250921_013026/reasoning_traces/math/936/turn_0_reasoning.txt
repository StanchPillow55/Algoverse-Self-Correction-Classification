=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many crayons Lizzie has based on the information given about Bobbie and Billie.

1. **Identify the number of crayons Billie has**: 
   We know from the problem that Billie has 18 crayons.

2. **Calculate the number of crayons Bobbie has**: 
   The problem states that Bobbie has three times as many crayons as Billie. Therefore, we can calculate Bobbie's crayons as follows:
   \[
   \text{Bobbie's crayons} = 3 \times \text{Billie's crayons} = 3 \times 18 = 54
   \]
   So, Bobbie has 54 crayons.

3. **Calculate the number of crayons Lizzie has**: 
   The problem states that Lizzie has half as many crayons as Bobbie. Therefore, we can calculate Lizzie's crayons as follows:
   \[
   \text{Lizzie's crayons} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Bobbie's crayons} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27
   \]
   So, Lizzie has 27 crayons.

4. **Final answer**: 
   After performing all the calculations, we find that Lizzie has 27 crayons.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{27}
\]
