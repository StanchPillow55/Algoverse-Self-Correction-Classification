=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Travis will be able to take home after selling his apples, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of boxes Travis can fill with his apples.**
   - Travis has a total of 10,000 apples.
   - Each box can hold 50 apples.
   - To find out how many boxes he can fill, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per box:

   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Total apples}}{\text{Apples per box}} = \frac{10000}{50}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = 200
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the boxes.**
   - Travis sells each box for $35.
   - To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of boxes by the price per box:

   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Price per box} = 200 \times 35
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 7000
   \]

3. **Determine how much Travis will take home.**
   - Assuming there are no costs or expenses involved in selling the apples (like transportation, storage, etc.), the total revenue of $7000 will be the amount Travis takes home.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Travis will take home} = 7000
\]

**Final Answer: $7000**

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of boxes Travis can sell and then calculate the total revenue he will receive.

Given information:
- Travis has 10,000 apples.
- 50 apples can fit in each box.
- Each box of apples is sold for $35.

Step 1: Calculate the number of boxes Travis can sell.
Number of apples per box = 50
Total number of apples = 10,000
Number of boxes = Total number of apples / Number of apples per box
Number of boxes...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many boxes of apples Travis can sell and then calculate the total revenue from selling these boxes.

### Step 1: Determine the number of boxes

Travis has 10,000 apples, and each box can hold 50 apples. To find out how many boxes Travis can fill, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per box:

\[
\text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Number of apples per box}} = \frac{100...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many boxes Travis can fill with his 10,000 apples. Since each box can hold 50 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per box.

10,000 apples รท 50 apples/box = 200 boxes

Next, we need to calculate how much money Travis will make from selling all these boxes. Since each box sells for $35, we multiply the number of boxes by the price per box.

200 boxes ร $35/box = $7,000

Therefore, Travis will be able to take h...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Travis has 10000 apples in total.
   * Each box can hold 50 apples.
   * The selling price for each box is $35.

2. Calculate the number of boxes Travis can fill with the apples:
   * Number of boxes = Total number of apples รท Apples per box
   * Number of boxes = 10000 รท 50
   * Number of boxes = 200
   
   So, Travis can fill 200 boxes with the apples he has.
