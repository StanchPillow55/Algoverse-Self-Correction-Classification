=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the height of Marissa's sunflower, we need to first convert her sister's height from feet and inches into just inches, then add the additional height of the sunflower.

1. **Convert the sister's height to inches:**
   - Her sister is 4 feet 3 inches tall.
   - We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.
   - Therefore, we convert 4 feet to inches:
     \[
     4 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Now, we add the 3 inches:
     \[
     \text{Total height in inches} = 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Calculate the height of Marissa's sunflower:**
   - Marissa's sunflower is 21 inches taller than her sister.
   - We add 21 inches to her sister's height:
     \[
     \text{Height of sunflower} = 51 \text{ inches} + 21 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Convert the height of the sunflower back to feet:**
   - To convert inches back to feet, we divide by 12:
     \[
     \text{Height in feet} = \frac{72 \text{ inches}}{12} = 6 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, the height of Marissa's sunflower is \( \boxed{6} \) feet.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to convert the height of Marissa's sister from feet to inches because the height difference is given in inches. 

There are 12 inches in a foot, so her sister's height in inches is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot + 3 inches = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

Marissa's sunflower is 21 inches taller than her sister, so the sunflower is 51 inches + 21 inches = 72 inches tall.

To convert this back to feet, we divide by the number of inches in a foot: 72 inches รท 12 ...
