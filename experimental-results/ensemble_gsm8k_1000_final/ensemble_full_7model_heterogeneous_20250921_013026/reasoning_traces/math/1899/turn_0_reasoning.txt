Final Answer: Let \( c \) represent the number of cherry candies. According to the problem:

1. The number of grape candies is three times the number of cherry candies:
   \[
   g = 3c
   \]
   
2. The number of apple candies is two times the number of grape candies:
   \[
   a = 2g
   \]

Now, substituting the expression for \( g \) into the expression for \( a \):
\[
a = 2(3c) = 6c
\]

Now we have expressions for all types of candies in terms of \( c \):
- Cherry candies: \( c \)
- Grape candies: \( g = 3c \)
- Apple candies: \( a = 6c \)

Next, we can find the total number of candies:
\[
\text{Total candies} = c + g + a = c + 3c + 6c = 10c
\]

Each candy costs $2.50, and the total cost of all candies is $200. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total number of candies} \times \text{Cost per candy}
\]
\[
200 = (10c) \times 2.50
\]

Now, we can solve for \( c \):
\[
200 = 25c
\]
\[
c = \frac{200}{25} = 8
\]

Now that we have \( c \), we can find the number of grape candies:
\[
g = 3c = 3 \times 8 = 24
\]

Thus, the store has \( \boxed{24} \) grape candies. 

To verify, we can check the total number of candies and their total cost:
- Cherry candies: \( c = 8 \)
- Grape candies: \( g = 24 \)
- Apple candies: \( a = 6c = 6 \times 8 = 48 \)

Total candies:
\[
8 + 24 + 48 = 80
\]

Total cost:
\[
80 \times 2.50 = 200
\]

The calculations confirm that the total cost is indeed $200, verifying our solution. Therefore, the final answer is \( \boxed{24} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 3 times as many grape candies as cherry candies.
- There are 2 times as many apple candies as grape candies.
- All the candies cost $2.50 each.
- The total cost of the candies is $200.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of cherry candies
- Then 3x = the number of grape candies
- And 2(3x) = 6x = the number of apple candies

Now, we can set up an equation to solve ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of grape candies in the store. Let's define some variables and work through the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( C \) be the number of cherry candies.
   - Since there are 3 times as many grape candies as cherry candies, let \( G = 3C \) be the number of grape candies.
   - Since there are 2 times as many apple candies as grape candies, let \( A = 2G \) be the number of apple candies.

2. *...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of cherry candies as C, the number of grape candies as G, and the number of apple candies as A.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

G = 3C (since there are 3 times as many grape candies as cherry candies)

A = 2G (since there are 2 times as many apple candies as grape candies)

The total cost of the candies is $200, and each candy costs $2.50. Therefore, the total number of candies is $200 / $2.50 = 80 candies.

So, we ...
