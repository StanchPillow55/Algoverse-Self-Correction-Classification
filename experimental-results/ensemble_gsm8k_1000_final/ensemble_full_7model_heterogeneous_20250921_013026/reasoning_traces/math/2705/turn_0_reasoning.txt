=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find Maximoff's total monthly bill after the increase, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original monthly bill**: 
   Maximoff's original monthly bill is given as $60.

2. **Calculate the increase in the bill**: 
   The problem states that his bill increased by thirty percent (30%). To find the amount of the increase, we can calculate 30% of the original bill.

   \[
   \text{Increase} = \text{Original Bill} \times \text{Percentage Increase}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 60 \times 0.30
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Increase} = 60 \times 0.30 = 18
   \]

   So, the increase in the bill is $18.

3. **Calculate the new total monthly bill**: 
   To find the new total monthly bill after the increase, we add the increase to the original bill.

   \[
   \text{Total Monthly Bill} = \text{Original Bill} + \text{Increase}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Monthly Bill} = 60 + 18
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition:

   \[
   \text{Total Monthly Bill} = 60 + 18 = 78
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Maximoff's total monthly bill while working from home is $78.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{78}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Maximoff's monthly bill before he started working from home was $60. 

To find out how much his bill increased by, we need to calculate thirty percent of $60. 

To calculate this, we multiply $60 by 30/100 (since percent means per hundred):

$60 * 30/100 = $18

So, his monthly bill increased by $18 when he started working from home.

To find out his total monthly bill now, we add this increase to his original bill:

$60 (original bill) + $18 (increase) = $78

So, Maximoff...
