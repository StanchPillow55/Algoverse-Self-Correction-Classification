=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to analyze the information given step by step.

1. **Total Beakers**: There are 22 beakers in total.
2. **Beakers with Copper Ions**: Out of these, 8 beakers contain copper ions.
3. **Beakers without Copper Ions**: Therefore, the number of beakers without copper ions is:
   \[
   22 - 8 = 14
   \]

4. **Testing Process**: Each beaker is tested one by one, and it takes 3 drops of solution to test each beaker. We are told that a total of 45 drops are used before all 8 beakers with copper ions are found.

5. **Calculating the Number of Beakers Tested**: Since each beaker requires 3 drops to test, we can find out how many beakers were tested using the total number of drops:
   \[
   \text{Number of beakers tested} = \frac{\text{Total drops used}}{\text{Drops per beaker}} = \frac{45}{3} = 15
   \]

6. **Finding Beakers without Copper Ions Tested**: We know that there are 8 beakers with copper ions. Since a total of 15 beakers were tested, we can find out how many of these were without copper ions:
   \[
   \text{Number of beakers with copper ions tested} = 8
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of beakers without copper ions tested} = \text{Total beakers tested} - \text{Beakers with copper ions tested} = 15 - 8 = 7
   \]

Thus, the number of beakers without copper ions that were tested is \( \boxed{7} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of beakers without copper ions that were tested.

Given information:
- The laboratory has 22 beakers of liquid in a fume hood.
- 8 of the beakers have copper ions in them.
- Adding three drops of a solution will turn the liquid in a beaker blue if there are copper ions present.
- 45 drops were used before all 8 beakers with copper ions were found.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of drops used for t...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many beakers without copper ions were tested before all 8 beakers with copper ions were identified. We know the following:

- There are 22 beakers in total.
- 8 of these beakers contain copper ions.
- Each test involves adding 3 drops of a solution to a beaker.
- A total of 45 drops were used before all 8 beakers with copper ions were found.

First, let's calculate how many beakers were tested in total. Since each test uses...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that three drops of a solution are used to test each beaker for copper ions. Therefore, if 45 drops were used to find all 8 beakers with copper ions, we can calculate the number of beakers tested by dividing the total number of drops used by the number of drops used per beaker.

45 drops / 3 drops per beaker = 15 beakers

This means that 15 beakers were tested in total to find all 8 beakers with copper ions. 

However, we want to find out how many beake...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 22 beakers in total.
   * 8 of the beakers contain copper ions.
   * 3 drops of a solution are used to test each beaker.
   * 45 drops were used in total before finding all 8 beakers with copper ions.

2. Calculate the number of beakers tested:
   * Since 3 drops are used for each beaker, we can find the number of beakers tested by dividing the total nu...
