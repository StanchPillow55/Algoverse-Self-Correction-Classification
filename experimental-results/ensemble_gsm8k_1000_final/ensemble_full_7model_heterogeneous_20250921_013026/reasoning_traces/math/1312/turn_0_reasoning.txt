=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of a printer given the total cost of keyboards and printers purchased by the merchant.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( k \) be the cost of one keyboard.
   - Let \( p \) be the cost of one printer.

2. **Given information:**
   - The merchant bought 15 keyboards and 25 printers for a total of $2050.
   - The cost of one keyboard is $20, so \( k = 20 \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   The total cost can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = (\text{Number of Keyboards} \times \text{Cost per Keyboard}) + (\text{Number of Printers} \times \text{Cost per Printer})
   \]
   Plugging in the values we have:
   \[
   2050 = (15 \times 20) + (25 \times p)
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the keyboards:**
   \[
   15 \times 20 = 300
   \]

5. **Substitute this value back into the equation:**
   \[
   2050 = 300 + (25 \times p)
   \]

6. **Isolate the term involving \( p \):**
   Subtract 300 from both sides:
   \[
   2050 - 300 = 25p
   \]
   \[
   1750 = 25p
   \]

7. **Solve for \( p \):**
   Divide both sides by 25:
   \[
   p = \frac{1750}{25}
   \]
   \[
   p = 70
   \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   The cost of one printer is \( \boxed{70} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The merchant bought 15 keyboards and 25 printers for a total of $2050.
- The cost of each keyboard is $20.

To find the cost of each printer, we need to set up an equation and solve for the unknown.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the cost of each printer.

We know that the total cost of the purchase is $2050, so we can write the equation:
15 × $20 + 25 × x = $2050

Solving the equatio...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of a printer given the total cost of keyboards and printers, and the cost of a keyboard.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the known quantities:**
   - Number of keyboards = 15
   - Cost of one keyboard = $20
   - Number of printers = 25
   - Total cost of keyboards and printers = $2050

2. **Calculate the total cost of the keyboards:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost of keyboards} = \text{Number of ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total cost of the keyboards. 

The merchant bought 15 keyboards, and each keyboard costs $20. So, the total cost of the keyboards is 15 keyboards * $20/keyboard = $300.

The merchant spent a total of $2050 for both the keyboards and printers. If we subtract the cost of the keyboards from the total cost, we can find out how much was spent on the printers.

So, the total cost of the printers is $2050 - $300 = $1750.

The merchant bought 25 printer...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to set up an equation and solve for the cost of a printer.

Given:
- The merchant bought 15 keyboards and 25 printers.
- The total cost of the purchase was $2050.
- Each keyboard costs $20.

Step 1: Let's define a variable for the unknown cost of a printer.
Let x = the cost of one printer

Step 2: Set up an equation using the given information.
Total cost = (Cost of keyboar...
