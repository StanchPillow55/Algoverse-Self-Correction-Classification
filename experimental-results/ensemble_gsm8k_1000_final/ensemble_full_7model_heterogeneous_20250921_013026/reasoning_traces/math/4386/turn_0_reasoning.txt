Final Answer: To find out how much money Jolene has raised so far, we need to calculate the total amount she earned from babysitting and from washing cars separately, and then add those two amounts together.

**Step 1: Calculate earnings from babysitting.**

Jolene babysits for 4 families, and she earns $30 from each family. We can calculate her total earnings from babysitting using the formula:

\[
\text{Total earnings from babysitting} = \text{Number of families} \times \text{Earnings per family}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total earnings from babysitting} = 4 \times 30
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
4 \times 30 = 120
\]

So, Jolene earned **$120** from babysitting.

**Step 2: Calculate earnings from washing cars.**

Next, Jolene washes cars for 5 neighbors, earning $12 for each car. We can calculate her total earnings from washing cars using a similar formula:

\[
\text{Total earnings from washing cars} = \text{Number of cars} \times \text{Earnings per car}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total earnings from washing cars} = 5 \times 12
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
5 \times 12 = 60
\]

So, Jolene earned **$60** from washing cars.

**Step 3: Calculate total earnings.**

Now, we need to add the total earnings from babysitting and washing cars together:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Total earnings from babysitting} + \text{Total earnings from washing cars}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 120 + 60
\]

Now, we perform the addition:

\[
120 + 60 = 180
\]

Thus, Jolene has raised a total of **$180** so far.

**Final Answer:**
Jolene has raised **$180** so far.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Jolene babysits for 4 families and gets paid $30 for each family. So, the total amount of money she gets from babysitting is 4 families * $30/family = $<<4*30=120>>120.

She also washes 5 neighbors' cars and gets paid $12 for each car. So, the total amount of money she gets from washing cars is 5 cars * $12/car = $<<5*12=60>>60.

To find out how much money Jolene raised in total, we need to add the money she got from babysitting and the money she got from washing cars. So...
