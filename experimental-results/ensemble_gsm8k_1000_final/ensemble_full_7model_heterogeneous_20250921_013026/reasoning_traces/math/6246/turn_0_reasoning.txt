=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of cookies Nicole ate.**
2. **Determine the number of cookies remaining after Nicole ate.**
3. **Calculate the number of cookies Eduardo ate from the remaining cookies.**
4. **Determine the final number of cookies remaining after both Nicole and Eduardo have eaten.**
5. **Calculate the percentage of the original cookies that remain.**

### Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies Nicole ate.

Nicole ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total cookies. The total number of cookies is 600.

\[
\text{Cookies eaten by Nicole} = \frac{2}{5} \times 600
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Cookies eaten by Nicole} = \frac{2 \times 600}{5} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of cookies remaining after Nicole ate.

Now we subtract the number of cookies Nicole ate from the total:

\[
\text{Remaining cookies} = 600 - 240 = 360
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of cookies Eduardo ate from the remaining cookies.

Eduardo ate \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining cookies. The remaining cookies are 360.

\[
\text{Cookies eaten by Eduardo} = \frac{3}{5} \times 360
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Cookies eaten by Eduardo} = \frac{3 \times 360}{5} = \frac{1080}{5} = 216
\]

### Step 4: Determine the final number of cookies remaining after both have eaten.

Now we subtract the number of cookies Eduardo ate from the remaining cookies:

\[
\text{Final remaining cookies} = 360 - 216 = 144
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the percentage of the original cookies that remain.

To find the percentage of the original cookies that remain, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage remaining} = \left( \frac{\text{Final remaining cookies}}{\text{Original total cookies}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Percentage remaining} = \left( \frac{144}{600} \right) \times 100
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Percentage remaining} = \frac{144 \times 100}{600} = \frac{14400}{600} = 24
\]

### Final Answer

The percentage of the original cookies that remained is \( \boxed{24} \).

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of cookies Nicole ate.**
2. **Determine the number of cookies remaining after Nicole ate.**
3. **Calculate the number of cookies Eduardo ate from the remaining cookies.**
4. **Determine the final number of cookies remaining after both Nicole and Eduardo have eaten.**

### Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies Nicole ate....

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- There were 600 cookies in the box.
- Nicole ate 2/5 of the total number of cookies.
- Eduardo ate 3/5 of the remaining amount.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies Nicole ate.
Nicole's portion = 2/5 of 600 cookies
Nicole's portion = 2/5 × 600 = 240 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies remaining after Nicole's portion.
Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Nicole's portion

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cookies remain after Nicole and Eduardo have eaten their portions, and then calculate what percentage of the original number of cookies this remaining amount represents.

**Step 1: Calculate how many cookies Nicole ate.**

Nicole ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of cookies. The total number of cookies is 600.

\[
\text{Cookies eaten by Nicole} = \frac{2}{5} \times 600 = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
\]

**Step 2: Deter...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many cookies Nicole ate. 

Nicole ate 2/5 of the total number of cookies. 

So, Nicole ate = 2/5 * 600 = 240 cookies

After Nicole ate some cookies, the remaining number of cookies is 600 - 240 = 360 cookies.

Next, let's find out how many cookies Eduardo ate. 

Eduardo ate 3/5 of the remaining cookies.

So, Eduardo ate = 3/5 * 360 = 216 cookies

After Eduardo ate some cookies, the remaining number of cookies is 360 - 216 = 144 cookies.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start with the total number of cookies and calculate how many are left after Nicole and Eduardo have eaten their portions.

Given:
- There were 600 cookies in the box.
- Nicole ate 2/5 of the total number of cookies.
- Eduardo ate 3/5 of the remaining amount.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies Nicole ate.
Nicole's portion = 2/5 × 600
Nicole's portion = 240 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the number of...
