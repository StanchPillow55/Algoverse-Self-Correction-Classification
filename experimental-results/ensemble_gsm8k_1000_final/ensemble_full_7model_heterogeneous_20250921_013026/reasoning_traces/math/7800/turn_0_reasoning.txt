=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Count of Lollipops**: Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

2. **Lollipops Eaten on the Way to School**: 
   - Oscar eats 2 lollipops.
   - Remaining lollipops = Initial lollipops - Lollipops eaten
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22
   \]

3. **Lollipops Given to Friends**: 
   - Oscar gives away 14 lollipops to his friends.
   - Remaining lollipops = Lollipops remaining after eating - Lollipops given away
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]

4. **Lollipops Bought on the Way Home**: 
   - Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave away 14 lollipops, he buys:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28
   \]
   - Now, we add the lollipops he bought to the remaining lollipops:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]

5. **Lollipops Eaten at Night**: 
   - Oscar eats 3 lollipops that night.
   - Remaining lollipops = Lollipops after buying - Lollipops eaten at night
   \[
   36 - 3 = 33
   \]

6. **Lollipops Eaten in the Morning**: 
   - Oscar eats 2 more lollipops in the morning.
   - Remaining lollipops = Lollipops after eating at night - Lollipops eaten in the morning
   \[
   33 - 2 = 31
   \]

Finally, after going through all these steps, we find that Oscar has **31 lollipops** left.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{31}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
- He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.
- He passes out 14 lollipops to his friends.
- He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends.
- He eats 3 more lollipops that night and 2 more in the morning.

Step 1: Calculate the number of lollipops Oscar has after eating 2 on his way to school.
Number of lollipops after eating 2 = 24 - 2...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to track the number of lollipops Oscar has at each step of the scenario described. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Amount:**
   - Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

2. **Eating on the Way to School:**
   - Oscar eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.
   - Calculation: \(24 - 2 = 22\)
   - Oscar now has 22 lollipops.

3. **Giving to Friends:**
   - Oscar gives 14 lollipops to his friends.
   - Calculation: \(22 - 14 = 8\)
   - ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241210): ANTHROPIC_API_ERROR: Error code: 404 - {'type': 'error', 'error': {'type': 'not_found_error', 'message': 'model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241210'}, 'request_id': 'req_011CTMeGeTYQpSib7LkLcx4X'}

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

He eats 2 on his way to school, so 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops remain.

He gives 14 to his friends, so 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops remain.

He buys twice as many as he gave to his friends, so he buys 14 * 2 = 28 lollipops.

Adding these to his remaining lollipops, 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night, so 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops remain.

He eats 2 more in the morning, so 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops remain.

So, Oscar has 31 lollipops.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

2. On his way to school, he eats 2 lollipops.
   * Remaining lollipops = 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops

3. He passes out 14 lollipops to his friends.
   * Remaining lollipops = 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops

4. On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends.
   * Lollipops given to friends = 14
   * Lollipops bought = 14 Ã— 2 = 28
   * Total lollipops after buy...
