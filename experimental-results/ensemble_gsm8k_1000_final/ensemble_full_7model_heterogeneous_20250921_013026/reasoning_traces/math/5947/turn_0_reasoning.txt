=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we start by determining Karina's current age and then use that information to find her brother's age and year of birth.

1. **Determine Karina's current age**: 
   The problem states that Karina is currently 40 years old.

2. **Calculate her brother's current age**:
   According to the problem, Karina is currently twice as old as her brother. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Karina's age} = 2 \times \text{Brother's age}
   \]
   Substituting Karina's age:
   \[
   40 = 2 \times \text{Brother's age}
   \]
   To find the brother's age, we divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   \text{Brother's age} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]

3. **Determine the year of birth for her brother**:
   Since Karina is currently 40 years old and was born in 1970, we can confirm her current age:
   \[
   2023 - 1970 = 53 \quad \text{(This calculation is incorrect; she is 40 as stated)}
   \]
   We need to find the year of birth for her brother. If he is currently 20 years old, we can calculate his year of birth by subtracting his age from the current year:
   \[
   \text{Year of birth} = 2023 - 20 = 2003
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, Karina's brother was born in the year 2003.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Karina's brother was born in } 2003.
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the year in which Karina's brother was born.

Given information:
- Karina was born in 1970.
- Karina is currently twice as old as her brother.
- Karina's current age is 40.

Step 1: Find Karina's current age.
Karina's current age = 40 years

Step 2: Find the year in which Karina was born.
Karina's year of birth = 1970

Karina's age when her brother was born = K...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the year Karina's brother was born. We are given the following information:

1. Karina was born in 1970.
2. Karina is currently twice as old as her brother.
3. Karina's current age is 40.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Determine Karina's Current Year
Since Karina was born in 1970 and her current age is 40, we can find the current year by adding her age to her birth year:

\[
1970 + 40 = 2010
\]

So, th...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): If Karina is currently 40 years old and she is twice as old as her brother, this means her brother is half her age. 

To find her brother's age, we divide Karina's age by 2:

40 / 2 = 20 years old

So, her brother is currently 20 years old.

To find out the year her brother was born, we subtract his age from the current year. Since Karina is 40 in the current year, we can assume the current year is 1970 + 40 = 2010.

So, to find her brother's birth year, we subtract his a...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Karina was born in 1970.
   * Karina is currently twice as old as her brother.
   * Karina's current age is 40.

2. Determine the current year:
   * Since Karina's current age is 40 and she was born in 1970, we can calculate the current year.
   * Current year = Karina's birth year + Karina's current age
   * Current year = 1970 + 40
   * Current year = 2010
