=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how tall Sara is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Roy's height**: 
   We know from the problem that Roy is 36 inches tall.

   \[
   \text{Roy's height} = 36 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate Joe's height**: 
   The problem states that Joe is 3 inches taller than Roy. Therefore, we can find Joe's height by adding 3 inches to Roy's height.

   \[
   \text{Joe's height} = \text{Roy's height} + 3 \text{ inches}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Joe's height} = 36 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 39 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate Sara's height**: 
   Next, we know that Sara is 6 inches taller than Joe. To find Sara's height, we add 6 inches to Joe's height.

   \[
   \text{Sara's height} = \text{Joe's height} + 6 \text{ inches}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Sara's height} = 39 \text{ inches} + 6 \text{ inches} = 45 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: 
   Therefore, Sara is 45 inches tall.

\[
\text{Sara's height} = 45 \text{ inches}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

**Sara is 45 inches tall.**

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how tall Joe is. Since Joe is 3 inches taller than Roy, and Roy is 36 inches tall, we add 3 inches to Roy's height to find Joe's height.

36 inches (Roy's height) + 3 inches = 39 inches

So, Joe is 39 inches tall.

Next, we need to find out how tall Sara is. Since Sara is 6 inches taller than Joe, and we know that Joe is 39 inches tall, we add 6 inches to Joe's height to find Sara's height.

39 inches (Joe's height) + 6 inches = 45 inches

So, S...
