=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of songs**: Aisha starts with 500 songs on her mp3 player.

   \[
   \text{Initial songs} = 500
   \]

2. **Adding more songs**: The week after, she adds another 500 songs.

   \[
   \text{Songs after adding} = 500 + 500 = 1000
   \]

3. **Doubling the amount of songs**: Next, Aisha decides to add twice the amount she already has. At this point, she has 1000 songs, so she adds:

   \[
   \text{Songs added} = 2 \times 1000 = 2000
   \]

   Now, we need to calculate the total number of songs after this addition:

   \[
   \text{Total songs after doubling} = 1000 + 2000 = 3000
   \]

4. **Removing songs**: Finally, Aisha decides to remove 50 songs from her mp3 player.

   \[
   \text{Total songs after removal} = 3000 - 50 = 2950
   \]

Now, we can summarize the calculations:

- Started with 500 songs.
- Added 500 songs: \(500 + 500 = 1000\).
- Added twice the amount (2000 songs): \(1000 + 2000 = 3000\).
- Removed 50 songs: \(3000 - 50 = 2950\).

Thus, the final number of songs on Aisha's mp3 player is:

\[
\boxed{2950}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it.

Given information:
- Aisha starts with 500 songs on her mp3 player.
- The week after, she adds another 500 songs.
- She then adds twice the amount she already had on her mp3 player.
- Finally, she removes 50 songs.

Step 1: Calculate the number of songs after adding another 500 songs.
Initial number of songs = 500
Number of songs added = 500
Total number of songs = 500 + 500 = 1000 songs

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of actions Aisha takes with her mp3 player and calculate the number of songs after each step.

1. **Initial Number of Songs:**
   Aisha starts with 500 songs on her mp3 player.

   \[
   \text{Initial number of songs} = 500
   \]

2. **Adding More Songs:**
   The week after, she adds another 500 songs.

   \[
   \text{Number of songs after adding 500} = 500 + 500 = 1000
   \]

3. **Doubling the Number of Songs:**

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Aisha starts with 500 songs on her mp3 player. 

In the second week, she adds another 500 songs. 

So, the total number of songs she has after the second week is 500 (initial number of songs) + 500 (songs added in the second week) = 1000 songs. 

She then adds twice the amount she already had on her mp3 player. This means she adds 2 * 1000 = 2000 songs.

So, the total number of songs she has after adding twice the amount is 1000 (songs she had) + 2000 (songs added) = 3000...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll keep track of the number of songs on Aisha's mp3 player at each stage.

Given:
- Aisha starts with 500 songs on her mp3 player.

Step 1: Aisha adds another 500 songs the week after.
Current number of songs = Initial songs + Added songs
Current number of songs = 500 + 500 = 1,000

Step 2: Aisha adds twice the amount she already has on her mp3 player.
Current number of songs = Previous total + (2 Ã— Previ...
