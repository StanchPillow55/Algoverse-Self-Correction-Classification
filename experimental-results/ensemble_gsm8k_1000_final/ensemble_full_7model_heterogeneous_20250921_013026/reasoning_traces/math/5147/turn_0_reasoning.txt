=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Rachel made in one hour, we need to consider both her base pay and the tips she received.

1. **Base Pay**: Rachel makes $12.00 as a waitress for one hour of work. This is straightforward:
   \[
   \text{Base Pay} = 12.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Tips**: Rachel serves 20 different people, and each person leaves her a tip of $1.25. To find the total amount of tips she received, we multiply the number of people by the tip amount per person:
   \[
   \text{Total Tips} = \text{Number of People} \times \text{Tip per Person}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Tips} = 20 \times 1.25
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   20 \times 1.25 = 25.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total Earnings**: To find Rachel's total earnings for the hour, we add her base pay to her total tips:
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Base Pay} + \text{Total Tips}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = 12.00 + 25.00
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition:
   \[
   12.00 + 25.00 = 37.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Rachel made a total of **$37.00** in that hour.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{37.00}
\]
