=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Noah and Ava have left to spend on lunch and snacks after paying for their zoo entry tickets and bus fare, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of zoo entry tickets.**
   - The cost of a zoo entry ticket is $5 per person.
   - There are 2 people (Noah and Ava).
   - Total cost for tickets = Cost per ticket × Number of people
   \[
   \text{Total cost for tickets} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of bus fare.**
   - The bus fare is $1.50 per person one way.
   - Since they need to go to the zoo and return, they will need to pay for the bus fare twice (once for going and once for returning).
   - Total bus fare for one way = Cost per person × Number of people
   \[
   \text{Total bus fare one way} = 1.50 \times 2 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Total bus fare for round trip = Total bus fare one way × 2
   \[
   \text{Total bus fare round trip} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for the trip.**
   - Total cost = Total cost for tickets + Total bus fare round trip
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how much money they have left for lunch and snacks.**
   - They brought $40 with them.
   - Money left = Total money brought - Total cost
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, after paying for the zoo entry tickets and the bus fare, Noah and Ava have **$24 left to spend on lunch and snacks**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Zoo entry tickets are $5 per person.
- Bus fare is $1.50 per person one way.
- Noah and Ava have $40 to spend.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the zoo entry tickets.
Zoo entry tickets for 2 people = 2 × $5 = $10

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the bus fare.
Bus fare for 2 people (one way) = 2 × $1.50 = $3
Bus fare for 2 people (round trip) = 2 × $3 = $6

Step 3: Calculat...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the zoo trip for Noah and Ava, including the zoo entry tickets and the bus fare, and then determine how much money they have left from their $40 budget for lunch and snacks.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate the cost of zoo entry tickets:**
   - The cost of a zoo entry ticket is $5 per person.
   - There are two people going to the zoo: Noah and Ava.
   - Total cost for zoo tickets = 2 people × $5...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total cost for the zoo entry tickets for Noah and Ava. Since each ticket costs $5, the total cost for two tickets is $5 * 2 = $10.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for the bus fare. Since the bus fare is $1.50 per person one way, the total cost for two people to go to the zoo and return is $1.50 * 2 * 2 = $6.

Adding the cost of the zoo entry tickets and the bus fare, we get $10 + $6 = $16.

Finally, we subtract the total cost of ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- Zoo entry tickets cost $5 per person.
- Bus fare is $1.50 per person one way.
- Noah and Ava bring $40 with them.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of zoo entry tickets for both Noah and Ava.
Cost of zoo entry tickets = $5 × 2 (since there are two people)
Cost of zoo entry tickets = $10

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of bus fare for both Noah and Ava.
One-way bus fare per person = $1.50
