Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought.**
   - Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.

2. **Determine the total number of oranges in those boxes.**
   - Each box contains 20 oranges.
   - Therefore, the total number of oranges is:
     \[
     \text{Total oranges} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Oranges per box} = 12 \times 20 = 240 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Calculate how many boxes of oranges she gave away.**
   - Mrs. Harrington gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each.
   - Total boxes given away:
     \[
     \text{Total boxes given away} = 2 \text{ (to mom)} + 2 \text{ (to sister)} = 4 \text{ boxes}
     \]

4. **Determine how many boxes she has left after giving some away.**
   - Boxes remaining:
     \[
     \text{Boxes remaining} = \text{Total boxes} - \text{Boxes given away} = 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes}
     \]

5. **Calculate how many oranges are left after giving some away.**
   - Oranges given away:
     \[
     \text{Oranges given away} = \text{Boxes given away} \times \text{Oranges per box} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ oranges}
     \]
   - Oranges remaining:
     \[
     \text{Oranges remaining} = \text{Total oranges} - \text{Oranges given away} = 240 - 80 = 160 \text{ oranges}
     \]

6. **Determine how many oranges Mrs. Harrington kept.**
   - She kept \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining oranges:
     \[
     \text{Oranges kept} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Oranges remaining} = \frac{1}{4} \times 160 = 40 \text{ oranges}
     \]

7. **Calculate how many oranges she sold.**
   - Oranges sold:
     \[
     \text{Oranges sold} = \text{Oranges remaining} - \text{Oranges kept} = 160 - 40 = 120 \text{ oranges}
     \]

Finally, we conclude that Mrs. Harrington sold **120 oranges**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold. We'll break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of oranges:**
   - Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
   - Each box contains 20 oranges.
   - Therefore, the total number of oranges is calculated by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box:
     \[
     12 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges per box} = 240 \text{ oranges}
     ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington had left after giving some to her mom and sister. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away 2 + 2 = <<2+2=4>>4 boxes in total.

She initially had 12 boxes, so after giving some away, she had 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 boxes left.

Each box contains 20 oranges, so in the 8 boxes, she had 8 * 20 = <<8*20=160>>160 oranges.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which means she sold the rest. ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
- She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each.
- She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges.
- Each box contains 20 oranges.

Step 1: Calculate the number of boxes Mrs. Harrington has left after giving away 4 boxes.
Boxes left = Total boxes - Boxes given away
Boxes left = 12 - (2 + 2) = 12 - 4 = 8 boxes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of oranges in the re...
