=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many hours James slept and then find the difference between the hours Harry and James slept.

1. **Identify how many hours Harry slept**: 
   Harry slept for 9 hours.

2. **Calculate how many hours James slept**: 
   According to the problem, James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept. We can calculate this by multiplying Harry's sleep hours by \( \frac{2}{3} \).

   \[
   \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Harry's sleep}
   \]
   \[
   \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9
   \]

   To perform the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
   \]

   So, James slept for 6 hours.

3. **Calculate how many more hours Harry slept than James**: 
   Now we need to find the difference between the hours Harry slept and the hours James slept.

   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep} - \text{James's sleep}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3
   \]

Thus, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

**Final Answer**: Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to determine how many hours James slept and then find the difference between the hours Harry and James slept.

1. **Identify how many hours Harry slept**: 
   Harry slept for 9 hours.

2. **Calculate how many hours James slept**: 
   According to the problem, James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept. We can calculate this by multiplying Harry's sleep hours by \( \frac{2}{3} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Harry slept 9 hours last night.
- James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept.

Step 1: Calculate how many hours James slept.
James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept.
Harry slept 9 hours.
So, James slept 2/3 × 9 hours = 6 hours.

Step 2: Calculate the difference between the hours Harry and James slept.
Harry slept 9 hours.
James slept 6 hours.
The difference is 9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours.

Therefore...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours James slept and then find the difference between the hours Harry slept and the hours James slept.

1. **Determine how many hours James slept:**

   We know that James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the hours that Harry slept. Harry slept for 9 hours. Therefore, we calculate the hours James slept as follows:

   \[
   \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9
   \]

   To perform the multiplication, multiply the...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many hours James slept. We know that James slept 2/3 of the time that Harry slept. So, we multiply the number of hours Harry slept by 2/3:

9 hours * 2/3 = 6 hours

So, James slept 6 hours.

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. To do this, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. 

Final Answer: Har...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate the number of hours James slept.

Given:
- Harry slept 9 hours last night.
- James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept.

Step 1: Calculate the number of hours James slept.
James' sleep = 2/3 × Harry's sleep
James' sleep = 2/3 × 9
James' sleep = 18/3
James' sleep = 6 hours

Explanation: To find the number of hours James slept, we mul...
