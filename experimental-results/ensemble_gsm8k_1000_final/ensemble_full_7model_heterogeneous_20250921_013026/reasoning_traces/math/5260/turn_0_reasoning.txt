=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Celia is going to put into her savings account, we need to calculate her total spending for the month and then find 10% of that total.

### Step 1: Calculate Weekly Food Spending
Celia plans to spend no more than $100 a week on food for 4 weeks. Therefore, her total food spending for the month is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total food spending} = \text{Weekly food spending} \times \text{Number of weeks}
\]
\[
\text{Total food spending} = 100 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 400 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Monthly Spending
Next, we will add up all of her planned expenses for the month:

1. **Rent**: $1500
2. **Food**: $400 (calculated above)
3. **Video streaming services**: $30
4. **Cell phone usage**: $50

Now, we sum these amounts:

\[
\text{Total monthly spending} = \text{Rent} + \text{Food} + \text{Video streaming} + \text{Cell phone}
\]
\[
\text{Total monthly spending} = 1500 + 400 + 30 + 50
\]
\[
\text{Total monthly spending} = 1980 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Savings
Celia wants to set aside 10% of her total spending for savings. We calculate 10% of her total monthly spending:

\[
\text{Savings} = 0.10 \times \text{Total monthly spending}
\]
\[
\text{Savings} = 0.10 \times 1980
\]
\[
\text{Savings} = 198 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Celia is going to put **$198** into her savings account.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much Celia plans to spend on food for the entire month. Since she plans to spend $100 a week on food and there are 4 weeks in a month, she will spend 100 * 4 = $<<100*4=400>>400 on food for the month.

Next, let's add up all of her planned spending for the month. This includes her rent, food, video streaming services, and cell phone usage. So, her total spending for the month will be 1500 (rent) + 400 (food) + 30 (video streaming) + 50 (cell pho...
