=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's denote the amount Sid spent on computer accessories as \( x \).

Initially, Sid has $48. After spending \( x \) on computer accessories and $8 on snacks, the total amount he has spent is:

\[
x + 8
\]

Thus, the amount of money Sid has left after these purchases can be calculated as:

\[
48 - (x + 8) = 48 - x - 8 = 40 - x
\]

According to the problem, after these purchases, Sid has $4 more than half of his original money left. Half of his original money ($48) is:

\[
\frac{48}{2} = 24
\]

So, $4 more than half of his original money is:

\[
24 + 4 = 28
\]

Now we can set up the equation based on the information given:

\[
40 - x = 28
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract 40 from both sides:

\[
-x = 28 - 40
\]

\[
-x = -12
\]

2. Multiply both sides by -1:

\[
x = 12
\]

Thus, Sid spent \( \boxed{12} \) dollars on computer accessories.

To verify, we can check the calculations:

- Amount spent on snacks: $8
- Total spent: \( 12 + 8 = 20 \)
- Amount left: \( 48 - 20 = 28 \)
- Half of original money: \( 24 \)
- $4 more than half: \( 24 + 4 = 28 \)

Since the amount left ($28) matches the condition given in the problem, our solution is confirmed to be correct. Therefore, the final answer is \( \boxed{12} \).

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the amount of money Sid spent on computer accessories as X. 

According to the problem, after spending X dollars on computer accessories and $8 on snacks, Sid has $4 more than half of his original money left. 

We know that Sid's original money was $48, so half of this amount is $48/2 = $24. 

Therefore, Sid has $24 + $4 = $28 left after his purchases. 

We can set up the following equation to represent the situation:
