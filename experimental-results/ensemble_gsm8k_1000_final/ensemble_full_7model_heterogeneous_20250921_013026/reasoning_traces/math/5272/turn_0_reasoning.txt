=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's denote the amounts of money on the three tables as follows:

- Let \( A \) be the amount of money on Table A.
- Let \( B \) be the amount of money on Table B.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of money on Table C.

From the problem, we know the following:

1. The amount on Table A is given as:
   \[
   A = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Table C has $20 more than Table A:
   \[
   C = A + 20
   \]
   Substituting the value of \( A \):
   \[
   C = 40 + 20 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Table B has twice as much money as Table C:
   \[
   B = 2C
   \]
   Substituting the value of \( C \):
   \[
   B = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now we have the amounts on all three tables:
- \( A = 40 \) dollars
- \( B = 120 \) dollars
- \( C = 60 \) dollars

Next, we need to find the total amount of money on all the tables:
\[
\text{Total} = A + B + C
\]
Substituting the values we found:
\[
\text{Total} = 40 + 120 + 60
\]

Calculating the total:
\[
\text{Total} = 40 + 120 = 160
\]
\[
\text{Total} = 160 + 60 = 220
\]

Thus, the total amount of money on all the tables is:
\[
\boxed{220} \text{ dollars}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- There are 3 roulette tables: A, B, and C.
- At 6:00 pm, Table B had twice as much money on it as Table C.
- Table C had $20 more than Table A.
- There was $40 on Table A.

Step 1: Find the amount of money on Table C.
Since Table C had $20 more than Table A, and Table A had $40, we can calculate the amount on Table C.
Amount on Table C = Amount on Table A + $20
Amount on Table C = ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of money on each of the three roulette tables (A, B, and C) and then sum these amounts to find the total money on all the tables.

Let's start by defining the variables based on the information given:

1. Let \( x \) be the amount of money on table A.
2. According to the problem, table C had $20 more than table A. Therefore, the amount of money on table C is \( x + 20 \).
3. Table B had twice as much money as table C...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that table A had $40 on it.

The problem states that table C had $20 more than table A. So, table C had $40 + $20 = $60.

The problem also states that table B had twice as much money on it as table C. So, table B had 2 * $60 = $120.

To find out how much money was there on all the tables, we add up the amounts on each table. So, the total amount of money on all the tables is $40 (table A) + $60 (table C) + $120 (table B)...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the total amount of money on all the tables.

Given:
- There are 3 roulette tables: A, B, and C.
- Table C has $20 more than Table A.
- Table B has twice as much money as Table C.
- Table A has $40 on it.

Step 1: Determine the amount of money on Table C.
Table C = Table A + $...
