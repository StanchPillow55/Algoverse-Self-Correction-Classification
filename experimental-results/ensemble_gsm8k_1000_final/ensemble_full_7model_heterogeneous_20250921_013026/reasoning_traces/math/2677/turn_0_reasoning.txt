Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of one child's ticket given the total number of adults, children, and the total bill.

1. **Identify the variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the price of one child's ticket.
   - The price of one adult ticket is given as $8.

2. **Determine the number of tickets sold**:
   - There are 10 adults and 11 children.
   - Therefore, the total number of adult tickets sold is 10, and the total number of child tickets sold is 11.

3. **Calculate the total cost of adult tickets**:
   - The total cost for adult tickets can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of adult tickets} = \text{Number of adults} \times \text{Price per adult ticket} = 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Set up the equation for the total bill**:
   - The total bill for both adults and children is given as $124. Therefore, we can express the total cost as:
     \[
     \text{Total bill} = \text{Total cost of adult tickets} + \text{Total cost of child tickets}
     \]
   - The total cost of child tickets can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of child tickets} = \text{Number of children} \times \text{Price per child ticket} = 11 \times x
     \]
   - Substituting the known values into the equation gives:
     \[
     124 = 80 + 11x
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - First, isolate \( 11x \) by subtracting 80 from both sides:
     \[
     124 - 80 = 11x
     \]
     \[
     44 = 11x
     \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 11 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{44}{11} = 4
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The price of one child's ticket is \( \boxed{4} \) dollars. 

This means that each child's ticket costs $4, which satisfies the total bill of $124 when combined with the adult tickets.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- 10 adults went to the ball game
- 11 children went to the ball game
- Adult tickets are $8 each
- The total bill was $124

To find the cost of one child's ticket, we need to:
1. Calculate the total cost of the adult tickets
2. Subtract the total cost of the adult tickets from the total bill
3. Divide the remaining amount by the number of children to get the cost of one child's ticket

Step 1: ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of one child's ticket given the total cost for the group and the cost of adult tickets.

Let's break down the information given:

- There are 10 adults, and each adult ticket costs $8.
- There are 11 children, and we need to find the cost of one child's ticket.
- The total cost for all tickets is $124.

First, calculate the total cost of the adult tickets:

\[
\text{Cost of adult tickets} = \text{Number of adults} \tim...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total cost of the adult tickets. Since each adult ticket costs $8 and there are 10 adults, the total cost for the adult tickets is 10 adults * $8/adult = $80.

The total bill was $124, so the cost of the children's tickets is $124 total - $80 for adults = $44.

There were 11 children, so the cost of one child's ticket is $44 total / 11 children = $4 per child.

So, one child's ticket costs $4.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to set up an equation and solve for the price of a child's ticket.

Given:
- 10 adults went to the ball game
- 11 children went to the ball game
- Adult tickets cost $8 each
- The total bill was $124

Step 1: Let's define a variable for the unknown price of a child's ticket.
Let x = the price of one child's ticket

Step 2: Set up an equation using the given information.
