Final Answer: To find the total number of balloons ordered by the party store, we can break the problem down into steps.

1. **Determine the number of bags of balloons in one box**: 
   Each box contains 8 bags of balloons.

2. **Determine the total number of bags in all boxes**: 
   The store ordered 5 boxes. Therefore, the total number of bags of balloons is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total bags} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Bags per box} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ bags}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of balloons in one bag**: 
   Each bag contains 12 balloons.

4. **Determine the total number of balloons in all bags**: 
   Now, we can calculate the total number of balloons by multiplying the total number of bags by the number of balloons in each bag:
   \[
   \text{Total balloons} = \text{Total bags} \times \text{Balloons per bag} = 40 \times 12
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   40 \times 12 = 480
   \]

Thus, the total number of balloons ordered by the party store is \( \boxed{480} \).

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of bags in each box, and then multiply that result by the number of balloons in each bag.

Step 1: Find the total number of bags
The store ordered 5 boxes of balloons, and each box contains 8 bags. So, we multiply 5 (boxes) by 8 (bags/box) to find the total number of bags.
5 boxes * 8 bags/box = 40 bags

Step 2: Find the total number of balloons
Each bag contains 12 balloons. So, we multiply the ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The party store ordered 5 boxes of balloons.
   * Each box contains 8 bags of balloons.
   * Each bag contains 12 balloons.

2. Calculate the number of balloons in one box:
   * Each box has 8 bags, and each bag has 12 balloons.
   * Number of balloons in one box = Number of bags per box × Number of balloons per bag
   * Number of balloons in one box = 8 × 12 = 96 ball...
