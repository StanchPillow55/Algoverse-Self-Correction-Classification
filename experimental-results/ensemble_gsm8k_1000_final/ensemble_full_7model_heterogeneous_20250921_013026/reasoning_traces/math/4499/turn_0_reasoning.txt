Final Answer: To determine how much more money Maisy will earn at her new job compared to her current job, we need to calculate her weekly earnings from both jobs and then find the difference.

**Step 1: Calculate earnings from the current job.**

- Current job hours per week: 8 hours
- Wage per hour: $10

To find the total earnings from the current job, we multiply the number of hours worked by the wage per hour:

\[
\text{Earnings from current job} = \text{Hours} \times \text{Wage} = 8 \, \text{hours} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 80 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate earnings from the new job.**

- New job hours per week: 4 hours
- Wage per hour: $15
- Bonus for exceeding quota: $35

First, we calculate the earnings from the hours worked at the new job:

\[
\text{Earnings from new job (without bonus)} = \text{Hours} \times \text{Wage} = 4 \, \text{hours} \times 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 60 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Next, we add the bonus to the earnings from the new job:

\[
\text{Total earnings from new job} = \text{Earnings from new job} + \text{Bonus} = 60 \, \text{dollars} + 35 \, \text{dollars} = 95 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in earnings between the new job and the current job.**

Now, we find the difference between the earnings from the new job and the current job:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Earnings from new job} - \text{Earnings from current job} = 95 \, \text{dollars} - 80 \, \text{dollars} = 15 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Maisy will earn **$15 more** at her new job compared to her current job.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much Maisy earns at her current job. She works 8 hours a week and earns $10 per hour. So, her weekly earnings are:

8 hours/week * $10/hour = $80/week

Now, let's calculate how much she would earn at her new job. She would work 4 hours a week and earn $15 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from the hours worked would be:

4 hours/week * $15/hour = $60/week

However, she would also receive a bonus of $35 per week for exceeding her quota. So, her t...
