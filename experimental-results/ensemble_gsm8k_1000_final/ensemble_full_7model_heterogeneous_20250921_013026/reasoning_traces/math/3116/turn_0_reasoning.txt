=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many people landed in Virginia, we need to track the number of passengers and crew members throughout the flight, step by step.

1. **Initial number of passengers**: The flight started with 124 passengers.

2. **Layover in Texas**:
   - **Passengers getting off**: 58 passengers got off.
   - **Passengers getting on**: 24 passengers got on.
   
   We can calculate the number of passengers after the layover in Texas:
   \[
   \text{Passengers after Texas} = \text{Initial passengers} - \text{Passengers off} + \text{Passengers on}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Passengers after Texas} = 124 - 58 + 24 = 90
   \]

3. **Layover in North Carolina**:
   - **Passengers getting off**: 47 passengers got off.
   - **Passengers getting on**: 14 passengers got on.
   
   Now, we calculate the number of passengers after the layover in North Carolina:
   \[
   \text{Passengers after North Carolina} = \text{Passengers after Texas} - \text{Passengers off} + \text{Passengers on}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Passengers after North Carolina} = 90 - 47 + 14 = 57
   \]

4. **Crew members**: There are 10 crew members on board for the entire flight. 

5. **Total number of people landing in Virginia**: To find the total number of people who landed in Virginia, we add the number of passengers after North Carolina to the number of crew members:
   \[
   \text{Total people landing in Virginia} = \text{Passengers after North Carolina} + \text{Crew members}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total people landing in Virginia} = 57 + 10 = 67
   \]

Thus, the total number of people who landed in Virginia is \( \boxed{67} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the number of passengers on the plane at each stage of the flight and then calculate the total number of people who landed in Virginia.

Given information:
- The flight started with 124 passengers.
- At the layover in Texas, 58 passengers got off and 24 got on.
- At the stop in North Carolina, 47 people got off and 14 got on.
- There were 10 crew members on board for the entire flight.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to track the number of people on the airplane throughout the journey, including both passengers and crew members. We will follow the sequence of events as described in the problem.

1. **Initial Count:**
   - The flight started with 124 passengers.
   - There are also 10 crew members on board.
   - Total people on board initially = 124 passengers + 10 crew members = 134 people.

2. **Layover in Texas:**
   - 58 passengers got off the plane....

status: 401
detail: You did not pass an authentication token

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The airplane started with 124 passengers. In Texas, 58 passengers got off and 24 got on. So, we subtract 58 from 124 and then add 24 to get the number of passengers on the plane after the layover in Texas.

124 - 58 = 66
66 + 24 = 90

So, there were 90 passengers on the plane when it left Texas.

In North Carolina, 47 passengers got off and 14 got on. So, we subtract 47 from 90 and then add 14 to get the number of passengers on the plane after the layover in North Carolin...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll start with the number of passengers at the beginning of the flight and then adjust the number based on the people getting on and off at each stop.

Given:
- The flight started with 124 passengers.
- At the layover in Texas, 58 passengers got off, and 24 got on.
- In North Carolina, 47 people got off, and 14 got on.
- There were 10 crew members on board for the entire flight.
