=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of students**: We know that the total number of students in the class is 60.

2. **Identify the number of students eating in the cafeteria**: The problem states that 10 students eat in the school cafeteria.

3. **Determine the number of students who bring their lunch**: According to the problem, the number of students who bring their lunch is three times the number of students who eat in the cafeteria. Since we know that 10 students eat in the cafeteria, we can calculate the number of students who bring their lunch as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of students who bring lunch} = 3 \times \text{Number of students eating in cafeteria} = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of students who eat lunch**: Now, we can find the total number of students who either bring their lunch or eat in the cafeteria:
   \[
   \text{Total students eating lunch} = \text{Students bringing lunch} + \text{Students eating in cafeteria} = 30 + 10 = 40
   \]

5. **Determine the number of students who don't eat lunch**: To find the number of students who don't eat lunch, we subtract the total number of students eating lunch from the total number of students in the class:
   \[
   \text{Number of students not eating lunch} = \text{Total students} - \text{Total students eating lunch} = 60 - 40 = 20
   \]

6. **Final answer**: Therefore, the number of students who don't eat lunch is:
   \[
   \boxed{20}
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by finding out how many students bring their lunch. We know that the number of students who bring their lunch is thrice the number of those who eat in the school cafeteria. 

So, if 10 students eat in the school cafeteria, then the number of students who bring their lunch is 3 * 10 = <<3*10=30>>30 students.

Now, to find out how many students don't eat lunch, we subtract the number of students who eat in the cafeteria and the number of students who bring their...
