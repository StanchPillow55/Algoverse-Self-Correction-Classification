=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many roses Tom sends in total over the course of a week, given that he sends 2 dozen roses each day.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Tom sends 2 dozen roses every day.
   - A week consists of 7 days.

2. **Calculating the Number of Roses per Day**:
   - One dozen equals 12 roses.
   - Therefore, 2 dozen roses is calculated as:
     \[
     2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ roses}
     \]

3. **Calculating the Total Number of Roses for the Week**:
   - Since Tom sends 24 roses each day and there are 7 days in a week, we calculate the total number of roses sent in a week as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total roses} = \text{roses per day} \times \text{number of days}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total roses} = 24 \text{ roses/day} \times 7 \text{ days}
     \]

4. **Performing the Multiplication**:
   - Now we perform the multiplication:
     \[
     24 \times 7 = 168
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of roses Tom sent to his wife over the week is:
     \[
     \boxed{168}
     \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to understand that a dozen is equal to 12. So, 2 dozen roses would be 2 * 12 = 24 roses.

Next, we know that there are 7 days in a week. So, if Tom sends 24 roses every day for a week, he would send 24 * 7 = 168 roses in total.

So, Tom sent a total of 168 roses to his wife over the course of a week.
