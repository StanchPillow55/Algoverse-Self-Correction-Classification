=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of students in the orchestra, the band, and the choir. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of students in the orchestra:**
   - We are given that there are 20 students in the orchestra.
   \[
   \text{Students in the orchestra} = 20
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of students in the band:**
   - We are told that there are twice as many students in the band as there are in the orchestra. Therefore, we can calculate the number of students in the band as follows:
   \[
   \text{Students in the band} = 2 \times \text{Students in the orchestra} = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of students in the choir:**
   - We know that there are 12 boys and 16 girls in the choir. To find the total number of students in the choir, we add the number of boys and girls together:
   \[
   \text{Students in the choir} = \text{Boys} + \text{Girls} = 12 + 16 = 28
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of students in all groups:**
   - Now that we have the number of students in each group, we can find the total number of students by adding the number of students in the orchestra, band, and choir:
   \[
   \text{Total students} = \text{Students in the orchestra} + \text{Students in the band} + \text{Students in the choir}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total students} = 20 + 40 + 28
   \]

5. **Perform the final addition:**
   - Now we will add these numbers together:
   \[
   20 + 40 = 60
   \]
   \[
   60 + 28 = 88
   \]

Thus, the total number of students in the orchestra, the band, and the choir is \( \boxed{88} \).

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's determine the number of students in each group.

We know that there are 20 students in the orchestra.

We're told that the band has twice the number of students as the orchestra. So, to find the number of students in the band, we multiply the number of students in the orchestra by 2:

20 students (orchestra) * 2 = 40 students (band)

We're also told that there are 12 boys and 16 girls in the choir. To find the total number of students in the choir, we add the...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 20 students in the orchestra.
   * The number of students in the band is twice that of the orchestra.
   * There are 12 boys and 16 girls in the choir.
   * Each student participates in only one group.

2. Calculate the number of students in the band:
   * Orchestra students = 20
   * Band students = 2 × Orchestra students
   * Band students = 2 × 20 = 40
