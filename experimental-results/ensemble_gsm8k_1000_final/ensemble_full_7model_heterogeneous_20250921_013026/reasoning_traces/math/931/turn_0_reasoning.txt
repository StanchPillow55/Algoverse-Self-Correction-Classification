=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many baseball cards Brandon has.**
   - According to the problem, Brandon has a collection of 20 baseball cards.
   \[
   \text{Brandon's cards} = 20
   \]

2. **Calculate how many baseball cards Malcom has.**
   - The problem states that Malcom has 8 more cards than Brandon. Therefore, we can find the number of cards Malcom has by adding 8 to the number of cards Brandon has.
   \[
   \text{Malcom's cards} = \text{Brandon's cards} + 8 = 20 + 8 = 28
   \]

3. **Determine how many cards Malcom gives to Mark.**
   - Malcom gives half of his cards to his friend Mark. To find out how many cards that is, we need to calculate half of Malcom's total cards.
   \[
   \text{Cards given to Mark} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Malcom's cards} = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 = 14
   \]

4. **Calculate how many cards Malcom has left after giving some to Mark.**
   - To find out how many cards Malcom has left, we subtract the number of cards he gave to Mark from the total number of cards he had.
   \[
   \text{Malcom's remaining cards} = \text{Malcom's cards} - \text{Cards given to Mark} = 28 - 14 = 14
   \]

5. **State the final answer.**
   - After all calculations, we find that Malcom has 14 cards left.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Brandon has a collection of 20 baseball cards.
- Malcom has 8 more cards than Brandon.
- Malcom then gives half of his cards to his friend Mark.

Step 1: Calculate how many cards Malcom has initially.
Malcom has 8 more cards than Brandon, so:
Malcom's initial number of cards = Brandon's cards + 8
Malcom's initial number of cards = 20 + 8 = 28 cards

Step 2: Calculate how many card...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many baseball cards Malcom has after giving half of his cards to his friend Mark. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how many cards Malcom initially has:**
   - We know that Brandon has 20 baseball cards.
   - Malcom has 8 more cards than Brandon.
   - Therefore, the number of cards Malcom initially has is:
     \[
     20 + 8 = 28
     \]
   Malcom starts with 28 baseball cards.

2. **Calculate how ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many baseball cards Malcom has. We know that Malcom has 8 more cards than Brandon, and Brandon has 20 cards. So, we add 8 to 20 to find out how many cards Malcom has:

20 (Brandon's cards) + 8 = 28 cards

So, Malcom has 28 baseball cards.

Next, we need to find out how many cards Malcom has left after he gives half of his cards to Mark. To do this, we divide the total number of Malcom's cards by 2:

28 (Malcom's cards) รท 2 = 14 cards

So, af...

1. Understand the given information:
   * Brandon has 20 baseball cards.
   * Malcom has 8 more cards than Brandon.
   * Malcom gives half of his cards to his friend Mark.

2. Calculate the number of cards Malcom has initially:
