=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many muffins Amy originally baked based on the information provided about how many muffins she brings to school each day and how many are left at the end of the week.

1. **Identify the number of muffins brought each day:**
   - On Monday, Amy brings 1 muffin.
   - On Tuesday, she brings 1 + 1 = 2 muffins.
   - On Wednesday, she brings 2 + 1 = 3 muffins.
   - On Thursday, she brings 3 + 1 = 4 muffins.
   - On Friday, she brings 4 + 1 = 5 muffins.
   - On Saturday, she brings 5 + 1 = 6 muffins.

2. **Calculate the total number of muffins brought to school during the week:**
   - Total muffins brought = Muffins on Monday + Muffins on Tuesday + Muffins on Wednesday + Muffins on Thursday + Muffins on Friday + Muffins on Saturday
   - Total muffins brought = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6

   Let's calculate this step by step:
   - 1 + 2 = 3
   - 3 + 3 = 6
   - 6 + 4 = 10
   - 10 + 5 = 15
   - 15 + 6 = 21

   So, the total number of muffins brought to school from Monday to Saturday is 21 muffins.

3. **Determine how many muffins were originally baked:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of muffins Amy originally baked.
   - After bringing 21 muffins to school, she has 7 muffins left.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     x - 21 = 7
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - To find \( x \), we add 21 to both sides of the equation:
     \[
     x = 21 + 7
     \]
     \[
     x = 28
     \]

Thus, the total number of muffins Amy originally baked is **28**.

**Final Answer: 28 muffins**.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to find out how many muffins Amy brought to school each day and then add them all up. 

On Monday, Amy brought 1 muffin to school. 

On Tuesday, she brought 1 (from Monday) + 1 (one more than the day before) = 2 muffins. 

On Wednesday, she brought 2 (from Tuesday) + 1 = 3 muffins. 

On Thursday, she brought 3 (from Wednesday) + 1 = 4 muffins. 

On Friday, she brought 4 (from Thursday) + 1 = 5 muffins. 

So, from Monday to Friday, Amy brough...
