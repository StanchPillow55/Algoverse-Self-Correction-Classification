=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum weight of a robot in the competition based on the given constraints.

1. **Identify the standard weight of the robot**: 
   The standard robot weighs 100 pounds.

2. **Determine the minimum weight**: 
   According to the problem, each robot must be at least 5 pounds heavier than the standard robot. Therefore, we calculate the minimum weight as follows:
   \[
   \text{Minimum weight} = \text{Standard weight} + 5 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds} + 5 \text{ pounds} = 105 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine the maximum weight**: 
   The problem states that each robot can weigh no more than twice the minimum weight. We first calculate twice the minimum weight:
   \[
   \text{Twice the minimum weight} = 2 \times \text{Minimum weight} = 2 \times 105 \text{ pounds} = 210 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Compare the constraints**: 
   Now we have two key weights:
   - Minimum weight: 105 pounds
   - Maximum weight: 210 pounds

   The maximum weight of the robot is determined by the constraint that it cannot exceed twice the minimum weight, which we calculated to be 210 pounds.

5. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the maximum weight of a robot in the competition is:
   \[
   \boxed{210 \text{ pounds}}
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that each robot can be no more than twice the minimum weight and no less than 5 pounds heavier than the standard robot. The standard robot weighs 100 pounds.

First, let's find the minimum weight. The problem states that the minimum weight is 5 pounds heavier than the standard robot. So, the minimum weight is:

100 pounds (standard robot weight) + 5 pounds = 105 pounds

Next, let's find the maximum weight. The problem states that the maximum weight is n...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The standard robot weighs 100 pounds.
   * Each robot can be no less than 5 pounds heavier than the standard robot.
   * Each robot can be no more than twice the minimum weight.

2. Calculate the minimum weight of a robot:
   * Minimum weight = Standard robot weight + 5 pounds
   * Minimum weight = 100 pounds + 5 pounds
   * Minimum weight = 105 pounds

3. Calculate th...
