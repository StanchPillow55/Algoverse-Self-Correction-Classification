=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it takes Ann to frost 10 cakes with her sprained wrist, given that it takes her 8 minutes to frost one cake.

1. **Determine the time to frost one cake with a sprained wrist:**
   - Ann takes 8 minutes to frost one cake.

2. **Calculate the time to frost 10 cakes:**
   - Since it takes her 8 minutes to frost one cake, we can find the total time for 10 cakes by multiplying the time for one cake by the number of cakes:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time per cake} \times \text{Number of cakes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 8 \text{ minutes/cake} \times 10 \text{ cakes} = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, it would take Ann 80 minutes to frost 10 cakes with her sprained wrist.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{80 \text{ minutes}}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Normally, Ann can frost a cake in 5 minutes.
- With a sprained wrist, it takes her 8 minutes to frost a cake.
- We need to find how much longer it would take her to frost 10 cakes with her sprained wrist.

Step 1: Calculate the time it would take Ann to frost 10 cakes normally.
Time to frost 1 cake normally = 5 minutes
Time to frost 10 cakes normally = 10 Ã— 5 minutes = 50 minutes

Step 2: Calc...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much longer it takes Ann to frost 10 cakes with her sprained wrist compared to her normal time.

### Step 1: Calculate the normal time to frost 10 cakes

Normally, Ann can frost one cake in 5 minutes. Therefore, to find out how long it takes her to frost 10 cakes, we multiply the time per cake by the number of cakes:

\[
\text{Normal time for 10 cakes} = 5 \, \text{minutes/cake} \times 10 \, \text{cakes} = 50 \, \text{minut...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how long it would normally take Ann to frost 10 cakes. 

Since she can frost a cake in 5 minutes, to frost 10 cakes, she would need 10 cakes * 5 minutes/cake = 50 minutes.

Now, let's calculate how long it would take her to frost 10 cakes with her sprained wrist. 

Since it takes her 8 minutes to frost a cake with her sprained wrist, to frost 10 cakes, she would need 10 cakes * 8 minutes/cake = 80 minutes.

To find out how much longer it would take ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. To find out how much longer it would take Ann to frost 10 cakes with her sprained wrist, we need to calculate the time difference between frosting 10 cakes with and without the sprained wrist.

Given:
- Ann normally takes 5 minutes to frost a cake.
- With a sprained wrist, it takes her 8 minutes to frost a cake.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes Ann to frost 10 cakes without the sprained wrist.
Time to...
