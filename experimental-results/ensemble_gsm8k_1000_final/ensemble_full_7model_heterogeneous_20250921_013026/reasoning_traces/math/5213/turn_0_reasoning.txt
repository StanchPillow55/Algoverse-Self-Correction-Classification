=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much speed Jon gained per week after his training sessions. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Speed**: Jon can throw a fastball at 80 miles per hour (mph).

2. **Speed Increase**: After completing his training, Jon can throw the ball 20% faster. We need to calculate what 20% of his initial speed (80 mph) is.

   \[
   \text{Increase in speed} = 20\% \text{ of } 80 \text{ mph}
   \]
   \[
   = 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \text{ mph}
   \]

3. **Final Speed**: After the training, Jon's new speed is the initial speed plus the increase in speed.

   \[
   \text{Final speed} = \text{Initial speed} + \text{Increase in speed}
   \]
   \[
   = 80 \text{ mph} + 16 \text{ mph} = 96 \text{ mph}
   \]

4. **Training Sessions**: Jon goes through 4 training sessions, each lasting 4 weeks. Therefore, the total duration of training is:

   \[
   \text{Total weeks} = 4 \text{ sessions} \times 4 \text{ weeks/session} = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

5. **Speed Gain Per Week**: We know that Jon gained a total of 16 mph over the course of 16 weeks. To find out how much speed he gained per week, we divide the total increase in speed by the total number of weeks.

   \[
   \text{Speed gain per week} = \frac{\text{Total increase in speed}}{\text{Total weeks}}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{16 \text{ mph}}{16 \text{ weeks}} = 1 \text{ mph/week}
   \]

Thus, Jon gained **1 mph** of speed per week during his training.

**Final Answer**: Jon gained 1 mph of speed per week.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the increase in Jon's fastball speed and then calculate the speed gain per week.

Given information:
- Jon's initial fastball speed is 80 miles per hour (mph).
- After intense training for 4 weeks, 4 times, he can throw the ball 20% faster.

Step 1: Calculate the increase in fastball speed.
Initial fastball speed = 80 mph
Increase in speed = 20% of 80 mph
Increase in speed = 0.20 Ã— 80 mph = 16 mph

Step 2: Calcul...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much speed Jon gained per week after undergoing his training sessions. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine Jon's final throwing speed

Jon initially throws a fastball at 80 miles per hour. After his training, he can throw the ball 20% faster. To find his final throwing speed, we calculate 20% of his initial speed and add it to the initial speed.

1. Calculate 20% of 80 mph:
   \[
   0.20 \times...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much faster Jon can throw a ball after his training. We know that he can throw a fastball at 80 miles per hour and that he can throw 20% faster after training. 

To find out how much faster he can throw, we multiply his original speed by 20% (or 0.20). 

80 mph * 0.20 = 16 mph

So, Jon can throw 16 mph faster after his training. 

Next, we need to find out how many weeks Jon trained for. We know that he trained 4 times for 4 weeks each time....

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jon's initial fastball speed is 80 miles per hour (mph).
   * He goes through intense training 4 times, each time for 4 weeks.
   * After the last training, he can throw a ball 20% faster.
   * We assume he gained an equal amount of speed (in mph) each week.

2. Calculate the total number of weeks Jon spent training:
   * Total training sessions = 4
   * Weeks per trai...
