=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Dennis had initially, we need to analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Identify the total change received**: 
   - Dennis received 2 $10 bills and $3 in loose coins.
   - The value of the 2 $10 bills is:
     \[
     2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Adding the $3 in coins gives us the total change:
     \[
     20 + 3 = 23 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the total amount spent**:
   - Dennis bought shirts worth $27.

3. **Calculate the initial amount of money Dennis had**:
   - To find out how much money Dennis had initially, we need to add the amount he spent to the amount of change he received. This is because the initial amount is the sum of the money spent and the change received.
   - Therefore, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Initial amount} = \text{Amount spent} + \text{Change received}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \text{Initial amount} = 27 + 23
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     27 + 23 = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Dennis had initially is \(\boxed{50}\) dollars.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Dennis had initially.

Given information:
- Dennis bought shirts worth $27 from a store.
- Dennis received 2 $10 bills and $3 in loose coins as change.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of change Dennis received.
2 × $10 = $20 (from the 2 $10 bills)
$3 (in loose coins)
Total change = $20 + $3 = $23

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Dennis had initially.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how much money Dennis had initially, we need to consider the total amount he spent and the change he received.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Dennis bought shirts worth $27.
   - He received change consisting of two $10 bills and $3 in loose coins.

2. **Calculate the Total Change Received:**
   - The change Dennis received includes:
     - 2 $10 bills: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars
     - $3 in loose coins
   - Total change = $20 (from bills) + $3 (fro...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to figure out how much change Dennis received and then add that to the cost of the shirts he bought.

First, we find out how much change Dennis received. He received 2 $10 bills and $3 in loose coins. So, the total change he received is:

2 * $10 + $3 = $20 + $3 = $23

Next, we add the cost of the shirts to the change Dennis received to find out how much money he had initially. The cost of the shirts is $27, so:

$27 (cost of shirts) + $23 (...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Dennis bought shirts worth $27.
   * He received 2 $10 bills and $3 in loose coins as change.

2. Calculate the total amount of change Dennis received:
   * Change = (2 × $10) + $3
   * Change = $20 + $3
   * Change = $23

3. To find out how much money Dennis had initially, we need to add the cost of the shirts and the change he received:
   * Initial amount = Co...
