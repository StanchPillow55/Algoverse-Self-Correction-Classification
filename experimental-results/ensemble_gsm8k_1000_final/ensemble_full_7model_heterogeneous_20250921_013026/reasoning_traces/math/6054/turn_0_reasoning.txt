=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many fish the twentieth fisherman caught, given the total number of fish caught by all fishermen and the number of fish caught by the first 19 fishermen.

1. **Identify the total number of fish caught**: 
   The problem states that the total number of fish caught by all 20 fishermen is 10,000 fish.

2. **Calculate the total number of fish caught by the first 19 fishermen**:
   Each of the 19 fishermen caught 400 fish. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of fish caught by these 19 fishermen as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total fish caught by 19 fishermen} = 19 \times 400
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   19 \times 400 = 7600
   \]

   So, the first 19 fishermen caught a total of 7600 fish.

3. **Determine the number of fish caught by the twentieth fisherman**:
   To find out how many fish the twentieth fisherman caught, we subtract the total number of fish caught by the first 19 fishermen from the overall total:

   \[
   \text{Fish caught by the 20th fisherman} = \text{Total fish} - \text{Fish caught by 19 fishermen}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Fish caught by the 20th fisherman} = 10000 - 7600
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   10000 - 7600 = 2400
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the number of fish caught by the twentieth fisherman is 

   \[
   \boxed{2400}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There were 20 fishermen in the lake.
- They caught a total of 10,000 fish.
- 19 of the fishermen caught 400 fish each with their own net.

To find the number of fish the twentieth fisherman caught, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of fish caught by the 19 fishermen.
Number of fish caught by each of the 19 fishermen = 400
Total number of fish caugh...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many fish the twentieth fisherman caught, given that the total number of fish caught by all 20 fishermen is 10,000 and 19 of them each caught 400 fish.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of fish caught by the 19 fishermen:**

   Each of the 19 fishermen caught 400 fish. Therefore, the total number of fish caught by these 19 fishermen is calculated by multiplying the number of fisher...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total number of fish that the 19 fishermen caught. 

Since each of the 19 fishermen caught 400 fish, we multiply the number of fishermen by the number of fish each fisherman caught:

19 fishermen * 400 fish/fisherman = 7600 fish

Next, we subtract the total number of fish caught by the 19 fishermen from the total number of fish caught by all 20 fishermen to find out how many fish the twentieth fisherman caught.

The total number of fish cau...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There are 20 fishermen in total.
- They caught a total of 10,000 fish.
- 19 fishermen caught 400 fish each.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of fish caught by the 19 fishermen.
Number of fish caught by 19 fishermen = 19 Ã— 400
Number of fish caught by 19 fishermen = 7,600

Step 2: Calculate the number of fish caught by the twentieth fisherman.
Let's call the number of fish caught b...
