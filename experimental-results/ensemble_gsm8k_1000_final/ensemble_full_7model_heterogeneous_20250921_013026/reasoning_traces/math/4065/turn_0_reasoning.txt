=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total points of Max, Dulce, and Val, and then compare that total to the points of their opponents' team.

1. **Identify the points of each team member:**
   - Max has 5 points.
   - Dulce has 3 points.

2. **Calculate the combined points of Max and Dulce:**
   \[
   \text{Combined points of Max and Dulce} = \text{Max's points} + \text{Dulce's points} = 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ points}
   \]

3. **Determine Val's points:**
   - Val has twice the combined points of Max and Dulce.
   \[
   \text{Val's points} = 2 \times \text{Combined points of Max and Dulce} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ points}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total points of Max, Dulce, and Val:**
   \[
   \text{Total points of the team} = \text{Max's points} + \text{Dulce's points} + \text{Val's points} = 5 + 3 + 16 = 24 \text{ points}
   \]

5. **Identify the points of the opponents' team:**
   - The opponents' team has a total of 40 points.

6. **Determine how many points their team is behind:**
   \[
   \text{Points behind} = \text{Opponents' points} - \text{Team's points} = 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ points}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that their team is **16 points behind**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Max has 5 points.
- Dulce has 3 points.
- Val has twice the combined points of Max and Dulce.
- The opponents' team has a total of 40 points.

Step 1: Calculate the combined points of Max and Dulce.
Max's points + Dulce's points = 5 + 3 = 8 points

Step 2: Calculate Val's points.
Val's points = 2 × (Max's points + Dulce's points)
Val's points = 2 × 8 = 16 points

Step 3: Calculate...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total points for Max, Dulce, and Val's team and compare it to their opponents' team, which has 40 points.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the points for Max and Dulce:**
   - Max has 5 points.
   - Dulce has 3 points.

2. **Calculate the combined points of Max and Dulce:**

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many points Val has. Val has twice the combined points of Max and Dulce. Max has 5 points and Dulce has 3 points, so together they have 5 + 3 = 8 points.

Since Val has twice their combined points, Val has 2 * 8 = 16 points.

Now, we need to find out how many points their team has in total. Their team consists of Max, Dulce, and Val, so their total points are 5 (Max's points) + 3 (Dulce's points) + 16 (Val's points) = 24 points.

Finally, we...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Max has 5 points
   * Dulce has 3 points
   * Val has twice the combined points of Max and Dulce
   * Their opponents' team has a total of 40 points

2. Calculate the combined points of Max and Dulce:
   * Max's points + Dulce's points = 5 + 3 = 8 points

3. Calculate Val's points:
   * Val's points = 2 × (Max's points + Dulce's points)
   * Val's points = 2 × 8 ...
