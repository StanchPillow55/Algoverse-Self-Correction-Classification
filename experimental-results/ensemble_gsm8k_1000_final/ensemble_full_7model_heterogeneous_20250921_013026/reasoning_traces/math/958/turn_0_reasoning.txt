=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify Djibo's current age**: 
   - Djibo is currently 17 years old.

2. **Determine Djibo's age five years ago**:
   - Five years ago, Djibo's age would have been:
     \[
     17 - 5 = 12 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Let \( S \) represent Djibo's sister's age five years ago**:
   - We know that five years ago, the sum of Djibo's age and his sister's age was 35. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     12 + S = 35
     \]

4. **Solve for \( S \)**:
   - To find \( S \), we can rearrange the equation:
     \[
     S = 35 - 12
     \]
     \[
     S = 23
     \]
   - This means Djibo's sister was 23 years old five years ago.

5. **Determine Djibo's sister's current age**:
   - Since five years have passed since then, we need to add 5 years to her age five years ago:
     \[
     \text{Sister's current age} = 23 + 5 = 28
     \]

6. **Final answer**:
   - Djibo's sister is currently **28 years old**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{28}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Djibo's sister today.

Given information:
- Djibo is 17 years old now.
- Five years ago, the sum of Djibo's age and his sister's age was 35.

Step 1: Find Djibo's age five years ago.
Djibo's age now - 5 years = Djibo's age five years ago
17 years - 5 years = 12 years

Step 2: Find the sum of Djibo's age and his sister's age five years ago.
Sum of Djibo's age and his sister's age = 35
Djibo's age five y...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine Djibo's sister's current age based on the information given.

1. **Understand the problem:**
   - Djibo is currently 17 years old.
   - Five years ago, Djibo's age plus his sister's age was 35.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - Let's denote Djibo's sister's current age as \( S \).

3. **Determine Djibo's age five years ago:**
   - Djibo is currently 17 years old, so five years ago, he was:
     \[
     17 - 5 = 12 \text{ years...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Five years ago, Djibo was 17 - 5 = 12 years old.

At that time, the sum of Djibo's age and his sister's age was 35. 

So, his sister's age five years ago was 35 - 12 = 23 years old.

Therefore, Djibo's sister today is 23 + 5 = 28 years old.

So, Djibo's sister is 28 years old today.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find Djibo's sister's age today, given the information about their ages five years ago.

Given:
- Djibo is currently 17 years old.
- Five years ago, the sum of Djibo's age and his sister's age was 35.

Step 1: Determine Djibo's age five years ago.
Djibo's current age = 17 years
Five years ago, Djibo's age = 17 - 5 = 12 years

Step 2: Let's express his sister's age five years ago in terms of a v...
