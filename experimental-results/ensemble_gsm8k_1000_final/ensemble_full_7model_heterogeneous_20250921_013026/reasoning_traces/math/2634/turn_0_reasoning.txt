=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Peter can save by buying math textbooks from outside bookshops instead of the school bookshop, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the price of one textbook in the school bookshop.**
   - The price of one textbook in the school bookshop is given as $45.

2. **Calculate the price of one textbook in outside bookshops.**
   - The textbooks sold in outside bookshops cost 20% less than the price in the school bookshop.
   - First, we need to calculate 20% of $45:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 45 = 0.20 \times 45 = 9
     \]
   - Now, we subtract this amount from the original price to find the price in outside bookshops:
     \[
     \text{Price in outside bookshops} = 45 - 9 = 36
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of buying 3 textbooks from the school bookshop.**
   - The total cost for 3 textbooks at the school bookshop is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost from school} = 3 \times 45 = 135
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of buying 3 textbooks from outside bookshops.**
   - The total cost for 3 textbooks at outside bookshops is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost from outside} = 3 \times 36 = 108
     \]

5. **Calculate the savings by buying from outside bookshops.**
   - To find the savings, we subtract the total cost from outside bookshops from the total cost from the school bookshop:
     \[
     \text{Savings} = \text{Total cost from school} - \text{Total cost from outside}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Savings} = 135 - 108 = 27
     \]

Thus, Peter can save **$27** by buying the textbooks from outside bookshops rather than from the school bookshop.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the difference in price between the math textbooks sold in the school bookshop and the ones sold in other bookshops, and then calculate the total savings for buying 3 textbooks from the other bookshops.

Given information:
- The price of a math textbook in the school bookshop is $45.
- The math textbooks sold in other bookshops cost 20% less than the ones sold in the school bookshop.
- Peter wants to buy 3 math t...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the math textbooks both at the school bookshop and at other bookshops, and then calculate the savings Peter would make by purchasing from the other bookshops.

### Step 1: Determine the cost of one textbook at other bookshops

The price of a math textbook at the school bookshop is $45. We are told that textbooks sold in bookshops outside the school cost 20% less. To find the price of a textbook at these other booksh...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The first step is to find out how much a math textbook costs in bookshops outside the school. Since these bookshops sell the textbooks for 20% less than the school bookshop, we need to calculate 20% of $45. 

20% of $45 can be calculated as follows:
20/100 * $45 = $9

So, each textbook in the outside bookshops costs $9 less than in the school bookshop. Therefore, the price of each textbook in the outside bookshops is $45 - $9 = $36.

Peter wants to buy 3 textbooks. If he ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The price of a math textbook in the school bookshop is $45.
   * Textbooks sold in bookshops outside the school cost 20% less.
   * Peter wants to buy 3 math textbooks.

2. Calculate the price of a math textbook in bookshops outside the school:
   * The price is 20% less than the school bookshop price.
   * To calculate the price, we first find 20% of $45 and the...
