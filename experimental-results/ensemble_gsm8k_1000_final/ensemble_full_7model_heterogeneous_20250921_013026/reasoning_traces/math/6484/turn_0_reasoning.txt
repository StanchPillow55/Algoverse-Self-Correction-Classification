=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will define the ages of Gabriel and Frank using algebra.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( F \) represent Frank's age.
   - Since Gabriel is 3 years younger than Frank, we can express Gabriel's age as \( G = F - 3 \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem, the total of their ages is 17. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   F + G = 17
   \]
   Substituting \( G \) with \( F - 3 \):
   \[
   F + (F - 3) = 17
   \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
   \[
   2F - 3 = 17
   \]

4. **Solve for \( F \):**
   - Add 3 to both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2F = 17 + 3
   \]
   \[
   2F = 20
   \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   F = \frac{20}{2}
   \]
   \[
   F = 10
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Frank's age is \( 10 \) years.

To verify, we can calculate Gabriel's age:
- Gabriel's age \( G = F - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \).
- Now, check the total:
\[
F + G = 10 + 7 = 17
\]
This confirms that our solution is correct.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Frank's age is } 10 \text{ years.}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Gabriel is 3 years younger than Frank.
- The current total of their ages is 17.

Let's represent Frank's age as x.

Since Gabriel is 3 years younger than Frank, we can represent Gabriel's age as (x - 3).

The total of their ages is 17, so we can write the equation:
x + (x - 3) = 17

Simplifying the equation:
2x - 3 = 17
2x = 20
x = 10

Therefore, Frank's age is 10 years old.

Final answer:
Fra...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and then solve for Frank's age.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( F \) represent Frank's current age.
- Since Gabriel is 3 years younger than Frank, Gabriel's age can be represented as \( F - 3 \).

According to the problem, the total of their ages is 17. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
F + (F - 3) = 17
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
F + F - 3 = 17
\]

Combine like terms:

\[

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote Frank's age as F. 

According to the problem, Gabriel is 3 years younger than Frank, so we can denote Gabriel's age as F - 3.

The problem also states that the total of their ages is 17, so we can set up the following equation:

F + (F - 3) = 17

This simplifies to:

2F - 3 = 17

Next, we add 3 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with F:

2F = 20

Finally, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for F:

F = 20 / 2

F = 10

So, Frank i...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find Frank's age, given that Gabriel is 3 years younger than Frank, and the sum of their current ages is 17.

Given:
- Gabriel is 3 years younger than Frank.
- The current total of their ages is 17.

Step 1: Let's express Gabriel's age in terms of Frank's age.
Gabriel's age = Frank's age - 3

Step 2: Express the total of their ages using the given information.
Total of their ages = Frank's age ...
