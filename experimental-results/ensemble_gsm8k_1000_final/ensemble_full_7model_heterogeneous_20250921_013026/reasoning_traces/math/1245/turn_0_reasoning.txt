=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of watermelons Alice had initially.**
   - Alice had 10 dozens of watermelons. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Total watermelons} = 10 \times 12 = 120
     \]

2. **Determine how many watermelons Alice sold yesterday.**
   - Alice sold 40% of her total watermelons yesterday. We calculate 40% of 120:
     \[
     \text{Watermelons sold yesterday} = 0.40 \times 120 = 48
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of watermelons remaining after yesterday's sale.**
   - We subtract the number of watermelons sold yesterday from the total:
     \[
     \text{Remaining watermelons} = 120 - 48 = 72
     \]

4. **Determine how many watermelons Alice sold today.**
   - Alice sold 1/4 of the remaining watermelons today. We calculate 1/4 of 72:
     \[
     \text{Watermelons sold today} = \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of watermelons left after today's sale.**
   - We subtract the number of watermelons sold today from the remaining watermelons:
     \[
     \text{Remaining watermelons} = 72 - 18 = 54
     \]

6. **State the final answer.**
   - The number of watermelons left to be sold tomorrow is:
     \[
     \boxed{54}
     \] 

Thus, Alice has 54 watermelons left to be sold tomorrow.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Alice had 10 dozens of watermelons.
- She sold 40% of it yesterday.
- She sold 1/4 of the remaining today.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of watermelons Alice had initially.
1 dozen = 12 watermelons
10 dozens = 10 × 12 = 120 watermelons

Step 2: Calculate the number of watermelons sold yesterday.
40% of 120 watermelons = 0.40 × 120 = 48 watermelons sold yesterday

Step 3: Calculate the nu...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many watermelons Alice has left to sell after selling some on two different days. Let's go through the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of watermelons Alice initially had:**

   Alice had 10 dozens of watermelons. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we calculate the total number of watermelons as follows:

   \[
   10 \text{ dozens} \times 12 \text{ watermelons/dozen} = 120 \text{ watermelons}
   \]

2. **Determi...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Alice had 10 dozens of watermelons. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, then Alice had 10 * 12 = 120 watermelons.

Yesterday, she sold 40% of her watermelons. To find out how many watermelons she sold, we need to calculate 40% of 120. We can do this by multiplying 120 by 0.40 (which is the decimal equivalent of 40%). 

120 * 0.40 = 48 watermelons

So, Alice sold 48 watermelons yesterday. To find out how many watermelons she had left after selling yesterday, we subtract the numb...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step, showing all the calculations and explaining the reasoning.

Given:
- Alice had 10 dozens of watermelons.
- She sold 40% of the watermelons yesterday.
- Today, she sold 1/4 of the remaining watermelons.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of watermelons Alice had initially.
10 dozens = 10 × 12 = 120 watermelons

Step 2: Calculate the number of watermelons sold yesterday.
40% of 120 watermelons = 0.4 × 120 = 4...
