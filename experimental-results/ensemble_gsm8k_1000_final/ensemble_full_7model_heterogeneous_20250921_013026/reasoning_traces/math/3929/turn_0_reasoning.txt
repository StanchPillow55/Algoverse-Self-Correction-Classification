=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of egg rolls eaten by Matthew, Patrick, and Alvin based on the information given.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( M \) be the number of egg rolls Matthew eats.
   - Let \( P \) be the number of egg rolls Patrick eats.
   - Let \( A \) be the number of egg rolls Alvin eats.

2. **Given information:**
   - Alvin ate 4 egg rolls: \( A = 4 \).
   - Matthew eats three times as many egg rolls as Patrick: \( M = 3P \).
   - Patrick eats half as many egg rolls as Alvin: \( P = \frac{1}{2}A \).

3. **Substituting the value of \( A \):**
   Since we know \( A = 4 \), we can find \( P \):
   \[
   P = \frac{1}{2}A = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2.
   \]

4. **Finding \( M \):**
   Now that we have \( P = 2 \), we can find \( M \):
   \[
   M = 3P = 3 \times 2 = 6.
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the number of egg rolls Matthew ate is \( \boxed{6} \).

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of egg rolls eaten by Matthew, Patrick, and Alvin based on the information given.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( M \) be the number of egg rolls Matthew eats.
   - Let \( P \) be the number of egg rolls Patrick eats.
   - Let \( A \) be the number of egg rolls Alvin eats.

   - Matthew eats three times as man...

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Matthew eats three times as many egg rolls as Patrick eats.
- Patrick eats half as many egg rolls as Alvin eats.
- Alvin ate 4 egg rolls.

Step 1: Find how many egg rolls Patrick ate.
Since Patrick eats half as many egg rolls as Alvin, we can use the following equation:
Patrick's egg rolls = Alvin's egg rolls / 2
Patrick's egg rolls = 4 / 2 = 2 egg rolls

Step 2: Find how many egg rolls M...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many egg rolls Matthew ate based on the relationships given between the number of egg rolls eaten by Matthew, Patrick, and Alvin.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Alvin ate 4 egg rolls.
   - Patrick eats half as many egg rolls as Alvin.

2. **Calculate how many egg rolls Patrick ate:**
   - Since Patrick eats half as many egg rolls as Alvin, we can calculate the number...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241210): ANTHROPIC_API_ERROR: Error code: 404 - {'type': 'error', 'error': {'type': 'not_found_error', 'message': 'model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241210'}, 'request_id': 'req_011CTMhebDYMd3yJJjg1Eny8'}

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out how many egg rolls Patrick ate. Since Patrick eats half as many egg rolls as Alvin eats, and Alvin ate 4 egg rolls, Patrick ate 4/2 = 2 egg rolls.

Now, let's figure out how many egg rolls Matthew ate. Since Matthew eats three times as many egg rolls as Patrick eats, and Patrick ate 2 egg rolls, Matthew ate 3*2 = <<3*2=6>>6 egg rolls.

So, Matthew ate 6 egg rolls.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to determine how many egg rolls Matthew ate.

Given:
- Matthew eats three times as many egg rolls as Patrick.
- Patrick eats half as many egg rolls as Alvin.
- Alvin ate 4 egg rolls.

Step 1: Determine the number of egg rolls Patrick ate.
- Patrick eats half as many egg rolls as Alvin.
- Alvin ate 4 egg rolls.
So, Patrick ate half of 4 egg rolls.

Patrick's egg rolls = 1/2 Ã— A...
