Final Answer: To determine the total amount of money the company pays in total per month after hiring 200 more employees, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of employees after the new hires.**
   - Initially, the company has 500 employees.
   - They hire 200 more employees.
   - Total employees after hiring = 500 + 200 = 700 employees.

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by each employee per month.**
   - Each employee works 10 hours a day.
   - They work 5 days a week.
   - They work 4 weeks a month.
   - Total hours worked by each employee in a month = 10 hours/day × 5 days/week × 4 weeks/month.
   \[
   \text{Total hours per employee} = 10 \times 5 \times 4 = 200 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total monthly pay for one employee.**
   - Each employee is paid $12 per hour.
   - Total pay for one employee per month = $12/hour × 200 hours/month.
   \[
   \text{Total pay per employee} = 12 \times 200 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total monthly pay for all employees.**
   - Now, we have 700 employees.
   - Total monthly pay for all employees = Total pay per employee × Total number of employees.
   \[
   \text{Total monthly pay} = 2400 \times 700
   \]

5. **Perform the multiplication to find the total monthly pay.**
   \[
   2400 \times 700 = 1680000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays in total per month after the new hires is **$1,680,000**.

Final answer: **$1,680,000**.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much the company pays its original 500 employees per month.

Each employee is paid $12 per hour and works 10 hours a day, so each employee earns $12 * 10 = $<<12*10=120>>120 per day.

Since they work five days a week, each employee earns $120 * 5 = $<<120*5=600>>600 per week.

Since they work four weeks a month, each employee earns $600 * 4 = $<<600*4=2400>>2400 per month.

So, for 500 employees, the company pays $2400 * 500 = $<<2400*500=120000...
