=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many games Percy needs to sell to reach his goal of saving up for a new PlayStation that costs $500, we can break the problem down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount Percy already has.

Percy receives:
- $200 on his birthday
- $150 at Christmas

Now, we add these amounts together:

\[
\text{Total amount from gifts} = 200 + 150 = 350
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much more money Percy needs.

Next, we need to find out how much more money Percy needs to reach the total cost of the PlayStation, which is $500. We can do this by subtracting the amount he already has from the total cost:

\[
\text{Amount needed} = \text{Cost of PlayStation} - \text{Total amount from gifts}
\]
\[
\text{Amount needed} = 500 - 350 = 150
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many games Percy needs to sell.

Percy plans to sell his old PlayStation games for $7.5 each. To find out how many games he needs to sell to make up the remaining $150, we divide the amount needed by the price per game:

\[
\text{Number of games to sell} = \frac{\text{Amount needed}}{\text{Price per game}} = \frac{150}{7.5}
\]

Now, we perform the division:

\[
\frac{150}{7.5} = 20
\]

### Final Answer

Percy needs to sell **20 games** to reach his goal of saving up for the new PlayStation.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The new PlayStation costs $500.
- Percy gets $200 on his birthday and $150 at Christmas.
- He will sell his old PlayStation games for $7.5 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Percy has from his birthday and Christmas.
Birthday money: $200
Christmas money: $150
Total money from birthday and Christmas: $200 + $150 = $350

Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount of money Percy ...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many games Percy needs to sell to reach his goal of $500 for a new PlayStation. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total amount Percy already has:**

   Percy receives $200 on his birthday and $150 at Christmas. To find out how much he already has, we add these two amounts together:

   \[
   200 + 150 = 350
   \]

   So, Percy already has $350.

2. **Calculate the remaining amount Percy needs:**...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to figure out how much money Percy already has. He gets $200 on his birthday and $150 at Christmas, so we add these two amounts together:

$200 + $150 = $350

Next, we need to figure out how much more money Percy needs to reach his goal of $500. To do this, we subtract the amount of money he already has from his goal:

$500 - $350 = $150

Now we know that Percy needs to make $150 by selling his old PlayStation games. Each game sells for $7.5, so we divide t...
