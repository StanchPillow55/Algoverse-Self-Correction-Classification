=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how old Lydia will be when she can eat an apple from the tree she planted.

1. **Determine the age when Lydia planted the tree**: 
   Lydia was 4 years old when she planted the tree.

2. **Determine the time it takes for the tree to bear fruit**: 
   According to the problem, it takes 7 years for the apple tree to bear fruit.

3. **Calculate the age of the tree when it bears fruit**: 
   Since Lydia planted the tree when she was 4 years old, we add the 7 years it takes for the tree to bear fruit to her age at planting:
   \[
   \text{Age when tree bears fruit} = \text{Age at planting} + \text{Years to bear fruit}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Age when tree bears fruit} = 4 + 7 = 11
   \]

4. **Determine Lydia's age when she can eat the apples**: 
   Since the tree will bear fruit when Lydia is 11 years old, that is the age at which she will be able to eat an apple from her tree for the first time.

Thus, Lydia will be **11 years old** when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time.

Final answer: **11 years old**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- It takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit.
- Lydia planted the tree when she was 4 years old.
- Lydia is now 9 years old.

To find out how old Lydia will be when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time, we need to calculate the number of years it will take for the tree to bear fruit.

Step 1: Calculate the number of years since Lydia planted the tree.
Number of ye...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more years it will take for Lydia's apple tree to bear fruit, given the information about when she planted the tree and her current age.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine when Lydia planted the tree:**
   - Lydia planted the tree when she was 4 years old.

2. **Determine Lydia's current age:**
   - Lydia is currently 9 years old.

3. **Calculate how many years have passed since Lydia planted t...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Lydia planted the apple tree when she was 4 years old. It takes 7 years for the tree to bear fruit. 

To find out when Lydia will be able to eat an apple from her tree, we need to add the number of years it takes for the tree to bear fruit to the age Lydia was when she planted the tree.

So, we add 4 years (Lydia's age when she planted the tree) to 7 years (the time it takes for the tree to bear fruit):

4 years + 7 years = 11 years

So, Lydia will be 11 years old when sh...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to calculate Lydia's age when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time.

Given:
- It takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit.
- Lydia planted the tree when she was 4 years old.
- Lydia is now 9 years old.

Step 1: Determine how many years have passed since Lydia planted the tree.
Years passed = Lydia's current age - Lydia's age when she planted the tree
