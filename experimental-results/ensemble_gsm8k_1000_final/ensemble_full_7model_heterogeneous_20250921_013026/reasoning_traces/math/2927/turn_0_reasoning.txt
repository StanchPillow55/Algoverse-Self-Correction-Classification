=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many more dollars per month the shoe company needs to make in order to reach their goal of $60,000 in a year, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount they currently make in a year:**
   The company sells $4,000 worth of shoes every month. To find out how much they make in a year, we multiply the monthly sales by the number of months in a year (12 months):

   \[
   \text{Total annual sales} = \text{Monthly sales} \times \text{Number of months}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total annual sales} = 4000 \times 12 = 48000
   \]

   So, the company currently makes $48,000 in a year.

2. **Determine the difference between the target and current annual sales:**
   The company wants to make $60,000 in a year. We need to find out how much more they need to make:

   \[
   \text{Additional amount needed} = \text{Target annual sales} - \text{Current annual sales}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Additional amount needed} = 60000 - 48000 = 12000
   \]

   Therefore, the company needs an additional $12,000 to reach their goal.

3. **Calculate the additional monthly sales required:**
   To find out how much more they need to make per month, we divide the additional amount needed by the number of months in a year:

   \[
   \text{Additional monthly sales} = \frac{\text{Additional amount needed}}{\text{Number of months}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Additional monthly sales} = \frac{12000}{12} = 1000
   \]

   Thus, the company needs to make an additional $1,000 per month.

4. **Final answer:**
   The shoe company should make **$1,000 more per month** selling shoes to reach their goal of $60,000 in a year.

Final answer: **$1,000** more per month.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how much the shoe company makes in a year with their current sales. 

They sell $4000 worth of shoes every month, and there are 12 months in a year. So, their annual sales would be:

$4000/month * 12 months/year = $48000/year

The company wants to make $60000 in a year, but they currently make $48000. So, the additional amount they need to make in a year is:

$60000/year - $48000/year = $12000/year

But the question asks how much more they need to ma...
