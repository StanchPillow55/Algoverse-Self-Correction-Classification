=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time spent cooking and watching the movies step by step.

1. **Calculate the length of the first movie:**
   - The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
   - In minutes, this is:
     \[
     1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     1 \text{ hour and } 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the length of the second movie:**
   - The second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first movie.
   - Therefore, the length of the second movie is:
     \[
     90 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent watching both movies:**
   - Total time for both movies is:
     \[
     90 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} = 210 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Calculate the time spent making popcorn:**
   - They spent 10 minutes making popcorn.

5. **Calculate the time spent making fries:**
   - They spent twice as long making fries as they did making popcorn.
   - Therefore, the time spent making fries is:
     \[
     2 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total cooking time:**
   - Total cooking time (popcorn + fries) is:
     \[
     10 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

7. **Calculate the total time spent cooking and watching the movies:**
   - Total time is:
     \[
     210 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
     \]

8. **Convert total time from minutes to hours:**
   - To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
     \[
     240 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, the total time it took Joseph and his friends to cook and watch the movies is **4 hours**.

\boxed{4}

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total time it took for Joseph and his friends to cook and watch the two movies.

Given information:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
- The second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first movie.
- They spent 10 minutes making popcorn.
- They spent twice as long making fries as they did making popcorn.

Step 1: Calculate the duration of the second movie.
Duration of the second movie = Duration ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Joseph and his friends spent cooking and watching the movies. We will break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each part step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the duration of each movie

1. **First Movie:**
   - The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
   - In minutes, this is: \(1 \text{ hour} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ minutes}\).

2. **Second Movie...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how long the second movie is. We know that the first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, and the second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first. 

1 hour and 30 minutes = 90 minutes

90 minutes + 30 minutes = 120 minutes

So, the second movie is 120 minutes long, which is equivalent to 2 hours.

Next, we need to find out how long they spent cooking. We know that they spent 10 minutes making popcorn and twice as long making fries.

10 minutes ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
- The second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first movie.
- They spent 10 minutes making popcorn.
- They spent twice as long making fries as they did making popcorn.

Step 1: Convert the length of the first movie from hours and minutes to minutes.
1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the l...
