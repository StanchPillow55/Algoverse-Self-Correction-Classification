Final Answer: To find out how much money Shelly has in total, we need to calculate the amount of money she has from both the $10 bills and the $5 bills.

1. **Calculate the number of $5 bills:**
   - Shelly has four fewer $5 bills than $10 bills.
   - She has 10 $10 bills.
   - Therefore, the number of $5 bills is:
     \[
     10 - 4 = 6
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount from the $10 bills:**
   - Each $10 bill is worth $10.
   - Shelly has 10 $10 bills, so the total amount from the $10 bills is:
     \[
     10 \times 10 = 100
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount from the $5 bills:**
   - Each $5 bill is worth $5.
   - Shelly has 6 $5 bills, so the total amount from the $5 bills is:
     \[
     6 \times 5 = 30
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of money Shelly has:**
   - Now, we add the total amounts from the $10 bills and the $5 bills:
     \[
     100 + 30 = 130
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Shelly has is **$130**.

Final answer: **$130**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Shelly has 10 $10 bills
- Shelly has 4 fewer $5 bills than $10 bills

Step 1: Calculate the number of $5 bills Shelly has.
Number of $10 bills = 10
Number of $5 bills = 10 - 4 = 6

Step 2: Calculate the total value of the $10 bills.
Value of $10 bills = 10 × $10 = $100

Step 3: Calculate the total value of the $5 bills.
Value of $5 bills = 6 × $5 = $30

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of mo...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Shelly has in total from her $10 bills and $5 bills.

**Step 1: Determine the number of $5 bills Shelly has.**

Shelly has ten $10 bills. The problem states that she has four fewer $5 bills than $10 bills. 

- Number of $10 bills = 10
- Number of $5 bills = Number of $10 bills - 4

So, the number of $5 bills Shelly has is:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money from the $10 bills.**

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Shelly has ten $10 bills. Since each bill is worth $10, we can calculate the total amount of these bills by multiplying the number of bills by the value of each bill. 

10 bills * $10/bill = $100

Shelly also has four fewer $5 bills than $10 bills. Since she has 10 $10 bills, this means she has 10 - 4 = 6 $5 bills.

We can calculate the total amount of these $5 bills by multiplying the number of bills by the value of each bill.

6 bills * $5/bill = $30

To find the total ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the final answer.

Given:
- Shelly has ten $10 bills.
- Shelly has four fewer $5 bills than $10 bills.

Step 1: Calculate the number of $5 bills Shelly has.
Shelly has 4 fewer $5 bills than $10 bills.
Number of $5 bills = Number of $10 bills - 4
Number of $5 bills = 10 - 4 = 6
