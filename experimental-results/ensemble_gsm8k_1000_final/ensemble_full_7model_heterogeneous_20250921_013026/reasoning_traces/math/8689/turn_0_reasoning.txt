=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will go through it step by step, calculating the number of passengers on the bus at each stage and determining how many more passengers are needed to fill the bus to its capacity.

1. **Initial number of passengers**: The bus starts with 20 people.

   \[
   \text{Initial passengers} = 20
   \]

2. **First stop**: At the first stop, 40 people enter the bus.

   \[
   \text{Passengers after first stop} = \text{Initial passengers} + \text{People who entered}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Passengers after first stop} = 20 + 40 = 60
   \]

3. **Second stop**: At the second stop, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first stop (which is 40) enter the bus.

   \[
   \text{People who entered at second stop} = \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Passengers after second stop} = \text{Passengers after first stop} + \text{People who entered at second stop}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Passengers after second stop} = 60 + 30 = 90
   \]

4. **Third stop**: At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubles.

   \[
   \text{Passengers after third stop} = 2 \times \text{Passengers after second stop}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Passengers after third stop} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

5. **Bus capacity**: The bus has a total capacity of 200 people.

6. **Remaining spaces**: To find out how many more people are needed to fill the bus, we subtract the current number of passengers from the bus capacity.

   \[
   \text{Remaining spaces} = \text{Bus capacity} - \text{Passengers after third stop}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining spaces} = 200 - 180 = 20
   \]

Thus, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The bus has a capacity of 200 people.
- When the bus departed Chengli city, it had 20 people.
- On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus.
- On the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus.
- The number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people on the bus after...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to track the number of passengers on the bus at each stage and calculate how many more people are needed to fill the bus to its capacity.

1. **Initial Passengers:**
   - The bus starts with 20 people.

2. **First Stop:**
   - 40 people enter the bus.
   - New total = Initial passengers + Passengers entering at first stop
   - New total = 20 + 40 = 60 people

3. **Second Stop:**
   - 3/4 of the number of people who entered at the first stop...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The bus had 20 people when it departed Chengli city. 

On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. The total number of people in the bus became 20 people + 40 people = 60 people.

On the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. This is 3/4 * 40 people = 30 people.

The total number of people in the bus after the second station is 60 people + 30 people = 90 people.

At the third station, the number of pas...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The bus capacity is 200 people.
   * When it left Chengli city, there were 20 people on the bus.
   * At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus.
   * At the second stop, 3/4 of the number of people who entered at the first stop also entered the bus.
   * At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled.

2. Calculate the number of people who entered...
