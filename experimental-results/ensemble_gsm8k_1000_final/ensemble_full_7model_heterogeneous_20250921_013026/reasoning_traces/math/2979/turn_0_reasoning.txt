=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's denote the number of guitars that Steve has as \( S \).

According to the problem:

1. Barbeck has two times as many guitars as Steve, so we can express the number of guitars Barbeck has as:
   \[
   B = 2S
   \]

2. Davey has three times as many guitars as Barbeck, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   D = 3B
   \]

3. We know that the total number of guitars is 27. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   S + B + D = 27
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( B \) and \( D \) in terms of \( S \) into the total equation.

Substituting \( B = 2S \) into the equation for \( D \):
\[
D = 3B = 3(2S) = 6S
\]

Now we can substitute both \( B \) and \( D \) into the total equation:
\[
S + B + D = S + 2S + 6S = 27
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
S + 2S + 6S = 9S
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
9S = 27
\]

Now, we can solve for \( S \):
\[
S = \frac{27}{9} = 3
\]

Now that we have \( S \), we can find \( B \) and \( D \):

1. Calculate \( B \):
   \[
   B = 2S = 2 \times 3 = 6
   \]

2. Calculate \( D \):
   \[
   D = 3B = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

Finally, we can conclude that the number of guitars Davey has is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): Let's denote the number of guitars that Steve has as \( S \).

According to the problem:

1. Barbeck has two times as many guitars as Steve, so we can express the number of guitars Barbeck has as:
   \[
   B = 2S
   \]

2. Davey has three times as many guitars as Barbeck, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   D = 3B
   \]

3. We know that the total number of guitars is 27. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   S + B + D = 27
   \]

Now, we can substitute the ...

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Barbeck has two times as many guitars as Steve.
- Davey has three times as many guitars as Barbeck.
- There are 27 guitars altogether.

Let's start by assigning variables to represent the number of guitars each person has:
- Let x = the number of guitars Steve has.
- Then Barbeck has 2x guitars.
- And Davey has 3(2x) = 6x guitars.

Now, we know the total number of guitars is 27, so we can...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and then solve for the number of guitars each person has.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) represent the number of guitars Steve has.
- Since Barbeck has two times as many guitars as Steve, Barbeck has \( 2S \) guitars.
- Davey has three times as many guitars as Barbeck, so Davey has \( 3 \times 2S = 6S \) guitars.

According to the problem, the total number of guitars is 27. Ther...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of guitars Steve has as S, the number of guitars Barbeck has as B, and the number of guitars Davey has as D.

According to the problem, we have two equations:

1) B = 2S (Barbeck has two times as many guitars as Steve)
2) D = 3B (Davey has three times as many guitars as Barbeck)

We also know that the total number of guitars is 27, so we have a third equation:

3) S + B + D = 27

We can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find out how many guitars Davey has, given the total number of guitars and the relative number of guitars each person has.

Given:
- Barbeck has two times as many guitars as Steve.
- Davey has three times as many guitars as Barbeck.
- There are 27 guitars in total.

Step 1: Let's express the number of guitars each person has in terms of Steve's guitars.
Steve's guitars = x
Barbeck's guitars = 2...
