=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many books are in the library now, we will break down the problem step by step, taking into account the changes in the number of books over the years.

1. **Books Five Years Ago**:
   - Five years ago, the library had 500 old books.

2. **Books Two Years Ago**:
   - Two years ago, the librarian bought 300 books. 
   - Therefore, the total number of books two years ago was:
     \[
     500 \text{ (old books)} + 300 \text{ (new books)} = 800 \text{ books}
     \]

3. **Books Last Year**:
   - Last year, the librarian bought 100 more books than she had bought the previous year (which was 300 books).
   - Thus, last year, she bought:
     \[
     300 + 100 = 400 \text{ books}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of books last year was:
     \[
     800 \text{ (books two years ago)} + 400 \text{ (new books)} = 1200 \text{ books}
     \]

4. **Books This Year**:
   - This year, the librarian donated 200 of the library's old books.
   - Therefore, the total number of books this year is:
     \[
     1200 \text{ (books last year)} - 200 \text{ (donated books)} = 1000 \text{ books}
     \]

Now, we can summarize the calculations:
- Five years ago: 500 books
- Two years ago: 800 books (after buying 300)
- Last year: 1200 books (after buying 400)
- This year: 1000 books (after donating 200)

Thus, the total number of books in the library now is:

\[
\boxed{1000}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it.

Given information:
- Five years ago, there were 500 old books in the library.
- Two years ago, the librarian bought 300 books.
- Last year, the librarian bought 100 more books than she had bought the previous year.
- This year, the librarian donated 200 of the library's old books.

Step 1: Calculate the number of books in the library two years ago.
Books in the library five years ago = 50...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to track the number of books in the library over the years, starting from five years ago until the present.

1. **Five years ago:**
   - The library had 500 old books.

2. **Two years ago:**
   - The librarian bought 300 books.
   - Therefore, the total number of books in the library two years ago was:
     \[
     500 \, (\text{initial books}) + 300 \, (\text{books bought}) = 800 \, \text{books}
     \]

3. **Last year:**
   - The libraria...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Five years ago, there were 500 books in the library.

Step 2: Two years ago, the librarian bought 300 books. So, we add these 300 books to the original 500 books. 

500 books + 300 books = 800 books

Step 3: Last year, the librarian bought 100 more books than she had bought the previous year. The previous year, she bought 300 books. So, last year, she bought 300 books + 100 books = 400 books. 

We add these 400 books to ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start with the initial number of books and add or subtract the changes in the library's collection over the years.

Given:
- Five years ago, there were 500 old books in the library.
- Two years ago, the librarian bought 300 books.
- Last year, the librarian bought 100 more books than she had bought the previous year.
- This year, the librarian donated 200 of the library's old books.

Step 1: Determine ...
