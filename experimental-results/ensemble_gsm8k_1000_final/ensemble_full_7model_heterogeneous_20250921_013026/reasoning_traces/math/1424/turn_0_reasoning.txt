=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much more money Christian and Sue need to make in order to buy the $50.00 bottle of perfume, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Christian and Sue currently have.**
2. **Calculate how much money Christian and Sue earn from their respective jobs.**
3. **Add their earnings to their current savings.**
4. **Determine how much more money they need to reach $50.00.**

### Step 1: Calculate Current Savings

- Christian has $5.00.
- Sue has $7.00.

Total current savings:
\[
\text{Total Savings} = \text{Christian's Savings} + \text{Sue's Savings} = 5 + 7 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Earnings from Jobs

**Christian's Earnings:**
- Christian mowed 4 yards and charged $5.00 per yard.
\[
\text{Christian's Earnings} = 4 \text{ yards} \times 5 \text{ dollars/yard} = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Sue's Earnings:**
- Sue walked 6 dogs and charged $2.00 per dog.
\[
\text{Sue's Earnings} = 6 \text{ dogs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dog} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Money After Earnings

Now we will add their earnings to their current savings.

**Total Money After Earnings:**
\[
\text{Total Money} = \text{Total Savings} + \text{Christian's Earnings} + \text{Sue's Earnings}
\]
\[
\text{Total Money} = 12 + 20 + 12 = 44 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Determine How Much More Money is Needed

Now we need to find out how much more money they need to reach the $50.00 goal.

**Amount Needed:**
\[
\text{Amount Needed} = \text{Cost of Perfume} - \text{Total Money}
\]
\[
\text{Amount Needed} = 50 - 44 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Christian and Sue need to make **$6.00** more in order to buy the $50.00 bottle of perfume for their mom.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much money Christian and Sue had initially. Christian had $5.00 and Sue had $7.00. So, they had a total of $5.00 + $7.00 = $<<5+7=12.00>>12.00.

Next, let's calculate how much money Christian made by mowing his neighbors' yards. He mowed 4 yards and charged $5.00 each, so he made 4 * $5.00 = $<<4*5=20.00>>20.00.

Similarly, Sue walked 6 dogs and charged $2.00 per dog, so she made 6 * $2.00 = $<<6*2=12.00>>12.00.

Now, let's add the money they in...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step and solve it:

Given information:
- The perfume costs $50.00
- Christian had $5.00 saved up
- Sue had $7.00 saved up
- Christian mowed 4 yards for $5.00 each
- Sue walked 6 dogs for $2.00 each

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Christian and Sue had saved up.
Christian's savings = $5.00
Sue's savings = $7.00
Total savings = Christian's savings + Sue's savings
Total savings = $5.00 + $7.00 = $12...
