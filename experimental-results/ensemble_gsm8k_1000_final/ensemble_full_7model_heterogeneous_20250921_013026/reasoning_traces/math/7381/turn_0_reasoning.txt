=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationship between Jessica's age and her mother's age based on the information provided.

1. **Understanding the Information Given:**
   - Let \( J \) be Jessica's current age.
   - Let \( M \) be her mother's current age.
   - According to the problem, Jessica was half her mother's age when her mother died.
   - If her mother were alive now, she would be 70 years old in 10 years.

2. **Setting Up the Equations:**
   - If her mother would be 70 years old in 10 years, that means her current age \( M \) is:
     \[
     M + 10 = 70
     \]
     \[
     M = 70 - 10 = 60
     \]
   - So, Jessica's mother is currently 60 years old.

3. **Finding Jessica's Age When Her Mother Died:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of years ago when her mother died. At that time, Jessica's mother's age was \( M - x = 60 - x \).
   - At that same time, Jessica's age was \( J - x \).
   - According to the problem, Jessica was half her mother's age when her mother died:
     \[
     J - x = \frac{1}{2}(60 - x)
     \]

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - We can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     2(J - x) = 60 - x
     \]
     \[
     2J - 2x = 60 - x
     \]
   - Rearranging gives us:
     \[
     2J - 60 = 2x - x
     \]
     \[
     2J - 60 = x
     \]

5. **Substituting Back:**
   - We now have \( x = 2J - 60 \). We can substitute this back into the context of the problem.
   - Since \( x \) is the number of years ago when her mother died, we can express Jessica's age at that time:
     \[
     J - x = J - (2J - 60) = 60 - J
     \]
   - At that time, her mother was \( 60 - x = 60 - (2J - 60) = 120 - 2J \).

6. **Setting Up the Half-Age Condition:**
   - We know that at the time of her mother's death:
     \[
     60 - J = \frac{1}{2}(120 - 2J)
     \]
   - Simplifying the right side:
     \[
     60 - J = 60 - J
     \]
   - This equation is always true, which means we need to find a specific value for \( J \).

7. **Finding Jessica's Current Age:**
   - We know that \( x = 2J - 60 \) must be a non-negative number, as it represents years ago. Therefore:
     \[
     2J - 60 \geq 0
     \]
     \[
     2J \geq 60
     \]
     \[
     J \geq 30
     \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Since we have established that Jessica's mother is currently 60 years old and that Jessica was half her age when her mother died, we can conclude that Jessica is currently 30 years old.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find Jessica's current age based on the given information.

Given information:
- Jessica was half her mother's age when her mother died.
- If Jessica's mother were alive now, ten years later, she would have been 70.

Step 1: Find the age of Jessica's mother when she died.
If Jessica's mother would have been 70 years old ten years from now, then her age when she died was 70 - 10 = 60 years old.

Step 2: Find Jessica's ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine Jessica's current age based on the information given about her and her mother's ages.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - Jessica was half her mother's age when her mother died.
   - If her mother were alive now, ten years later, she would have been 70.

2. **Determine the mother's age at the time of her death:**
   - If her mother would have been 70 now, ten years after he...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote Jessica's mother's age at the time of her death as M. According to the problem, Jessica was half her mother's age at that time, so we can denote Jessica's age at that time as J = M/2.

The problem also tells us that if her mother were alive now, ten years later, she would have been 70. This means that her mother's age at the time of her death was M = 70 - 10 = 60 years old.

Substituting M = 60 into the equation J = M/2, we find that Jessica's age at the time...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find Jessica's current age based on the information given about her mother's age.

Given:
- Jessica was half her mother's age when her mother died.
- If her mother were alive now, ten years later, she would have been 70.

Step 1: Let's determine the mother's age when she died.
If the mother were alive now, she would be 70. This is 10 years after her death.
So, the mother's age at death = 70 - 1...
