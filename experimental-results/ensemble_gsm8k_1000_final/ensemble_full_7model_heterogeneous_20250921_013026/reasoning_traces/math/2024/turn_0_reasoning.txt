=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many balloons are left after some have burst. We will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial quantities of balloons**:
   - Red balloons: 20
   - Green balloons: 15

2. **Identify how many balloons burst**:
   - Red balloons that burst: 3
   - Green balloons that burst: 2

3. **Calculate the remaining red balloons**:
   - We start with 20 red balloons and 3 burst.
   - The calculation for the remaining red balloons is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining red balloons} = \text{Initial red balloons} - \text{Red balloons that burst}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Remaining red balloons} = 20 - 3 = 17
     \]

4. **Calculate the remaining green balloons**:
   - We start with 15 green balloons and 2 burst.
   - The calculation for the remaining green balloons is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining green balloons} = \text{Initial green balloons} - \text{Green balloons that burst}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Remaining green balloons} = 15 - 2 = 13
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of balloons left**:
   - Now we add the remaining red and green balloons together to find the total number of balloons left:
   \[
   \text{Total remaining balloons} = \text{Remaining red balloons} + \text{Remaining green balloons}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total remaining balloons} = 17 + 13 = 30
   \]

Thus, after calculating the remaining balloons, we find that the total number of balloons left is:

\[
\boxed{30}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 20 red balloons and 15 green balloons at the party.
- Before the party started, 3 red and 2 green balloons burst.

Step 1: Calculate the number of red balloons left.
Initial number of red balloons = 20
Number of red balloons that burst = 3
Number of red balloons left = 20 - 3 = 17

Step 2: Calculate the number of green balloons left.
Initial number of green balloons = 15
Number of gr...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many balloons are left after some of them burst. We are given the initial counts of red and green balloons and the number of each that burst.

**Step 1: Determine the initial number of balloons.**

- Initially, there are 20 red balloons.
- Initially, there are 15 green balloons.

**Step 2: Determine how many balloons burst.**

- 3 red balloons burst.
- 2 green balloons burst.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of balloons left...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem involves simple subtraction. 

Initially, there are 20 red balloons and 15 green balloons. So, the total number of balloons is 20 + 15 = 35 balloons.

Before the party started, 3 red and 2 green balloons burst. So, the total number of balloons that burst is 3 + 2 = 5 balloons.

To find out how many balloons are left, we subtract the number of balloons that burst from the initial total number of balloons. 

So, 35 - 5 = 30 balloons.

Therefore, there are 30 bal...
