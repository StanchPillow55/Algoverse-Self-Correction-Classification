=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's denote the number of kids at the cookout in 2004 as \( x \).

According to the problem, the number of kids in subsequent years can be expressed in terms of \( x \):

1. In 2005, half the number of kids from 2004 attended the cookout. Therefore, the number of kids in 2005 is:
   \[
   \text{Kids in 2005} = \frac{x}{2}
   \]

2. In 2006, the number of kids who attended the cookout was \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the number of kids in 2005. Thus, the number of kids in 2006 is:
   \[
   \text{Kids in 2006} = \frac{2}{3} \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)
   \]

Now, we can simplify the expression for the number of kids in 2006:
\[
\text{Kids in 2006} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{x}{2} = \frac{2x}{6} = \frac{x}{3}
\]

We know from the problem statement that there were 20 kids at the cookout in 2006. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{3} = 20
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:
\[
x = 20 \cdot 3
\]
\[
x = 60
\]

Thus, the number of kids at the cookout in 2004 was \( \boxed{60} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the information given in 2006 to find the number of kids at the cookout in 2004.

Given information:
- In 2006, there were 20 kids at the cookout.
- In 2006, the number of kids was 2/3 as many as in 2005.
- In 2005, the number of kids was half the number of kids in 2004.

Step 1: Find the number of kids at the cookout in 2005.
Let's call the number of kids in 2004 as x.
Number of kids in 2005 = 1/2 ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given for 2006 to find out how many kids were at the cookout in 2004.

**Step 1: Determine the number of kids in 2005.**

We know that in 2006, there were 20 kids at the cookout. According to the problem, the number of kids in 2006 was \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the number of kids in 2005. We can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{(Number of kids in 2005)} = 20
\]

Let \( x \) be the number of...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of kids at the cookout in 2004 as K.

According to the problem, half the number of kids came to the cookout in 2005 as compared to 2004. So, the number of kids in 2005 is K/2.

In 2006, 2/3 as many kids came to the cookout as in 2005. So, the number of kids in 2006 is 2/3 * (K/2) = K/3.

We know that there were 20 kids at the cookout in 2006. So, we can set up the equation K/3 = 20.

To solve for K, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to ge...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll start with the information given for the most recent year and work backwards to find the number of kids at the cookout in 2004.

Given:
- In 2006, there were 20 kids at the cookout.
- In 2005, there were 3/2 times as many kids as in 2006.
- In 2004, there were twice as many kids as in 2005.

Step 1: Calculate the number of kids at the cookout in 2005.
- In 2006, there were 20 kids.
- In 2005, there ...
