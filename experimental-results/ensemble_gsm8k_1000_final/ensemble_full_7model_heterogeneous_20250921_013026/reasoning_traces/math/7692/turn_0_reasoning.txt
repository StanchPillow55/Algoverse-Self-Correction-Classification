=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first define the points scored by each student based on the information given.

1. **Identify the points scored by Naomi:**
   - Naomi scored \( N = 68 \) points.

2. **Calculate the points scored by Yuri:**
   - Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. 
   - Half of Naomi's points is \( \frac{N}{2} = \frac{68}{2} = 34 \).
   - Therefore, Yuri's score \( Y \) is:
     \[
     Y = 34 + 10 = 44
     \]

3. **Calculate the points scored by Brianna:**
   - Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
   - Therefore, Brianna's score \( B \) is:
     \[
     B = N + 17 = 68 + 17 = 85
     \]

4. **Calculate the total points scored by the four students:**
   - The total points scored by all four students is given as 251 points.
   - Let \( J \) be the points scored by Jojo. The equation for the total points is:
     \[
     N + Y + B + J = 251
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     68 + 44 + 85 + J = 251
     \]

5. **Calculate the sum of Naomi's, Yuri's, and Brianna's scores:**
   - First, we add Naomi's, Yuri's, and Brianna's scores:
     \[
     68 + 44 + 85 = 197
     \]

6. **Substitute the sum back into the total points equation:**
   - Now we can substitute this sum into the total points equation:
     \[
     197 + J = 251
     \]

7. **Solve for Jojo's score:**
   - To find \( J \), we subtract 197 from both sides:
     \[
     J = 251 - 197 = 54
     \]

Thus, Jojo scored \( \boxed{54} \) points.

2. **Calculate the points scored by Yuri:**
   - Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. 
   - Half of Naomi's points is \( \frac{N}{2} = \frac{68}{2} = 34 \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Four students scored a total of 251 points in a board game.
- Naomi scored 68 points.
- Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
- Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.

Step 1: Calculate how many points Yuri scored.
Yuri's points = (Naomi's points / 2) + 10
Yuri's points = (68 / 2) + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 points

Step 2: Calculate how many points Brianna scored.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many points Jojo scored, given the total points scored by all four students and the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna.

Let's break down the information given:

1. The total points scored by all four students is 251.
2. Naomi scored 68 points.
3. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
4. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.

We need to find out how many points Jojo scored.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's score is 68/2 = 34 points. So, Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 more points than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's find out how many points Jojo scored. We know that the total score of the four students is 251 points. So, Jojo's score is the total score minus the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Briann...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the number of points Jojo scored.

Given:
- Four students scored a total of 251 points.
- Naomi scored 68 points.
- Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
- Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.

Step 1: Calculate Yuri's score.
