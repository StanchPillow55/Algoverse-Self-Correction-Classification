=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many college courses Sid attended and then find the total number of courses attended by both Max and Sid.

1. **Determine the number of courses Max attended:**
   - According to the problem, Max attended 40 college courses in 2 years.

2. **Calculate the number of courses Sid attended:**
   - The problem states that Sid attended four times as many college courses as Max.
   - Therefore, we can calculate Sid's courses as follows:
     \[
     \text{Sid's courses} = 4 \times \text{Max's courses} = 4 \times 40
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Sid's courses} = 4 \times 40 = 160
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of courses attended by both Max and Sid:**
   - Now that we know the number of courses attended by both individuals, we can find the total:
     \[
     \text{Total courses} = \text{Max's courses} + \text{Sid's courses} = 40 + 160
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     \text{Total courses} = 40 + 160 = 200
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - The total number of college courses attended by both Max and Sid is \( \boxed{200} \).

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Max attended 40 college courses in 2 years.

Sid attended four times as many college courses as Max in the same period. This means Sid attended 4 * 40 = <<4*40=160>>160 college courses in 2 years.

To find the total number of college courses they both attended, we add the number of courses Max attended to the number of courses Sid attended.

So, 40 (Max's courses) + 160 (Sid's courses) = <<40+160=200>>200 college courses.

Therefore, Max and Sid attended a total of 200 co...
