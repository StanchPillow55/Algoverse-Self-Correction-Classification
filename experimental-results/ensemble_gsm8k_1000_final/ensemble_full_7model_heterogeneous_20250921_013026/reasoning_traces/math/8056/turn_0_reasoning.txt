=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cups Judy bought:**
   Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen is equal to 12.
   \[
   \text{Cups Judy bought} = 12
   \]

2. **Determine the number of dishes Judy bought:**
   According to the problem, Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Therefore, the number of dishes she bought can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Dishes Judy bought} = 2 \times \text{Cups Judy bought} = 2 \times 12 = 24
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of utensils Judy brought:**
   The total number of utensils Judy brought is the sum of the cups and dishes she bought.
   \[
   \text{Total utensils Judy brought} = \text{Cups Judy bought} + \text{Dishes Judy bought} = 12 + 24 = 36
   \]

4. **Determine the number of cups and dishes brought by Judy's friend:**
   Judy's friend brought 40 cups. The problem states that her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. First, we need to find out how many dishes Judy's friend brought:
   \[
   \text{Dishes friend brought} = \text{Dishes Judy bought} + 20 = 24 + 20 = 44
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of utensils brought by Judy's friend:**
   The total number of utensils brought by Judy's friend is the sum of the cups and dishes her friend brought.
   \[
   \text{Total utensils friend brought} = \text{Cups friend brought} + \text{Dishes friend brought} = 40 + 44 = 84
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:**
   Finally, we add the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend to find the overall total.
   \[
   \text{Total utensils brought by both} = \text{Total utensils Judy brought} + \text{Total utensils friend brought} = 36 + 84 = 120
   \]

Thus, the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]
