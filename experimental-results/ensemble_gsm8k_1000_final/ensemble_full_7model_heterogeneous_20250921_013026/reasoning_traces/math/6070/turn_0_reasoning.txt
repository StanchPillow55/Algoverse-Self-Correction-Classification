=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much each piece of pizza cost, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of pizzas**: Luigi bought 4 pizzas.

2. **Determine how many pieces each pizza was cut into**: Each pizza was cut into 5 pieces.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces**: 
   \[
   \text{Total pieces} = \text{Number of pizzas} \times \text{Pieces per pizza}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total pieces} = 4 \text{ pizzas} \times 5 \text{ pieces/pizza} = 20 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Determine the total cost of the pizzas**: Luigi spent $80 for the 4 pizzas.

5. **Calculate the cost per piece**: 
   \[
   \text{Cost per piece} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Total pieces}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Cost per piece} = \frac{80 \text{ dollars}}{20 \text{ pieces}} = 4 \text{ dollars/piece}
   \]

Thus, the cost of each piece of pizza is \(\boxed{4}\) dollars.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of each piece of pizza.

Given information:
- Luigi bought 4 pizzas for $80.
- Each pizza was cut into 5 pieces.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of pizza.
Total number of pieces = Number of pizzas × Number of pieces per pizza
Total number of pieces = 4 × 5 = 20 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the cost of each piece of pizza.
Cost of each piece of pizza = Total cost of pizzas / Total number of pie...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each piece of pizza. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the Total Cost of the Pizzas:**
   Luigi bought four pizzas for a total of $80. This is given directly in the problem.

2. **Calculate the Total Number of Pieces:**
   Each pizza is cut into 5 pieces. Since Luigi bought 4 pizzas, we need to calculate the total number of pieces from all the pizzas combined.

   \[
   \text{Total number of...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many pieces of pizza Luigi has in total. Since each pizza was cut into 5 pieces and Luigi bought 4 pizzas, we multiply 4 by 5 to get 20 pieces of pizza.

Next, we need to find out how much each piece of pizza costs. To do this, we divide the total cost of the pizzas by the total number of pieces. 

So, $80 divided by 20 pieces equals $4 per piece.

Therefore, each piece of pizza cost $4.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Luigi bought 4 pizzas.
   * The total cost of the pizzas was $80.
   * Each pizza was cut into 5 pieces.

2. Calculate the total number of pizza pieces:
   * Number of pizzas = 4
   * Pieces per pizza = 5
   * Total pieces = Number of pizzas × Pieces per pizza
   * Total pieces = 4 × 5 = 20 pieces

3. Calculate the cost per piece:
   * Total cost = $80
   * Total piece...
