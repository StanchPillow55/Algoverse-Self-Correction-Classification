=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first determine how many candies each person can eat before they cry, and then calculate how many candies are left in the bucket after they eat. Finally, we will divide the remaining candies equally among them.

1. **Determine how many candies each person can eat:**
   - Nellie can eat 12 sourball candies.
   - Jacob can eat half of what Nellie can eat:
     \[
     \text{Jacob's candies} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
     \]
   - Lana can eat three fewer than Jacob:
     \[
     \text{Lana's candies} = 6 - 3 = 3
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of candies eaten by all three:**
   - Total candies eaten:
     \[
     \text{Total eaten} = \text{Nellie's candies} + \text{Jacob's candies} + \text{Lana's candies}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total eaten} = 12 + 6 + 3 = 21
     \]

3. **Determine how many candies are left in the bucket:**
   - Initially, there are 30 candies in the bucket. After they eat, the number of remaining candies is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining candies} = 30 - \text{Total eaten}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Remaining candies} = 30 - 21 = 9
     \]

4. **Divide the remaining candies equally among Nellie, Jacob, and Lana:**
   - There are 3 people sharing the remaining 9 candies:
     \[
     \text{Candies per person} = \frac{\text{Remaining candies}}{3}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Candies per person} = \frac{9}{3} = 3
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Each person will get 3 sourball candies from the remaining candies.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many candies each person ate. 

Nellie ate 12 candies. 

Jacob ate half of what Nellie ate, so Jacob ate 12/2 = 6 candies. 

Lana ate three fewer than Jacob, so Lana ate 6-3 = 3 candies. 

Next, we add up the total number of candies they ate: 12 (Nellie) + 6 (Jacob) + 3 (Lana) = 21 candies. 

They started with 30 candies, so after they ate until they cried, there were 30-21 = 9 candies left in the bucket. 

Finally, they divided the remainin...
