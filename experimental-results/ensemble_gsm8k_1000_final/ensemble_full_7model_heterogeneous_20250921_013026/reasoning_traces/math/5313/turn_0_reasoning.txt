=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of cake pieces eaten.**
2. **Calculate the remaining pieces of cake after some have been eaten.**
3. **Divide the remaining pieces among Juelz's three sisters.**

### Step 1: Calculate the number of cake pieces eaten

The total number of cake pieces is given as 240. According to the problem, Forest and his friends ate 60% of the cake pieces. 

To find out how many pieces were eaten, we calculate 60% of 240:

\[
\text{Pieces eaten} = 60\% \times 240 = \frac{60}{100} \times 240
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Pieces eaten} = 0.6 \times 240 = 144
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining pieces of cake

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after 144 pieces have been eaten. We subtract the number of pieces eaten from the total number of pieces:

\[
\text{Remaining pieces} = \text{Total pieces} - \text{Pieces eaten} = 240 - 144
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Remaining pieces} = 240 - 144 = 96
\]

### Step 3: Divide the remaining pieces among Juelz's three sisters

Juelz divides the remaining 96 pieces among his three sisters. To find out how many pieces each sister receives, we divide the remaining pieces by the number of sisters:

\[
\text{Pieces per sister} = \frac{\text{Remaining pieces}}{\text{Number of sisters}} = \frac{96}{3}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Pieces per sister} = 32
\]

### Final Answer

Each sister received **32 pieces** of cake.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of cake pieces eaten by Forest and his friends.
2. Calculate the number of cake pieces remaining after they ate 60% of the cake.
3. Divide the remaining cake pieces equally among Juelz's three sisters.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cake pieces eaten by Forest and his friends.
* The cake had 240 pieces in total.
* They ate 60% of the cake.
* 60% of 240 = 0.60 × 240 = 144 ...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of cake pieces eaten initially.**

   The problem states that Forest and his friends ate 60% of the cake's pieces. The total number of cake pieces is 240.

   To find out how many pieces were eaten, we calculate 60% of 240:

   \[
   \text{Number of pieces eaten} = 0.60 \times 240
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of pieces eaten} = 144
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many pieces of the cake were eaten after the birthday song. We know that 60% of the cake was eaten. To find out how many pieces that is, we multiply the total number of pieces (240) by 60% (or 0.60 in decimal form).

240 * 0.60 = 144 pieces

So, 144 pieces of the cake were eaten.

Next, we need to find out how many pieces were left. We do this by subtracting the number of pieces eaten from the total number of pieces.

240 - 144 = 96 pieces

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The birthday cake has 240 pieces in total.
   * Forest and his friends ate 60% of the cake's pieces.
   * Juelz divided the remaining pieces among his three sisters.

2. Calculate the number of cake pieces eaten by Forest and his friends:
   * 60% of 240 pieces = 0.6 × 240
   * 0.6 × 240 = 144 pieces
   * So, Forest and his friends ate 144 pieces of the cake.
