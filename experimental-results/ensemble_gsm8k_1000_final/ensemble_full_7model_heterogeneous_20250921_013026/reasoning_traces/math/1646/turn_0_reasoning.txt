=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many passengers fit into 5 buses, we first need to find out how many passengers fit into one bus. 

1. **Calculate the number of passengers per bus:**
   We know that 198 passengers fit into 9 buses. To find the number of passengers per bus, we divide the total number of passengers by the number of buses:

   \[
   \text{Passengers per bus} = \frac{\text{Total passengers}}{\text{Number of buses}} = \frac{198}{9}
   \]

   Now, we perform the division:

   \[
   198 \div 9 = 22
   \]

   So, each bus can carry 22 passengers.

2. **Calculate the number of passengers in 5 buses:**
   Now that we know each bus can carry 22 passengers, we can find out how many passengers fit into 5 buses by multiplying the number of passengers per bus by the number of buses:

   \[
   \text{Passengers in 5 buses} = \text{Passengers per bus} \times \text{Number of buses} = 22 \times 5
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   22 \times 5 = 110
   \]

Thus, the total number of passengers that fit into 5 buses is **110**.

Final answer: **110 passengers**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of passengers that can fit in 5 buses, given that 198 passengers can fit into 9 buses.

Given information:
- 198 passengers fit into 9 buses.
- We need to find the number of passengers that can fit into 5 buses.

Step 1: Find the number of passengers that can fit into one bus.
Number of passengers per bus = Total number of passengers / Total number of buses
Number of passengers per bus = 198 / 9 = 22 p...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many passengers fit in 5 buses given that 198 passengers fit into 9 buses. We can approach this problem by first finding out how many passengers fit into one bus, and then use that information to find out how many passengers fit into 5 buses.

**Step 1: Find the number of passengers per bus.**

We know that 198 passengers fit into 9 buses. To find the number of passengers per bus, we divide the total number of passengers by...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many passengers fit into one bus. We do this by dividing the total number of passengers by the total number of buses. 

So, 198 passengers รท 9 buses = 22 passengers per bus.

Now that we know how many passengers fit into one bus, we can find out how many passengers fit into 5 buses. We do this by multiplying the number of passengers that fit into one bus by the number of buses.

So, 22 passengers per bus ร 5 buses = 110 passengers.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * 198 passengers fit into 9 buses.
   * We need to find out how many passengers fit in 5 buses.

2. Find the number of passengers per bus:
   * To do this, we divide the total number of passengers by the number of buses.
   * Number of passengers per bus = Total passengers รท Number of buses
   * Number of passengers per bus = 198 รท 9
   * Number of passengers per bus = 22
