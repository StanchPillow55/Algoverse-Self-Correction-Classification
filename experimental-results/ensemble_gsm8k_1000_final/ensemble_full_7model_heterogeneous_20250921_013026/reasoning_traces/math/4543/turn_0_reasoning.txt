=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many students picked strawberries as their favorite fruit, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of students surveyed**: Sarah interviewed a total of 450 students.

2. **Identify the number of students who liked each fruit**:
   - Students who liked oranges: 70
   - Students who liked pears: 120
   - Students who liked apples: 147

3. **Calculate the total number of students who liked oranges, pears, and apples**:
   \[
   \text{Total for oranges, pears, and apples} = \text{Students who liked oranges} + \text{Students who liked pears} + \text{Students who liked apples}
   \]
   \[
   = 70 + 120 + 147
   \]

   Now, let's perform the addition step by step:
   - First, add the number of students who liked oranges and pears:
     \[
     70 + 120 = 190
     \]
   - Next, add the number of students who liked apples to this total:
     \[
     190 + 147 = 337
     \]

   So, the total number of students who liked oranges, pears, and apples is 337.

4. **Calculate the number of students who liked strawberries**:
   To find the number of students who liked strawberries, we subtract the total number of students who liked oranges, pears, and apples from the total number of students surveyed:
   \[
   \text{Students who liked strawberries} = \text{Total students} - \text{Total for oranges, pears, and apples}
   \]
   \[
   = 450 - 337
   \]

   Now, perform the subtraction:
   \[
   450 - 337 = 113
   \]

5. **Final answer**: Therefore, the number of students who picked strawberries as their favorite fruit is \( \boxed{113} \).

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of students who chose oranges, pears, and apples from the total number of students interviewed.

First, let's add up the number of students who chose oranges, pears, and apples:

70 (oranges) + 120 (pears) + 147 (apples) = 337 students

Next, we subtract this number from the total number of students interviewed to find out how many chose strawberries:

450 (total students) - 337 (students who chose oranges, pears, or a...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Sarah interviewed a total of 450 students.
   * 70 students liked oranges best.
   * 120 students liked pears best.
   * 147 students liked apples best.
   * We need to find out how many students picked strawberries as their favorite.

2. Recognize that the total number of students who picked oranges, pears, and apples should be subtracted from the total number of studen...
