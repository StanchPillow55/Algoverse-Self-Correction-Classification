=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Alfred needs to save each month to reach his goal of $1,000.00 for Christmas shopping, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total savings goal**: Alfred wants to save a total of $1,000.00.

2. **Account for the leftover money**: Alfred has $100.00 left over from last year's holiday. This amount will reduce the total amount he needs to save this year.

   \[
   \text{Amount needed to save} = \text{Total savings goal} - \text{Leftover money}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount needed to save} = 1000 - 100 = 900
   \]

3. **Determine the monthly savings requirement**: Alfred wants to save this amount over 12 months. To find out how much he needs to save each month, we divide the total amount he needs to save by the number of months.

   \[
   \text{Monthly savings} = \frac{\text{Amount needed to save}}{\text{Number of months}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly savings} = \frac{900}{12}
   \]

4. **Perform the division**:

   \[
   \text{Monthly savings} = 75
   \]

Thus, Alfred needs to save **$75.00 each month** in order to reach his goal of $1,000.00 for Christmas shopping.

**Final Answer**: Alfred needs to save $75.00 each month.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money Alfred needs to save each month to reach his goal of $1,000.00 in 12 months, taking into account the $100.00 he has left over from last year.

Given information:
- Alfred's goal is to save $1,000.00 over 12 months.
- Alfred has $100.00 left over from last year's holiday to put towards this year's goal.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Alfred needs to save.
Total amount to save = $1,000.00

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Alfred needs to save each month to reach his goal of $1,000.00 in 12 months, considering he already has $100.00 saved from last year.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the Total Savings Goal:**
   Alfred's total savings goal for the year is $1,000.00.

2. **Account for the Existing Savings:**

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Alfred's goal is to save $1,000.00 for his Christmas shopping. He already has $100.00 from last year. 

First, we need to determine how much more Alfred needs to save to reach his goal. We do this by subtracting the amount he already has from his total goal:

$1,000.00 - $100.00 = $900.00

So, Alfred needs to save $900.00 more to reach his goal.

Next, we need to determine how much Alfred needs to save each month. Since he has 12 months to save, we divide the total amount...
