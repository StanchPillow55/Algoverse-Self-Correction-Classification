=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the known values:**
   - Asaf's age = 50 years
   - The sum of Asaf's and Alexander's ages = 140 years
   - Let Alexander's age be \( A \).

2. **Set up the equation for their ages:**
   \[
   \text{Asaf's age} + \text{Alexander's age} = 140
   \]
   Substituting Asaf's age:
   \[
   50 + A = 140
   \]
   To find Alexander's age, we solve for \( A \):
   \[
   A = 140 - 50 = 90
   \]
   So, Alexander is 90 years old.

3. **Determine the age difference between Asaf and Alexander:**
   \[
   \text{Age difference} = A - \text{Asaf's age} = 90 - 50 = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

4. **Relate the age difference to the number of pencils:**
   According to the problem, the age difference is half the total number of pencils Asaf has. Let \( P \) be the number of pencils Asaf has. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Age difference} = \frac{P}{2}
   \]
   We already calculated the age difference as 40 years:
   \[
   40 = \frac{P}{2}
   \]
   To find \( P \), multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   P = 40 \times 2 = 80
   \]
   So, Asaf has 80 pencils.

5. **Determine the number of pencils Alexander has:**
   The problem states that Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf:
   \[
   \text{Alexander's pencils} = P + 60 = 80 + 60 = 140
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of pencils they have together:**
   \[
   \text{Total pencils} = \text{Asaf's pencils} + \text{Alexander's pencils} = 80 + 140 = 220
   \]

7. **Final answer:**
   The total number of pencils Asaf and Alexander have together is \( \boxed{220} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The age difference between Asaf and Alexander is half the total number of pencils Asaf has.
- The sum of their ages is 140.
- Asaf is 50 years old.
- Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf.

Step 1: Find Alexander's age.
Sum of their ages = 140
Asaf's age = 50
Alexander's age = 140 - 50 = 90

Step 2: Find the age difference between Asaf and Alexander.
Age difference = Alexander's...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pencils Asaf and Alexander have together. We are given several pieces of information:

1. Asaf is 50 years old.
2. The sum of Asaf and Alexander's ages is 140.
3. The age difference between Asaf and Alexander is half the total number of pencils Asaf has.
4. Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Determine Alexander's Age

We know the sum of their age...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of pencils Asaf has as P and the number of pencils Alexander has as P + 60 (since Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf).

According to the problem, the age difference between Asaf and Alexander is half the total number of pencils Asaf has. Since Asaf is 50 years old, this means that Alexander is 50 + P/2 years old.

The problem also states that the sum of their ages is 140. So, we can write the equation:

50 + P/2 + 50 = 140

Solving this equati...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The age difference between Asaf and Alexander is half the number of pencils Asaf has.
   * The sum of their ages is 140.
   * Asaf is 50 years old.
   * Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf.

2. Find Alexander's age:
   * Sum of their ages = Asaf's age + Alexander's age
   * 140 = 50 + Alexander's age
   * Alexander's age = 140 - 50
   * Alexander's age = 90
