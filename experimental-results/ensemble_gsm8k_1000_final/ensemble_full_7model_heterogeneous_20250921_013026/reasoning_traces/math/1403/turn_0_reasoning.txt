=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to define the five numbers in Brad's zip code based on the information given. Let's denote the five numbers as \( a, b, c, d, e \).

1. **Understanding the conditions:**
   - The first and second numbers are the same: \( a = b \).
   - The third number is zero: \( c = 0 \).
   - The fourth number is double the first number: \( d = 2a \).
   - The fourth and fifth numbers add up to 8: \( d + e = 8 \).
   - The sum of all five numbers is 10: \( a + b + c + d + e = 10 \).

2. **Substituting known values:**
   - Since \( b = a \) and \( c = 0 \), we can rewrite the sum:
     \[
     a + a + 0 + d + e = 10
     \]
     This simplifies to:
     \[
     2a + d + e = 10
     \]

3. **Substituting for \( d \):**
   - We know \( d = 2a \), so we substitute \( d \) in the equation:
     \[
     2a + 2a + e = 10
     \]
     This simplifies to:
     \[
     4a + e = 10
     \]

4. **Using the fourth and fifth number condition:**
   - We also have the equation from the fourth and fifth numbers:
     \[
     d + e = 8
     \]
     Substituting \( d = 2a \) gives us:
     \[
     2a + e = 8
     \]

5. **Now we have two equations:**
   - From the sum of all numbers: \( 4a + e = 10 \) (Equation 1)
   - From the fourth and fifth numbers: \( 2a + e = 8 \) (Equation 2)

6. **Solving the equations:**
   - We can solve for \( e \) in Equation 2:
     \[
     e = 8 - 2a
     \]
   - Substitute this expression for \( e \) into Equation 1:
     \[
     4a + (8 - 2a) = 10
     \]
     Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     4a + 8 - 2a = 10
     \]
     \[
     2a + 8 = 10
     \]
     \[
     2a = 2
     \]
     \[
     a = 1
     \]

7. **Finding the other numbers:**
   - Now that we have \( a = 1 \):
     \[
     b = a = 1
     \]
     \[
     c = 0
     \]
     \[
     d = 2a = 2 \times 1 = 2
     \]
     \[
     e = 8 - 2a = 8 - 2 \times 1 = 6
     \]

8. **Final values:**
   - The five numbers are:
     \[
     a = 1, \quad b = 1, \quad c = 0, \quad d = 2, \quad e = 6
     \]

9. **Constructing the zip code:**
   - Therefore, Brad's zip code is \( 11026 \).

**Final Answer:**
Bradâ€™s zip code is **11026**.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the five numbers in Brad's zip code as a, b, c, d, and e respectively. 

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The first and second numbers are the same, so a = b.
2. The third number is zero, so c = 0.
3. The fourth number is double the first number, so d = 2a.
4. The fourth and fifth numbers add up to 8, so d + e = 8.
5. All five numbers add up to 10, so a + b + c + d + e = 10.

   * The zip code has five numbers.
   * The sum of all five numbers is 10.
   * The first and second numbers are the same. Let's call this number 'x'.
   * The third number is zero.
   * The fourth number is double the first number, so it's '2x'.
   * The fourth and fifth numbers add up to 8.
