=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first determine how many marbles of each color Cara has, and then calculate the probability of picking a blue marble.

1. **Total Marbles**: Cara has a total of 60 marbles.

2. **Yellow Marbles**: We know that 20 of the marbles are yellow.

3. **Green Marbles**: The problem states that half as many marbles are green as yellow. Since there are 20 yellow marbles:
   \[
   \text{Green Marbles} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

4. **Remaining Marbles**: Now we need to find out how many marbles are left after accounting for the yellow and green marbles. We have:
   \[
   \text{Total Yellow and Green} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]
   Therefore, the number of remaining marbles is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Marbles} = 60 - 30 = 30
   \]

5. **Red and Blue Marbles**: The remaining 30 marbles are equally divided between red and blue. Thus, the number of red marbles is:
   \[
   \text{Red Marbles} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]
   And the number of blue marbles is also:
   \[
   \text{Blue Marbles} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]

6. **Calculating the Probability of Picking a Blue Marble**: The probability of picking a blue marble is the number of blue marbles divided by the total number of marbles:
   \[
   P(\text{Blue}) = \frac{\text{Number of Blue Marbles}}{\text{Total Marbles}} = \frac{15}{60}
   \]

7. **Simplifying the Probability**: We can simplify this fraction:
   \[
   P(\text{Blue}) = \frac{15}{60} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

8. **Expressing as a Percentage**: To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   \[
   P(\text{Blue}) \text{ (as a percentage)} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
   \]

Thus, the odds that Cara picks a blue marble are **25%**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Cara has 60 marbles in a bag.
- 20 of them are yellow.
- Half as many are green.
- The remaining marbles are equally divided between red and blue.

Step 1: Find the number of green marbles.
Since half as many are green, we can calculate the number of green marbles as:
Number of green marbles = 20 รท 2 = 10

Step 2: Find the total number of marbles that are not yellow or green.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many marbles of each color are in the bag and then calculate the probability of picking a blue marble.

1. **Determine the number of yellow marbles:**
   - We are given that there are 20 yellow marbles.

2. **Determine the number of green marbles:**
   - We are told that the number of green marbles is half the number of yellow marbles.
   - Therefore, the number of green marbles is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

3. **Calculate t...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many green marbles there are. Since there are half as many green marbles as yellow marbles, and there are 20 yellow marbles, there are 20/2 = 10 green marbles.

Next, we need to find out how many marbles are left for red and blue. We know there are 60 marbles in total, and we've accounted for 20 yellow and 10 green, so there are 60 - 20 - 10 = 30 marbles left.

Since the remaining marbles are equally divided between red and blue, there are 30/2 =...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Cara has a total of 60 marbles in the bag.
   * 20 marbles are yellow.
   * The number of green marbles is half the number of yellow marbles.
   * The remaining marbles are equally divided between red and blue.

2. Calculate the number of green marbles:
   * Number of green marbles = Half of yellow marbles
   * Number of green marbles = 20 รท 2 = 10
