Final Answer: Let \( x \) be the total amount of money Susan had at first.

1. **Calculate the amounts spent in each month:**
   - In September, she spent \( \frac{1}{5} \) of her total money:
     \[
     \text{Amount spent in September} = \frac{1}{5}x
     \]
   - In October, she spent \( \frac{1}{4} \) of her total money:
     \[
     \text{Amount spent in October} = \frac{1}{4}x
     \]
   - In November, she spent $120:
     \[
     \text{Amount spent in November} = 120
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   The total amount spent over the three months is:
   \[
   \text{Total spent} = \frac{1}{5}x + \frac{1}{4}x + 120
   \]

3. **Combine the fractions:**
   To combine \( \frac{1}{5}x \) and \( \frac{1}{4}x \), we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 4 is 20.
   - Convert \( \frac{1}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 20:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{20}
     \]
   - Convert \( \frac{1}{4} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 20:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{20}
     \]
   - Now we can combine:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5}x + \frac{1}{4}x = \frac{4}{20}x + \frac{5}{20}x = \frac{9}{20}x
     \]

4. **Set up the equation:**
   After spending the amounts, Susan has $540 left. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x - \left( \frac{9}{20}x + 120 \right) = 540
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   First, distribute the negative sign:
   \[
   x - \frac{9}{20}x - 120 = 540
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   \left(1 - \frac{9}{20}\right)x - 120 = 540
   \]
   To simplify \( 1 - \frac{9}{20} \):
   \[
   1 = \frac{20}{20} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 - \frac{9}{20} = \frac{20}{20} - \frac{9}{20} = \frac{11}{20}
   \]
   Thus, the equation becomes:
   \[
   \frac{11}{20}x - 120 = 540
   \]

6. **Isolate \( x \):**
   Add 120 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{11}{20}x = 540 + 120
   \]
   \[
   \frac{11}{20}x = 660
   \]

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by \( \frac{20}{11} \):
   \[
   x = 660 \times \frac{20}{11}
   \]
   Calculate \( 660 \div 11 \):
   \[
   660 \div 11 = 60
   \]
   Now multiply by 20:
   \[
   x = 60 \times 20 = 1200
   \]

8. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total amount of money Susan had at first is:
   \[
   \boxed{1200}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Susan had initially.

Given information:
- Susan spent 1/5 of her money in September.
- Susan spent 1/4 of her money in October.
- Susan spent $120 in November.
- After these expenses, she had $540 left.

Let's represent the initial amount of money as "x".

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money spent in September.
Amount spent in September = 1/5 of x = 0.2x

Step 2: Calculate the amount ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial amount of money Susan had before making her expenditures in September, October, and November. Let's denote the initial amount of money Susan had as \( x \).

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Spending in September:**
   - Susan spent \( \frac{1}{5} \) of her initial amount in September.
   - The amount spent in September is \( \frac{1}{5}x \).

2. **Spending in October:**
   - Susan spent \( \frac{1}{4} \) of her ini...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the initial amount of money Susan had as X.

According to the problem, Susan spent 1/5 of her money in September and 1/4 of her money in October. This means she spent a total of 1/5X + 1/4X of her money in these two months.

To add these two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 5 and 4 is 20. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

1/5X = 4/20X
1/4X = 5/20X

Adding these two fractions together giv...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. To find out how much money Susan had initially, we need to work backwards from the remaining amount.

Given:
- Susan spent 1/5 of her money in September.
- She spent 1/4 of her money in October.
- She spent $120 in November.
- After spending these amounts, she had $540 left.

Step 1: Let's express the remaining amount as a fraction of the initial amount.
- Remaining amount = Initial amount - Spent amounts...
