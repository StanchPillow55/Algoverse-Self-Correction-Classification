Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of easy questions:**
   The quiz has a total of 60 questions, and 40% of these are easy questions.

   \[
   \text{Number of easy questions} = 60 \times 0.40 = 24
   \]

2. **Determine the number of average and difficult questions:**
   The remaining questions are average and difficult. Since 40% are easy, the percentage of average and difficult questions combined is:

   \[
   100\% - 40\% = 60\%
   \]

   The number of average and difficult questions combined is:

   \[
   \text{Number of average and difficult questions} = 60 \times 0.60 = 36
   \]

   Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, we can find the number of each:

   \[
   \text{Number of average questions} = \text{Number of difficult questions} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - **Easy questions:** Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct.

   \[
   \text{Correct easy questions} = 24 \times 0.75 = 18
   \]

   - **Average questions:** Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct.

   \[
   \text{Correct average questions} = 18 \times 0.5 = 9
   \]

   - **Difficult questions:** Aries is also sure to get half of the difficult questions correct.

   \[
   \text{Correct difficult questions} = 18 \times 0.5 = 9
   \]

4. **Total points Aries is sure to get:**
   Now, we can sum the number of questions she is sure to get correct:

   \[
   \text{Total correct answers} = \text{Correct easy questions} + \text{Correct average questions} + \text{Correct difficult questions}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total correct answers} = 18 + 9 + 9 = 36
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of points Aries is sure to get on the quiz is:

   \[
   \boxed{36}
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how many questions are easy, average, and difficult.

Since 40% of the questions are easy, we have:
40/100 * 60 = 24 easy questions

The remaining 60% of the questions are equally divided into average and difficult questions. So, we have:
60/100 * 60 = 36 questions that are either average or difficult

Since these 36 questions are equally divided into average and difficult, we have:
36/2 = 18 average questions
36/2 = 18 difficult questions

Now, let...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The quiz has 60 items in total.
   * 40% of the questions are easy.
   * The remaining questions are equally divided into average and difficult.
   * Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct.
   * Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct.

2. Calculate the number of easy questions:
   * 40% of 60 = 0.4 Ã— 60 = 24 easy ...
