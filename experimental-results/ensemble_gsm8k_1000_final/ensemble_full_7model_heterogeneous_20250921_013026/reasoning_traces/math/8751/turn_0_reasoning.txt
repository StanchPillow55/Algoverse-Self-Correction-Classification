=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many good seashells Tom, Nancy, and Benny found together, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny.**
   - Tom found 214 seashells.
   - Nancy found 432 seashells.
   - Benny found 86 seashells.

   We will add these numbers together:

   \[
   \text{Total seashells} = \text{Tom's seashells} + \text{Nancy's seashells} + \text{Benny's seashells}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total seashells} = 214 + 432 + 86
   \]

   Now, we will perform the addition step by step:

   First, add Tom's and Nancy's seashells:

   \[
   214 + 432 = 646
   \]

   Now, add Benny's seashells to this total:

   \[
   646 + 86 = 732
   \]

   So, the total number of seashells found is:

   \[
   \text{Total seashells} = 732
   \]

2. **Subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells.**
   - They discovered that 67 seashells were cracked.

   We will calculate the number of good seashells by subtracting the cracked seashells from the total seashells:

   \[
   \text{Good seashells} = \text{Total seashells} - \text{Cracked seashells}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Good seashells} = 732 - 67
   \]

   Now, we will perform the subtraction:

   \[
   732 - 67 = 665
   \]

3. **State the final answer.**
   The total number of good seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny together is:

   \[
   \text{Final answer} = 665
   \]

Thus, the number of good seashells they found together is **665**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tom found 214 seashells
- Nancy found 432 seashells
- Benny found 86 seashells
- 67 seashells were cracked

Step 1: Calculate the total number of seashells found.
Total seashells found = Tom's seashells + Nancy's seashells + Benny's seashells
Total seashells found = 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells

Step 2: Calculate the number of good seashells.
Good seashells = Total seashells found - Cracked ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of finding out how many good seashells Tom, Nancy, and Benny found together, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Seashells Found:**

   First, we need to add up the number of seashells each person found.

   - Tom found 214 seashells.
   - Nancy found 432 seashells.
   - Benny found 86 seashells.

   To find the total number of seashells, we add these numbers together:

   \[
   214 + 432 + 86
   \]

   Let's perform th...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find the total number of seashells that Tom, Nancy, and Benny found. We do this by adding the number of seashells each of them found:

214 (Tom's seashells) + 432 (Nancy's seashells) + 86 (Benny's seashells) = 732 seashells

Next, we need to subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells to find the number of good seashells. 

732 (total seashells) - 67 (cracked seashells) = 665 seashells

So, Tom, Nancy, and Benny found 665 ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- Tom found 214 seashells
- Nancy found 432 seashells
- Benny found 86 seashells
- 67 seashells were cracked

Step 1: Calculate the total number of seashells found by adding the number of seashells each person found.
Total seashells = Tom's seashells + Nancy's seashells + Benny's seashells
Total seashells = 214 + 432 + 86
Total seashells = 732

Step 2: Subtract the number of cracked seashells from th...
