=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls in the classroom.**
2. **Calculate the number of girls.**
3. **Find out how many girls own dogs and cats.**
4. **Calculate how many girls have no pets.**

### Step 1: Determine the number of boys and girls

We know that there are 30 students in total and that \( \frac{1}{3} \) of them are boys.

To find the number of boys:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 = 10
\]

Now, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 30 - 10 = 20
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of girls

From our calculation, we have:
- Number of girls = 20

### Step 3: Find out how many girls own dogs and cats

According to the problem:
- 40% of the girls own dogs.
- 20% of the girls own cats.

Now we will calculate the number of girls who own dogs:
\[
\text{Number of girls who own dogs} = 40\% \times 20 = 0.4 \times 20 = 8
\]

Next, we calculate the number of girls who own cats:
\[
\text{Number of girls who own cats} = 20\% \times 20 = 0.2 \times 20 = 4
\]

### Step 4: Calculate how many girls have no pets

Now, we need to find out how many girls have no pets. We can do this by subtracting the number of girls who own dogs and cats from the total number of girls.

First, we find the total number of girls who own pets (either dogs or cats):
\[
\text{Total girls with pets} = \text{Number of girls who own dogs} + \text{Number of girls who own cats} = 8 + 4 = 12
\]

Now, we can find the number of girls who have no pets:
\[
\text{Number of girls with no pets} = \text{Total number of girls} - \text{Total girls with pets} = 20 - 12 = 8
\]

### Final Answer

The number of girls in the class who have no pets is \( \boxed{8} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the number of boys in the class.
2. Find the number of girls in the class.
3. Find the number of girls who own dogs.
4. Find the number of girls who own cats.
5. Find the number of girls who have no pets.

Step 1: Find the number of boys in the class.
Total students in the class = 30
1/3 of the students are boys
Number of boys = 30 × 1/3 = 10

Step 2: Find the number of girls in the class....

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of girls in the class who have no pets. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of boys in the class:**
   - The problem states that 1/3 of the students are boys.
   - Total number of students = 30.
   - Number of boys = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 30 = 10 \).

2. **Determine the number of girls in the class:**
   - Total number of students = 30.
   - Number of boys = 10.
   - Number of girls ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many boys and girls are in the class. Since 1/3 of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

30 students * 1/3 = 10 boys

Since the total number of students is 30, the number of girls in the class is:

30 students - 10 boys = 20 girls

Next, we need to find out how many girls own dogs, cats, and how many have no pets. 

40% of the girls own dogs, so:

20 girls * 40/100 = 8 girls own dogs

20% of the girls own a ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Find the number of girls in the class:
   * There are 30 students in total.
   * 1/3 of the students are boys, so 2/3 must be girls.
   * Number of girls = 2/3 × 30 = 20 girls

2. Find the number of girls who own dogs:
   * 40% of the girls own dogs.
   * 40% = 40/100 = 0.4
   * Number of girls with dogs = 0.4 × 20 = 8 girls

3. Find the number of girls who own cats:
   * 20% of the girls own cats.
