=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of episodes across all seasons and then determine the total time it would take to watch them all.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of episodes in the first 9 seasons
Each of the first 9 seasons has 22 episodes. Therefore, the total number of episodes in these seasons is:

\[
\text{Total episodes in 9 seasons} = 9 \text{ seasons} \times 22 \text{ episodes/season} = 198 \text{ episodes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of episodes in the last season
The last season has 4 episodes more than the regular seasons. Therefore, the number of episodes in the last season is:

\[
\text{Episodes in last season} = 22 \text{ episodes} + 4 \text{ episodes} = 26 \text{ episodes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of episodes across all seasons
Now, we add the episodes from the last season to the total from the first 9 seasons:

\[
\text{Total episodes} = \text{Total episodes in 9 seasons} + \text{Episodes in last season}
\]
\[
\text{Total episodes} = 198 \text{ episodes} + 26 \text{ episodes} = 224 \text{ episodes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total time to watch all episodes
Each episode is 0.5 hours long. Therefore, the total time to watch all episodes is:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Total episodes} \times \text{Time per episode}
\]
\[
\text{Total time} = 224 \text{ episodes} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/episode} = 112 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer
It will take John a total of **112 hours** to watch all the episodes after the last season finishes.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There were 9 seasons before the announcement.
- Each season is 22 episodes, except for the last season, which is 4 episodes longer.
- Each episode is 0.5 hours long.

Step 1: Calculate the number of episodes in the last season.
Last season episodes = 22 + 4 = 26 episodes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of episodes in all the seasons.
Total episodes = (9 Ã— 22) + 26 = 218 + 26 =...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of episodes in all the seasons and then determine the total time it would take to watch all these episodes.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of episodes in the first 9 seasons.**

Each of the first 9 seasons has 22 episodes. Therefore, the total number of episodes in the first 9 seasons is calculated as follows:

\[
9 \text{ seasons} \times 22 \text{ episodes/season} = 198 \text{ episodes}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total number of episodes in the first 9 seasons. Since each season has 22 episodes, we multiply 22 by 9:

22 episodes/season * 9 seasons = 198 episodes

Next, we need to calculate the number of episodes in the final season. We know that the final season is 4 episodes longer than the usual 22, so we add 4 to 22:

22 episodes + 4 episodes = 26 episodes

Now we add the number of episodes in the first 9 seasons to the number in the final season to g...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given information:
- There were 9 seasons before the announcement.
- They announced 1 more season will be made.
- Each season has 22 episodes, except for the last season, which has 4 more episodes.
- Each episode is 0.5 hours long.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of seasons.
Total seasons = Seasons before announcement + Announced seasons
Total seasons = 9 + 1 = 10 seasons
