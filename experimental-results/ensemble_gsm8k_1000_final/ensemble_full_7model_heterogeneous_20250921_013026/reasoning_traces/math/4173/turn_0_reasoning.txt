=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many burgers Jack can make after preparing barbecue sauce for 18 pulled pork sandwiches, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of barbecue sauce Jack makes.**
   - Jack uses:
     - 3 cups of ketchup
     - 1 cup of vinegar
     - 1 cup of honey
   - The total amount of sauce is:
     \[
     \text{Total sauce} = 3 \text{ cups (ketchup)} + 1 \text{ cup (vinegar)} + 1 \text{ cup (honey)} = 5 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. **Determine how much sauce is used for the pulled pork sandwiches.**
   - Each pulled pork sandwich requires \( \frac{1}{6} \) cup of sauce.
   - For 18 pulled pork sandwiches, the total amount of sauce used is:
     \[
     \text{Sauce for pulled pork} = 18 \text{ sandwiches} \times \frac{1}{6} \text{ cup/sandwich} = 3 \text{ cups}
     \]

3. **Calculate the remaining sauce after making the pulled pork sandwiches.**
   - Jack started with 5 cups of sauce and used 3 cups for the pulled pork sandwiches:
     \[
     \text{Remaining sauce} = 5 \text{ cups} - 3 \text{ cups} = 2 \text{ cups}
     \]

4. **Determine how many burgers can be made with the remaining sauce.**
   - Each burger requires \( \frac{1}{4} \) cup of sauce.
   - To find out how many burgers can be made with 2 cups of sauce, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of burgers} = \frac{\text{Remaining sauce}}{\text{Sauce per burger}} = \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ cup/burger}} = 2 \text{ cups} \times 4 \text{ burgers/cup} = 8 \text{ burgers}
     \]

Thus, Jack can make a total of **8 burgers** with the remaining barbecue sauce after preparing for the pulled pork sandwiches.

Final answer: **8 burgers**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jack uses 3 cups of ketchup, 1 cup of vinegar, and 1 cup of honey to make the barbecue sauce.
- Each burger takes 1/4 cup of sauce.
- Each pulled pork sandwich takes 1/6 cup of sauce.
- Jack makes 18 pulled pork sandwiches.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of barbecue sauce made.
Total sauce = 3 cups of ketchup + 1 cup of vinegar + 1 cup of honey = 5 cups of sauce

Step 2: Calculate th...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much barbecue sauce Jack has in total and then calculate how many burgers he can make after making 18 pulled pork sandwiches.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of barbecue sauce Jack has.

Jack's barbecue sauce recipe includes:
- 3 cups of ketchup
- 1 cup of vinegar
- 1 cup of honey

The total amount of sauce is the sum of these ingredients:
\[ 
3 \text{ cups (ketchup)} + 1 \text{ cup (vinegar)} + 1 \text{ cup (honey)...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how much barbecue sauce Jack makes in total. He uses 3 cups of ketchup, 1 cup of vinegar, and 1 cup of honey, which adds up to 5 cups of sauce.

Next, we need to determine how much sauce Jack uses for the 18 pulled pork sandwiches. Each sandwich uses 1/6 cup of sauce, so 18 sandwiches use 18 * (1/6) = 3 cups of sauce.

Subtracting the sauce used for the sandwiches from the total amount of sauce gives us the amount of sauce left for the burgers....
