=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many pieces of candy Brent has left after giving some to his sister, we will first calculate the total amount of each type of candy he received, then sum them up, and finally subtract the number of lollipops he gave away.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of each type of candy

1. **Kit-Kat bars**: Brent received 5 Kit-Kat bars.
   \[
   \text{Kit-Kat} = 5
   \]

2. **Hershey kisses**: He received three times the amount of Kit-Kat bars.
   \[
   \text{Hershey kisses} = 3 \times 5 = 15
   \]

3. **Nerds**: He received 8 boxes of Nerds.
   \[
   \text{Nerds} = 8
   \]

4. **Lollipops**: He received 11 lollipops.
   \[
   \text{Lollipops} = 11
   \]

5. **Baby Ruths**: He received 10 Baby Ruths.
   \[
   \text{Baby Ruths} = 10
   \]

6. **Reese Peanut Butter Cups**: He received half the amount of Baby Ruths.
   \[
   \text{Reese Peanut Butter Cups} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of candy

Now we will sum all the pieces of candy:
\[
\text{Total candy} = \text{Kit-Kat} + \text{Hershey kisses} + \text{Nerds} + \text{Lollipops} + \text{Baby Ruths} + \text{Reese Peanut Butter Cups}
\]
Substituting the values we calculated:
\[
\text{Total candy} = 5 + 15 + 8 + 11 + 10 + 5
\]

Now, let's perform the addition step by step:
- First, add Kit-Kat and Hershey kisses:
  \[
  5 + 15 = 20
  \]
- Next, add Nerds:
  \[
  20 + 8 = 28
  \]
- Next, add Lollipops:
  \[
  28 + 11 = 39
  \]
- Next, add Baby Ruths:
  \[
  39 + 10 = 49
  \]
- Finally, add Reese Peanut Butter Cups:
  \[
  49 + 5 = 54
  \]

Thus, the total amount of candy Brent received is:
\[
\text{Total candy} = 54
\]

### Step 3: Subtract the lollipops given to his sister

Brent gave away 5 lollipops. We need to subtract this from the total amount of candy:
\[
\text{Candy left} = \text{Total candy} - \text{Lollipops given away}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Candy left} = 54 - 5 = 49
\]

### Final Answer

Brent has **49 pieces of candy left** after giving 5 lollipops to his sister.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many pieces of each type of candy Brent has. 

He has 5 Kit-Kat bars. 

He has three times that amount in Hershey kisses, so 5 Kit-Kat bars * 3 = <<5*3=15>>15 Hershey kisses.

He has 8 boxes of Nerds.

He has 11 lollipops.

He has 10 Baby Ruths.

He has half the amount of Reese Peanut butter cups as Baby Ruths, so 10 Baby Ruths / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 Reese Peanut butter cups.

Now, we add up all the pieces of candy Brent has: 5 Kit-Kat bars + 15 ...
