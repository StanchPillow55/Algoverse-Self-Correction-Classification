Final Answer: To determine how many stickers Xia had at the beginning, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of stickers left**: 
   Xia has five sheets of stickers left, and each sheet contains ten stickers. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of stickers she has left by multiplying the number of sheets by the number of stickers per sheet.

   \[
   \text{Stickers left} = \text{Number of sheets} \times \text{Stickers per sheet} = 5 \times 10 = 50
   \]

   So, Xia has 50 stickers left.

2. **Determine the total number of stickers she had initially**:
   We know that after sharing 100 stickers with her friends, Xia had 50 stickers left. To find out how many stickers she had at the beginning, we need to add the number of stickers she shared to the number of stickers she has left.

   \[
   \text{Total stickers initially} = \text{Stickers shared} + \text{Stickers left} = 100 + 50 = 150
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of stickers Xia had at the beginning is:

   \[
   \boxed{150}
   \]
