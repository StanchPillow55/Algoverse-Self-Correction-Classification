=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much change Laura received after her purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the pants and shirts she bought, and then subtract that total from the amount she gave to the cashier.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the pants.
Laura bought 2 pairs of pants, each costing $54.

\[
\text{Total cost of pants} = \text{Number of pants} \times \text{Cost per pair}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of pants} = 2 \times 54 = 108
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the shirts.
Laura bought 4 shirts, each costing $33.

\[
\text{Total cost of shirts} = \text{Number of shirts} \times \text{Cost per shirt}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of shirts} = 4 \times 33 = 132
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the purchase.
Now, we add the total cost of the pants and the total cost of the shirts to find the overall total cost.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of pants} + \text{Total cost of shirts}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 108 + 132 = 240
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the change Laura received.
Laura gave the cashier $250. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount given to the cashier.

\[
\text{Change} = \text{Amount given} - \text{Total cost}
\]
\[
\text{Change} = 250 - 240 = 10
\]

### Final Answer
Laura received **$10** in change.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Laura bought 2 pairs of pants for $54 each.
- Laura bought 4 shirts for $33 each.
- Laura gave the cashier $250.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the pants.
Cost of 2 pairs of pants = 2 × $54 = $108

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the shirts.
Cost of 4 shirts = 4 × $33 = $132

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the items purchased.
Total cost = Cost of pants + Cost of shirts
Total co...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Laura bought and then determine how much change she received from the cashier after paying with $250.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the pants.**

Laura bought 2 pairs of pants, each costing $54. To find the total cost of the pants, we multiply the number of pants by the cost per pair:

\[
2 \times 54 = 108
\]

So, the total cost for the pants is $108.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of t...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total cost of the pants and the shirts that Laura bought.

The cost of the pants is 2 pairs * $54 each = $108.
The cost of the shirts is 4 shirts * $33 each = $132.

So, the total cost of the pants and shirts is $108 + $132 = $240.

Laura gave the cashier $250. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the items from the amount she gave to the cashier.

So, the change Laura received is $250 - $240 = $10.
