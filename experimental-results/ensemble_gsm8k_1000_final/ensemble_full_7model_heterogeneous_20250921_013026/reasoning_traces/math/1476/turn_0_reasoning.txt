=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the weights of Mike, Megan, and Kelly, and then calculate their total weight to see how much it exceeds the bridge's weight limit of 100 kilograms.

1. **Determine Kelly's Weight:**
   - Kelly's weight is given as 34 kilograms.

2. **Determine Megan's Weight:**
   - We know that Kelly weighs 15% less than Megan. This means:
     \[
     \text{Kelly's weight} = \text{Megan's weight} - 0.15 \times \text{Megan's weight}
     \]
   - Let \( M \) be Megan's weight. Therefore, we can write:
     \[
     34 = M - 0.15M
     \]
   - Simplifying this, we have:
     \[
     34 = 0.85M
     \]
   - To find \( M \), we divide both sides by 0.85:
     \[
     M = \frac{34}{0.85} \approx 40
     \]
   - Thus, Megan weighs approximately 40 kilograms.

3. **Determine Mike's Weight:**
   - Mike weighs 5 kilograms more than Megan. Therefore:
     \[
     \text{Mike's weight} = M + 5 = 40 + 5 = 45 \text{ kilograms}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Weight of the Three Children:**
   - Now we can find the total weight of Mike, Megan, and Kelly:
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = \text{Kelly's weight} + \text{Megan's weight} + \text{Mike's weight}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = 34 + 40 + 45 = 119 \text{ kilograms}
     \]

5. **Determine How Much They Exceed the Weight Limit:**
   - The bridge can hold up to 100 kilograms. Therefore, we need to find out how much the total weight exceeds this limit:
     \[
     \text{Excess weight} = \text{Total weight} - \text{Weight limit}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Excess weight} = 119 - 100 = 19 \text{ kilograms}
     \]

Thus, the three children weigh **19 kilograms too much** to cross the bridge.

**Final Answer: 19 kilograms**

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total weight of the three children and compare it to the maximum weight the bridge can hold.

Given information:
- The bridge can hold up to 100 kilograms at once.
- Kelly weighs 34 kilograms.
- Kelly's weight is 15% less than Megan's weight.
- Mike's weight is 5 kilograms more than Megan's weight.

Step 1: Find Megan's weight.
Let Megan's weight be x kilograms.
Kelly's weight is 15% less than Megan's weight,...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the weights of Mike, Megan, and Kelly, and then calculate their total weight to see if it exceeds the bridge's capacity of 100 kilograms.

### Step 1: Determine Megan's Weight

We know that Kelly weighs 34 kilograms and that this is 15% less than Megan's weight. Let Megan's weight be \( M \) kilograms.

The relationship between Kelly's weight and Megan's weight can be expressed as:
\[ 34 = M - 0.15M \]

Simplifying the equation...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much Megan weighs. We know that Kelly weighs 15% less than Megan. So, if we let Megan's weight be x kilograms, we can set up the equation:

0.85x = 34 kg

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.85:

x = 34 kg / 0.85 = 40 kg

So, Megan weighs 40 kilograms.

Next, we find out how much Mike weighs. We know that Mike weighs 5 kilograms more than Megan. So:

Mike's weight = Megan's weight + 5 kg = 40 kg + 5 kg = 45 kg

Now, we ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The bridge can hold up to 100 kilograms.
   * Kelly weighs 34 kilograms, which is 15% less than Megan.
   * Mike weighs 5 kilograms more than Megan.

2. Find Megan's weight:
   * Kelly's weight = Megan's weight - 15% of Megan's weight
   * 34 = Megan's weight - 0.15 × Megan's weight
   * 34 = 0.85 × Megan's weight
   * Megan's weight = 34 ÷ 0.85
   * Megan's weight ...
