=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many rocks Jose collected**:
   - We know that Joshua collected 80 rocks.
   - Jose collected 14 fewer rocks than Joshua.
   - Therefore, we can calculate the number of rocks Jose collected as follows:
     \[
     \text{Rocks collected by Jose} = \text{Rocks collected by Joshua} - 14
     \]
     \[
     \text{Rocks collected by Jose} = 80 - 14 = 66
     \]

2. **Determine how many rocks Albert collected**:
   - Albert collected 20 more rocks than Jose.
   - We can calculate the number of rocks Albert collected as follows:
     \[
     \text{Rocks collected by Albert} = \text{Rocks collected by Jose} + 20
     \]
     \[
     \text{Rocks collected by Albert} = 66 + 20 = 86
     \]

3. **Determine how many more rocks Albert collected than Joshua**:
   - We need to find the difference between the number of rocks Albert collected and the number of rocks Joshua collected.
   - We can calculate this difference as follows:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Rocks collected by Albert} - \text{Rocks collected by Joshua}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 86 - 80 = 6
     \]

Thus, Albert collected 6 more rocks than Joshua.

**Final Answer**: Albert collected 6 more rocks than Joshua.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Joshua collected 80 rocks.
- Jose collected 14 fewer rocks than Joshua.
- Albert collected 20 more rocks than Jose.

Step 1: Calculate the number of rocks Jose collected.
Joshua collected 80 rocks.
Jose collected 14 fewer rocks than Joshua.
Jose's rocks = 80 - 14 = 66 rocks

Step 2: Calculate the number of rocks Albert collected.
Albert collected 20 more rocks than Jose.
Albert's ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rocks each person collected and then find out how many more rocks Albert collected than Joshua.

1. **Determine how many rocks Jose collected:**
   - We know Joshua collected 80 rocks.
   - Jose collected 14 fewer rocks than Joshua.
   - Therefore, the number of rocks Jose collected is:
     \[
     80 - 14 = 66
     \]

2. **Determine how many rocks Albert collected:**
   - Albert collected 20 more rocks than Jos...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many rocks Jose collected. Since Jose collected 14 fewer rocks than Joshua, we subtract 14 from Joshua's total of 80 rocks.

80 - 14 = 66 rocks

So, Jose collected 66 rocks.

Next, we need to find out how many rocks Albert collected. Since Albert collected 20 more rocks than Jose, we add 20 to Jose's total of 66 rocks.

66 + 20 = 86 rocks

So, Albert collected 86 rocks.

Finally, we need to find out how many more rocks Albert collected than ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the solution.

Given:
- Joshua collected 80 rocks.
- Jose collected 14 fewer rocks than Joshua.
- Albert collected 20 more rocks than Jose.

Step 1: Calculate the number of rocks Jose collected.
Jose's rocks = Joshua's rocks - 14
Jose's rocks = 80 - 14 = 66
So, Jose collected 66 ...
