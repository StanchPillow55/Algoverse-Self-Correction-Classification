=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to establish a relationship between the lengths of Topher's shoes and Bobby's shoes based on the information given.

1. **Convert Topher's shoe length to inches**:
   - Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches.
   - We know that 1 foot = 12 inches.
   - Therefore, 8 feet = \(8 \times 12 = 96\) inches.
   - Adding the 4 inches gives us:
     \[
     \text{Total length of Topher's shoe} = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Set up the equation**:
   - Let \( b \) represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches.
   - According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Topher's shoe length} = 9b + 10
     \]
   - We already calculated that Topher's shoe length is 100 inches. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     100 = 9b + 10
     \]

3. **Solve for \( b \)**:
   - First, we will isolate \( 9b \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:
     \[
     100 - 10 = 9b
     \]
     \[
     90 = 9b
     \]
   - Next, we divide both sides by 9 to solve for \( b \):
     \[
     b = \frac{90}{9} = 10
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( b = 10 \) inches.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.
- The length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches.

Step 1: Convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches.
8 feet = 8 × 12 inches = 96 inches
4 inches
Total length of Topher's shoe = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to find the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches, given the relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes.

### Step 1: Convert Topher's Shoe Length to Inches
First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know:
- 1 foot = 12 inches

Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Therefore, we convert the feet to inches and add the remaining inches:
\[ 
8 \text{ feet} = 8 \time...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet to inches because the length of Bobby's shoe is asked in inches. 

There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is 8 * 12 = 96 inches.

So, the total length of Topher's shoe in inches is 96 inches (from the 8 feet) + 4 inches = 100 inches.

The problem states that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes. We can write this as an equation: 

100 inches...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.
   * The length of Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches.

2. Convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to inches:
   * 8 feet = 8 × 12 inches = 96 inches
   * Topher's shoe length = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

3. Let's express the length of Topher's shoe...
