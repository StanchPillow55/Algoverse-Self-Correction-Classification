Final Answer: To determine how much the school will pay for the new seats, we can break the problem down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of seats**: 
   The school is adding 5 rows of seats, and each row has 8 seats. Therefore, the total number of seats can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total seats} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Seats per row} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ seats}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost without discount**: 
   Each seat costs $30. To find the total cost without any discounts, we multiply the total number of seats by the cost per seat:

   \[
   \text{Total cost without discount} = \text{Total seats} \times \text{Cost per seat} = 40 \times 30 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of groups of 10 seats**: 
   Since the parent offers a 10% discount on each group of 10 seats, we need to find out how many groups of 10 are in 40 seats. We can do this by dividing the total number of seats by 10:

   \[
   \text{Number of groups of 10} = \frac{\text{Total seats}}{10} = \frac{40}{10} = 4 \text{ groups}
   \]

4. **Calculate the discount for each group of 10 seats**: 
   The cost for each group of 10 seats can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Cost for 10 seats} = 10 \times 30 = 300 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Now, we calculate the 10% discount on this cost:

   \[
   \text{Discount for 10 seats} = 0.10 \times 300 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Therefore, the cost after the discount for each group of 10 seats is:

   \[
   \text{Cost after discount for 10 seats} = 300 - 30 = 270 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost after discounts**: 
   Since there are 4 groups of 10 seats, we multiply the discounted cost of one group by the number of groups:

   \[
   \text{Total cost after discounts} = \text{Cost after discount for 10 seats} \times \text{Number of groups} = 270 \times 4 = 1080 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Final answer**: 
   The total amount the school will pay for the new seats, after applying the discounts, is:

   \[
   \boxed{1080} \text{ dollars}
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total number of seats the school is adding. Since each row has 8 seats and the school is adding 5 rows, the total number of seats is 8 seats/row * 5 rows = 40 seats.

Next, let's calculate the total cost without any discount. Each seat costs $30, so the total cost is 40 seats * $30/seat = $1200.

Now, let's calculate the discount. The parent is offering a 10% discount on each group of 10 seats. Since the school is buying 40 seats, there are 40 s...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The school is adding 5 rows of seats to the auditorium.
   * Each row has 8 seats.
   * Each seat costs $30.
   * A parent offered a 10% discount on each group of 10 seats purchased.

2. Calculate the total number of seats being added:
   * Number of rows = 5
   * Number of seats per row = 8
   * Total seats = Number of rows × Number of seats per row
   * Total...
