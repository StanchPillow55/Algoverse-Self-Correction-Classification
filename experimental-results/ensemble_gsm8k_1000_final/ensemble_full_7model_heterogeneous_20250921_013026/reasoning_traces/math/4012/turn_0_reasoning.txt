=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Michael has to pay his friend to watch his pets, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of animals**: 
   - Michael has 2 cats and 3 dogs. 
   - To find the total number of animals, we add the number of cats and dogs together:
     \[
     \text{Total animals} = \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of dogs} = 2 + 3 = 5
     \]

2. **Determine the cost per animal**: 
   - The friend charges $13 per night for each animal.

3. **Calculate the total cost for one night**: 
   - To find the total cost for watching all the animals for one night, we multiply the total number of animals by the cost per animal:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for one night} = \text{Total animals} \times \text{Cost per animal} = 5 \times 13
     \]
   - Now, we perform the multiplication:
     \[
     5 \times 13 = 65
     \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   - Therefore, the total amount Michael has to pay his friend for one night of watching his pets is $65.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{65}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Michael has 2 cats and 3 dogs
- The friend charges $13 per animal per night

To find the total amount Michael has to pay, we need to calculate the cost for each type of animal and then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the cost for the cats.
Number of cats × Cost per cat per night = Total cost for cats
2 cats × $13 per cat per night = $26

Step 2: Calculate the cost for the dogs.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost Michael will incur for having his friend watch his pets. Here's how we can break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the number of animals:**
   - Michael has 2 cats.
   - Michael has 3 dogs.

2. **Calculate the total number of animals:**
   - Total animals = Number of cats + Number of dogs
   - Total animals = 2 cats + 3 dogs = 5 animals

3. **Determine the cost per animal per night:**
   - The friend charges $...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine the total number of animals Michael has. He has 2 cats and 3 dogs, so in total, he has 2 + 3 = 5 animals.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for one night. Since the friend charges $13 per animal per night, the total cost for one night would be 5 animals * $13/animal/night = $65/night.

Therefore, Michael has to pay $65 for one night of pet-sitting.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Michael has 2 cats and 3 dogs.
   * His friend charges $13 per night for each animal.

2. Calculate the total number of animals:
   * Total animals = Number of cats + Number of dogs
   * Total animals = 2 + 3
   * Total animals = 5

3. Calculate the total cost per night:
   * Cost per night = Charge per animal × Total animals
   * Cost per night = $13 × 5
   * Cost per...
