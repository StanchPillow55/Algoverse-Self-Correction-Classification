=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let \( d \) represent the number of drunk drivers in the traffic class. According to the problem, the number of speeders can be expressed in terms of the number of drunk drivers. Specifically, the number of speeders is given as "3 less than 7 times that many." This can be mathematically represented as:

\[
s = 7d - 3
\]

where \( s \) is the number of speeders.

The total number of students in the class is given as 45. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students:

\[
d + s = 45
\]

Now, substituting the expression for \( s \) into the total equation, we have:

\[
d + (7d - 3) = 45
\]

Next, we simplify the equation:

\[
d + 7d - 3 = 45
\]

Combining like terms gives:

\[
8d - 3 = 45
\]

Now, we will isolate \( d \) by first adding 3 to both sides of the equation:

\[
8d = 45 + 3
\]

\[
8d = 48
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( d \):

\[
d = \frac{48}{8}
\]

\[
d = 6
\]

Thus, the number of drunk drivers in the traffic class is \( \boxed{6} \).

To verify, we can calculate the number of speeders using the value of \( d \):

\[
s = 7d - 3 = 7(6) - 3 = 42 - 3 = 39
\]

Now, we check the total number of students:

\[
d + s = 6 + 39 = 45
\]

Since the total is indeed 45, our solution is confirmed. The final answer is \( \boxed{6} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of drunk drivers in the traffic class.

Given information:
- There are a certain number of drunk drivers.
- The number of speeders is 3 less than 7 times the number of drunk drivers.
- There are 45 students total in the traffic class.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of drunk drivers.
- Then, the number of speeders is 7x - 3.

We know that the total number of students is 45, which is ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given and solve for the number of drunk drivers.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of drunk drivers.

According to the problem, the number of speeders is 3 less than 7 times the number of drunk drivers. Therefore, we can express the number of speeders as:
\[ 7x - 3 \]

The total number of students in the class is given as 45. This total is the sum of the number of drunk drivers and the num...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of drunk drivers as D and the number of speeders as S. 

According to the problem, we have two equations:

1) D + S = 45 (since the total number of students is 45)

2) S = 7D - 3 (since the number of speeders is 3 less than 7 times the number of drunk drivers)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for D:

D + (7D - 3) = 45
8D - 3 = 45
8D = 48
D = 48 / 8
D = 6

So, there are 6 drunk drivers in the class.

To check our work, ...
