=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the points scored in the last home game**:
   - Lola's team scored 62 points in their last home game.

2. **Determine the points scored in the first away game**:
   - It is stated that the team scored twice as many points in their last home game as they did in their first away game. Let \( x \) be the points scored in the first away game.
   - According to the problem, \( 2x = 62 \).
   - To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     x = \frac{62}{2} = 31
     \]
   - Therefore, the team scored 31 points in their first away game.

3. **Determine the points scored in the second away game**:
   - The team scored 18 points more than the first away game in the second away game. Thus, the points scored in the second away game is:
     \[
     31 + 18 = 49
     \]

4. **Determine the points scored in the third away game**:
   - The team scored 2 more points than in the second away game in the third away game. Therefore, the points scored in the third away game is:
     \[
     49 + 2 = 51
     \]

5. **Calculate the cumulative points scored so far**:
   - Now, we will add the points from all games played:
     - Last home game: 62 points
     - First away game: 31 points
     - Second away game: 49 points
     - Third away game: 51 points
   - The total cumulative points scored is:
     \[
     62 + 31 + 49 + 51 = 193
     \]

6. **Determine the target cumulative points**:
   - The problem states that we want to bring the cumulative points up to four times the score from their last home game. Therefore, we calculate:
     \[
     4 \times 62 = 248
     \]

7. **Calculate the points needed in the next game**:
   - To find out how many points they need to score in the next game to reach the target cumulative points of 248, we subtract the current cumulative points from the target:
     \[
     248 - 193 = 55
     \]

Thus, Lolaâ€™s team needs to score **55 points** in their next game to bring their cumulative points up to four times the score from their last home game.

**Final Answer**: 55 points

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Lola's team scored 62 points at their last home game. 

Second, we know that they scored twice as many points at their last home game than their first away game. So, the score of the first away game is 62 / 2 = 31 points.

Third, we know that at the second away game, they scored eighteen more points than the first away game. So, the score of the second away game is 31 + 18 = 49 points.

Fourth, we know that a...
