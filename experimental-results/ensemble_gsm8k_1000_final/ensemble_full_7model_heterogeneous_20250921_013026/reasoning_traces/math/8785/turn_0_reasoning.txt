=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from the reservations over the course of a week.

1. **Calculate the total number of reservations per week:**
   - Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
   - The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of reservations per week is:
     \[
     \text{Total reservations per week} = \text{Reservations per night} \times \text{Number of open days}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total reservations per week} = 6 \text{ reservations/night} \times 2 \text{ nights/week} = 12 \text{ reservations/week}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from each reservation:**
   - Each reservation includes:
     - 2 meals at $5 each
     - 1 bottle of wine at $5
   - First, calculate the cost of the meals:
     \[
     \text{Cost of meals} = 2 \text{ meals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/meal} = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Next, add the cost of the wine:
     \[
     \text{Total cost per reservation} = \text{Cost of meals} + \text{Cost of wine} = 10 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue for the week:**
   - Now, we can find the total revenue generated from all reservations in a week:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue per week} = \text{Total reservations per week} \times \text{Total cost per reservation}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total revenue per week} = 12 \text{ reservations/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/reservation} = 180 \text{ dollars/week}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, Tom's restaurant makes a total of **$180** in a week.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{180}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
- They normally order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.
- The restaurant is open 2 days a week.

Step 1: Calculate the revenue per night.
Revenue per night = (2 meals × $5 per meal) + $5 bottle of wine
Revenue per night = ($10 + $5) = $15

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue per week.
Total revenue per week = Revenue per night...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue Tom's restaurant makes in a week based on the given information.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine the Revenue per Reservation:**
   - Each reservation orders 2 meals and 1 bottle of wine.
   - The cost of each meal is $5, so for 2 meals, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The cost of one bottle of wine is $5.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from one reservati...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much money Tom's restaurant makes per reservation. Each reservation orders 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. So, the total cost per reservation is 2*$5 + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15.

Next, let's calculate how much money the restaurant makes per night. The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night and each reservation brings in $15. So, the total income per night is 6*$15 = $90.

Finally, let's calculate how much money the restaurant makes...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given:
- Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
- They normally order 2 meals that cost $5 each.
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine per reservation.
- The restaurant is open 2 days a week.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost per reservation.
Cost of meals per reservation = 2 × $5 = $10
Cost of wine per reservation = $5
Total cost per reservation = Cost of meals + Cost of wine
Total ...
