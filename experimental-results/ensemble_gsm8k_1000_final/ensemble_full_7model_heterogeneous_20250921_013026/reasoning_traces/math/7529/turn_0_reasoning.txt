=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost for one trip to the movies and then see how many such trips he can afford with his budget of $42.

1. **Calculate the total cost for one trip:**
   - The cost of a movie ticket is $7.
   - The cost of popcorn is also $7.
   - Therefore, the total cost for one trip to the movies is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost per trip} = \text{Cost of ticket} + \text{Cost of popcorn} = 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine how many trips he can afford:**
   - Peter has a total of $42 to spend.
   - To find out how many trips he can afford, we divide his total budget by the cost per trip:
     \[
     \text{Number of trips} = \frac{\text{Total budget}}{\text{Cost per trip}} = \frac{42}{14}
     \]

3. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{42}{14} = 3
   \]

Thus, Peter can afford to go to the movies **3 times**.

4. **Final answer:**
Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find out how many times Peter can go to the movies with the $42 he has for the week.

Given information:
- The cost of a movie ticket is $7.
- The cost of popcorn is $7.
- Peter has $42 for the week.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of one trip to the movies.
Cost of a movie ticket + Cost of popcorn = Total cost of one trip to the movies
$7 + $7 = $14

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies this week, we need to calculate the total cost for each movie outing and then see how many such outings he can afford with his budget.

1. **Calculate the total cost per movie outing:**

   - Cost of a movie ticket: $7
   - Cost of popcorn: $7

   Total cost per outing = Cost of ticket + Cost of popcorn
   \[
   \text{Total cost per outing} = 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine how many outings Peter can...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The total cost for Peter to go to the movies once is the cost of the ticket plus the cost of the popcorn. 

So, the total cost for one movie outing is $7 (for the ticket) + $7 (for the popcorn) = $14.

Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we need to divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one movie outing.

So, the number of times Peter can go to the movies is $42 รท $14 = 3 times.

Therefore, Peter can go to the mo...
