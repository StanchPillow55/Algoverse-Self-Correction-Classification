=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Betty's sister has and then find the total number of books that both Betty and her sister have.

1. **Determine the number of books Betty has**:
   - According to the problem, Betty has 20 books.

2. **Calculate the number of books Betty's sister has**:
   - The problem states that Betty's sister has \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more books than Betty. 
   - To find out how many books this is, we first calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the number of books Betty has:
     \[
     \text{Books sister has} = 20 + \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 20\right)
     \]
   - First, calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 \):
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
     \]
   - Now, add this to the number of books Betty has:
     \[
     \text{Books sister has} = 20 + 5 = 25
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of books**:
   - Now that we know Betty has 20 books and her sister has 25 books, we can find the total number of books:
     \[
     \text{Total books} = \text{Books Betty has} + \text{Books sister has} = 20 + 25
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     \text{Total books} = 45
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - The total number of books that Betty and her sister have together is \( \boxed{45} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Betty has 20 books.
- Betty's sister has 1/4 times more books than Betty.

Step 1: Calculate the number of books Betty's sister has.
Betty's sister has 1/4 times more books than Betty.
Number of books Betty's sister has = Betty's books + 1/4 of Betty's books
Number of books Betty's sister has = 20 + (1/4 × 20)
Number of books Betty's sister has = 20 + 5
Number of books Betty's sister has = 25 ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Betty's sister has and then find the total number of books both Betty and her sister have together.

1. **Determine the number of books Betty's sister has:**

   - We know that Betty has 20 books.
   - Her sister has \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more books than Betty. This means her sister has Betty's number of books plus an additional \( \frac{1}{4} \) of Betty's books.

   - First, calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \) of Bett...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Betty's sister has 1/4 times more books than Betty. This means she has 1/4 * 20 = 5 more books than Betty.

So, Betty's sister has 20 + 5 = <<20+5=25>>25 books.

Together, Betty and her sister have 20 + 25 = <<20+25=45>>45 books.

Therefore, the total number of books the two have is 45.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Betty has 20 books.
   * Betty's sister has 1/4 times more books than Betty.

2. Calculate the number of books Betty's sister has:
   * Betty's sister's books = 1/4 times Betty's books
   * Betty's sister's books = 1/4 × 20
   * Betty's sister's books = 5

   So, Betty's sister has 5 books.

3. Calculate the total number of books the two have:
   * Total books = ...
