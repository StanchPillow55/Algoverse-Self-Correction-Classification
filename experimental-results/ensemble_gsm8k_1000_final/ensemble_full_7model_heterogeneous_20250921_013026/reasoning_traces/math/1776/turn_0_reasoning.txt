Final Answer: To determine the score William needs to achieve on his final exam to ensure the class averages at least 75%, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total score needed for the class to average 75%**:
   - The average score needed is 75% for 30 students.
   - Therefore, the total score needed for the class is:
     \[
     \text{Total score needed} = \text{Average score} \times \text{Number of students} = 75\% \times 30
     \]
   - Converting 75% to a decimal gives us 0.75. Thus:
     \[
     \text{Total score needed} = 0.75 \times 30 = 22.5
     \]
   - Since we are dealing with scores, we need to multiply by 100 (as scores are typically out of 100):
     \[
     \text{Total score needed} = 75 \times 30 = 2250
     \]

2. **Calculate the total score before William's exam**:
   - The average score before William took the exam was 74%.
   - Thus, the total score for the 29 students who took the exam is:
     \[
     \text{Total score before William} = 74\% \times 29 = 0.74 \times 29
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     \text{Total score before William} = 0.74 \times 29 = 21.46
     \]
   - Again, converting this to a score out of 100:
     \[
     \text{Total score before William} = 74 \times 29 = 2146
     \]

3. **Determine the score William needs**:
   - Let \( x \) be the score William needs to achieve on his exam.
   - The total score for the class after William takes the exam will be:
     \[
     \text{Total score after William} = \text{Total score before William} + x = 2146 + x
     \]
   - To find the score William needs to ensure the average is at least 75%, we set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{2146 + x}{30} \geq 75
     \]
   - Multiplying both sides by 30 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     2146 + x \geq 2250
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x \geq 2250 - 2146
     \]
     \[
     x \geq 104
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since scores are typically out of 100, it is impossible for William to score 104 on the exam. Therefore, it is not possible for the class to achieve an average of 75% with the current scores.

Thus, the final answer is that **William cannot achieve a score that will allow the class to average at least 75%**.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the score William must achieve on his exam to ensure the class average is at least 75%. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- There are 30 students in the class.
- 29 students have already taken the exam.
- The average score of these 29 students is 74%.
- William is the 30th student and has not yet taken the exam.
- The class needs an average of at least 75% for a pizza party...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The average of a set of numbers is the sum of all the numbers divided by the quantity of numbers. 

Before William took the test, the average score was 74%. This means that the sum of the scores of the 29 students who took the test is 74% * 29 = 2146%.

To get an average of 75% for the whole class of 30 students, the total sum of the scores needs to be 75% * 30 = 2250%.

So, to raise the average to 75%, William needs to score 2250% - 2146% = 104% on his test.

However, it...
