=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many weeks it will take Woody to save enough money to buy the games console, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total cost of the games console**: 
   The cost of the games console is $282.

2. **Determine how much money Woody already has**: 
   Woody currently has $42.

3. **Calculate how much more money Woody needs**: 
   To find out how much more money Woody needs, we subtract the amount he already has from the total cost of the console:
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Amount Woody has} = 282 - 42 = 240
   \]
   So, Woody needs $240 more.

4. **Identify Woody's weekly allowance**: 
   Woody receives an allowance of $24 every week.

5. **Calculate how many weeks it will take Woody to save the additional amount needed**: 
   To find out how many weeks it will take, we divide the amount Woody needs by his weekly allowance:
   \[
   \text{Weeks needed} = \frac{\text{Amount needed}}{\text{Weekly allowance}} = \frac{240}{24}
   \]
   Performing the division:
   \[
   \frac{240}{24} = 10
   \]

Thus, it will take Woody **10 weeks** to save the money he needs for the games console.

Final answer: **10 weeks**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Woody to save the remaining amount needed to buy the games console.

Given information:
- The games console costs $282.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how much more money Woody needs to save to afford the games console. To do this, we subtract the amount of money he already has from the cost of the games console. 

So, $282 (cost of the games console) - $42 (amount Woody already has) = $240 (amount Woody still needs to save).

Next, we need to determine how many weeks it will take Woody to save this amount. We know that Woody receives an allowance of $24 every week. So, we divide the total am...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The games console costs $282.
   * Woody already has $42.
   * Woody receives an allowance of $24 every week.

2. Calculate the amount of money Woody still needs to save:
   * Money needed = Cost of console - Money Woody has
   * Money needed = $282 - $42
   * Money needed = $240

3. Determine the number of weeks it will take to save the remaining amount:
   * Weeks to...
