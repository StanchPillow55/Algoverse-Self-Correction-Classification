=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Jack will have in his piggy bank after 8 weeks, given his initial amount and his weekly allowance.

1. **Initial Amount**: Jack starts with $43 in his piggy bank.

2. **Weekly Allowance**: Jack receives an allowance of $10 each week.

3. **Amount Saved Each Week**: Jack puts half of his allowance into his piggy bank. Therefore, the amount he saves each week is:
   \[
   \text{Amount saved each week} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Savings Over 8 Weeks**: To find out how much Jack will save over 8 weeks, we multiply the amount he saves each week by the number of weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total savings over 8 weeks} = 5 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Total Amount in Piggy Bank After 8 Weeks**: Now, we add the total savings over 8 weeks to the initial amount in the piggy bank:
   \[
   \text{Total amount in piggy bank} = \text{Initial amount} + \text{Total savings}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount in piggy bank} = 43 \text{ dollars} + 40 \text{ dollars} = 83 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, after 8 weeks, Jack will have a total of **$83** in his piggy bank.

Final answer: **$83**

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's figure out how much money Jack puts into his piggy bank each week. He gets $10 a week and puts half of it into his piggy bank. So, he puts $10 / 2 = $<<10/2=5>>5 into his piggy bank each week.

Next, let's figure out how much money Jack will put into his piggy bank after 8 weeks. He puts $5 into his piggy bank each week, so after 8 weeks, he will have put $5 * 8 = $<<5*8=40>>40 into his piggy bank.

Finally, let's add the money Jack already has in his piggy b...
