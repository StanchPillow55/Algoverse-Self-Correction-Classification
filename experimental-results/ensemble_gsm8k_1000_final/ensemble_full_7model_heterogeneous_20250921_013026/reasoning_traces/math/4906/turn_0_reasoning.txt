=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of legs in Monroe's collection of ants and spiders, we need to calculate the number of legs contributed by each type of creature and then sum those amounts.

1. **Determine the number of legs for spiders:**
   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   - Monroe has 8 spiders.
   - Therefore, the total number of legs from the spiders can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total legs from spiders} = \text{Number of spiders} \times \text{Legs per spider} = 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of legs for ants:**
   - Each ant has 6 legs.
   - Monroe has 12 ants.
   - Therefore, the total number of legs from the ants can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total legs from ants} = \text{Number of ants} \times \text{Legs per ant} = 12 \times 6 = 72 \text{ legs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of legs in the entire collection:**
   - Now, we add the total number of legs from the spiders and the ants:

   \[
   \text{Total legs} = \text{Total legs from spiders} + \text{Total legs from ants} = 64 + 72 = 136 \text{ legs}
   \]

Thus, the total number of legs in Monroe's collection of ants and spiders is:

\[
\boxed{136}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of legs of the ants and spiders in Monroe's collection.

Given information:
- Monroe has 8 spiders.
- Monroe has 12 ants.

Step 1: Find the total number of legs of the spiders.
Number of legs per spider = 8
Total number of legs of the spiders = 8 spiders Ã— 8 legs per spider = 64 legs

Step 2: Find the total number of legs of the ants.
Number of legs per ant = 6
Total number of legs of the ants = ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine the total number of legs in Monroe's collection of ants and spiders, we need to consider the number of legs each type of creature has and then calculate the total based on the quantities Monroe has.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine the number of legs per spider:**
   - Spiders are arachnids, and each spider has 8 legs.

2. **Calculate the total number of legs for all spiders:**
   - Monroe has 8 spiders.
   - Total legs from spiders = Number of...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Spiders have 8 legs and ants have 6 legs. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of spider legs. We do this by multiplying the number of spiders by the number of legs each spider has:

8 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 64 legs

Next, we calculate the total number of ant legs by multiplying the number of ants by the number of legs each ant has:

12 ants * 6 legs/ant = 72 legs

Finally, we add the total number of spider legs and ant legs to find the total number of legs i...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Monroe has 8 spiders and 12 ants.
   * We need to find the total number of legs of all the spiders and ants combined.

2. Determine the number of legs each creature has:
   * Spiders have 8 legs each.
   * Ants have 6 legs each.

3. Calculate the total number of spider legs:
   * Number of spiders = 8
   * Number of legs per spider = 8
   * Total spider legs = Nu...
