=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of trees Chris has:**
   Chris has 6 trees.

2. **Calculate the number of trees Ferdinand has:**
   According to the problem, Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. Therefore, we can calculate Ferdinand's trees as follows:
   \[
   \text{Ferdinand's trees} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Chris's trees} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of trees Harry has:**
   The problem states that Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. We first need to find twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has:
   \[
   \text{Twice Ferdinand's trees} = 2 \times \text{Ferdinand's trees} = 2 \times 3 = 6
   \]
   Now, we add 5 to this amount to find the number of trees Harry has:
   \[
   \text{Harry's trees} = \text{Twice Ferdinand's trees} + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11
   \]

4. **Calculate how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard:**
   To find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's trees} - \text{Ferdinand's trees} = 11 - 3 = 8
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the number of more trees in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard is:
   \[
   \boxed{8}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Chris has 6 trees in his yard.
- Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has.
- Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.

Step 1: Calculate the number of trees Ferdinand has.
Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has.
Ferdinand's trees = 6 รท 2 = 3 trees

Step 2: Calculate the number of trees Harry has.
Harry has 5 more than twice the number...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of trees in Ferdinand's and Harry's yards and then find the difference between them.

1. **Determine the number of trees in Chris's yard:**
   - According to the problem, Chris has 6 trees.

2. **Calculate the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard:**
   - Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has.
   - Since Chris has 6 trees, we calculate half of 6:
     \[
     \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out how many trees Ferdinand has. Since he has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 trees.

Next, let's figure out how many trees Harry has. Since Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, and Ferdinand has 3 trees, Harry has 5 + 2*3 = <<5+2*3=11>>11 trees.

Finally, to find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of...
