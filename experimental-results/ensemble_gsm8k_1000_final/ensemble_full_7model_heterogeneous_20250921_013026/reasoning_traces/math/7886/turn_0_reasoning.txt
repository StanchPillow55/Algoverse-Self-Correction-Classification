=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many of Marcy's candles will both smell like wet dog and explode. We will break this down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Marcy makes 50,000 candles.
   - 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles are expected to explode.
   - Among the candles that explode, 5% have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

2. **Calculating the Number of Exploding Candles**:
   - Since 1% of the candles explode, we can calculate the number of exploding candles as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of exploding candles} = 1\% \text{ of } 50000 = \frac{1}{100} \times 50000 = 500
     \]

3. **Calculating the Number of Exploding Candles that Smell Like Wet Dog**:
   - Now, we know that 5% of the exploding candles smell like wet dog. We can calculate this as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of exploding candles that smell like wet dog} = 5\% \text{ of } 500 = \frac{5}{100} \times 500 = 25
     \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
     \[
     \boxed{25}
     \] 

In conclusion, out of the 50,000 candles Marcy makes, 25 of them will both smell like wet dog and explode.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and have the potential to explode.

Given information:
- Marcy makes 50,000 candles.
- 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode.
- 5% of the more dangerous candles (1% of the total) have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

Step 1: Calculate the number of candles that have the potential to explode.
Total number of candles = 50,000
Percentage of c...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of Marcy's candles both explode and smell like wet dog.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Guarantee:**
   - Marcy's candles are marketed as 99% guaranteed not to explode. This means that 1% of the candles do explode.

2. **Calculate the Number of Exploding Candles:**
   - Marcy makes 50,000 candles in total.
   - 1% of these candles explode. To find the number of exploding candles, we ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many candles are likely to explode. Since Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, this means that 1% of them will explode. 

To find out how many candles this is, we multiply the total number of candles (50000) by 1% (or 0.01):

50000 * 0.01 = 500 candles

So, 500 candles are likely to explode.

Next, we need to find out how many of these exploding candles also smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the dangerous candles have this...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Marcy makes homemade candles.
   * 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles may explode.
   * 5% of the more dangerous candles (the ones that may explode) also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
   * Marcy makes a total of 50,000 candles.

2. Calculate the number of candles that may explode:
   * 1% of 50,000 candle...
