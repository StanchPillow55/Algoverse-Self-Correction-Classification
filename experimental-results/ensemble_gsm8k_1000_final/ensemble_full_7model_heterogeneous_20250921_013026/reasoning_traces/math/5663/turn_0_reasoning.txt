Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing the lawn:**
   - The rate for mowing is $14 per hour.
   - David mowed for 2 hours a day.
   - He mowed for a week, which we will assume is 7 days.

   First, we calculate the total hours he mowed:
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = \text{Hours per day} \times \text{Number of days} = 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ hours}
   \]

   Now, we calculate his total earnings:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Total hours} \times \text{Rate per hour} = 14 \text{ hours} \times 14 \text{ dollars/hour} = 196 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate how much money he spent on shoes:**
   - David spent half of his earnings on a pair of shoes.
   \[
   \text{Money spent on shoes} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Total earnings} = \frac{1}{2} \times 196 \text{ dollars} = 98 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining money after buying shoes:**
   - To find out how much money he has left after buying the shoes, we subtract the amount spent on shoes from his total earnings:
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Money spent on shoes} = 196 \text{ dollars} - 98 \text{ dollars} = 98 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate how much money he gave to his mom:**
   - David gave half of the remaining money to his mom.
   \[
   \text{Money given to mom} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Remaining money} = \frac{1}{2} \times 98 \text{ dollars} = 49 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate how much money he has left after giving money to his mom:**
   - Finally, we subtract the amount given to his mom from the remaining money:
   \[
   \text{Final amount left} = \text{Remaining money} - \text{Money given to mom} = 98 \text{ dollars} - 49 \text{ dollars} = 49 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the amount of money David has left is \(\boxed{49}\) dollars.

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing the lawn:**
   - The rate for mowing is $14 per hour.
   - David mowed for 2 hours a day.
   - He mowed for a week, which we will assume is 7 days.

   First, we calculate the total hours he mowed:
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = \text{Hours per day} \times \text{Number of days} = 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ hours}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- The rate for mowing a lawn is $14 per hour.
- David mowed for 2 hours a day for a week.
- He spent half of the money he made from mowing on a pair of shoes.
- He gave half of the remaining money to his mom.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money David made from mowing the lawn.
Total hours mowed = 2 hours per day × 7 days = 14 hours
Total money earned = $14 per hour × 14 hou...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps outlined in the problem statement and perform the necessary calculations.

1. **Calculate the total hours David mowed in a week:**

   David mowed for 2 hours each day. A week typically has 7 days, so the total number of hours he mowed in a week is:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing:**

   The rate for mowing is $14 per hour. Therefo...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): David mowed for 2 hours a day for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, he mowed for 2*7 = <<2*7=14>>14 hours in total.

At a rate of $14 per hour, David earned 14*14 = $<<14*14=196>>196 for mowing lawns for a week.

He spent half of the money he made from mowing a lawn on a pair of shoes, which is 1/2*196 = $<<1/2*196=98>>98.

After buying the shoes, David had 196-98 = $<<196-98=98>>98 left.

He gave half of the remaining money to his mom, which is 1/2*98 = $<<1/2*98...
