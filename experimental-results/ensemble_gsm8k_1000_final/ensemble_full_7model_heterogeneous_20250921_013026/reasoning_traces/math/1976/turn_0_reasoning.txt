Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of boats eaten by fish.**
2. **Calculate the number of boats shot with flaming arrows.**
3. **Determine the total number of boats left after both events.**

### Step 1: Calculate the number of boats eaten by fish

Madison makes a total of 30 paper boats. According to the problem, 20% of these boats are eaten by fish.

To find 20% of 30, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Number of boats eaten} = \text{Total boats} \times \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of boats eaten} = 30 \times \frac{20}{100} = 30 \times 0.2 = 6
\]

So, 6 boats are eaten by fish.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of boats shot with flaming arrows

Madison shoots 2 of the remaining boats with flaming arrows. 

### Step 3: Determine the total number of boats left

Now, we need to find out how many boats are left after both events (the fish eating and the arrows shooting).

First, we calculate the number of boats left after the fish have eaten some:

\[
\text{Boats left after fish} = \text{Total boats} - \text{Boats eaten}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Boats left after fish} = 30 - 6 = 24
\]

Next, we subtract the number of boats shot with flaming arrows:

\[
\text{Boats left after arrows} = \text{Boats left after fish} - \text{Boats shot}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Boats left after arrows} = 24 - 2 = 22
\]

### Final Answer

After calculating both events, the total number of boats left is:

\[
\boxed{22}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Madison makes 30 paper boats.

2. 20% of the boats are eaten by fish.
   * To calculate 20% of 30 boats:
   * 20% of 30 = 0.20 x 30 = 6 boats

3. So, the number of boats eaten by fish is 6.
   * 30 boats - 6 boats eaten = 24 boats remaining

4. Madison shoots two of the remaining boats with flaming arrows.
   * 24 boats - 2 boats shot = 22 boats remaining

Therefore, the final number of boats left is 22.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of Madison's paper boats remain after some are eaten by fish and others are shot with flaming arrows.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Boats:**
   Madison starts with 30 paper boats.

2. **Boats Eaten by Fish:**
   We are told that 20% of the boats are eaten by fish. To find out how many boats this is, we calculate 20% of 30.

   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many boats were eaten by fish. We know that 20% of the boats were eaten. To find this, we multiply the total number of boats by 20% (or 0.20 in decimal form):

30 boats * 0.20 = 6 boats

So, 6 boats were eaten by fish.

Next, we know that Madison shoots two of the remaining boats with flaming arrows. 

So, to find out how many boats are left, we subtract the number of boats eaten by fish and the number of boats shot by Madison from the total...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Madison makes 30 paper boats.
   * 20% of the boats are eaten by fish.
   * Madison shoots two of the remaining boats with flaming arrows.

2. Calculate the number of boats eaten by fish:
   * 20% of 30 boats = 0.2 × 30
   * 0.2 × 30 = 6 boats
   So, 6 boats are eaten by fish.

3. Calculate the number of boats remaining after the fish eat some:
   * Total boats -...
