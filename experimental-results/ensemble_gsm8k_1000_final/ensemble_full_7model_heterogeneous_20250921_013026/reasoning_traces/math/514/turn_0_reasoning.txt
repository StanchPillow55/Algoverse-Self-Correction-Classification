=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow Clara's actions step by step and keep track of the number of stickers she has at each stage.

1. **Initial Number of Stickers**: 
   Clara starts with a total of 100 stickers.

   \[
   \text{Initial stickers} = 100
   \]

2. **Giving Stickers to a Boy**: 
   Clara gives 10 stickers to a boy she likes. We need to subtract these 10 stickers from her initial amount.

   \[
   \text{Stickers after giving to boy} = 100 - 10 = 90
   \]

3. **Giving Half of Remaining Stickers to Friends**: 
   Now, Clara has 90 stickers left. She decides to give half of these stickers to her best friends. To find out how many stickers she gives away, we calculate half of 90.

   \[
   \text{Half of remaining stickers} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
   \]

   Now, we subtract the 45 stickers she gives to her friends from the 90 stickers she had.

   \[
   \text{Stickers after giving to friends} = 90 - 45 = 45
   \]

4. **Final Count of Stickers**: 
   After all the transactions, Clara has 45 stickers left.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Clara has } 45 \text{ stickers left.}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Clara starts with 100 stickers. She gives 10 stickers to a boy she likes, so we subtract 10 from 100.

100 - 10 = 90 stickers

Clara then gives half of the 90 stickers to her best friends. To find out how many stickers she gives to her friends, we divide 90 by 2.

90 รท 2 = 45 stickers

So, Clara gives 45 stickers to her friends. To find out how many stickers Clara has left, we subtract the number of stickers she gave to her friends from the number of stickers she had afte...

Given:
- Clara brings a package of 100 stickers to school.
- She gives 10 stickers to a boy she likes.
- She gives half of the remaining stickers to her best friends.

Step 1: Calculate the number of stickers Clara has after giving 10 stickers to the boy.
