=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many minutes Daniel practices basketball during a whole week, we can break the problem down into two parts: his practice during the school week and his practice during the weekend.

1. **Calculate daily practice during the school week:**
   - Daniel practices for 15 minutes each day.
   - The school week consists of 5 days (Monday to Friday).
   - Therefore, the total practice time during the school week is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total practice during school week} = \text{Daily practice} \times \text{Number of school days}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total practice during school week} = 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 75 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate daily practice during the weekend:**
   - On the weekend, Daniel practices twice as long as he does on a school day.
   - Therefore, his weekend practice time per day is:
     \[
     \text{Weekend practice per day} = 2 \times \text{Daily practice} = 2 \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - The weekend consists of 2 days (Saturday and Sunday).
   - Thus, the total practice time during the weekend is:
     \[
     \text{Total practice during weekend} = \text{Weekend practice per day} \times \text{Number of weekend days}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total practice during weekend} = 30 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate total practice time for the whole week:**
   - Now, we add the total practice time from the school week and the weekend:
     \[
     \text{Total practice for the week} = \text{Total practice during school week} + \text{Total practice during weekend}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total practice for the week} = 75 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 135 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of minutes Daniel practices basketball during a whole week is \( \boxed{135} \).

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Daniel practices basketball for 15 minutes each day during the school week. The school week is typically 5 days, so we can calculate the total minutes he practices during the school week by multiplying the number of days by the number of minutes he practices each day.

15 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 75 minutes/week

On the weekend, Daniel practices twice as long each day. This means he practices for 15 minutes/day * 2 = 30 minutes/day.

The weekend is typically 2 days, so...
