Final Answer: To find out how many pairs of socks Lisa ended up with, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pairs Lisa initially bought:**
   - Lisa bought 12 pairs of socks.

2. **Calculate the number of pairs Sandra brought:**
   - Sandra brought 20 pairs of socks.

3. **Calculate the number of pairs Lisa's cousin brought:**
   - Lisa's cousin brought one-fifth the number of pairs that Sandra bought. 
   - Since Sandra brought 20 pairs, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Cousin's pairs} = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ pairs}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of pairs Lisa's mom brought:**
   - Lisa's mom brought 8 more than three times the number of pairs Lisa started with.
   - First, we calculate three times the number of pairs Lisa started with:
     \[
     3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ pairs}
     \]
   - Now, we add 8 to this amount:
     \[
     \text{Mom's pairs} = 36 + 8 = 44 \text{ pairs}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of pairs of socks Lisa ended up with:**
   - Now we sum all the pairs of socks:
     - Lisa's initial pairs: 12
     - Sandra's pairs: 20
     - Cousin's pairs: 4
     - Mom's pairs: 44
   - Therefore, the total is:
     \[
     \text{Total pairs} = 12 + 20 + 4 + 44
     \]
   - Performing the addition step-by-step:
     \[
     12 + 20 = 32
     \]
     \[
     32 + 4 = 36
     \]
     \[
     36 + 44 = 80
     \]

Thus, Lisa ended up with a total of **80 pairs of socks**.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{80}
\]
