=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of songs that Beyonce has released, we need to consider the singles and the songs from the albums separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Count the singles:**
   - Beyonce has released 5 different singles.
   - Therefore, the total number of singles is:
     \[
     \text{Total singles} = 5
     \]

2. **Count the songs in the albums:**
   - She has released 2 albums, each containing 15 songs.
   - The total number of songs in these 2 albums can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Songs in 2 albums} = 2 \times 15 = 30
     \]

   - She also released 1 album that contains 20 songs.
   - Therefore, the total number of songs in this album is:
     \[
     \text{Songs in 1 album} = 20
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of songs from all albums:**
   - Now, we add the songs from the two albums and the one album:
     \[
     \text{Total songs from albums} = 30 + 20 = 50
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of songs released:**
   - Finally, we add the total number of singles to the total number of songs from the albums:
     \[
     \text{Total songs released} = \text{Total singles} + \text{Total songs from albums} = 5 + 50 = 55
     \]

Thus, the total number of songs that Beyonce has released is:
\[
\boxed{55}
\]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many songs are on the two albums that each have 15 songs. We do this by multiplying the number of albums by the number of songs on each album. 

2 albums * 15 songs/album = 30 songs

Next, we add the number of songs on the album that has 20 songs.

30 songs + 20 songs = 50 songs

Finally, we add the number of singles that Beyonce released on iTunes.

50 songs + 5 singles = 55 songs

So, Beyonce has released a total of 55 songs.
