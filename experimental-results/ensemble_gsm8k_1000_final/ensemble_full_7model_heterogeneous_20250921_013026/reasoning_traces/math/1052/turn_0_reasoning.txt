=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of James, John, and Tim based on the information provided.

1. **Understanding the ages**:
   - James turned 23 when John turned 35.
   - Tim is 5 years less than twice John's age.
   - We know Tim's age is 79.

2. **Setting up the equations**:
   - Let \( J \) represent James's age.
   - Let \( Jo \) represent John's age.
   - Let \( T \) represent Tim's age.

   From the problem, we know:
   - When James was 23, John was 35. This means the age difference between James and John is:
     \[
     Jo - J = 35 - 23 = 12
     \]
     Therefore, John is 12 years older than James:
     \[
     Jo = J + 12
     \]

3. **Using Tim's age**:
   - We know Tim's age \( T = 79 \).
   - Tim's age is also described as 5 years less than twice John's age:
     \[
     T = 2Jo - 5
     \]
   Substituting \( T = 79 \) into the equation gives:
   \[
   79 = 2Jo - 5
   \]

4. **Solving for John's age**:
   - Rearranging the equation:
     \[
     79 + 5 = 2Jo
     \]
     \[
     84 = 2Jo
     \]
     \[
     Jo = \frac{84}{2} = 42
     \]
   So, John is 42 years old.

5. **Finding James's age**:
   - Now we can find James's age using the relationship we established earlier:
     \[
     Jo = J + 12
     \]
   Substituting \( Jo = 42 \):
   \[
   42 = J + 12
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   J = 42 - 12 = 30
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, James is \( \boxed{30} \) years old.

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of James, John, and Tim based on the information provided.

1. **Understanding the ages**:
   - James turned 23 when John turned 35.
   - Tim is 5 years less than twice John's age.
   - We know Tim's age is 79.

2. **Setting up the equations**:
   - Let \( J \) represent James's age.
   - Let \( Jo \) represent John's age.
   - Let \( T \) represent Tim's age.

   From the problem, we know...

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- James turned 23 the same time John turned 35.
- Tim is 5 years less than twice John's age.
- Tim is 79 years old.

Step 1: Find John's age.
Since Tim is 5 years less than twice John's age, we can use the following equation:
Tim's age = 2 × John's age - 5
79 = 2 × John's age - 5
84 = 2 × John's age
John's age = 42

Step 2: Find James' age.
We know that James turned 23 the same time...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine James's age given the information about the ages of John and Tim.

1. **Understand the relationships:**
   - James turned 23 when John turned 35. This means there is a 12-year age difference between John and James (since 35 - 23 = 12).
   - Tim is 5 years less than twice John's age. We are given that Tim is 79 years old.

2. **Set up the equation for Tim's age:**
   - Let \( J \) represent John's current age.
   - According to ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how old John is. We know that Tim is 79 and that he is 5 years less than twice John's age. We can set up the equation 2J - 5 = 79, where J represents John's age.

To solve for J, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

2J = 79 + 5
2J = 84

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

J = 84 / 2
J = 42

So, John is 42 years old.

We know that James turned 23 the same time John turned 35. This means that James is 7 years younger than John (because 42 - 35 =...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * When James turned 23, John turned 35.
   * Tim is 5 years less than twice John's age.
   * Tim is currently 79 years old.

2. Find the age difference between James and John:
   * John's age - James' age = 35 - 23 = 12 years
   * This means John is always 12 years older than James.

3. Express Tim's age in terms of John's age:
   * Tim's age = 2 × John's age - 5
