=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of tomatoes from the first plant:**
   - The first tomato plant bore 8 tomatoes.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes from the second plant:**
   - The second plant bore 4 more tomatoes than the first plant. 
   - Therefore, the number of tomatoes from the second plant is:
     \[
     8 + 4 = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes from the first two plants:**
   - Now, we add the tomatoes from the first and second plants:
     \[
     8 + 12 = 20 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of tomatoes from the two remaining plants:**
   - Each of the two remaining plants bore three times the number of tomatoes as the first two plants combined. 
   - Since the first two plants combined produced 20 tomatoes, the total for the two remaining plants is:
     \[
     3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]
   - Since there are two remaining plants, each plant will bear:
     \[
     \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ tomatoes per plant}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes from all four plants:**
   - Now we add the tomatoes from all four plants:
     - First plant: 8 tomatoes
     - Second plant: 12 tomatoes
     - Third plant: 30 tomatoes
     - Fourth plant: 30 tomatoes
   - The total number of tomatoes is:
     \[
     8 + 12 + 30 + 30 = 80 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of tomatoes Mabel has is:
     \[
     \boxed{80}
     \]

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of tomatoes from all four tomato plants that Mabel planted. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of tomatoes on each plant:**

   - **First plant:** It bore 8 tomatoes.
   - **Second plant:** It bore 4 more tomatoes than the first plant. 
     \[
     \text{Number of tomatoes on the second plant} = 8 + 4 = 12
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes from the first two...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that one tomato plant bore 8 tomatoes. 

Second, another plant bore 4 more tomatoes than the first plant. So, this plant bore 8 + 4 = 12 tomatoes.

So far, two plants have borne a total of 8 + 12 = 20 tomatoes.

The problem states that the two remaining plants each bore three times the number of tomatoes as the first two plants combined. This means each of these plants bore 3 * 20 = 60 tomatoes.

So, the total nu...
