=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of necklaces Haley has**: 
   - We are given that Haley has 25 necklaces.

2. **Determine the number of necklaces Jason has**:
   - The problem states that Haley has 5 more necklaces than Jason. 
   - We can express this relationship with the equation:
     \[
     \text{Haley's necklaces} = \text{Jason's necklaces} + 5
     \]
   - Plugging in the number of necklaces Haley has:
     \[
     25 = \text{Jason's necklaces} + 5
     \]
   - To find the number of necklaces Jason has, we subtract 5 from both sides:
     \[
     \text{Jason's necklaces} = 25 - 5 = 20
     \]

3. **Determine the number of necklaces Josh has**:
   - The problem states that Josh has half the number of necklaces as Jason. 
   - We can express this relationship with the equation:
     \[
     \text{Josh's necklaces} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Jason's necklaces}
     \]
   - Substituting the number of necklaces Jason has:
     \[
     \text{Josh's necklaces} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
     \]

4. **Calculate how many more necklaces Haley has than Josh**:
   - We need to find the difference between the number of necklaces Haley has and the number of necklaces Josh has:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Haley's necklaces} - \text{Josh's necklaces}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 25 - 10 = 15
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Haley has 15 more necklaces than Josh.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Haley has 5 more necklaces than Jason.
- Josh has half the number of necklaces as Jason.
- Haley has 25 necklaces.

Step 1: Find the number of necklaces Jason has.
Since Haley has 5 more necklaces than Jason, we can use this equation:
Haley's necklaces = Jason's necklaces + 5
25 = Jason's necklaces + 5
Jason's necklaces = 20

Step 2: Find the number of necklaces Josh has.
Josh has half th...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of necklaces each person has and then find out how many more necklaces Haley has than Josh.

Let's break down the information given:

1. **Haley has 5 more necklaces than Jason.**
2. **Josh has half the number of necklaces as Jason.**
3. **Haley has 25 necklaces.**

We need to find out how many necklaces Jason and Josh have.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out how many necklaces Jason has. Since Haley has 5 more necklaces than Jason, and Haley has 25 necklaces, we can subtract 5 from 25 to find out how many necklaces Jason has. 

25 - 5 = 20 necklaces

So, Jason has 20 necklaces.

Next, let's figure out how many necklaces Josh has. Since Josh has half the number of necklaces as Jason, and Jason has 20 necklaces, we can divide 20 by 2 to find out how many necklaces Josh has.

20 / 2 = 10 necklaces
