=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many cans of soup Mark donates, we can break the problem down into several steps.

1. **Identify the number of shelters and people served**:
   - Mark donates soup to **6 homeless shelters**.
   - Each shelter services **30 people**.

2. **Calculate the total number of people served**:
   To find the total number of people served across all shelters, we multiply the number of shelters by the number of people each shelter serves:
   \[
   \text{Total people} = \text{Number of shelters} \times \text{People per shelter}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total people} = 6 \times 30 = 180
   \]

3. **Determine the number of cans of soup per person**:
   Mark decides to buy **10 cans of soup per person**.

4. **Calculate the total number of cans of soup**:
   To find the total number of cans of soup Mark donates, we multiply the total number of people by the number of cans per person:
   \[
   \text{Total cans of soup} = \text{Total people} \times \text{Cans per person}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cans of soup} = 180 \times 10 = 1800
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of cans of soup that Mark donates is:
   \[
   \boxed{1800}
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we first need to figure out how many cans of soup Mark donates to each homeless shelter. Since each shelter services 30 people and Mark buys 10 cans of soup per person, we multiply these two numbers together:

30 people * 10 cans/person = 300 cans/shelter

This means that Mark donates 300 cans of soup to each homeless shelter.

Next, we need to figure out how many cans of soup Mark donates in total. Since there are 6 homeless shelters and he donates...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mark donates soup to 6 homeless shelters.
   * Each shelter serves 30 people.
   * Mark decides to buy 10 cans of soup per person.

2. Calculate the number of people served in total:
   * Number of shelters = 6
   * People served per shelter = 30
   * Total people served = Number of shelters × People served per shelter
   * Total people served = 6 × 30 = 180 people
