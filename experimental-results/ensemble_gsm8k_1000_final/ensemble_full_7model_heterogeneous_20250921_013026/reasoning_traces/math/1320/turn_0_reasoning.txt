Final Answer: To find out how much money Shaniqua makes from giving haircuts and styles, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the earnings per service**:
   - For each haircut, Shaniqua earns $12.
   - For each hairstyle, she earns $25.

2. **Determine the number of services provided**:
   - Shaniqua gives 8 haircuts.
   - Shaniqua gives 5 hairstyles.

3. **Calculate the total earnings from haircuts**:
   To find out how much she makes from haircuts, we multiply the number of haircuts by the earnings per haircut:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings from haircuts} = \text{Number of haircuts} \times \text{Earnings per haircut}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings from haircuts} = 8 \times 12 = 96
   \]

4. **Calculate the total earnings from hairstyles**:
   To find out how much she makes from hairstyles, we multiply the number of hairstyles by the earnings per hairstyle:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings from hairstyles} = \text{Number of hairstyles} \times \text{Earnings per hairstyle}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings from hairstyles} = 5 \times 25 = 125
   \]

5. **Calculate the total earnings**:
   Now, we add the total earnings from haircuts and hairstyles to find her overall earnings:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Total earnings from haircuts} + \text{Total earnings from hairstyles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 96 + 125 = 221
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   Shaniqua would make a total of **$221** from giving 8 haircuts and 5 hairstyles.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{221}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Shaniqua makes $12 for every haircut and $25 for every style. 

If she gave 8 haircuts, she would make 8 * $12 = $<<8*12=96>>96.

If she styled 5 hair, she would make 5 * $25 = $<<5*25=125>>125.

To find out how much money Shaniqua would make in total, we add the amount she makes from haircuts to the amount she makes from styles.

So, $96 + $125 = $<<96+125=221>>221.

Therefore, Shaniqua would make $221 if she gave 8 haircuts and 5 styles.
