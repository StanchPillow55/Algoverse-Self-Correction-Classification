=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of legs at the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. 

1. **Birds**: Each bird has 2 legs. 
   - Number of birds = 3
   - Total legs from birds = 3 birds × 2 legs/bird = 6 legs

2. **Dogs**: Each dog has 4 legs.
   - Number of dogs = 5
   - Total legs from dogs = 5 dogs × 4 legs/dog = 20 legs

3. **Snakes**: Each snake has 0 legs.
   - Number of snakes = 4
   - Total legs from snakes = 4 snakes × 0 legs/snake = 0 legs

4. **Spider**: A spider has 8 legs.
   - Number of spiders = 1
   - Total legs from spiders = 1 spider × 8 legs/spider = 8 legs

Now, we will sum the total number of legs from all the animals:

\[
\text{Total legs} = \text{legs from birds} + \text{legs from dogs} + \text{legs from snakes} + \text{legs from spiders}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total legs} = 6 \text{ (from birds)} + 20 \text{ (from dogs)} + 0 \text{ (from snakes)} + 8 \text{ (from spider)}
\]

Calculating the sum:

\[
\text{Total legs} = 6 + 20 + 0 + 8 = 34
\]

Thus, the total number of legs at the pet shop is **34**.

Final answer: **34 legs**.

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To find the total number of legs at the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. 

1. **Birds**: Each bird has 2 legs. 
   - Number of birds = 3
   - Total legs from birds = 3 birds × 2 legs/bird = 6 legs

2. **Dogs**: Each dog has 4 legs.
   - Number of dogs = 5
   - Total legs from dogs = 5 dogs × 4 legs/dog = 20 legs

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of animal and then add them all together.

Given information:
- 3 birds
- 5 dogs
- 4 snakes
- 1 spider

Step 1: Calculate the number of legs for the birds.
Birds have 2 legs each.
Number of legs for birds = 3 birds × 2 legs per bird = 6 legs

Step 2: Calculate the number of legs for the dogs.
Dogs have 4 legs each.
Number of le...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of determining the total number of legs for the animals at the pet shop, we need to consider each type of animal separately and calculate the number of legs they contribute. Then, we will sum these amounts to find the total number of legs.

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Birds:**
   - Each bird has 2 legs.
   - There are 3 birds.
   - Total legs from birds = \(3 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 6 \text{ legs}\).

2. **Dogs:**
   - Each...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to know how many legs each type of animal has. 

Birds have 2 legs, dogs have 4 legs, snakes have 0 legs, and spiders have 8 legs.

We then multiply the number of each type of animal by the number of legs that type of animal has.

Birds: 3 birds * 2 legs = 6 legs
Dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs = 20 legs
Snakes: 4 snakes * 0 legs = 0 legs
Spiders: 1 spider * 8 legs = 8 legs

We then add up all the legs:

6 legs (from birds) + 20 legs (from dogs) + 0 l...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. To find the total number of legs, we need to multiply the number of each animal by the number of legs that animal has, and then add all the results together.

Given:
- There are 3 birds
- There are 5 dogs
- There are 4 snakes
- There is 1 spider

Step 1: Calculate the number of bird legs.
Birds have 2 legs each.
Number of bird legs = 3 birds × 2 legs per bird = 6 legs

Step 2: Calculate the number of dog ...
