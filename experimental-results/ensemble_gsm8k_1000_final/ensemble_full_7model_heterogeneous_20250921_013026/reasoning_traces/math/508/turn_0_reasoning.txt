=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how far James drove in total, we will break the problem down into two parts based on the information given.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance for the first part of the trip.

James drives at a speed of 30 miles per hour (mph) for half an hour.

1. **Convert half an hour to hours:**
   \[
   \text{Half an hour} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Use the formula for distance:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   For the first part:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 30 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance for the second part of the trip.

James drives for twice as long (1 hour) at twice the speed (60 mph).

1. **Calculate the time for the second part:**
   \[
   \text{Time}_2 = 2 \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

2. **Calculate the speed for the second part:**
   \[
   \text{Speed}_2 = 2 \times 30 \text{ mph} = 60 \text{ mph}
   \]

3. **Use the distance formula again for the second part:**
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 60 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total distance driven.

Now, we add the distances from both parts of the trip:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2
\]
\[
\text{Total Distance} = 15 \text{ miles} + 60 \text{ miles} = 75 \text{ miles}
\]

### Final Answer:
James drove a total of **75 miles**.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- James drives 30 mph for half an hour.
- Then he drives twice as long for twice the speed.

Step 1: Calculate the distance James drove in the first half hour.
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time James drove for the second part of the trip.
Time for the second part = 2 × 0.5 hours = 1 hour

Step 3: Calculate the speed for the second p...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance James drove in two parts of his journey. We'll break it down step by step.

### Part 1: First Segment of the Journey

1. **Speed**: James drives at 30 mph.
2. **Time**: He drives for half an hour, which is 0.5 hours.

To find the distance for this segment, we use the formula for distance:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Distance}_1 = 30 \, \te...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's break down the problem into two parts: the distance James drove at 30 mph and the distance he drove at twice the speed for twice the time.

1) James drives 30 mph for half an hour. 
The formula to calculate distance is speed multiplied by time. So, for this part of the journey, the distance he drove is:

30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles

2) Then he drives twice as long (1 hour) at twice the speed (60 mph). 
Again, using the formula for distance (speed * time), t...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * James drives at 30 mph for half an hour.
   * Then, he drives for twice as long at twice the speed.

2. Calculate the distance James drove in the first half hour:
   * Time = 0.5 hours
   * Speed = 30 mph
   * Distance = Speed × Time
   * Distance = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles
   So, James drove 15 miles in the first half hour.

3. Calculate the time and speed for th...
