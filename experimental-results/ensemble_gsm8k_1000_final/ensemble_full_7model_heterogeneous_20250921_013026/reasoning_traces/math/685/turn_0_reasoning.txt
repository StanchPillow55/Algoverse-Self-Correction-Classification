Final Answer: Let's denote the total number of kids in camp as \( x \).

According to the problem, half of the kids are going to soccer camp. Therefore, the number of kids going to soccer camp can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Kids going to soccer camp} = \frac{1}{2}x
\]

Next, we know that \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the kids going to soccer camp are going in the morning. Thus, the number of kids going to soccer camp in the morning is:

\[
\text{Kids going to soccer camp in the morning} = \frac{1}{4} \left(\frac{1}{2}x\right) = \frac{1}{8}x
\]

The remaining kids going to soccer camp must be going in the afternoon. Therefore, the number of kids going to soccer camp in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Kids going to soccer camp in the afternoon} = \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{8}x
\]

To simplify this expression, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \( \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \frac{1}{8} \) is 8. We can rewrite \( \frac{1}{2} \) as \( \frac{4}{8} \):

\[
\text{Kids going to soccer camp in the afternoon} = \frac{4}{8}x - \frac{1}{8}x = \frac{3}{8}x
\]

According to the problem, we know that 750 kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{8}x = 750
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{8}{3} \):

\[
x = 750 \times \frac{8}{3}
\]

Calculating the right-hand side:

\[
x = 750 \times \frac{8}{3} = 750 \times 2.6667 \approx 2000
\]

Now, let's calculate it step by step:

1. First, calculate \( 750 \times 8 = 6000 \).
2. Then divide by 3: \( \frac{6000}{3} = 2000 \).

Thus, the total number of kids in camp is:

\[
\boxed{2000}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of kids in the camp by working backward from the given information.

Given information:
- Half of the kids are going to soccer camp.
- 1/4 of the kids going to soccer camp are going in the morning.
- 750 kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon.

Step 1: Find the number of kids going to soccer camp in the morning.
Since 1/4 of the kids going to soccer camp are going in the morning, we can c...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of kids in the camp. We are given that half of the kids are going to soccer camp, and of those, 1/4 are going to soccer camp in the morning, while the remaining kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon. We know that 750 kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of kids in the camp.

2. **Kids G...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that 1/4 of the kids going to soccer camp are going in the morning, which means that the remaining 3/4 are going in the afternoon. If 750 kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of kids going to soccer camp:

3/4 * (total number of kids going to soccer camp) = 750

To solve for the total number of kids going to soccer camp, we can divide both s...
