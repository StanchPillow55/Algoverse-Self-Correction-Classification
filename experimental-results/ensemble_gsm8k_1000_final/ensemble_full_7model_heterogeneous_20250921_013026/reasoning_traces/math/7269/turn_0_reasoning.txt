=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much Stan pays the magician, we need to calculate the total number of hours the magician works and then multiply that by the hourly rate.

1. **Determine the number of hours worked per day:**
   The magician works for 3 hours each day.

2. **Determine the number of days worked in 2 weeks:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so in 2 weeks, the total number of days is:
   \[
   2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked:**
   Since the magician works 3 hours each day for 14 days, the total number of hours worked is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total payment:**
   The magician charges $60 per hour. Therefore, the total amount paid to the magician is:
   \[
   42 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ dollars/hour} = 2520 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Stan pays the magician is \(\boxed{2520}\) dollars.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how much Stan pays the magician per day. Since the magician works 3 hours a day and is paid $60 an hour, we multiply these two numbers together:

3 hours/day * $60/hour = $180/day

Next, we need to calculate how much Stan pays the magician for 2 weeks of work. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is 14 days. We multiply the daily rate by the number of days:

$180/day * 14 days = $2520

So, Stan pays the magician $2520 for 2 weeks of work.
