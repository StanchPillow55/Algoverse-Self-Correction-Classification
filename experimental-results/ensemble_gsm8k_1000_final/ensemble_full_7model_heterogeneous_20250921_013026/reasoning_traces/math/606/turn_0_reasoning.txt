=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of red marbles**:
   - We know there are 20 red marbles.

2. **Calculate the number of green marbles**:
   - According to the problem, there are three times more green marbles than red marbles.
   - Therefore, the number of green marbles is:
     \[
     \text{Number of green marbles} = 3 \times \text{Number of red marbles} = 3 \times 20 = 60
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of yellow marbles**:
   - Yellow marbles make up 20% of the green marbles.
   - Therefore, the number of yellow marbles is:
     \[
     \text{Number of yellow marbles} = 0.20 \times \text{Number of green marbles} = 0.20 \times 60 = 12
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of marbles**:
   - The total number of marbles in the box is three times more than the number of green marbles.
   - Therefore, the total number of marbles is:
     \[
     \text{Total number of marbles} = 3 \times \text{Number of green marbles} = 3 \times 60 = 180
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of marbles of a different color**:
   - We have already calculated the number of red, green, and yellow marbles:
     - Red marbles: 20
     - Green marbles: 60
     - Yellow marbles: 12
   - Now we can find the number of marbles of a different color by subtracting the known marbles from the total:
     \[
     \text{Number of marbles of a different color} = \text{Total number of marbles} - (\text{Number of red marbles} + \text{Number of green marbles} + \text{Number of yellow marbles})
     \]
     \[
     = 180 - (20 + 60 + 12) = 180 - 92 = 88
     \]

Thus, the number of marbles of a different color is \( \boxed{88} \).

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of marbles of each color and then find out how many marbles are of a different color than red, green, or yellow.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of green marbles:**
   - We know there are 20 red marbles.
   - The problem states that there are three times more green marbles than red marbles.
   - Therefore, the number of green marbles is:
     \[

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many green marbles there are. Since there are three times more green marbles than red, we multiply the number of red marbles by 3:

20 red marbles * 3 = 60 green marbles

Next, let's find out how many yellow marbles there are. Since yellow marbles make up 20% of the green marbles, we multiply the number of green marbles by 20% (or 0.2):

60 green marbles * 0.2 = 12 yellow marbles

Now, let's find out the total number of marbles in the box. Since ...
