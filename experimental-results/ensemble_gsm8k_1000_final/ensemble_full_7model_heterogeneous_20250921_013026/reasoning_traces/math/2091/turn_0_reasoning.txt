Final Answer: To determine how much Shara saved on the pair of shoes after applying the 8% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the relationship between the original price, discount, and final price**:
   - Let \( P \) be the original price of the shoes.
   - The discount is 8% of the original price, which can be expressed as \( 0.08P \).
   - The final price after the discount is applied can be expressed as:
     \[
     P - 0.08P = 0.92P
     \]
   - We know that Shara paid $184 for the shoes, so we can set up the equation:
     \[
     0.92P = 184
     \]

2. **Solve for the original price \( P \)**:
   - To find \( P \), we can rearrange the equation:
     \[
     P = \frac{184}{0.92}
     \]
   - Now, we perform the division:
     \[
     P = 200
     \]

3. **Calculate the amount saved**:
   - The amount saved is the discount, which is 8% of the original price \( P \):
     \[
     \text{Discount} = 0.08P = 0.08 \times 200
     \]
   - Now, we calculate the discount:
     \[
     \text{Discount} = 16
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Shara saved $16 on the pair of shoes.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The store has an 8% discount on all items.
- Shara paid $184 for a pair of shoes.

To find the amount Shara saved, we need to find the original price of the shoes before the discount.

Step 1: Calculate the discount amount.
Discount percentage = 8%
Discount amount = Original price × Discount percentage
Let's call the original price "x".
Discount amount = x × 0.08

Step 2: Calculate the final p...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how much Shara saved on the pair of shoes, we need to first understand the relationship between the original price, the discount, and the final price she paid.

1. **Understand the Discount:**
   - The store offers an 8% discount on all items. This means that the price Shara paid is 92% of the original price (since 100% - 8% = 92%).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the original price of the shoes.
   - The price Shara paid, which is $184, is ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to find out the original price of the shoes before the discount. 

We know that Shara paid $184, which is 92% of the original price (since she got an 8% discount). 

To find the original price, we can set up the equation:

0.92 * Original Price = $184

Solving for the Original Price, we get:

Original Price = $184 / 0.92 = $200

So, the original price of the shoes was $200. 

To find out how much Shara saved, we subtract the price she paid f...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. To find out how much Shara saved, we need to calculate the original price of the shoes before the discount and then subtract the amount she paid.

Given:
- The store has an 8% discount on all items.
- Shara paid $184 for a pair of shoes.

Step 1: Let's express the discount as a decimal.
8% = 8 ÷ 100 = 0.08

Step 2: Set up an equation to find the original price of the shoes.
Let x be the original price of the...
