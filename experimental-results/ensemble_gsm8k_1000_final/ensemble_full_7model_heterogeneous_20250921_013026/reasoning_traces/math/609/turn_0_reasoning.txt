=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much Angie paid in taxes this month, we can set up an equation based on the information provided.

1. **Identify Angie's total income**: 
   - Angie has a salary of $80 per month.

2. **Identify Angie's expenses**: 
   - She contributes $42 for necessities.
   - Let \( T \) represent the amount she pays in taxes.

3. **Calculate Angie's total expenses**: 
   - Her total expenses can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Total Expenses} = \text{Necessities} + \text{Taxes} = 42 + T
     \]

4. **Determine how much money Angie has left over**: 
   - At the end of the month, Angie has $18 left over. This means that her total income minus her total expenses equals $18:
     \[
     \text{Income} - \text{Total Expenses} = 18
     \]
   - Substituting the known values into the equation:
     \[
     80 - (42 + T) = 18
     \]

5. **Solve for \( T \)**:
   - First, simplify the equation:
     \[
     80 - 42 - T = 18
     \]
     \[
     38 - T = 18
     \]
   - Next, isolate \( T \):
     \[
     38 - 18 = T
     \]
     \[
     T = 20
     \]

Thus, Angie paid **$20** in taxes this month.
