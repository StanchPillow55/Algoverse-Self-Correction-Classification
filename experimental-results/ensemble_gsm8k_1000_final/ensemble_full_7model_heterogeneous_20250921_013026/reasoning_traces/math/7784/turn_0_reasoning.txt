=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many eggs the family consumes in a week based on the daily consumption of eggs by each family member.

1. **Identify the family members and their egg consumption:**
   - There are 5 family members in total.
   - Three of the family members eat 3 eggs each per day.
   - The remaining two family members eat 2 eggs each per day.

2. **Calculate the daily egg consumption for each group:**
   - For the three family members who eat 3 eggs each:
     \[
     \text{Eggs consumed by three members} = 3 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ eggs/member} = 9 \text{ eggs}
     \]
   - For the two family members who eat 2 eggs each:
     \[
     \text{Eggs consumed by two members} = 2 \text{ members} \times 2 \text{ eggs/member} = 4 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total daily egg consumption for the family:**
   - Now, we add the eggs consumed by both groups:
     \[
     \text{Total daily egg consumption} = 9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs}
     \]

4. **Calculate the weekly egg consumption:**
   - Since the family consumes 13 eggs each day, we need to find out how many eggs they consume in a week (7 days):
     \[
     \text{Total weekly egg consumption} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of eggs the family will consume in a week is:
     \[
     \boxed{91}
     \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The family has 5 people.
- 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
- The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.
- They eat eggs every day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs consumed by the 3 people who eat 3 eggs each day.
Number of eggs consumed by 3 people = 3 people × 3 eggs per day = 9 eggs per day

Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs consumed by the 2 people who eat 2 eggs each day.
Number of...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in one day and then extend that to a week.

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Identify the number of people and their egg consumption:**
   - There are 5 people in the family.
   - 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
   - The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

2. **Calculate the daily egg consumption for each group:**
   - For the 3 people who eat 3 eggs each:
     \[

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's figure out how many eggs are eaten each day. 

Three people in the family eat three eggs each day. So, they eat 3 people * 3 eggs/person/day = 9 eggs/day.

The rest of the family, which is 5 people - 3 people = 2 people, eat two eggs each day. So, they eat 2 people * 2 eggs/person/day = 4 eggs/day.

Adding these together, the family eats 9 eggs/day + 4 eggs/day = 13 eggs/day.

To find out how many eggs the family eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount b...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The family has 5 members.
   * 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
   * The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.
   * We need to find the total number of eggs consumed in a week.

2. Calculate the number of eggs consumed by the 3 people who eat 3 eggs per day:
   * 3 people × 3 eggs per day = 9 eggs per day
   * In a week: 9 eggs per day × 7 days = 63 eggs

3. Calculate t...
