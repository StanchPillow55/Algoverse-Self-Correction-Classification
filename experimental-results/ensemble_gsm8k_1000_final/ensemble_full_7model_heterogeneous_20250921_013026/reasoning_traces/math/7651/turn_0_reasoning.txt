=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of crabs each person has based on the information provided.

1. **Determine the number of crabs Bo has:**
   According to the problem, Bo has 40 crabs.
   \[
   \text{Bo's crabs} = 40
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of crabs Monic has:**
   The problem states that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, we can calculate Monic's crabs as follows:
   \[
   \text{Monic's crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of crabs Rani has:**
   The problem also states that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Thus, we can find Rani's crabs:
   \[
   \text{Rani's crabs} = \text{Monic's crabs} + 10 = 36 + 10 = 46
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of crabs the three have together:**
   Now that we have the number of crabs for each person, we can find the total by adding them together:
   \[
   \text{Total crabs} = \text{Rani's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Bo's crabs}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total crabs} = 46 + 36 + 40
   \]

5. **Perform the addition:**
   First, add Rani's and Monic's crabs:
   \[
   46 + 36 = 82
   \]
   Now, add Bo's crabs:
   \[
   82 + 40 = 122
   \]

Thus, the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together is:
\[
\boxed{122}
\]

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of crabs each person has based on the information provided.

1. **Determine the number of crabs Bo has:**
   According to the problem, Bo has 40 crabs.
   \[
   \text{Bo's crabs} = 40
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of crabs Monic has:**
   The problem states that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, we can calculate Monic's crabs as follows:

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic.
- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
- Bo has 40 crabs.

Step 1: Find the number of crabs Monic has.
Bo has 40 crabs, and Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
Monic's crabs = Bo's crabs - 4
Monic's crabs = 40 - 4 = 36 crabs

Step 2: Find the number of crabs Rani has.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic.
Rani's crabs = Monic's crabs + 10
Rani's crabs = 36...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of crabs each person has and then sum them up to find the total number of crabs.

1. **Determine the number of crabs Bo has:**
   - According to the problem, Bo has 40 crabs.

2. **Determine the number of crabs Monic has:**
   - The problem states that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
   - Since Bo has 40 crabs, we calculate the number of crabs Monic has as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of crabs Monic has} = \te...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Step 1: Find out how many crabs Monic has.
Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, and Bo has 40 crabs, we subtract 4 from 40 to find out how many crabs Monic has.
40 - 4 = 36 crabs
So, Monic has 36 crabs.

Step 2: Find out how many crabs Rani has.
Since Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, and Monic has 36 crabs, we add 10 to 36 to find out how many crabs Rani has.
36 + 10 = 46 crabs
So, Rani has 46 crabs.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of crabs the three have togethe...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the total number of crabs Rani, Monic, and Bo have together.

Given:
- Bo has 40 crabs.
- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
- Rani has ten more crabs than Monic.

Step 1: Calculate the number of crabs Monic has.
Monic's crabs = Bo's crabs - 4
Monic's crabs = 40 - 4 = 36

Step 2: C...
