=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine Viggo's current age based on the information provided about his younger brother's age.

1. **Understanding the Brother's Age**:
   - The younger brother is currently 10 years old.

2. **Finding the Brother's Age When He Was 2**:
   - If the brother is currently 10 years old, then he was 2 years old 8 years ago (because 10 - 2 = 8).

3. **Viggo's Age When the Brother Was 2**:
   - According to the problem, when the brother was 2 years old, Viggo's age was 10 years more than twice his brother's age at that time.
   - The brother's age at that time was 2 years.
   - Twice the brother's age when he was 2 is:
     \[
     2 \times 2 = 4
     \]
   - Therefore, Viggo's age at that time was:
     \[
     4 + 10 = 14
     \]

4. **Calculating Viggo's Current Age**:
   - Since the brother was 2 years old 8 years ago, Viggo was 14 years old at that time. 
   - To find Viggo's current age, we add 8 years to his age at that time:
     \[
     14 + 8 = 22
     \]

5. **Calculating the Sum of Their Ages**:
   - Now we have both their current ages:
     - Viggo's current age: 22 years
     - Brother's current age: 10 years
   - The sum of their ages is:
     \[
     22 + 10 = 32
     \]

Thus, the sum of Viggo's and his younger brother's ages is \( \boxed{32} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Viggo's age was 10 years more than twice his younger brother's age when his brother was 2 years old.
- Viggo's younger brother is currently 10 years old.

Step 1: Find Viggo's younger brother's age when Viggo's age was 10 years more than twice his younger brother's age.
Viggo's younger brother's age when Viggo's age was 10 years more than twice his younger brother's age = 2 years old

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine Viggo's current age and then find the sum of his age and his younger brother's current age.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( B \) be the age of Viggo's younger brother when he was 2 years old. So, \( B = 2 \).
   - Let \( V \) be Viggo's age when his brother was 2 years old.

2. **Establish the Relationship:**
   - According to the problem, Viggo's age was 10 years more than twic...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote Viggo's brother's age as B and Viggo's age as V.

From the problem, we know that when Viggo's brother was 2 years old, Viggo was 10 years more than twice his brother's age. This can be written as:

V = 2B + 10

At that time, B was 2, so we can substitute B = 2 into the equation:

V = 2*2 + 10 = 4 + 10 = 14

So, when Viggo's brother was 2 years old, Viggo was 14 years old.

Now, we know that Viggo's brother is currently 10 years old. This means 8 years have pa...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Viggo's younger brother is currently 10 years old.
   * When his younger brother was 2 years old, Viggo's age was 10 years more than twice his brother's age.

2. Find Viggo's age when his younger brother was 2 years old:
   * Younger brother's age at that time = 2 years
   * Viggo's age = 10 + (2 × Younger brother's age)
   * Viggo's age = 10 + (2 × 2)
   * Viggo...
