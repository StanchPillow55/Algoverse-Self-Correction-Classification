Final Answer: To find out how much Bob sells his cube of silver for, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the cube of silver.**
   The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cube with side length \( s \) is given by:
   \[
   V = s^3
   \]
   Given that the side length \( s \) is 3 inches:
   \[
   V = 3^3 = 27 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weight of the silver.**
   We know that each cubic inch of silver weighs 6 ounces. Therefore, the total weight \( W \) of the silver cube can be calculated as:
   \[
   W = \text{Volume} \times \text{Weight per cubic inch} = 27 \text{ cubic inches} \times 6 \text{ ounces/cubic inch}
   \]
   \[
   W = 162 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the silver value.**
   Each ounce of silver sells for $25. Therefore, the total silver value \( SV \) can be calculated as:
   \[
   SV = W \times \text{Price per ounce} = 162 \text{ ounces} \times 25 \text{ dollars/ounce}
   \]
   \[
   SV = 4050 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the selling price.**
   Bob sells the silver for 110% of its silver value. To find the selling price \( SP \), we calculate:
   \[
   SP = SV \times 1.10 = 4050 \text{ dollars} \times 1.10
   \]
   \[
   SP = 4455 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4455 \text{ dollars}}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The cube of silver measures 3 inches on each side.
- A cubic inch of silver weighs 6 ounces.
- Each ounce of silver sells for $25.
- Bob sells the silver for 110% of its silver value.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the cube of silver.
Volume of a cube = side length × side length × side length
Volume of the cube = 3 inches × 3 inches × 3 inches = 27 cubic inches

Step 2: Calculate the weight ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total selling price of Bob's silver cube. We'll break this down into several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Cube
The cube has sides measuring 3 inches each. The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[
V = \text{side}^3
\]
Substituting the side length:
\[
V = 3^3 = 27 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Weight of the Silver
Each cubic inch of silver weighs 6 ounces. Therefore, the...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find the volume of the cube. The formula for the volume of a cube is side length cubed. So, the volume of the cube is 3 inches * 3 inches * 3 inches = 27 cubic inches.

Next, we need to find the weight of the cube. Since a cubic inch of silver weighs 6 ounces, the cube weighs 27 cubic inches * 6 ounces/cubic inch = 162 ounces.

Then, we need to find the value of the silver in the cube. Since each ounce of silver sells for $25, the value of the silver in ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. Find the volume of the silver cube:
   * The cube measures 3 inches on each side.
   * Volume of a cube = side length^3
   * Volume = 3 inches × 3 inches × 3 inches = 27 cubic inches

2. Calculate the weight of the silver cube:
   * Each cubic inch of silver weighs 6 ounces.
   * Weight of the cube = Volume × Weight per cubic inch
   * Weight = 27 cubic inches × 6 ounces per cubic inch = 162 ounces
