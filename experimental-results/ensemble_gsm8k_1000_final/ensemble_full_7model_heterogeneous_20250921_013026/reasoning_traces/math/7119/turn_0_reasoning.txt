=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Jerry will have left after grocery shopping, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he needs to buy and then subtract that total from the $50 he has.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of mustard oil.**
- Jerry needs to buy 2 liters of mustard oil.
- The cost per liter is $13.

\[
\text{Cost of mustard oil} = \text{Number of liters} \times \text{Cost per liter} = 2 \, \text{liters} \times 13 \, \text{dollars/liter} = 26 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of gluten-free penne pasta.**
- Jerry needs to buy 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta.
- The cost per pound is $4.

\[
\text{Cost of gluten-free penne pasta} = \text{Number of pounds} \times \text{Cost per pound} = 3 \, \text{pounds} \times 4 \, \text{dollars/pound} = 12 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of pasta sauce.**
- Jerry needs to buy 1 pound of pasta sauce.
- The cost per pound is $5.

\[
\text{Cost of pasta sauce} = \text{Number of pounds} \times \text{Cost per pound} = 1 \, \text{pound} \times 5 \, \text{dollars/pound} = 5 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of all items.**
Now, we will add the costs of all the items together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of mustard oil} + \text{Cost of gluten-free penne pasta} + \text{Cost of pasta sauce}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 26 \, \text{dollars} + 12 \, \text{dollars} + 5 \, \text{dollars} = 43 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate how much money Jerry will have left.**
Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money Jerry has:

\[
\text{Money left} = \text{Total money} - \text{Total cost} = 50 \, \text{dollars} - 43 \, \text{dollars} = 7 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**
Jerry will have $7 left after grocery shopping.
