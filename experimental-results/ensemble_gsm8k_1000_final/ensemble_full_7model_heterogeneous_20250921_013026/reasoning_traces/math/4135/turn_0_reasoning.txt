=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we first need to determine how many teeth each adult had removed based on the information provided. Each adult has a total of 32 teeth. We'll calculate the number of teeth removed for each adult step by step.

1. **First Person:**
   - The first person had \( \frac{1}{4} \) of all his teeth removed.
   - Total teeth = 32
   - Teeth removed = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 32 = 8 \)

2. **Second Person:**
   - The second person had \( \frac{3}{8} \) of all his teeth removed.
   - Total teeth = 32
   - Teeth removed = \( \frac{3}{8} \times 32 = 12 \)

3. **Third Person:**
   - The third person had half of his teeth removed.
   - Total teeth = 32
   - Teeth removed = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 32 = 16 \)

4. **Fourth Person:**
   - The fourth person had 4 teeth removed.
   - Teeth removed = 4

Now, we can sum the number of teeth removed from all four adults:

\[
\text{Total teeth removed} = \text{Teeth removed by first person} + \text{Teeth removed by second person} + \text{Teeth removed by third person} + \text{Teeth removed by fourth person}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total teeth removed} = 8 + 12 + 16 + 4
\]

Calculating the total:

\[
8 + 12 = 20
\]
\[
20 + 16 = 36
\]
\[
36 + 4 = 40
\]

Thus, the total number of teeth removed at the dental clinic is:

\[
\boxed{40}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of teeth removed from the four adults at the dental clinic.

Given information:
- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult has 32 teeth.
- The first person had 1/4 of all their teeth removed.
- The second person had 3/8 of all their teeth removed.
- The third person had 1/2 of all their teeth removed.
- The fourth person had 4 teeth removed.

Step 1: Calculate the number of teeth removed from the first p...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of teeth removed for each of the four adults and then sum these numbers to find the total number of teeth removed.

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **First Person:**
   - Total teeth: 32
   - Fraction of teeth removed: \( \frac{1}{4} \)
   - Number of teeth removed: 
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 32 = 8
     \]

2. **Second Person:**
   - Total teeth: 32
   - Fraction of teeth removed: \( \frac{3}{8} \)
   - Numb...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Each adult has 32 teeth. 

The first person had 1/4 of his teeth removed. To find out how many teeth that is, we multiply 32 by 1/4:

32 * 1/4 = 8 teeth

The second person had 3/8 of his teeth removed. To find out how many teeth that is, we multiply 32 by 3/8:

32 * 3/8 = 12 teeth

The third person had half of his teeth removed. To find out how many teeth that is, we multiply 32 by 1/2:

32 * 1/2 = 16 teeth

The last person had 4 teeth removed. 

To find the total number ...
