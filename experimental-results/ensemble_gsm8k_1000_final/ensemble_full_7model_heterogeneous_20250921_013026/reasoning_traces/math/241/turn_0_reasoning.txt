=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many desktop computers were sold by Mr. Lu's store, given the total sales and the distribution of sales among different types of computers.

1. **Identify the total sales**: 
   Mr. Lu's store sold a total of 72 computers.

2. **Determine the fractions of sales**:
   - Half of the sales are laptops: 
     \[
     \text{Laptops} = \frac{1}{2} \times 72 = 36
     \]
   - One-third of the sales are netbooks:
     \[
     \text{Netbooks} = \frac{1}{3} \times 72 = 24
     \]

3. **Calculate the total sales of laptops and netbooks**:
   We can now add the number of laptops and netbooks sold:
   \[
   \text{Total laptops and netbooks} = 36 + 24 = 60
   \]

4. **Determine the number of desktop computers sold**:
   The rest of the sales are desktop computers. To find the number of desktop computers sold, we subtract the total number of laptops and netbooks from the total sales:
   \[
   \text{Desktop computers} = \text{Total sales} - \text{Total laptops and netbooks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Desktop computers} = 72 - 60 = 12
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the number of desktop computers sold is:
   \[
   \boxed{12}
   \]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many laptops and netbooks were sold.

Since half of the sales are laptops, we multiply the total sales by 1/2:
72 * 1/2 = 36 laptops

Since one-third of the sales are netbooks, we multiply the total sales by 1/3:
72 * 1/3 = 24 netbooks

To find out how many desktop computers were sold, we subtract the number of laptops and netbooks from the total sales:
72 - 36 - 24 = 12 desktop computers

So, Mr. Lu's store sold 12 desktop computers last mo...
