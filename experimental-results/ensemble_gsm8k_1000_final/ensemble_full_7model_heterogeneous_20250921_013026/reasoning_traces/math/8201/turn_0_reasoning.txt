=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we first need to determine the total number of spools she has and then find out how many of those spools are blue.

### Step 1: Count the total number of spools

Candy has the following spools:
- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Now, we can calculate the total number of spools by adding these quantities together:

\[
\text{Total spools} = \text{Light blue} + \text{Dark blue} + \text{Light green} + \text{Dark green}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total spools} = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. \(15 + 45 = 60\)
2. \(60 + 40 = 100\)
3. \(100 + 50 = 150\)

So, the total number of spools is:

\[
\text{Total spools} = 150
\]

### Step 2: Count the total number of blue spools

Next, we need to find the total number of blue spools. Blue spools consist of both light blue and dark blue spools:

\[
\text{Total blue spools} = \text{Light blue} + \text{Dark blue}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total blue spools} = 15 + 45
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Total blue spools} = 60
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the percentage of blue spools

To find the percentage of spools that are blue, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we found:

\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
\]

Calculating the fraction:

\[
\frac{60}{150} = 0.4
\]

Now, multiplying by 100 to convert to a percentage:

\[
0.4 \times 100 = 40
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue is:

\[
\boxed{40\%}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of spools Candy has and then calculate the percentage of blue spools.

Given information:
- Candy has 15 light blue spools of thread.
- Candy has 45 dark blue spools of thread.
- Candy has 40 light green spools of thread.
- Candy has 50 dark green spools of thread.

Step 1: Find the total number of spools Candy has.
Total number of spools = Light blue spools + Dark blue spools + Light green spool...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine what percent of Candy's spools are blue, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Spools:**

   Candy has the following spools:
   - Light blue: 15 spools
   - Dark blue: 45 spools
   - Light green: 40 spools
   - Dark green: 50 spools

   First, we sum up all the spools to find the total number of spools:
   \[
   \text{Total spools} = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50
   \]

   Calculating the sum:
   \[
   15 + 45 = 60
   \]
   \[
   60 + 40 = 1...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find the total number of spools of thread that Candy has. We do this by adding together the number of each color of spool she has:

15 light blue + 45 dark blue + 40 light green + 50 dark green = 150 total spools

Next, we need to find out how many of these spools are blue. We do this by adding together the number of light blue and dark blue spools:

15 light blue + 45 dark blue = 60 blue spools

Now we can find out what percent of her spools are blue. W...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Candy has 15 light blue spools of thread
   * Candy has 45 dark blue spools of thread
   * Candy has 40 light green spools of thread
   * Candy has 50 dark green spools of thread
   * We need to find the percentage of her spools that are blue

2. Calculate the total number of blue spools:
   * Total blue spools = Light blue spools + Dark blue spools
   * Total blue spo...
