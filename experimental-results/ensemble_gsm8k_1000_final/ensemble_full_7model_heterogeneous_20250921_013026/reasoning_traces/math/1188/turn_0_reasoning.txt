Final Answer: To find out how much total Preston received from Abra Company, we need to calculate the cost of the sandwiches, the delivery fee, and the tip. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the sandwiches:**
   - Preston charges $5 for each sandwich.
   - Abra Company orders 18 sandwiches.
   - The total cost for the sandwiches can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of sandwiches} = \text{Number of sandwiches} \times \text{Price per sandwich}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost of sandwiches} = 18 \times 5 = 90 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Add the delivery fee:**
   - Preston charges a delivery fee of $20.
   - We add this fee to the total cost of the sandwiches:
     \[
     \text{Total cost with delivery} = \text{Total cost of sandwiches} + \text{Delivery fee}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost with delivery} = 90 + 20 = 110 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the tip:**
   - Abra Company tips Preston 10% of the total cost (which includes the sandwiches and the delivery fee).
   - To find the tip, we calculate 10% of the total cost with delivery:
     \[
     \text{Tip} = 0.10 \times \text{Total cost with delivery}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Tip} = 0.10 \times 110 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount received by Preston:**
   - Finally, we add the tip to the total cost with delivery:
     \[
     \text{Total amount received} = \text{Total cost with delivery} + \text{Tip}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total amount received} = 110 + 11 = 121 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount that Preston received from Abra Company is \(\boxed{121}\) dollars.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the cost of the sandwiches. Preston charges $5 for each sandwich, and Abra Company ordered 18 sandwiches. So, the cost of the sandwiches is 5 * 18 = $90.

Next, we add the delivery fee. Preston charges $20 for delivery, so the total cost before the tip is 90 + 20 = $110.

Finally, we need to calculate the tip. Abra Company tips Preston 10% of the total cost before the tip. 10% of $110 is 0.10 * 110 = $11.

So, the total amount that Preston rece...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Preston charges $5 for each sandwich.
   * He charges a $20 delivery fee.
