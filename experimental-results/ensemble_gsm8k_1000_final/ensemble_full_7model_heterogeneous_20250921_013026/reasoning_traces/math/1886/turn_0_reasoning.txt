=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many months it will take for the Sterling Auto Store to sell all 500 cars, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cars sold by one salesperson in one month**:
   Each salesperson sells 10 cars per month. Since there are 10 sales professionals, we can calculate the total number of cars sold by all salespeople in one month as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total cars sold per month} = \text{Number of salespeople} \times \text{Cars sold per salesperson}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cars sold per month} = 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ cars}
   \]

2. **Determine how many months it will take to sell all 500 cars**:
   Now that we know the total number of cars sold per month is 100, we can find out how many months it will take to sell all 500 cars by dividing the total number of cars by the number of cars sold per month:

   \[
   \text{Number of months} = \frac{\text{Total number of cars}}{\text{Total cars sold per month}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of months} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ months}
   \]

Thus, it will take the Sterling Auto Store **5 months** to sell all 500 cars.

Final answer: **5 months**.
