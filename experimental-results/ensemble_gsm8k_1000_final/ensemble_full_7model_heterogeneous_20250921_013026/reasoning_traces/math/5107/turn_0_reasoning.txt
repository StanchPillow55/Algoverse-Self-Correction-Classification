=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the original borrowed amount, we can use the formula for simple interest, which is given by:

\[
I = P \times r \times t
\]

where:
- \( I \) is the interest earned (or paid),
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the original borrowed amount),
- \( r \) is the interest rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( t \) is the time the money is borrowed for (in years).

In this problem, we know:
- The total interest \( I = 1500 \) dollars,
- The interest rate \( r = 12\% = 0.12 \) (as a decimal),
- The time \( t = 1 \) year.

We need to find the principal amount \( P \).

Substituting the known values into the formula:

\[
1500 = P \times 0.12 \times 1
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
1500 = P \times 0.12
\]

To isolate \( P \), we can divide both sides of the equation by \( 0.12 \):

\[
P = \frac{1500}{0.12}
\]

Now, we perform the division:

\[
P = 1500 \div 0.12
\]

Calculating \( 1500 \div 0.12 \):

\[
P = 1500 \div 0.12 = 1500 \times \frac{100}{12} = 1500 \times \frac{25}{3} = 1500 \times 8.3333 \approx 12500
\]

Thus, the original borrowed amount \( P \) is:

\[
P = 12500
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12500}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the original borrowed amount given the interest rate and the total interest paid.

Given information:
- Interest rate: 12% per year
- Total interest paid: $1500

Let's denote the original borrowed amount as the principal (P).

Step 1: Set up the formula for simple interest.
Simple interest = (Principal × Interest rate × Time) / 100
$1500 = (P × 12 × 1) / 100

Step 2: Solve for the principal (P).
$1500 = (P × 12 ×...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the original amount of money borrowed, given that the interest rate is 12% per annum and the total interest paid over the year is $1500.

Let's denote the original borrowed amount as \( P \).

The formula for calculating simple interest is given by:

\[
I = P \times r \times t
\]

where:
- \( I \) is the interest,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the original borrowed amount),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (expressed ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem involves simple interest calculation. The formula for simple interest is:

I = PRT

where:
I = Interest
P = Principal amount (the initial amount of money)
R = Rate of interest
T = Time period

In this problem, we are given:
I = $1500
R = 12% = 0.12 (as a decimal)
T = 1 year

We are asked to find P, the original borrowed amount. We can rearrange the formula to solve for P:

P = I / (RT)

Substituting the given values:

P = $1500 / (0.12 * 1)

P = $1500 / 0.12

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The borrowed amount is unknown. Let's call it 'P' (for principal).
   * The interest rate is 12% per year.
   * The total interest paid is $1500.
   * The loan duration is 1 year.

2. Know the formula for simple interest:
   * Interest = Principal × Rate × Time
   * In this case, Time is 1 year, so we can simplify the formula to:
   * Interest = Principal × Rate

3. Plug...
