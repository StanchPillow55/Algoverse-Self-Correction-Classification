=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many sushi rolls James can make with the remaining fish, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of fish that went bad.**
   James bought 400 fish, and 20% of them went bad. We can calculate the number of bad fish as follows:

   \[
   \text{Number of bad fish} = 20\% \text{ of } 400 = \frac{20}{100} \times 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of usable fish.**
   To find out how many fish are still good and can be used, we subtract the number of bad fish from the total number of fish:

   \[
   \text{Number of usable fish} = \text{Total fish} - \text{Bad fish} = 400 - 80 = 320
   \]

3. **Determine how many sushi rolls can be made.**
   Each sushi roll requires 40 fish. To find out how many sushi rolls James can make with the remaining usable fish, we divide the number of usable fish by the number of fish needed for one sushi roll:

   \[
   \text{Number of sushi rolls} = \frac{\text{Usable fish}}{\text{Fish per sushi roll}} = \frac{320}{40} = 8
   \]

Thus, James can make **8 sushi rolls** with the remaining fish.

Final answer: **8 sushi rolls**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of fish that are still usable after the 20% of the fish have gone bad, and then calculate the number of sushi rolls James can make with the remaining fish.

Given information:
- James needs 40 fish to make one sushi roll.
- James bought 400 fish.
- 20% of the fish have gone bad and cannot be used.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fish that have gone bad.
20% of 400 fish = 0.20 × 400 = 80 fish

Step 2: ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many fish James can actually use after accounting for the fish that have gone bad, and then calculate how many sushi rolls he can make with the usable fish.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of fish that have gone bad.

James bought a total of 400 fish. We are told that 20% of these fish have gone bad.

First, we calculate 20% of 400:

\[
20\% \text{ of } 400 = \frac{20}{100} \times 400 = 0.2 \times 400 = 80
\]

So, 80 fish...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many fish have gone bad. We do this by calculating 20% of the total number of fish that James bought. 

20% of 400 fish = 0.20 * 400 = 80 fish

This means that 80 of the fish that James bought have gone bad and cannot be used.

Next, we subtract the number of bad fish from the total number of fish to find out how many fish James has left.

400 fish - 80 fish = 320 fish

Finally, we divide the number of good fish by the number of fish needed ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * James needs 40 fish to make one sushi roll.
   * He bought 400 fish from the market.
   * 20% of the fish have gone bad and cannot be used.

2. Calculate the number of fish that have gone bad:
   * 20% of 400 = 0.2 × 400
   * 0.2 × 400 = 80 fish have gone bad

3. Calculate the number of fish that are still usable:
   * Total fish bought - Fish gone bad = Usable f...
