=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break down the coffee consumption step by step.

1. **Initial Amount of Coffee**: Omar starts with a 12-ounce cup of coffee.

2. **Coffee Drank on the Way to Work**: 
   - Omar drinks one-quarter of the cup on the way to work.
   - One-quarter of 12 ounces is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{One-quarter of 12 ounces} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ ounces}
     \]
   - After drinking 3 ounces, the amount of coffee left in the cup is:
     \[
     12 \text{ ounces} - 3 \text{ ounces} = 9 \text{ ounces}
     \]

3. **Coffee Drank at the Office**:
   - Once at the office, Omar drinks another half of the cup.
   - Half of the remaining 9 ounces is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Half of 9 ounces} = \frac{1}{2} \times 9 = 4.5 \text{ ounces}
     \]
   - After drinking 4.5 ounces, the amount of coffee left in the cup is:
     \[
     9 \text{ ounces} - 4.5 \text{ ounces} = 4.5 \text{ ounces}
     \]

4. **Coffee Drank Later**:
   - Later, when Omar remembers his coffee, he drinks 1 ounce of the remaining amount.
   - After drinking 1 ounce, the amount of coffee left in the cup is:
     \[
     4.5 \text{ ounces} - 1 \text{ ounce} = 3.5 \text{ ounces}
     \]

5. **Final Amount of Coffee Left**:
   - The final amount of coffee left in the cup is 3.5 ounces.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3.5} \text{ ounces}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Omar buys a 12-ounce cup of coffee every morning.
- On the way to work, he drinks one-quarter of the cup.
- When he gets to his office, he drinks another half of the cup.
- He forgets to drink any more of his coffee once he starts working.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to track the amount of coffee Omar drinks at each stage and determine how much is left in the cup afterward.

1. **Initial Amount of Coffee:**
   - Omar starts with a 12-ounce cup of coffee.

2. **First Stage - Drinking on the Way to Work:**
   - Omar drinks one-quarter of the cup on the way to work.
   - Calculation: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3\) ounces.
   - Amount of coffee left after this stage: \(12 - 3 = 9\) ounces.

3. **Second Stage...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's break down how much coffee Omar drinks at each stage of his morning.

On the way to work, he drinks one-quarter of the 12-ounce cup. To find out how much this is, we multiply 12 ounces by 1/4:

12 ounces * 1/4 = 3 ounces

So, Omar drinks 3 ounces of coffee on the way to work.

When he gets to his office, he drinks another half of the cup. However, this is half of the remaining coffee, not half of the original 12 ounces. Since he already drank 3 ounces, there ...
