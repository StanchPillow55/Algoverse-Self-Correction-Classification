Final Answer: To determine how much money Sandy earned over the weekend, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate Sandy's earnings for Friday:**
   - Sandy worked for 10 hours on Friday.
   - Her hourly wage is $15.
   - To find her earnings for Friday, we multiply the number of hours worked by her hourly wage:
     \[
     \text{Earnings on Friday} = \text{Hours worked on Friday} \times \text{Hourly wage}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Earnings on Friday} = 10 \, \text{hours} \times 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 150 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate Sandy's earnings for Saturday:**
   - Sandy worked for 6 hours on Saturday.
   - Using the same hourly wage of $15, we calculate her earnings for Saturday:
     \[
     \text{Earnings on Saturday} = \text{Hours worked on Saturday} \times \text{Hourly wage}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Earnings on Saturday} = 6 \, \text{hours} \times 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 90 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate Sandy's earnings for Sunday:**
   - Sandy worked for 14 hours on Sunday.
   - Again, using her hourly wage of $15, we calculate her earnings for Sunday:
     \[
     \text{Earnings on Sunday} = \text{Hours worked on Sunday} \times \text{Hourly wage}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Earnings on Sunday} = 14 \, \text{hours} \times 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 210 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate total earnings for the weekend:**
   - Now we sum up her earnings from all three days:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings on Friday} + \text{Earnings on Saturday} + \text{Earnings on Sunday}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = 150 \, \text{dollars} + 90 \, \text{dollars} + 210 \, \text{dollars}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = 450 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

Thus, Sandy earned a total of **$450** over the weekend.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Sandy earns $15 per hour. 

On Friday, she worked for 10 hours. So, she earned 10 hours * $15/hour = $150 on Friday.

On Saturday, she worked for 6 hours. So, she earned 6 hours * $15/hour = $90 on Saturday.

On Sunday, she worked for 14 hours. So, she earned 14 hours * $15/hour = $210 on Sunday.

To find out how much Sandy earned in total over the weekend, we add up her earnings from Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. 

So, $150 (Friday) + $90 (Saturday) + $210 (Sunday) = $45...
