Final Answer: To find out how much Yulia spent to operate her lemonade stand, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the gross revenue from the lemonade stand**: Yulia made a gross revenue of $47 from her lemonade stand.

2. **Identify the net profit from the lemonade stand**: Yulia's net profit from the lemonade stand was $44.

3. **Understand the relationship between gross revenue, expenses, and net profit**: The net profit is calculated by subtracting the total expenses from the gross revenue. This can be expressed with the formula:
   \[
   \text{Net Profit} = \text{Gross Revenue} - \text{Expenses}
   \]

4. **Rearranging the formula to find expenses**: We can rearrange the formula to solve for expenses:
   \[
   \text{Expenses} = \text{Gross Revenue} - \text{Net Profit}
   \]

5. **Substituting the known values**: Now we can substitute the values we have into the rearranged formula:
   \[
   \text{Expenses} = 47 - 44
   \]

6. **Calculating the expenses**:
   \[
   \text{Expenses} = 3
   \]

Thus, Yulia spent **$3** to operate her lemonade stand.

Final answer: Yulia spent **$3** to operate her lemonade stand.

She made $47 from her lemonade stand and $31 from babysitting. So, the total money she made is $47 + $31 = $78.

However, we know that she only netted a profit of $44. This means that the difference between the total money she made and her profit is the cost of running her lemonade stand. 

So, the cos...
