=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many students do not have glasses in the local high school, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of students who have glasses**:
   We know that 40 percent of the students have glasses. To find this number, we first convert the percentage into a decimal and then multiply it by the total number of students.

   \[
   \text{Percentage of students with glasses} = 40\% = 0.40
   \]

   Now, we multiply this decimal by the total number of students:

   \[
   \text{Number of students with glasses} = 0.40 \times 325
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   0.40 \times 325 = 130
   \]

   So, there are 130 students who have glasses.

2. **Calculate the number of students who do not have glasses**:
   To find the number of students who do not have glasses, we subtract the number of students with glasses from the total number of students.

   \[
   \text{Number of students without glasses} = \text{Total students} - \text{Students with glasses}
   \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   \text{Number of students without glasses} = 325 - 130
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   325 - 130 = 195
   \]

Thus, the number of students who do not have glasses is **195**.

**Final Answer**: 195 students do not have glasses.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 325 students in the local high school.
- 40% of the students have glasses.

To find the number of students who do not have glasses, we need to first find the number of students who have glasses, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

Step 1: Find the number of students who have glasses.
40% of 325 students = 0.40 × 325 = 130 students

Step 2: Find the number of st...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of determining how many students do not have glasses, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of students with glasses:**

   We know that 40 percent of the students have glasses. To find the number of students with glasses, we calculate 40 percent of the total number of students.

   \[
   \text{Number of students with glasses} = 40\% \times 325
   \]

   To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:

   \[
   40\% = \f...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many students have glasses. We know that 40 percent of the students have glasses. 

To find 40 percent of 325, we multiply 325 by 0.40 (which is the decimal equivalent of 40 percent). 

325 * 0.40 = 130

So, 130 students have glasses.

Next, we need to find out how many students do not have glasses. 

We know that there are 325 students in total. If 130 students have glasses, then the number of students who do not have glasses is the total n...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 325 students in the local high school.
   * 40 percent of the students have glasses.

2. Calculate the number of students who have glasses:
   * To find the number of students with glasses, we need to calculate 40% of 325.
   * 40% can be written as a decimal: 40 ÷ 100 = 0.4
   * Number of students with glasses = 325 × 0.4 = 130

3. Calculate the number of stud...
