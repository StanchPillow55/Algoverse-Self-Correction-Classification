=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the price of the first house that Jill and Bob bought. We know the following:

1. The total price of both houses is $600,000.
2. The second house is twice as expensive as the first house.

Let's denote the price of the first house as \( x \). According to the information provided, the price of the second house would then be \( 2x \) (since it is twice as expensive).

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total price of both houses:

\[
x + 2x = 600,000
\]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
3x = 600,000
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:

\[
x = \frac{600,000}{3}
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
x = 200,000
\]

Now that we have the price of the first house, we can summarize:

- The price of the first house (which Jill and Bob bought) is \( x = 200,000 \).
- The price of the second house is \( 2x = 2 \times 200,000 = 400,000 \).

Finally, we confirm that the total price of both houses is indeed $600,000:

\[
200,000 + 400,000 = 600,000
\]

Thus, Jill and Bob ended up paying for their new house:

\[
\boxed{200,000}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the price of the first house that Jill and Bob ended up buying.

Given information:
- The price of the first house was accessible.
- The price of the second house was twice as expensive as the first one and was way over their budget.
- The total price of both houses is $600,000.

Let's represent the price of the first house as "x".

Step 1: Express the price of the second house in terms of the price of the first ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the price of the first house that Jill and Bob ended up buying. We know two key pieces of information:

1. The second house is twice as expensive as the first house.
2. The total price of both houses together is $600,000.

Let's use algebra to find the price of the first house.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the price of the first house.
   - Since the second house is twice as expensiv...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the price of the first house as X. According to the problem, the second house is twice as expensive as the first one, so its price is 2X.

The problem also states that the total price of both houses is $600,000. So, we can set up the following equation:

X + 2X = $600,000

This simplifies to:

3X = $600,000

To find the value of X, which represents the price of the first house, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

X = $600,000 / 3

X = $200,000

So, Ji...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to set up an equation and solve for the price of the first house, which is the one Jill and Bob bought.

Given:
- The second house is twice as expensive as the first one.
- The total price of both houses together is $600,000.

Step 1: Let's express the price of the second house in terms of the first house.
Price of the second house = 2 Ã— Price of the first house

Step 2: Set u...
