=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **First Try**: Homer scored 400 points.
   \[
   \text{Points on first try} = 400
   \]

2. **Second Try**: Homer scored 70 points fewer than the first try. To find the score on the second try, we subtract 70 from the first try's score.
   \[
   \text{Points on second try} = 400 - 70 = 330
   \]

3. **Third Try**: Homer scored twice the number of points she scored on the second try. To find the score on the third try, we multiply the second try's score by 2.
   \[
   \text{Points on third try} = 2 \times 330 = 660
   \]

4. **Total Points**: Now, we will calculate the total number of points scored across all three tries by adding the points from each try together.
   \[
   \text{Total Points} = \text{Points on first try} + \text{Points on second try} + \text{Points on third try}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Points} = 400 + 330 + 660
   \]

5. **Calculating the Total**:
   - First, add the points from the first and second tries:
     \[
     400 + 330 = 730
     \]
   - Next, add the result to the points from the third try:
     \[
     730 + 660 = 1390
     \]

Thus, the total number of points that Homer scored in all tries is:
\[
\boxed{1390}
\]

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **First Try**: Homer scored 400 points.
   \[
   \text{Points on first try} = 400
   \]

2. **Second Try**: Homer scored 70 points fewer than the first try. To find the score on the second try, we subtract 70 from the first try's score.
   \[
   \text{Points on second try} = 400 - 70 = 330
   \]

3. **Third Try**: Homer scored twice the number of points she scored on the second try. To find the score on t...

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Homer scored 400 points on the first try.
- Homer scored 70 points fewer on the second try.
- Homer scored twice the number of points on the third try compared to the second try.

Step 1: Calculate the number of points scored on the second try.
Points scored on the first try - 70 points = Points scored on the second try
400 points - 70 points = 330 points

Step 2: Calculate the nu...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of points Homer scored across all three tries in the Candy Crush game. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Try:**
   Homer scored 400 points on the first try.

2. **Second Try:**
   Homer scored 70 points fewer than the first try on the second try. 
   - First, we calculate the points scored on the second try:
     \[
     \text{Points on second try} = \text{Points on first try} - 70 = 400 - 70 = 330
 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Homer scored 400 points on the first try.

On the second try, she scored 70 points fewer than the first try. So, she scored 400 - 70 = 330 points on the second try.

On the third try, she scored twice the number of points she scored on the second try. So, she scored 2 * 330 = 660 points on the third try.

To find the total number of points she scored in all tries, we add the points she scored on each try. So, the total number of points she scored is 400 (first try) + 330 ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll find the points Homer scored in each try and then add them up to get the total points.

Given:
- Homer scored 400 points on the first try.
- On the second try, she scored 70 points fewer than the first try.
- On the third try, she scored twice the number of points she scored on the second try.

Step 1: Find the points scored on the second try.
Second try points = First try points - 70
Second try poi...
