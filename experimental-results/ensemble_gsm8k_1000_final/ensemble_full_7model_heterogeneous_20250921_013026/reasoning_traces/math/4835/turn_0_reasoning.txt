=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the cost of each item Sofia wants to buy.

1. **Determine the cost of a shirt:**
   - The cost of one shirt is given as $7.

2. **Determine the cost of a pair of shoes:**
   - The pair of shoes costs $3 more than the shirt.
   - Therefore, the cost of the shoes is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of shoes} = \text{Cost of shirt} + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of 2 shirts:**
   - Since each shirt costs $7, the total cost for 2 shirts is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of 2 shirts} = 2 \times \text{Cost of shirt} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the shoes and the 2 shirts:**
   - Now we add the cost of the shoes to the total cost of the shirts:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of shoes and 2 shirts} = \text{Cost of shoes} + \text{Total cost of 2 shirts} = 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Determine the cost of the bag:**
   - The bag costs half the total price of the 2 shirts and the pair of shoes. Therefore, the cost of the bag is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of bag} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Total cost of shoes and 2 shirts} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total amount Sofia will pay:**
   - Finally, we add the total cost of the shoes, the 2 shirts, and the bag:
     \[
     \text{Total amount paid} = \text{Total cost of shoes and 2 shirts} + \text{Cost of bag} = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]

Next, we know that a pair of shoes is $3 more than the cost of a shirt. So, the cost of the shoes is $7 + $3 = $10.

Now, we know that the bag costs half the total price of the 2 shirts and a pair of shoes. So, we first need to find the total price of the 2 shirts and the shoes, which is $14 + $10 = $24. Then, we fi...
