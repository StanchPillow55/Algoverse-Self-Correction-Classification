=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many of Mr. Sanchez's Grade 5 students received a final grade of B or above, given that 40% of his students received a final grade below B.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of students below grade B

First, we need to find out how many students got a final grade below B. Since 40% of the students received a grade below B, we can calculate this number by taking 40% of the total number of students.

Total number of students = 60

Percentage of students below B = 40%

To find the number of students below B, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of students below B} = \text{Total students} \times \left(\frac{\text{Percentage below B}}{100}\right)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of students below B} = 60 \times \left(\frac{40}{100}\right) = 60 \times 0.4 = 24
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of students with grade B and above

Now that we know 24 students received a grade below B, we can find out how many students received a grade of B or above by subtracting the number of students below B from the total number of students.

\[
\text{Number of students with grade B and above} = \text{Total students} - \text{Number of students below B}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of students with grade B and above} = 60 - 24 = 36
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of Mr. Sanchez's Grade 5 students who got a final grade of B and above is:

\[
\boxed{36}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many students got a final grade below B. 

Since 40% of his students got a final grade below B, we calculate 40% of 60. 

To do this, we multiply 60 by 0.40 (which is the decimal equivalent of 40%). 

60 * 0.40 = 24

So, 24 students got a final grade below B.

Next, we need to find out how many students got a final grade of B and above. 

To do this, we subtract the number of students who got a final grade below B from the total number of st...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mr. Sanchez has 60 students in Grade 5.
   * 40% of his Grade 5 students got a final grade below B.

2. Calculate the number of students who got a final grade below B:
   * 40% of 60 students = 0.4 × 60
   * 0.4 × 60 = 24 students
   * So, 24 students got a final grade below B.

3. Calculate the number of students who got a final grade of B and above:
