=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first determine the number of pets each person has, starting with Teddy, then moving on to Ben and Dave.

1. **Teddy's Pets:**
   - Teddy has 7 dogs and 8 cats.
   - Total pets for Teddy = Number of dogs + Number of cats
   \[
   \text{Total pets for Teddy} = 7 + 8 = 15
   \]

2. **Ben's Pets:**
   - Ben has 9 more dogs than Teddy.
   - Therefore, the number of dogs Ben has = Teddy's dogs + 9
   \[
   \text{Ben's dogs} = 7 + 9 = 16
   \]
   - Ben has the same number of cats as Teddy, which is 8.
   - Total pets for Ben = Number of dogs + Number of cats
   \[
   \text{Total pets for Ben} = 16 + 8 = 24
   \]

3. **Dave's Pets:**
   - Dave has 5 less dogs than Teddy.
   - Therefore, the number of dogs Dave has = Teddy's dogs - 5
   \[
   \text{Dave's dogs} = 7 - 5 = 2
   \]
   - Dave has 13 more cats than Teddy.
   - Therefore, the number of cats Dave has = Teddy's cats + 13
   \[
   \text{Dave's cats} = 8 + 13 = 21
   \]
   - Total pets for Dave = Number of dogs + Number of cats
   \[
   \text{Total pets for Dave} = 2 + 21 = 23
   \]

4. **Total Pets for All:**
   - Now, we will add the total number of pets for Teddy, Ben, and Dave.
   \[
   \text{Total pets for all} = \text{Total pets for Teddy} + \text{Total pets for Ben} + \text{Total pets for Dave}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total pets for all} = 15 + 24 + 23
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total pets for all} = 62
   \]

Thus, the total number of pets that Teddy, Ben, and Dave have combined is **62**. 

Final answer: **62**

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Teddy has 7 dogs and 8 cats.
- Ben has 9 more dogs than Teddy.
- Dave has 13 more cats and 5 less dogs than Teddy.

Step 1: Calculate the number of dogs and cats that Ben has.
Ben's dogs = Teddy's dogs + 9 = 7 + 9 = 16 dogs
Ben has no cats.

Step 2: Calculate the number of dogs and cats that Dave has.
Dave's dogs = Teddy's dogs - 5 = 7 - 5 = 2 dogs
Dave's cats = Teddy's cats + 13 ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pets each person has and then sum them up to find the total number of pets.

### Step 1: Determine the number of dogs and cats each person has.

**Teddy:**
- Teddy has 7 dogs.
- Teddy has 8 cats.

**Ben:**
- Ben has 9 more dogs than Teddy. 
  \[
  \text{Ben's dogs} = 7 + 9 = 16
  \]
- Ben's number of cats is not mentioned, so we assume he has no cats.

**Dave:**
- Dave has 13 more cats than Teddy.
  \[
  \text{Dav...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, let's find out how many dogs and cats each person has:

1. Teddy has 7 dogs and 8 cats. So, Teddy has a total of 7 + 8 = <<7+8=15>>15 pets.

2. Ben has 9 more dogs than Teddy. So, Ben has 7 + 9 = <<7+9=16>>16 dogs. Since the problem doesn't mention any cats for Ben, we assume he doesn't have any. So, Ben has a total of 16 pets.

3. Dave has 13 more cats and 5 less dogs than Teddy. So, Dave has 8 + 13 = <<8+13=21>>21 cats and ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Teddy's pets:
   * Teddy has 7 dogs and 8 cats.
   * Total pets Teddy has = 7 dogs + 8 cats = 15 pets

2. Ben's pets:
   * Ben has 9 more dogs than Teddy.
   * Teddy has 7 dogs, so Ben has 7 + 9 = 16 dogs.
   * The problem doesn't mention Ben having any cats.
   * Total pets Ben has = 16 dogs

3. Dave's pets:
   * Dave has 13 more cats than Teddy and 5 less dogs than Teddy.
   * Teddy has 8 cats, so Dave ha...
