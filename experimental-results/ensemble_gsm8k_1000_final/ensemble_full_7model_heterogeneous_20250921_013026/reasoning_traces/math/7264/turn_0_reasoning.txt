=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many more books Karson needs to buy to make his library 90% full, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate 90% of the library's total capacity**:
   The total capacity of the library is 400 books. To find 90% of this capacity, we can use the formula:
   \[
   90\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.90 \times 400
   \]
   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   0.90 \times 400 = 360
   \]
   So, 90% of the library's capacity is 360 books.

2. **Determine how many more books Karson needs**:
   Karson currently has 120 books. To find out how many more books he needs to reach 360 books, we subtract the number of books he currently has from the number of books needed to be 90% full:
   \[
   \text{Books needed} = 360 - 120
   \]
   Performing the subtraction:
   \[
   360 - 120 = 240
   \]
   Thus, Karson needs to buy 240 more books to make his library 90% full.

3. **Final answer**:
   Karson has to buy **240 more books** to make his library 90% full.

In conclusion, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of books Karson needs to buy to make his library 90% full.

Given information:
- The capacity of Karson's home library is 400 books.
- Karson currently has 120 books.
- We need to make the library 90% full.

Step 1: Calculate the number of books required to make the library 90% full.
90% of the library capacity = 0.90 × 400 = 360 books

Step 2: Calculate the number of books Karson needs to buy.
Number ...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many books Karson needs to buy to make his library 90% full.

### Step 1: Determine the target number of books for 90% capacity

The library's total capacity is 400 books. To find out how many books would make the library 90% full, we calculate 90% of 400.

\[
90\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.90 \times 400
\]

\[
0.90 \times 400 = 360
\]

So, Karson needs 360 books to make his library 90% full.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out what 90% of the total capacity of Karson's library is. 

The total capacity of the library is 400 books. 

To find 90% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.90 (which is the decimal equivalent of 90%).

400 * 0.90 = 360 books

So, 90% of the total capacity of Karson's library is 360 books. 

Karson currently has 120 books. 

To find out how many more books Karson needs to buy to make his library 90% full, we subtract the number of books he currently has ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Karson's home library can hold 400 books in total.
   * He currently has 120 books in his library.
   * We need to find out how many more books he needs to buy to make his library 90% full.

2. Calculate the number of books that would make the library 90% full:
   * 90% of the library capacity = 0.9 × 400
   * 0.9 × 400 = 360
   * So, when the library has 360 boo...
