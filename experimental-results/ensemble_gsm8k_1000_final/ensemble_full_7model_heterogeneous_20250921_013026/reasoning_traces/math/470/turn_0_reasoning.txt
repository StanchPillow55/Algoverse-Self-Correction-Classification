Final Answer: To determine how many hours Gary worked that week, we need to break down his earnings based on his normal wage and the overtime pay he received.

1. **Identify Gary's normal hourly wage**:
   - Gary's normal wage is $12 per hour.

2. **Determine the overtime rate**:
   - Overtime is paid at 1.5 times the normal wage.
   - Overtime rate = 1.5 × $12 = $18 per hour.

3. **Set up the equation for total earnings**:
   - Let \( h \) be the total number of hours Gary worked that week.
   - If Gary worked more than 40 hours, the first 40 hours are paid at the normal rate, and any hours beyond that are paid at the overtime rate.

4. **Break down the hours worked**:
   - If \( h \) is the total hours worked and \( h > 40 \):
     - Normal hours = 40 hours
     - Overtime hours = \( h - 40 \)

5. **Calculate total earnings based on hours worked**:
   - Total earnings = (Normal hours × Normal rate) + (Overtime hours × Overtime rate)
   - Total earnings = (40 hours × $12) + ((h - 40) hours × $18)

6. **Set the total earnings equal to the paycheck**:
   - We know Gary's total earnings for the week is $696.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   40 \times 12 + (h - 40) \times 18 = 696
   \]

7. **Calculate the earnings from the normal hours**:
   - Earnings from normal hours = \( 40 \times 12 = 480 \)

8. **Substitute this back into the equation**:
   \[
   480 + (h - 40) \times 18 = 696
   \]

9. **Isolate the overtime earnings**:
   \[
   (h - 40) \times 18 = 696 - 480
   \]
   \[
   (h - 40) \times 18 = 216
   \]

10. **Solve for \( h - 40 \)**:
    \[
    h - 40 = \frac{216}{18}
    \]
    \[
    h - 40 = 12
    \]

11. **Solve for \( h \)**:
    \[
    h = 12 + 40
    \]
    \[
    h = 52
    \]

Thus, the total number of hours Gary worked that week is \( \boxed{52} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of hours Gary worked that week, given his normal hourly wage and the overtime pay.

Given information:
- Gary's normal hourly wage is $12.
- Gary's paycheck (before taxes) was $696.

Step 1: Determine the total amount of regular pay Gary earned.
Regular pay = Normal hourly wage × Regular hours worked
Let's assume Gary worked x hours in total.
Regular pay = $12 × (x - 40) = $12x - $480

Step 2: De...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Gary worked in total, given that he earns overtime pay for hours worked beyond 40 hours in a week. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( h \) be the total number of hours Gary worked in the week.
   - Gary's normal hourly wage is $12 per hour.
   - Overtime pay is 1.5 times the normal wage, which is \( 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \) dollars per hour.

2. **Understand the Pay Stru...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much Gary would earn if he worked 40 hours with his normal wage. 

$12 per hour * 40 hours = $480

This means that if Gary worked 40 hours, he would earn $480. However, we know that he earned $696, which is more than $480. The difference between these two amounts is the overtime pay that Gary earned. 

$696 - $480 = $216

This $216 is the extra money Gary earned from working overtime. We know that for every hour of overtime, Gary earns 1.5 times...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Gary's normal wage is $12 per hour.
   * He earns 1.5 times his normal wage for every hour worked over 40 hours.
   * His paycheck before taxes is $696.

2. Calculate Gary's earnings for the first 40 hours (regular pay):
   * Regular pay = 40 hours × $12/hour
   * Regular pay = $480

3. Calculate the remaining amount of his paycheck, which is from overtime hour...
