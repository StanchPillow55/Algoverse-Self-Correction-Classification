=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much battery Brody's calculator has left after using three quarters of its battery and then calculate how much battery will remain after a two-hour exam.

1. **Calculate the total battery life of the calculator:**
   The calculator can run for a total of 60 hours on a full battery.

2. **Determine how much battery has been used:**
   Brody has used three quarters of the battery. To find out how many hours this represents, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Battery used} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Battery used} = 45 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining battery life:**
   To find out how much battery is left, we subtract the used battery from the total battery life:
   \[
   \text{Battery remaining} = 60 \text{ hours} - 45 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Battery remaining} = 15 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Determine the battery consumption during the exam:**
   Brody is about to take a two-hour math exam, which will require the use of the calculator for the entire duration. We need to subtract the battery used during the exam from the remaining battery:
   \[
   \text{Battery used during exam} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Calculate the battery left after the exam:**
   Now we subtract the battery used during the exam from the remaining battery:
   \[
   \text{Battery left after exam} = 15 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Battery left after exam} = 13 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, after Brody completes his two-hour math exam, his calculator will have **13 hours** of battery left.

**Final Answer: 13 hours**

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much battery Brody's calculator has left before and after the exam.

1. **Determine the total battery life:**
   - The calculator can run for 60 hours on a full battery.

2. **Calculate the battery used:**
   - Brody has used three quarters of the battery.
   - To find out how many hours of battery have been used, calculate three quarters of 60 hours:
     \[
     \text{Battery used} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 = 45 \text{ hour...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many hours of battery life Brody has used up. Since he has used three quarters of the battery, we multiply the total battery life by 3/4:

60 hours * 3/4 = 45 hours

This means Brody has used 45 hours of battery life.

Next, we subtract this from the total battery life to find out how many hours of battery life are left:

60 hours - 45 hours = 15 hours

So, before the exam, Brody has 15 hours of battery life left.

Since the exam will take 2...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Brody's calculator can run for 60 hours on a full battery.
   * Brody has used three quarters (3/4) of the battery.
   * Brody is about to take a two-hour math exam.

2. Calculate the remaining battery life before the exam:
   * Full battery life = 60 hours
   * Used battery life = 3/4 of 60 hours
   * 3/4 of 60 hours = (3 ร 60) รท 4 = 180 รท 4 = 45 hours
   * Remaining ...
