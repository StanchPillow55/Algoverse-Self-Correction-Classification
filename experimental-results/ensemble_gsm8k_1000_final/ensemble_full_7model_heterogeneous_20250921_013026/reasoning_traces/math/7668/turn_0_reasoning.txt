=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of one pen first, and then calculate the total cost for 8 pens.

1. **Identify the costs of the pencil and eraser:**
   - The cost of a pencil is given as \( \$1.20 \).
   - The cost of an eraser is given as \( \$0.30 \).

2. **Calculate the combined cost of the pencil and eraser:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost of pencil and eraser} = \text{Cost of pencil} + \text{Cost of eraser}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of pencil and eraser} = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
   \]

3. **Determine the cost of one pen:**
   According to the problem, a pen costs as much as the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser. Therefore, the cost of one pen is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of one pen} = 1.50
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for 8 pens:**
   To find the total cost for 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 8 pens} = \text{Cost of one pen} \times 8
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 8 pens} = 1.50 \times 8
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 8 pens} = 12.00
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   The total cost for 8 pens is \( \boxed{12.00} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined.
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- We need to find the cost of 8 pens.

Step 1: Find the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined.
Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pencil and an eraser combined = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Step 2: Find the cost of a pen.
Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser ...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of one pen and then calculate the total cost for 8 pens.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Cost of a Pencil and an Eraser:**
   - The cost of a pencil is given as $1.20.
   - The cost of an eraser is given as $0.30.

2. **Calculate the Combined Cost of a Pencil and an Eraser:**
   - To find the combined cost, we add the cost of a pencil and the cost of an eraser:
   \[
   \text{Combined cost of a pencil an...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Step 1: Determine the cost of one pen

The problem states that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. So, to find the cost of one pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser.

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30

Cost of one pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
= $1.20 + $0.30
= $1.50

So, one pen costs $1.50.

Step 2: Determine the cost of 8 pens

Now that we know the cost of one pen, we can find the cost of 8 pens by mult...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * A pencil costs $1.20
   * An eraser costs $0.30
   * A pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined

2. Calculate the cost of one pen:
   * Cost of one pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
   * Cost of one pen = $1.20 + $0.30
   * Cost of one pen = $1.50

3. Calculate the cost of 8 pens:
   * Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen × 8
   * Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 ×...
