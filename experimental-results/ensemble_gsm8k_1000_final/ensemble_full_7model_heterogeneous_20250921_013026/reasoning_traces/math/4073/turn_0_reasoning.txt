=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many red apples Brogan will harvest from both apple trees.

1. **Determine the number of apples from each tree:**
   - Each tree produces 20 apples.

2. **Calculate the number of red apples from the first tree:**
   - The first tree has 40% red apples.
   - To find the number of red apples from the first tree, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of red apples from the first tree} = 20 \times 0.40 = 8
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of red apples from the second tree:**
   - The second tree has 50% red apples.
   - To find the number of red apples from the second tree, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of red apples from the second tree} = 20 \times 0.50 = 10
     \]

4. **Add the number of red apples from both trees:**
   - Now we add the red apples from both trees to find the total number of red apples:
     \[
     \text{Total red apples} = \text{Red apples from first tree} + \text{Red apples from second tree}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total red apples} = 8 + 10 = 18
     \]

Thus, the total number of red apples that Brogan gets from both trees is **18**.

**Final Answer: 18 red apples**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of red apples produced by each tree and then add them together to get the total number of red apples.

Given information:
- The first tree is 40% red and 60% green, and it produces 20 apples.
- The second tree is 50% red and 50% green, and it produces 20 apples.

Step 1: Find the number of red apples from the first tree.
Red apples from the first tree = 40% of 20 apples
Red apples from the first tree =...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red apples Brogan gets from each tree and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of red apples from the first tree.**

The first tree produces 20 apples, and 40% of them are red. To find the number of red apples from this tree, we calculate 40% of 20.

\[
\text{Number of red apples from the first tree} = 0.40 \times 20 = 8
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of red apples from the second tree.**

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how many red apples Brogan gets from each tree.

From the first tree, 40% of the apples are red. Since the tree produces 20 apples, we calculate 40% of 20. 

To find 40% of a number, we multiply that number by 0.40 (which is the decimal equivalent of 40%). 

So, 0.40 * 20 = 8 red apples from the first tree.

From the second tree, 50% of the apples are red. Since this tree also produces 20 apples, we calculate 50% of 20.

To find 50% of a number, we ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Brogan has two apple trees.
   * The first tree has 40% red apples and 60% green apples.
   * The second tree has 50% red apples and 50% green apples.
   * Each tree produces 20 apples.

2. Calculate the number of red apples from the first tree:
   * The first tree produces 20 apples in total.
   * 40% of the apples from the first tree are red.
   * Number of red apple...
