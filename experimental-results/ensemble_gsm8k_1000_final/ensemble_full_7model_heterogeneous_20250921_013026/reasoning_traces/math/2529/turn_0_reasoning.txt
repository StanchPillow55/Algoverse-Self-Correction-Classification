=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first determine how many hot dogs each competitor can eat per minute, and then calculate how many hot dogs the third competitor can eat in 5 minutes.

1. **Determine the eating rate of the first competitor:**
   - The first competitor can eat 10 hot dogs per minute.

2. **Determine the eating rate of the second competitor:**
   - The second competitor can eat 3 times more than the first competitor.
   - Therefore, the eating rate of the second competitor is:
     \[
     3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ hot dogs per minute}
     \]

3. **Determine the eating rate of the third competitor:**
   - The third competitor can eat twice as much as the second competitor.
   - Therefore, the eating rate of the third competitor is:
     \[
     2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ hot dogs per minute}
     \]

4. **Calculate how many hot dogs the third competitor can eat in 5 minutes:**
   - To find the total number of hot dogs eaten by the third competitor in 5 minutes, we multiply the eating rate by the time:
     \[
     60 \text{ hot dogs per minute} \times 5 \text{ minutes} = 300 \text{ hot dogs}
     \]

Thus, the third competitor can eat a total of **300 hot dogs** after 5 minutes.

Final answer: **300 hot dogs**.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The first competitor can eat 10 hotdogs per minute. 

The second competitor can eat 3 times more than the first competitor, so he can eat 3 * 10 = <<3*10=30>>30 hotdogs per minute.

The third competitor can eat twice as much as the second competitor, so he can eat 2 * 30 = <<2*30=60>>60 hotdogs per minute.

If the third competitor can eat 60 hotdogs per minute, then after 5 minutes, he would have eaten 60 * 5 = <<60*5=300>>300 hotdogs.

Therefore, the third competitor can...
