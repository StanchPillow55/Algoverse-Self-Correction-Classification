=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much money the amusement park made overall in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tickets sold and then multiply that by the price of each ticket.

1. **Calculate the number of visitors from Monday to Friday:**
   The park welcomed 100 people per day from Monday to Friday. There are 5 days from Monday to Friday.

   \[
   \text{Visitors from Monday to Friday} = 100 \text{ people/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 500 \text{ people}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of visitors on Saturday:**
   On Saturday, the park was visited by 200 people.

   \[
   \text{Visitors on Saturday} = 200 \text{ people}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of visitors on Sunday:**
   On Sunday, the park was visited by 300 people.

   \[
   \text{Visitors on Sunday} = 300 \text{ people}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of visitors for the week:**
   Now, we add the visitors from all days together:

   \[
   \text{Total visitors} = \text{Visitors from Monday to Friday} + \text{Visitors on Saturday} + \text{Visitors on Sunday}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total visitors} = 500 + 200 + 300 = 1000 \text{ people}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   Each ticket is sold for $3. Therefore, the total revenue can be calculated by multiplying the total number of visitors by the price of each ticket:

   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \text{Total visitors} \times \text{Price per ticket}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 1000 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ dollars/person} = 3000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   The total amount of money the amusement park made overall in a week is:

   \[
   \boxed{3000} \text{ dollars}
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The amusement park was visited by 100 people per day for 5 days (Monday to Friday), 200 people on Saturday, and 300 people on Sunday.

To find the total number of visitors for the week, we add up the visitors for each day:

100 people/day * 5 days = 500 people
200 people on Saturday
300 people on Sunday

Total visitors = 500 people + 200 people + 300 people = 1000 people

Since each ticket costs $3, we multiply the total number of visitors by the price of each ticket to f...
