=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many points Reggie loses by in the basketball shooting contest against his brother, we need to calculate the total points scored by both Reggie and his brother based on the shots they made.

### Step 1: Calculate Reggie's Points

Reggie made:
- 3 layups (worth 1 point each)
- 2 free throws (worth 2 points each)
- 1 long shot (worth 3 points)

Now, we calculate the points from each type of shot:

1. **Points from layups**:
   \[
   \text{Points from layups} = 3 \text{ layups} \times 1 \text{ point/layup} = 3 \text{ points}
   \]

2. **Points from free throws**:
   \[
   \text{Points from free throws} = 2 \text{ free throws} \times 2 \text{ points/free throw} = 4 \text{ points}
   \]

3. **Points from long shots**:
   \[
   \text{Points from long shots} = 1 \text{ long shot} \times 3 \text{ points/long shot} = 3 \text{ points}
   \]

Now, we sum all the points Reggie scored:
\[
\text{Total points for Reggie} = 3 \text{ points (layups)} + 4 \text{ points (free throws)} + 3 \text{ points (long shots)} = 10 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate His Brother's Points

Reggie's brother only made long shots and made 4 of them. Each long shot is worth 3 points.

Calculating the points for his brother:
\[
\text{Points for brother} = 4 \text{ long shots} \times 3 \text{ points/long shot} = 12 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Point Difference

Now we find out how many points Reggie loses by by calculating the difference between the points scored by his brother and the points scored by Reggie:
\[
\text{Point difference} = \text{Points for brother} - \text{Total points for Reggie}
\]
\[
\text{Point difference} = 12 \text{ points} - 10 \text{ points} = 2 \text{ points}
\]

### Final Answer

Reggie loses by **2 points**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total points scored by Reggie and his brother, and then find the difference between them.

Given information:
- Reggie and his brother each get to take 10 shots.
- Layups are worth 1 point, free throws are worth 2 points, and anything further away is worth 3 points.
- Reggie makes 3 layups, 2 free throws, and 1 long shot.
- Reggie's brother only shoots long shots and makes 4 of them.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total points scored by Reggie and his brother, and then determine the difference in their scores to find out how many points Reggie loses by.

**Step 1: Calculate Reggie's total score.**

Reggie makes:
- 3 layups, each worth 1 point.
- 2 free throws, each worth 2 points.
- 1 long shot, worth 3 points.

Let's calculate the points for each type of shot:

- Points from layups: \(3 \text{ layups} \times 1 \text{ point per layup...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total points that Reggie scored. 

Reggie made 3 layups, which are worth 1 point each. So, 3 layups * 1 point/layup = 3 points.

Reggie also made 2 free throws, which are worth 2 points each. So, 2 free throws * 2 points/free throw = 4 points.

Finally, Reggie made 1 long shot, which is worth 3 points. So, 1 long shot * 3 points/long shot = 3 points.

Adding up all of Reggie's points, we get 3 points (from layups) + 4 points (from free thro...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Reggie and his brother each take 10 shots.
   * Layups are worth 1 point.
   * Free throws are worth 2 points.
   * Shots further away (long shots) are worth 3 points.
   * Reggie makes 3 layups, 2 free throws, and 1 long shot.
   * Reggie's brother only shoots long shots and makes 4 of them.

2. Calculate Reggie's total points:
   * Points from layups = 3 Ã— 1 = ...
