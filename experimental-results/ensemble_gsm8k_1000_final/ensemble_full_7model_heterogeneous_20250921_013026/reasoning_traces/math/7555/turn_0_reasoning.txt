=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the combined weight of Grace and Alex based on the information provided.

1. **Identify Grace's weight**: 
   - Grace weighs 125 pounds.

2. **Determine Alex's weight**: 
   - The problem states that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. 
   - First, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight:
     \[
     4 \times 125 = 500 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Next, we find Alex's weight by subtracting 2 pounds from this value:
     \[
     500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate their combined weight**: 
   - Now, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
     \[
     125 + 498 = 623 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   - The combined weight of Grace and Alex is \( \boxed{623} \) pounds.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Grace weighs 125 pounds.
- Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs.

Step 1: Calculate how much Alex weighs.
Alex's weight = 4 × Grace's weight - 2 pounds
Alex's weight = 4 × 125 pounds - 2 pounds
Alex's weight = 500 pounds - 2 pounds
Alex's weight = 498 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the combined weight of Grace and Alex.
Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight
Co...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine the weights of Grace and Alex and then find their combined weight.

1. **Determine Grace's weight:**
   - Grace's weight is given as 125 pounds.

2. **Determine Alex's weight:**
   - Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs.
   - First, calculate 4 times Grace's weight:
     \[
     4 \times 125 = 500
     \]
   - Next, subtract 2 pounds from this result to find Alex's weight:
     \[
     500 - 2 = 498
     \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much Alex weighs. 

According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. 

Grace weighs 125 pounds, so 4 times her weight would be 4 * 125 = 500 pounds.

Since Alex weighs 2 pounds less than this, his weight would be 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weight, we simply add the weight of Grace and Alex together.

So, 125 (Grace's weight) + 498 (Alex's weight) = 623 pounds.

Therefore, their combi...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the combined weight of Grace and Alex.

Given:
- Grace weighs 125 pounds.
- Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight.

Step 1: Calculate Alex's weight.
- Alex's weight = (4 × Grace's weight) - 2
- Alex's weight = (4 × 125) - 2
- Alex's weight = 500 - 2
- Alex's weigh...
