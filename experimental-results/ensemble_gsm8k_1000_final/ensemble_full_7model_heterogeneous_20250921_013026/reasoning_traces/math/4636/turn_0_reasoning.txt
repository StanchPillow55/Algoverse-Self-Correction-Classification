=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem step by step, we will keep track of the number of biscuits Randy has at each stage.

1. **Initial number of biscuits**: Randy starts with 32 biscuits.

2. **Biscuits received from his father**: Randy's father gives him 13 biscuits. We add this to the initial amount:
   \[
   32 + 13 = 45
   \]
   So now, Randy has 45 biscuits.

3. **Biscuits received from his mother**: Randy's mother gives him 15 biscuits. We add this to the current amount:
   \[
   45 + 15 = 60
   \]
   Now, Randy has 60 biscuits.

4. **Biscuits eaten by his brother**: Randy's brother eats 20 biscuits. We subtract this from the current amount:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   After his brother eats the biscuits, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

Now, we can summarize all the steps:

- Started with 32 biscuits.
- Received 13 biscuits from his father: \(32 + 13 = 45\).
- Received 15 biscuits from his mother: \(45 + 15 = 60\).
- His brother ate 20 biscuits: \(60 - 20 = 40\).

Thus, the final answer is that Randy is left with **40 biscuits**.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Randy had 32 biscuits initially.
- His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift.
- His mother gave him 15 biscuits.
- Randy's brother ate 20 of these biscuits.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of biscuits Randy had after receiving the gifts from his father and mother.
Initial biscuits + Biscuits from father + Biscuits from mother = Total biscuits
32 + 13 + 15 = 60 biscuits

Step 2: Calculate t...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of determining how many biscuits Randy is left with, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Count of Biscuits:**
   Randy initially had 32 biscuits.

2. **Biscuits Received from Father:**
   Randy's father gave him 13 additional biscuits. To find the new total, we add these to his initial count:
   \[
   32 + 13 = 45
   \]
   So, after receiving biscuits from his father, Randy has 45 biscuits.

3. **Biscuits Received from Mother:**
   Randy's m...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Randy initially had 32 biscuits. His father gave him an additional 13 biscuits, and his mother gave him 15 more biscuits. 

To find out how many biscuits Randy has now, we add all these amounts together. 

32 (initial amount) + 13 (from father) + 15 (from mother) = 60 biscuits

However, Randy's brother ate 20 of these biscuits. So, we need to subtract the number of biscuits his brother ate from the total number of biscuits Randy has.

60 (total biscuits) - 20 (eaten by br...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start with the number of biscuits Randy had initially and then add or subtract biscuits based on the information provided.

Given:
- Randy had 32 biscuits initially.
- His father gave him 13 biscuits.
- His mother gave him 15 biscuits.
- Randy's brother ate 20 biscuits.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of biscuits Randy had after receiving gifts from his parents.
