=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of open parking spots in the parking area, we will calculate the number of spots on each level step by step.

1. **First Level**: 
   - The problem states that there are 4 open parking spots on the first level.
   - So, \( P_1 = 4 \).

2. **Second Level**: 
   - The problem states that there are 7 more open parking spots on the second level than on the first level.
   - Therefore, the number of open parking spots on the second level can be calculated as:
   \[
   P_2 = P_1 + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11
   \]

3. **Third Level**: 
   - The problem states that there are 6 more open parking spots on the third level than on the second level.
   - Thus, the number of open parking spots on the third level is:
   \[
   P_3 = P_2 + 6 = 11 + 6 = 17
   \]

4. **Fourth Level**: 
   - The problem states that there are 14 open parking spots on the fourth level.
   - So, \( P_4 = 14 \).

5. **Total Open Parking Spots**: 
   - Now, we will sum the number of open parking spots from all four levels:
   \[
   \text{Total} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + P_4
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total} = 4 + 11 + 17 + 14
   \]

   Now, we will perform the addition step by step:
   - First, add \( 4 + 11 = 15 \).
   - Next, add \( 15 + 17 = 32 \).
   - Finally, add \( 32 + 14 = 46 \).

Thus, the total number of open parking spots in the parking area is \( \boxed{46} \).

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by determining the number of open parking spots on each level.

We know that there are 4 open parking spots on the first level.

The problem states that there are 7 more open parking spots on the second level than on the first level. So, we add 7 to the number of open parking spots on the first level to find the number of open parking spots on the second level: 4 + 7 = 11.

Next, the problem states that there are 6 more open parking spots on the third level th...
