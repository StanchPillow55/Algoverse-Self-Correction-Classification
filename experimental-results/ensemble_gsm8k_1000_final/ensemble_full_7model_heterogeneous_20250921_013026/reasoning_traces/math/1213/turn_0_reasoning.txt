=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many correct answers Lyssa and Precious got on the English proficiency exam and then compare their scores.

### Step 1: Determine the number of incorrect answers for Lyssa

Lyssa answered 20% of the items incorrectly. The total number of items on the exam is 75.

To find the number of incorrect answers Lyssa had, we calculate 20% of 75:

\[
\text{Incorrect answers by Lyssa} = 0.20 \times 75 = 15
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of correct answers for Lyssa

Now, we can find out how many correct answers Lyssa had by subtracting her incorrect answers from the total number of items:

\[
\text{Correct answers by Lyssa} = \text{Total items} - \text{Incorrect answers by Lyssa}
\]
\[
\text{Correct answers by Lyssa} = 75 - 15 = 60
\]

### Step 3: Determine the number of correct answers for Precious

Precious made 12 mistakes. To find out how many correct answers Precious had, we subtract her mistakes from the total number of items:

\[
\text{Correct answers by Precious} = \text{Total items} - \text{Mistakes by Precious}
\]
\[
\text{Correct answers by Precious} = 75 - 12 = 63
\]

### Step 4: Compare the correct answers of Lyssa and Precious

Now we need to find out how many more correct answers Lyssa had compared to Precious:

\[
\text{Difference in correct answers} = \text{Correct answers by Lyssa} - \text{Correct answers by Precious}
\]
\[
\text{Difference in correct answers} = 60 - 63 = -3
\]

### Final Answer

Lyssa actually had 3 fewer correct answers than Precious. Therefore, the answer to the question "How many more correct answers did Lyssa get than Precious?" is:

\[
\text{Lyssa got 3 fewer correct answers than Precious.}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Lyssa got 3 fewer correct answers than Precious.}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out how many questions Lyssa answered incorrectly. 

Since Lyssa answered 20% of the items incorrectly, and there were 75 items in total, we can calculate the number of items she answered incorrectly by multiplying 75 by 20% (or 0.20). 

75 * 0.20 = 15

So, Lyssa answered 15 items incorrectly. 

To find out how many items Lyssa answered correctly, we subtract the number of items she answered incorrectly from the total number of items.
