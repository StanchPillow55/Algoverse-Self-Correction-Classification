=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Joe has left after spending on chocolates and fruits, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount spent on chocolates**:
   Joe spent \( \frac{1}{9} \) of his pocket money on chocolates. His total pocket money is $450.

   \[
   \text{Amount spent on chocolates} = \frac{1}{9} \times 450
   \]

   To calculate this, we can perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \frac{1}{9} \times 450 = \frac{450}{9} = 50
   \]

   So, Joe spent $50 on chocolates.

2. **Calculate the amount spent on fruits**:
   Joe spent \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his pocket money on fruits.

   \[
   \text{Amount spent on fruits} = \frac{2}{5} \times 450
   \]

   Again, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 450 = \frac{2 \times 450}{5} = \frac{900}{5} = 180
   \]

   So, Joe spent $180 on fruits.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent**:
   Now we need to find the total amount Joe spent on both chocolates and fruits.

   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Amount spent on chocolates} + \text{Amount spent on fruits}
   \]

   Substituting the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 180 = 230
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining money**:
   To find out how much money Joe has left, we subtract the total amount spent from his initial pocket money.

   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = \text{Total pocket money} - \text{Total amount spent}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 450 - 230 = 220
   \]

Thus, Joe has $220 left after his purchases.

**Final Answer**: Joe has $220 left.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Joe's pocket money is $450.
- Joe spent 1/9 of his pocket money on chocolates.
- Joe spent 2/5 of his pocket money on fruits.

Step 1: Calculate how much Joe spent on chocolates.
Amount spent on chocolates = 1/9 of $450
Amount spent on chocolates = $450 × 1/9 = $50

Step 2: Calculate how much Joe spent on fruits.
Amount spent on fruits = 2/5 of $450
Amount spent on fruits = $450 × 2/5 = $180

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how much money Joe has left after spending on chocolates and fruits, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount spent on chocolates:**

   Joe spent \(\frac{1}{9}\) of his pocket money on chocolates. His total pocket money is $450.

   \[
   \text{Amount spent on chocolates} = \frac{1}{9} \times 450
   \]

   To calculate this, divide 450 by 9:

   \[
   450 \div 9 = 50
   \]

   So, Joe spent $50 on chocolates.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much money Joe spent on chocolates and fruits. 

To find out how much he spent on chocolates, we multiply his total pocket money by 1/9:

450 * 1/9 = $50

Next, we find out how much he spent on fruits by multiplying his total pocket money by 2/5:

450 * 2/5 = $180

Now, we add the amount he spent on chocolates and fruits to find out how much he spent in total:

50 + 180 = $230

Finally, we subtract the total amount he spent from his total po...
