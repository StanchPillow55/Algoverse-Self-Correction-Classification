=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many yards of grass Brendan can cut in a day after using the lawnmower, and then calculate how much he can cut in a week.

1. **Determine Brendan's original cutting rate:**
   Brendan can cut 8 yards of grass per day.

2. **Calculate the increase in cutting rate due to the lawnmower:**
   The lawnmower helps him cut more grass by 50%. To find out how much this is, we calculate 50% of his original cutting rate:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 50\% \text{ of } 8 \text{ yards} = 0.5 \times 8 = 4 \text{ yards}
   \]

3. **Calculate Brendan's new cutting rate:**
   Now, we add the increase to his original cutting rate:
   \[
   \text{New cutting rate} = \text{Original cutting rate} + \text{Increase} = 8 \text{ yards} + 4 \text{ yards} = 12 \text{ yards}
   \]

4. **Calculate how much grass Brendan can cut in a week:**
   There are 7 days in a week. To find out how much grass he can cut in a week, we multiply his new cutting rate by the number of days:
   \[
   \text{Total yards cut in a week} = \text{New cutting rate} \times 7 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ yards/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ yards}
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   After calculating all the steps, we find that Brendan will be able to cut a total of 84 yards of grass after a week.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{84}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of yards Brendan can cut per day with the new lawnmower and then calculate the total number of yards he can cut in a week.

Given information:
- Brendan can cut 8 yards of grass per day without the lawnmower.
- The lawnmower helps him cut 50% more yards per day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of yards Brendan can cut per day with the lawnmower.
Increase in yards cut per day = 50% of 8 yards
Increase in ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many yards of grass Brendan can cut per day with the help of the lawnmower, and then calculate the total amount of grass he can cut in a week.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Brendan's original cutting capacity:**
   - Brendan can cut 8 yards of grass per day without the lawnmower.

2. **Calculate the increase in cutting capacity with the lawnmower:**
   - The lawnmower helps Brendan cut 50% more yards per day.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Brendan can cut 8 yards of grass per day. If he bought a lawnmower that increased his productivity by 50%, he would be able to cut an additional 50% of 8 yards per day.

To calculate 50% of 8, we multiply 8 by 0.50 (which is the decimal equivalent of 50%):

8 * 0.50 = 4 yards

So, with the lawnmower, Brendan can cut an additional 4 yards per day. This means he can now cut:

8 (his original amount) + 4 (the additional amount) = 12 yards per day

If Brendan cuts grass 7 day...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Brendan can cut 8 yards of grass per day without the lawnmower.
   * The lawnmower helps him cut 50% more yards per day.
   * We need to find out how many yards Brendan can cut in a week with the lawnmower.

2. Calculate the increase in yards cut per day with the lawnmower:
   * 50% of 8 yards = 0.5 Ã— 8 = 4 yards
   * So, the lawnmower helps Brendan cut an additiona...
