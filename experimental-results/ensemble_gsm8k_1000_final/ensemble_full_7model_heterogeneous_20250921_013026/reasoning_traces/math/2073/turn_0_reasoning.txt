=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how much jelly beans Alex has left after eating some.**
2. **Divide the remaining jelly beans into 3 equal piles.**
3. **Calculate the weight of each pile.**

### Step 1: Calculate the remaining jelly beans

Alex started with 36 ounces of jelly beans and ate 6 ounces. We need to subtract the amount he ate from the total amount he had:

\[
\text{Remaining jelly beans} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Amount eaten}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Remaining jelly beans} = 36 \text{ ounces} - 6 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

### Step 2: Divide the remaining jelly beans into 3 equal piles

Now that we know Alex has 30 ounces of jelly beans left, we need to divide this amount into 3 equal piles. To find the weight of each pile, we will divide the total remaining jelly beans by the number of piles:

\[
\text{Weight of each pile} = \frac{\text{Remaining jelly beans}}{\text{Number of piles}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Weight of each pile} = \frac{30 \text{ ounces}}{3} = 10 \text{ ounces}
\]

### Final Answer

Each pile weighs **10 ounces**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Alex had 36 ounces of jelly beans.
- He ate 6 ounces.
- He divided the rest equally into 3 piles.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of jelly beans left after Alex ate 6 ounces.
Amount of jelly beans left = Total amount of jelly beans - Amount of jelly beans eaten
Amount of jelly beans left = 36 ounces - 6 ounces = 30 ounces

Step 2: Divide the remaining 30 ounces of jelly beans equally into 3 pile...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps outlined below:

1. **Determine the initial amount of jelly beans Alex had:**
   - Alex started with 36 ounces of jelly beans.

2. **Calculate the amount of jelly beans Alex ate:**
   - Alex ate 6 ounces of jelly beans.

3. **Subtract the amount Alex ate from the initial amount to find out how much is left:**
   \[
   36 \text{ ounces} - 6 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
   \]
   - After eating 6 ounces, Alex has 30 o...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many ounces of jelly beans Alex has left after he ate some. He started with 36 ounces and ate 6 ounces. 

We subtract the amount he ate from the total amount he had:

36 ounces - 6 ounces = 30 ounces

So, Alex has 30 ounces of jelly beans left.

Next, we need to find out how much each pile weighs. Alex divided the 30 ounces of jelly beans equally into 3 piles. 

We divide the total amount of jelly beans by the number of piles:

30 ounces รท 3...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Alex started with 36 ounces of jelly beans.
   * He ate 6 ounces of jelly beans.
   * He divided the remaining jelly beans equally into 3 piles.

2. Calculate the remaining jelly beans after Alex ate 6 ounces:
   * Remaining jelly beans = Initial amount - Amount eaten
   * Remaining jelly beans = 36 ounces - 6 ounces
   * Remaining jelly beans = 30 ounces

3. Divide...
