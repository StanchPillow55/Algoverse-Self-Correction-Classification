=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many cookies the adults eat.**
2. **Calculate how many cookies are left after the adults eat.**
3. **Divide the remaining cookies equally among the children.**

### Step 1: Calculate how many cookies the adults eat

The total number of cookies in the jar is 120. The adults eat \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the cookies.

To find out how many cookies the adults eat, we calculate:

\[
\text{Cookies eaten by adults} = \frac{1}{3} \times 120
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Cookies eaten by adults} = \frac{120}{3} = 40
\]

### Step 2: Calculate how many cookies are left

Now, we need to find out how many cookies are left after the adults have eaten:

\[
\text{Cookies left} = \text{Total cookies} - \text{Cookies eaten by adults}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Cookies left} = 120 - 40 = 80
\]

### Step 3: Divide the remaining cookies among the children

There are 4 children who will divide the remaining cookies equally. To find out how many cookies each child gets, we divide the number of remaining cookies by the number of children:

\[
\text{Cookies per child} = \frac{\text{Cookies left}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{80}{4}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Cookies per child} = 20
\]

### Final Answer

Each child gets **20 cookies**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 2 adults and 4 children in Everlee's family.
- There are a total of 120 cookies in the cookie jar.
- The adults eat 1/3 of the cookies.
- The remaining cookies are divided equally among the children.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies the adults eat.
Adults eat 1/3 of the cookies = 1/3 ร 120 = 40 cookies

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of cookies the adults eat.**
   - The problem states that the adults eat 1/3 of the cookies.
   - There are a total of 120 cookies in the jar.
   - To find out how many cookies the adults eat, we calculate 1/3 of 120.

   \[
   \text{Cookies eaten by adults} = \frac{1}{3} \times 120 = 40
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of cookies remaining after the adults have eaten.**
   - We subtract the...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many cookies the adults eat. Since there are 120 cookies and the adults eat 1/3 of them, we multiply 120 by 1/3:

120 * 1/3 = 40 cookies

So, the adults eat 40 cookies. 

Next, we need to find out how many cookies are left for the children. We do this by subtracting the number of cookies the adults ate from the total number of cookies:

120 - 40 = 80 cookies

So, there are 80 cookies left for the children. 

Finally, we need to find out how many ...
