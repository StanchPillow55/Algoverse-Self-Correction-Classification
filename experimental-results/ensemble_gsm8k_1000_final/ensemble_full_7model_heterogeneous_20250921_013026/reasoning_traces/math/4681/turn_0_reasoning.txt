=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Coby to travel from Washington to Idaho and then from Idaho to Nevada. We will use the formula for time, which is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the time from Washington to Idaho

The distance from Washington to Idaho is given as 640 miles. Coby travels this distance at a speed of 80 miles per hour.

Using the formula for time:

\[
\text{Time from Washington to Idaho} = \frac{640 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ miles per hour}} 
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Time from Washington to Idaho} = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time from Idaho to Nevada

The distance from Idaho to Nevada is given as 550 miles. Coby travels this distance at a speed of 50 miles per hour.

Using the formula for time again:

\[
\text{Time from Idaho to Nevada} = \frac{550 \text{ miles}}{50 \text{ miles per hour}} 
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Time from Idaho to Nevada} = 11 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total travel time

Now, we need to find the total time for the entire trip, which is the sum of the time taken for each segment of the trip:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time from Washington to Idaho} + \text{Time from Idaho to Nevada}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Time} = 8 \text{ hours} + 11 \text{ hours} = 19 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total time it took for Coby to arrive at his destination in Nevada is:

\[
\boxed{19} \text{ hours}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for Coby to travel from Washington to Nevada, including the time it takes to travel from Washington to Idaho and from Idaho to Nevada.

Given information:
- The distance from Washington to Idaho is 640 miles.
- The distance from Idaho to Nevada is 550 miles.
- Coby's speed from Washington to Idaho is 80 miles per hour.
- Coby's speed from Idaho to Nevada is 50 miles per hour.

Step 1:...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Coby spent traveling from Washington to Nevada with a stop in Idaho. We will break this down into two segments: the trip from Washington to Idaho and the trip from Idaho to Nevada.

### Step 1: Calculate the time taken from Washington to Idaho
- **Distance from Washington to Idaho**: 640 miles
- **Speed from Washington to Idaho**: 80 miles per hour

To find the time taken for this segment, we use the formula:
\[

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it took Coby to travel from Washington to Idaho and from Idaho to Nevada. 

First, we calculate the time it took for Coby to travel from Washington to Idaho. We know that the distance between Washington and Idaho is 640 miles and Coby is traveling at a speed of 80 miles per hour. The time it takes to travel a certain distance at a certain speed is given by the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

So, the time it took for C...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given information:
- Coby is traveling from Washington to Nevada.
- He needs to stop in Idaho to pick up some friends.
- Idaho is 640 miles away from Washington.
- Idaho is 550 miles away from Nevada.
- Coby is traveling at a speed of 80 miles per hour from Washington to Idaho.
- Coby is traveling at a speed of 50 miles per hour from Idaho to Nevada.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes Cob...
