=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the time at which Uranus first appears in the evening sky over Texas, starting from the time Mars is visible.

1. **Determine the time Mars is visible:**
   Mars can be seen until 12:10 AM.

2. **Calculate the time Jupiter appears:**
   Jupiter appears 2 hours and 41 minutes after Mars. 
   - First, convert 2 hours to minutes: 
     \[
     2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Now add the 41 minutes:
     \[
     120 \text{ minutes} + 41 \text{ minutes} = 161 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Now, we need to add 161 minutes to 12:10 AM. 
     - Break down 161 minutes into hours and minutes:
       \[
       161 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ hours} \text{ and } 41 \text{ minutes}
       \]
   - Adding this to 12:10 AM:
     - First, add 2 hours:
       \[
       12:10 \text{ AM} + 2 \text{ hours} = 2:10 \text{ AM}
       \]
     - Now add 41 minutes:
       \[
       2:10 \text{ AM} + 41 \text{ minutes} = 2:51 \text{ AM}
       \]
   - Therefore, Jupiter first appears at **2:51 AM**.

3. **Calculate the time Uranus appears:**
   Uranus appears 3 hours and 16 minutes after Jupiter.
   - Convert 3 hours to minutes:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Now add the 16 minutes:
     \[
     180 \text{ minutes} + 16 \text{ minutes} = 196 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Now, we need to add 196 minutes to 2:51 AM.
     - Break down 196 minutes into hours and minutes:
       \[
       196 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} \text{ and } 16 \text{ minutes}
       \]
   - Adding this to 2:51 AM:
     - First, add 3 hours:
       \[
       2:51 \text{ AM} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5:51 \text{ AM}
       \]
     - Now add 16 minutes:
       \[
       5:51 \text{ AM} + 16 \text{ minutes} = 6:07 \text{ AM}
       \]
   - Therefore, Uranus first appears at **6:07 AM**.

4. **Calculate how many minutes after 6:00 AM Uranus appears:**
   - From 6:00 AM to 6:07 AM is:
     \[
     7 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Uranus first appears **7 minutes after 6:00 AM**.

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to determine the time at which Uranus first appears in the evening sky over Texas, starting from the time Mars is visible.

1. **Determine the time Mars is visible:**
   Mars can be seen until 12:10 AM.

2. **Calculate the time Jupiter appears:**
   Jupiter appears 2 hours and 41 minutes after Mars. 
   - First, convert 2 hours to minutes:

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the time when Uranus first appears in the evening sky over Texas.

Given information:
- Mars can be seen until 12:10 AM.
- Jupiter appears 2 hours and 41 minutes later.
- Uranus appears 3 hours and 16 minutes after Jupiter's first appearance.

Step 1: Find the time when Jupiter first appears.
Time when Mars disappears = 12:10 AM
Time when Jupiter appears = 12:10 AM + 2 hours and 41 minutes = 2:51 AM

Step 2: Find...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the time at which Uranus first appears in the sky and then calculate how many minutes after 6:00 AM this time is.

**Step 1: Determine when Jupiter appears.**

Mars is visible until 12:10 AM. Jupiter appears 2 hours and 41 minutes after Mars disappears.

- Start time: 12:10 AM
- Add 2 hours: 12:10 AM + 2 hours = 2:10 AM
- Add 41 minutes: 2:10 AM + 41 minutes = 2:51 AM

So, Jupiter appears at 2:51 AM.

**Step 2: Determine when U...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to convert all the times into minutes to make the calculation easier.

Mars can be seen until 12:10 AM. This is 10 minutes past midnight.

Jupiter appears 2 hours and 41 minutes after Mars. To convert this to minutes, we multiply the hours by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour) and add the minutes. 

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
120 minutes + 41 minutes = 161 minutes

So, Jupiter appears 161 minutes after Mars.

Uranus appears 3 hours and ...
