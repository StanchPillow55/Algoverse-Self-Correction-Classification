=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many girls are at the party, we first need to find out how many boys are present. We know that there are a total of 50 people at the party and that 30% of them are boys.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of boys.**

We can find the number of boys by calculating 30% of 50. 

To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:
\[
30\% = \frac{30}{100} = 0.30
\]

Now, we multiply this decimal by the total number of people:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = 0.30 \times 50
\]

Calculating this gives:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = 15
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of girls.**

Next, we need to find out how many girls are at the party. Since we know the total number of people and the number of boys, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of people to find the number of girls.

\[
\text{Number of girls} = \text{Total number of people} - \text{Number of boys}
\]
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 50 - 15
\]

Calculating this gives:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 35
\]

**Final Answer:**
There are 35 girls at the party.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of girls at the party.

Given information:
- There are 50 people at the party.
- 30% of them are boys.

Step 1: Find the number of boys at the party.
30% of 50 people = 0.30 × 50 = 15 boys

Step 2: Find the number of girls at the party.
Total number of people - Number of boys = Number of girls
50 - 15 = 35 girls

Therefore, there are 35 girls at the party.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of determining how many girls are at the party, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of boys at the party.**

   We know that 30% of the people at the party are boys. To find the number of boys, we calculate 30% of the total number of people at the party.

   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 30\% \text{ of 50}
   \]

   To calculate 30% of 50, we convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply:

   \[
   30\% = \frac{30}{100} = 0.3...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many boys are at the party. We know that 30% of the people at the party are boys. 

To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.30 (which is the decimal equivalent of 30%). 

50 * 0.30 = 15

So, there are 15 boys at the party.

Next, we need to find out how many girls are at the party. We know that there are 50 people at the party in total, and 15 of them are boys. 

To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total numbe...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 50 people at the party in total.
   * 30% of the people at the party are boys.

2. Calculate the number of boys at the party:
   * To find the number of boys, we need to calculate 30% of 50.
   * 30% can be written as a decimal: 30% = 0.30
   * Number of boys = 50 × 0.30 = 15 boys

3. Calculate the number of girls at the party:
   * We know the total number of ...
