=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step and calculate Brendan's remaining money at the end of the month.

1. **Determine Brendan's total earnings for June**:
   - Brendan earned $5000 in June.

2. **Calculate how much he recharges to his debit card**:
   - According to the problem, Brendan recharges his debit card with half of his pay.
   - Half of his pay is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Recharge amount} = \frac{1}{2} \times 5000 = 2500
     \]

3. **Calculate how much money he has after recharging his debit card**:
   - After recharging his debit card, Brendan has the remaining amount of his earnings:
     \[
     \text{Remaining amount after recharge} = 5000 - 2500 = 2500
     \]

4. **Subtract the cost of the used car**:
   - Brendan bought a used car worth $1500. We need to subtract this amount from his remaining money:
     \[
     \text{Remaining amount after car purchase} = 2500 - 1500 = 1000
     \]

5. **Final amount**:
   - At the end of the month, Brendan has $1000 remaining.

Thus, the total amount of remaining money at the end of the month is:
\[
\boxed{1000}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Brendan earns $5000 in June. He recharges his debit card with half of his pay. 

So, the amount he recharges his debit card with is 1/2 * $5000 = $2500.

This means he has $5000 - $2500 = $2500 left.

Then, Brendan bought a used car worth $1500. So, he spent $1500 from his remaining money.

Therefore, his total amount of remaining money at the end of the month is $2500 - $1500 = $1000.

So, Brendan has $1000 left at the end of June.
