=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many pillows Miranda can stuff after plucking her goose, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pounds of feathers available from the goose.**
   - We know that there are approximately 3600 feathers in total from the goose.
   - Given that 1 pound of goose feathers is approximately 300 feathers, we can calculate the total pounds of feathers by dividing the total number of feathers by the number of feathers per pound.

   \[
   \text{Total pounds of feathers} = \frac{\text{Total feathers}}{\text{Feathers per pound}} = \frac{3600 \text{ feathers}}{300 \text{ feathers/pound}} = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine how many pillows can be stuffed with the available feathers.**
   - Each pillow requires 2 pounds of feathers. To find out how many pillows can be stuffed, we divide the total pounds of feathers by the pounds needed per pillow.

   \[
   \text{Number of pillows} = \frac{\text{Total pounds of feathers}}{\text{Pounds per pillow}} = \frac{12 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds/pillow}} = 6 \text{ pillows}
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - Miranda can stuff a total of 6 pillows after plucking the goose.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many pounds of feathers Miranda has. We know that a pound of goose feathers is approximately 300 feathers, and her goose has approximately 3600 feathers. 

So, we divide the total number of feathers by the number of feathers in a pound to find the total pounds of feathers:

3600 feathers / 300 feathers/pound = 12 pounds of feathers

Next, we need to determine how many pillows Miranda can stuff with these feathers. We know that she needs two...
