=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the total number of pieces from all the lego boxed sets he has.

1. **Identify the number of pieces in each set:**
   - The first set has **500 pieces**.
   - The second set has **3 times more pieces** than the first set. Therefore, we calculate:
     \[
     3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ pieces}
     \]
   - The third set has **1/4 the number of pieces** of the first set. Therefore, we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125 \text{ pieces}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of pieces:**
   Now, we add the number of pieces from all three sets together:
   \[
   500 + 1500 + 125
   \]

   Let's perform the addition step by step:
   - First, add the first two sets:
     \[
     500 + 1500 = 2000
     \]
   - Now, add the third set:
     \[
     2000 + 125 = 2125
     \]

3. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of blocks Johnny picks up is:
   \[
   \boxed{2125}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Johnny has a Lego boxed set with 500 pieces.
- He has another Lego boxed set that has 3 times more pieces than the 500-piece set.
- He has another Lego boxed set that has 1/4 the number of pieces of the 500-piece set.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces in the second Lego boxed set.
Number of pieces in the second set = 3 × 500 = 1,500 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of pi...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of Lego pieces Johnny has to pick up. We are given information about three different sets of Lego pieces:

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set.

Let's calculate the number of pieces in each set and then sum them up to find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's break down the problem. Johnny has three sets of legos:

1. A set with 500 pieces.
2. A set that has 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece set.
3. A set that has 1/4 the number of pieces as the 500 piece set.

To find out how many legos Johnny has to pick up, we need to add up all the pieces from the three sets.

The first set has 500 pieces. 

The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set. To find out how many pieces that is, we multiply 500 by ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given information:
- Johnny dumped a Lego set with 500 pieces on the floor.
- He also dumped another set that had 3 times more pieces than the 500-piece set.
- Lastly, he dumped a set that had 1/4 the number of pieces of the 500-piece set.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces in the second set (3 times more than 500).
Second set pieces = 3 × 500 = 1,500 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the numb...
