=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the population of Salem**: Since Salem is 15 times the size of Leesburg, we can calculate Salem's population by multiplying Leesburg's population by 15.

   \[
   \text{Population of Leesburg} = 58940
   \]
   \[
   \text{Population of Salem} = 15 \times \text{Population of Leesburg} = 15 \times 58940
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   15 \times 58940 = 884100
   \]

   So, the population of Salem is 884100.

2. **Calculate the new population of Salem after 130000 people move out**: We need to subtract the number of people moving out from Salem's current population.

   \[
   \text{New Population of Salem} = \text{Population of Salem} - 130000
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Population of Salem} = 884100 - 130000
   \]

   Now, we perform the subtraction:

   \[
   884100 - 130000 = 754100
   \]

   Therefore, the new population of Salem after 130000 people move out is 754100.

3. **Determine the number of women in Salem**: According to the problem, half of Salem's population is women. We will calculate the number of women by taking half of the new population of Salem.

   \[
   \text{Number of women in Salem} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{New Population of Salem}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of women in Salem} = \frac{1}{2} \times 754100
   \]

   Now, we perform the division:

   \[
   \frac{754100}{2} = 377050
   \]

   Thus, the number of women living in Salem is 377050.

4. **Final Answer**: 

   The number of women living in Salem is \( \boxed{377050} \).

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the population of Salem**: Since Salem is 15 times the size of Leesburg, we can calculate Salem's population by multiplying Leesburg's population by 15.

   \[
   \text{Population of Leesburg} = 58940
   \]
   \[
   \text{Population of Salem} = 15 \times \text{Population of Leesburg} = 15 \times 58940
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   15 \times 58940 = 884100

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Salem is 15 times the size of Leesburg.
- Leesburg has 58,940 people.
- 130,000 people move out of Salem.
- Half of Salem's population is women.

Step 1: Calculate the original population of Salem.
Since Salem is 15 times the size of Leesburg, we can calculate Salem's original population as:
Salem's original population = 15 × Leesburg's population
Salem's original population = 15 × 58,940...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the population of Salem, account for the people moving out, and then calculate the number of women in Salem.

### Step 1: Determine Salem's Initial Population
We know that Salem is 15 times the size of Leesburg. Leesburg has a population of 58,940 people. Therefore, we can calculate the initial population of Salem as follows:

\[
\text{Population of Salem} = 15 \times \text{Population of Leesburg} = 15 \times 58,940
\]

Let's p...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out the total population of Salem. Since Salem is 15 times the size of Leesburg, and Leesburg has 58940 people, we multiply 58940 by 15.

58940 * 15 = 884100

So, Salem has 884100 people.

Next, we need to account for the 130000 people who moved out of Salem. We subtract this number from Salem's total population.

884100 - 130000 = 754100

So, after 130000 people moved out, Salem has 754100 people.

Finally, we need to find out how many women live i...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Salem is 15 times the size of Leesburg.
   * Leesburg has 58,940 people.
   * 130,000 people move out of Salem.
   * Half of Salem's population is women.

2. Calculate the population of Salem before people moved out:
   * Salem's population = 15 × Leesburg's population
   * Salem's population = 15 × 58,940
   * Salem's population = 884,100

3. Calculate the popul...
