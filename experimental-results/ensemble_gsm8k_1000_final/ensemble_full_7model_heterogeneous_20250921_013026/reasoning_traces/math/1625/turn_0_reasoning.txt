Final Answer: To find the new price of the movie ticket after a 20% decrease from the original price of $100, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of decrease**: 
   We need to calculate 20% of the original price. The formula to find a percentage of a number is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Amount} = \left( \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100} \right) \times \text{Original Price}
   \]
   Here, the percentage is 20, and the original price is $100.

   \[
   \text{Amount of decrease} = \left( \frac{20}{100} \right) \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20
   \]

2. **Calculate the new price**:
   To find the new price, we subtract the amount of decrease from the original price:
   \[
   \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Amount of decrease}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 100 - 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   The new price of the movie ticket after a 20% decrease is:
   \[
   \boxed{80}
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To find the new price of the movie ticket, we need to calculate how much 20% of the original price is and then subtract that from the original price.

Step 1: Calculate 20% of the original price
20% of $100 is calculated as follows:

20/100 * $100 = $20

Step 2: Subtract the discount from the original price
The new price of the movie ticket is the original price minus the discount. So, we subtract $20 from $100:

$100 - $20 = $80

So, the new price of the movie ticket is ...
