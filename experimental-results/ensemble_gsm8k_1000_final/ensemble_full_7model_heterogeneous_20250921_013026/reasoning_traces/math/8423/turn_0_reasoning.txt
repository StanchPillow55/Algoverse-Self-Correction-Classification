=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let \( B \) represent the points scored by Bahati, \( A \) represent the points scored by Azibo, and \( D \) represent the points scored by Dinar. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The total points scored by the three players is 45:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( B \) from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1.

First, we substitute \( B \) from equation 2 into equation 1:
\[
(A + 20) + A + D = 45
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2A + D + 20 = 45
\]
Subtracting 20 from both sides gives:
\[
2A + D = 25 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

Next, we substitute \( B \) from equation 3 into equation 1:
\[
(D + 10) + A + D = 45
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
A + 2D + 10 = 45
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:
\[
A + 2D = 35 \quad \text{(Equation 5)}
\]

Now we have two equations (Equation 4 and Equation 5):
1. \( 2A + D = 25 \) (Equation 4)
2. \( A + 2D = 35 \) (Equation 5)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, we can express \( D \) from Equation 4:
\[
D = 25 - 2A
\]

Now, we substitute this expression for \( D \) into Equation 5:
\[
A + 2(25 - 2A) = 35
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
A + 50 - 4A = 35
\]
Combining like terms results in:
\[
-3A + 50 = 35
\]
Subtracting 50 from both sides gives:
\[
-3A = -15
\]
Dividing both sides by -3 results in:
\[
A = 5
\]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( D \) using the expression for \( D \):
\[
D = 25 - 2(5) = 25 - 10 = 15
\]

Finally, we can find \( B \) using the expression for \( B \):
\[
B = A + 20 = 5 + 20 = 25
\]

To verify, we check if the total points add up:
\[
B + A + D = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45
\]
This is correct.

Thus, the number of points Azibo scored is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of points scored by Azibo.

Given information:
- The team's total points are 45.
- Bahati scored the most points, which is 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar.

Let's represent the points scored by each player as follows:
- Bahati's points = x
- Azibo's points = x - 20
- Dinar's points = x - 30

We know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so we can set up an equation:
x + (x - 20) + (...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine how many points Azibo scored, given the relationships between the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of points Azibo scored.
- Let \( B \) be the number of points Bahati scored.
- Let \( D \) be the number of points Dinar scored.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45:
   \[
   A ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of points scored by Azibo as A, by Bahati as B, and by Dinar as D.

From the problem, we know that:

B + A + D = 45 (since they together scored 45 points)

We also know that:

B = A + 20 (since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)

B = D + 10 (since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

We can use these equations to solve for A, B, and D.

First, let's substitute B from the second equation into the first one:

(A + 20) + A + D = 45
2A + D +...
