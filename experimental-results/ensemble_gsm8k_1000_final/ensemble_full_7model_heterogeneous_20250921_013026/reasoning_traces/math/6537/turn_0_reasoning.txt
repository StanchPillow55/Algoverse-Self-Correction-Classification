=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Alice paid for each acorn based on the information provided.

1. **Determine how much Bob paid for each acorn:**
   Bob paid a total of $6000 for his acorns. We need to find out how many acorns Bob purchased. However, the problem does not specify the number of acorns Bob bought, so we will denote the number of acorns Bob purchased as \( B \).

   The cost per acorn for Bob can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Cost per acorn for Bob} = \frac{\text{Total cost paid by Bob}}{\text{Number of acorns Bob bought}} = \frac{6000}{B}
   \]

2. **Determine how much Alice paid for her acorns:**
   According to the problem, Alice purchased 3600 acorns for nine times the price Bob paid. Therefore, the total amount Alice paid can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total cost paid by Alice} = 9 \times \text{Total cost paid by Bob} = 9 \times 6000 = 54000
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost per acorn for Alice:**
   Now that we know the total amount Alice paid, we can find out how much she paid for each acorn:
   \[
   \text{Cost per acorn for Alice} = \frac{\text{Total cost paid by Alice}}{\text{Number of acorns Alice bought}} = \frac{54000}{3600}
   \]

4. **Perform the calculation:**
   To simplify \( \frac{54000}{3600} \):
   \[
   \frac{54000 \div 3600}{3600 \div 3600} = \frac{15}{1} = 15
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, Alice paid **$15** for each acorn.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the price per acorn that Alice paid.

Given information:
- Alice purchased 3600 acorns.
- Alice paid nine times the price Bob paid for his acorns.
- Bob paid $6000 for his acorns.

Step 1: Find the price Bob paid per acorn.
Bob's total cost = $6000
Price per acorn = Bob's total cost / Number of acorns
Price per acorn = $6000 / (unknown number of acorns)

Step 2: Find the price Alice paid per acorn.
Alice's total ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Alice paid for each acorn. We are given the following information:

1. Bob paid $6000 for his acorns.
2. Alice purchased her acorns for nine times the price Bob paid.
3. Alice purchased 3600 acorns.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the Total Amount Alice Paid

Since Alice paid nine times the amount Bob paid, we first calculate the total amount Alice paid:

\[ \text{Amount Bob paid} = \...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much Alice paid for all her acorns. We know that Alice paid nine times the price Bob paid for his acorns. So, we multiply Bob's total cost by 9:

$6000 * 9 = $54000

So, Alice paid $54000 for all her acorns.

Next, we need to find out how much Alice paid for each acorn. To do this, we divide the total amount Alice paid by the number of acorns she bought:

$54000 / 3600 = $15

So, Alice paid $15 for each acorn.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Alice purchased 3600 acorns.
   * Alice paid nine times the price Bob paid for his acorns.
   * Bob paid $6000 for his acorns.

2. Find the total amount Alice paid for her acorns:
   * Alice paid nine times the price Bob paid.
   * Bob paid $6000.
   * So, Alice paid: 9 Ã— $6000 = $54,000

3. Calculate the price Alice paid for each acorn:
   * Alice paid a total of $54,...
