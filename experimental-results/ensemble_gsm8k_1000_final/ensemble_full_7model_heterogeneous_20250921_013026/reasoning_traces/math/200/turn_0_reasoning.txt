=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate Sansa's earnings from selling portraits over a period of 3 days. We will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the price of each portrait:**
   - The price of an 8-inch portrait is given as $5.
   - The price of a 16-inch portrait is twice the price of the 8-inch portrait:
     \[
     \text{Price of 16-inch portrait} = 2 \times \text{Price of 8-inch portrait} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings per day:**
   - Sansa sells 3 of the 8-inch portraits per day:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from 8-inch portraits} = 3 \times \text{Price of 8-inch portrait} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Sansa sells 5 of the 16-inch portraits per day:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from 16-inch portraits} = 5 \times \text{Price of 16-inch portrait} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Now, we can find the total earnings per day by adding the earnings from both types of portraits:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings per day} = \text{Earnings from 8-inch portraits} + \text{Earnings from 16-inch portraits} = 15 + 50 = 65 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings over 3 days:**
   - To find the total earnings over 3 days, we multiply the daily earnings by 3:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings over 3 days} = 3 \times \text{Total earnings per day} = 3 \times 65 = 195 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, Sansa earns a total of **$195** over the course of 3 days.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{195}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount Sansa earns from selling the 8-inch and 16-inch portraits per day, and then calculate the total earnings for 3 days.

Given information:
- Sansa sells an 8-inch portrait for $5.
- Sansa sells a 16-inch portrait for twice the price of the 8-inch portrait.
- Sansa sells 3 eight-inch portraits and 5 sixteen-inch portraits per day.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total earnings of Sansa over a period of 3 days, based on the number of portraits she sells and their respective prices.

**Step 1: Determine the price of each type of portrait.**

- An 8-inch portrait is sold for $5.
- A 16-inch portrait is sold for twice the price of an 8-inch portrait.

To find the price of a 16-inch portrait, we multiply the price of an 8-inch portrait by 2:

\[
\text{Price of a 16-inch portrait} = 2 \t...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how much Sansa earns from selling one 16-inch portrait. Since it's twice the price of the 8-inch portrait, which costs $5, she sells a 16-inch portrait for 2 * $5 = $<<2*5=10>>10.

Next, let's calculate how much she earns from selling the 8-inch portraits per day. She sells three 8-inch portraits per day, so she earns 3 * $5 = $<<3*5=15>>15 per day from the 8-inch portraits.

Similarly, we can calculate how much she earns from selling the 16-inch por...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Sansa sells an 8-inch portrait for $5.
   * A 16-inch portrait is sold for twice the price of the 8-inch portrait.
   * She sells three 8-inch portraits and five 16-inch portraits per day.
   * We need to find out how much she earns in 3 days.

2. Calculate the price of a 16-inch portrait:
   * Price of 16-inch portrait = 2 Ã— Price of 8-inch portrait
   * Price of 1...
