=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of sausages eaten on Monday:**
   Mr. Castiel prepared a total of 600 boar sausages. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them on Monday.

   \[
   \text{Sausages eaten on Monday} = \frac{2}{5} \times 600 = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of sausages remaining after Monday:**
   After eating 240 sausages on Monday, we need to find out how many sausages are left.

   \[
   \text{Sausages remaining after Monday} = 600 - 240 = 360
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sausages eaten on Tuesday:**
   Mr. Castiel ate half of the remaining sausages on Tuesday.

   \[
   \text{Sausages eaten on Tuesday} = \frac{1}{2} \times 360 = 180
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of sausages remaining after Tuesday:**
   After eating 180 sausages on Tuesday, we find the remaining sausages.

   \[
   \text{Sausages remaining after Tuesday} = 360 - 180 = 180
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of sausages eaten on Friday:**
   Mr. Castiel ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the remaining sausages on Friday.

   \[
   \text{Sausages eaten on Friday} = \frac{3}{4} \times 180 = \frac{540}{4} = 135
   \]

6. **Calculate the number of sausages left after Friday:**
   Finally, we need to find out how many sausages are left after he ate 135 sausages on Friday.

   \[
   \text{Sausages remaining after Friday} = 180 - 135 = 45
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Mr. Castiel has **45 sausages left**.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step and calculate the number of sausages left after each day's consumption.

Given information:
- Mr. Castiel prepared 600 boar sausages on the weekend.
- He ate 2/5 of them on Monday.
- He ate half of the remaining sausages on Tuesday.
- He saved the rest for Friday.
- He ate 3/4 of the remaining sausages on Friday.

Step 1: Calculate the number of sausages eaten on Monday.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to track the number of sausages Mr. Castiel has after each day he eats some. Let's go through each step carefully:

1. **Initial Amount:**
   - Mr. Castiel starts with 600 boar sausages.

2. **Monday:**
   - He eats \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the sausages on Monday.
   - Calculate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 600:
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 600 = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
     \]
   - So, he eats 240 sausages on Monday.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Step 1: Determine how many sausages Mr. Castiel ate on Monday.
Mr. Castiel ate 2/5 of the 600 boar sausages on Monday. To find out how many sausages he ate, multiply 600 by 2/5:

600 * 2/5 = 240 sausages

Step 2: Determine how many sausages were left after Monday.
Subtract the number of sausages eaten on Monday from the total number of sausages:

600 - 240 = 360 sausages

Step 3: Determine how many sausages Mr. Castiel ate on Tuesday.
Mr. Castiel ate half of the remaining...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mr Castiel prepared 600 boar sausages on the weekend.
   * On Monday, he ate 2/5 of the total sausages.
   * On Tuesday, he ate half of the remaining sausages.
   * On Friday, he ate 3/4 of the remaining sausages.

2. Calculate the number of sausages eaten on Monday:
