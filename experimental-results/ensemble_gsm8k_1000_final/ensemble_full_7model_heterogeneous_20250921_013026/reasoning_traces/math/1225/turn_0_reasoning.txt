Final Answer: To determine how many points Donovan Mitchell needs to average per game over the remaining games to reach his goal of averaging 30 points per game for the entire 20-game season, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total points needed for the season**:
   Donovan wants to average 30 points per game over 20 games. Therefore, the total points he needs to score for the season is:
   \[
   \text{Total points needed} = \text{Average points per game} \times \text{Total games}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total points needed} = 30 \, \text{points/game} \times 20 \, \text{games} = 600 \, \text{points}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total points he has scored so far**:
   Donovan has played 15 games and is averaging 26 points per game. Thus, the total points he has scored so far is:
   \[
   \text{Total points scored} = \text{Average points per game} \times \text{Games played}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total points scored} = 26 \, \text{points/game} \times 15 \, \text{games} = 390 \, \text{points}
   \]

3. **Determine how many points he still needs to score**:
   To find out how many more points he needs to score to reach his goal of 600 points, we subtract the points he has already scored from the total points needed:
   \[
   \text{Points needed} = \text{Total points needed} - \text{Total points scored}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Points needed} = 600 \, \text{points} - 390 \, \text{points} = 210 \, \text{points}
   \]

4. **Calculate how many games are left**:
   Since he has played 15 games out of a total of 20 games, the number of games remaining is:
   \[
   \text{Games remaining} = 20 \, \text{games} - 15 \, \text{games} = 5 \, \text{games}
   \]

5. **Determine the average points he needs to score in the remaining games**:
   To find out how many points he needs to average per game over the remaining 5 games, we divide the points he still needs by the number of games left:
   \[
   \text{Average points needed per game} = \frac{\text{Points needed}}{\text{Games remaining}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average points needed per game} = \frac{210 \, \text{points}}{5 \, \text{games}} = 42 \, \text{points/game}
   \]

Thus, Donovan Mitchell needs to average **42 points per game** over the remaining 5 games to reach his goal of averaging 30 points per game for the entire season.

**Final Answer**: 42 points per game.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many points Donovan Mitchell has scored so far this season. We do this by multiplying his current average points per game by the number of games his team has played. 

26 points/game * 15 games = 390 points

Next, we need to find out how many total points he needs to average 30 points per game for the entire 20 game season. We do this by multiplying his goal average by the total number of games in the season.

30 points/game * 20 games = 600...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Donovan Mitchell is currently averaging 26 points per game.
   * His team has played 15 games this season.
   * The entire season will have 20 games.
   * Donovan's goal is to average 30 points per game for the entire season.

2. Calculate the total points Donovan has scored so far:
