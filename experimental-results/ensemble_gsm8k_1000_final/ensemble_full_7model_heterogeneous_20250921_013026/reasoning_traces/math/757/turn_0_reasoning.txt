=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate how much kibble Luna ate throughout the day and then determine how much kibble remains in the bag.

1. **Initial Amount of Kibble**: 
   - The bag starts with 12 cups of kibble.

2. **Kibble Given by Mary**:
   - In the morning, Mary gives Luna 1 cup of kibble.
   - In the evening, Mary gives Luna another 1 cup of kibble.
   - Total kibble given by Mary = 1 cup (morning) + 1 cup (evening) = 2 cups.

3. **Kibble Given by Frank**:
   - In the afternoon, Frank gives Luna 1 cup of kibble.
   - In the late evening, Frank gives Luna twice as much as he gave in the afternoon. Since he gave 1 cup in the afternoon, he gives 2 cups in the late evening.
   - Total kibble given by Frank = 1 cup (afternoon) + 2 cups (late evening) = 3 cups.

4. **Total Kibble Consumed by Luna**:
   - Total kibble consumed = Total given by Mary + Total given by Frank
   - Total kibble consumed = 2 cups (Mary) + 3 cups (Frank) = 5 cups.

5. **Remaining Kibble in the Bag**:
   - To find out how much kibble is left in the bag, we subtract the total kibble consumed from the initial amount.
   - Remaining kibble = Initial amount - Total consumed
   - Remaining kibble = 12 cups - 5 cups = 7 cups.

Thus, the final answer is that Mary will find **7 cups of kibble remaining in the bag**.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Luna starts with a 12-cup bag of kibble.

Mary gives Luna 1 cup in the morning and 1 cup in the evening. So, Mary gives Luna a total of 1 + 1 = 2 cups of kibble.

Frank gives Luna 1 cup in the afternoon and twice as much in the late evening as he had given Luna in the afternoon. So, Frank gives Luna a total of 1 + 2*1 = 3 cups of kibble.

Together, Mary and Frank give Luna a total of 2 + 3 = 5 cups of kibble ...
