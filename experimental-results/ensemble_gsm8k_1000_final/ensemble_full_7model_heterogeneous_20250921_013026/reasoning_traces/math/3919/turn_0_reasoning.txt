=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many cakes Leila ate in total, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of cakes eaten on each day:**
   - On Monday, Leila ate 6 cakes.
   - On Friday, she ate 9 cakes.
   - On Saturday, she ate triple the number of cakes she ate on Monday.

2. **Calculate the number of cakes eaten on Saturday:**
   - Since she ate 6 cakes on Monday, the number of cakes she ate on Saturday is:
     \[
     \text{Cakes on Saturday} = 3 \times \text{Cakes on Monday} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ cakes}
     \]

3. **Add up the total number of cakes eaten:**
   - Now we will sum the cakes eaten on each day:
     \[
     \text{Total cakes} = \text{Cakes on Monday} + \text{Cakes on Friday} + \text{Cakes on Saturday}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cakes} = 6 + 9 + 18
     \]

4. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add the cakes from Monday and Friday:
     \[
     6 + 9 = 15
     \]
   - Now add the cakes from Saturday:
     \[
     15 + 18 = 33
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of cakes Leila ate is:
     \[
     \boxed{33}
     \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Leila ate 6 cakes on Monday.

She ate 9 cakes on Friday.

On Saturday, she ate triple the number of cakes she ate on Monday. Since she ate 6 cakes on Monday, triple that number would be 6 * 3 = 18 cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she ate, we add the number of cakes she ate each day.

So, 6 (Monday) + 9 (Friday) + 18 (Saturday) = 33 cakes.

Therefore, Leila ate 33 cakes last week.
