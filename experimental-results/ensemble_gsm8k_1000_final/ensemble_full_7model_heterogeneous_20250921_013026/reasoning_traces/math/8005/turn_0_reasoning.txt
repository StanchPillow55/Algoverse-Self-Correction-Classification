=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age**:
   Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. Therefore, we can find his current age by subtracting 5 from 27:
   \[
   \text{Jame's current age} = 27 - 5 = 22
   \]

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years**:
   In 8 years, Jame's age will be:
   \[
   \text{Jame's age in 8 years} = 22 + 8 = 30
   \]

3. **Determine his cousin's age in 8 years**:
   According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. We can express this mathematically:
   \[
   \text{Cousin's age in 8 years} = 2 \times \text{Jame's age in 8 years} - 5
   \]
   Substituting Jame's age in 8 years:
   \[
   \text{Cousin's age in 8 years} = 2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55
   \]

4. **Determine the cousin's current age**:
   Since we know the cousin's age in 8 years is 55, we can find the cousin's current age by subtracting 8 from 55:
   \[
   \text{Cousin's current age} = 55 - 8 = 47
   \]

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin**:
   Now we can find the difference in their current ages:
   \[
   \text{Age difference} = \text{Cousin's current age} - \text{Jame's current age} = 47 - 22 = 25
   \]

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of Jame and his cousin now is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the current ages of Jame and his cousin, and then calculate the difference between their ages.

Given information:
- Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
- In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age.

Step 1: Find Jame's current age.
Jame's age in 5 years = 27
Jame's current age = 27 - 5 = 22 years old

Step 2: Find the cousin's age in 8 years.
Cousin's age in 8 years = 2 Ã— Jame's age in 8 years -...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Jame and his cousin, and then find the difference between their ages.

### Step 1: Determine Jame's Current Age

We know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. To find Jame's current age, we subtract 5 years from 27:

\[ 
\text{Jame's current age} = 27 - 5 = 22 
\]

### Step 2: Set Up an Equation for the Cousin's Age

We are told that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at tha...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote Jame's current age as J and his cousin's current age as C.

From the problem, we know that Jame will be 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years. So, J = 22.

The problem also tells us that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old. Twice Jame's age at that time will be 2 * 30 = 60 years. So, Jame's cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

Therefore, his cousi...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the answer.

Given:
- Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
- In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.

Step 1: Determine Jame's current age.
Jame's age in 5 years = 27
Jame's current age = 27 - 5 = 22

Step 2: Determine Jame's age in 8 years.
Jame's age in 8...
