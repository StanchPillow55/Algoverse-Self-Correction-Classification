=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the current age of Ann's brother and then find out how old he will be in 3 years.

1. **Determine Ann's current age**: 
   - Ann is currently 9 years old.

2. **Calculate Ann's brother's current age**: 
   - The problem states that Ann's brother is twice her age. 
   - Therefore, we can calculate her brother's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Calculate how old her brother will be in 3 years**: 
   - To find out how old her brother will be in 3 years, we add 3 years to his current age:
     \[
     \text{Brother's age in 3 years} = \text{Brother's current age} + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   - Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ann is 9 years old.
- Ann's brother is twice her age.

Step 1: Find the current age of Ann's brother.
Ann's age = 9 years
Ann's brother's age = 2 × Ann's age
Ann's brother's age = 2 × 9 = 18 years

Step 2: Find the age of Ann's brother in 3 years.
Ann's brother's age in 3 years = Ann's brother's current age + 3 years
Ann's brother's age in 3 years = 18 + 3 = 21 years

Therefore, Ann's brother ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the current age of Ann's brother and then calculate how old he will be in 3 years.

1. **Determine Ann's current age:**
   - Ann is currently 9 years old.

2. **Determine her brother's current age:**
   - The problem states that Ann's brother is twice her age. Therefore, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2 to find her brother's age.
   \[
   \text{Brother's current age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]
   So, ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Ann's age is given as 9 years old.

Her brother is twice her age, which means her brother is 2 * 9 = <<2*9=18>>18 years old.

In 3 years, Ann's brother will be 18 + 3 = <<18+3=21>>21 years old.

So, Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Ann is 9 years old.
   * Ann's brother is twice her age.
   * We need to find her brother's age after 3 years.

2. Calculate Ann's brother's current age:
   * Ann's age = 9 years
   * Her brother's age = 2 × Ann's age
   * Her brother's age = 2 × 9 = 18 years
   So, Ann's brother is currently 18 years old.

3. Calculate Ann's brother's age after 3 years:
   * Cur...
