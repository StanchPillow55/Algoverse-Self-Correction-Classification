=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many siblings Janet and Carlos have based on the information given about Masud's siblings.

1. **Identify the number of siblings Masud has:**
   - Masud has 60 siblings.

2. **Calculate the number of siblings Janet has:**
   - According to the problem, Janet has 60 less than four times as many siblings as Masud.
   - First, we calculate four times the number of siblings Masud has:
     \[
     4 \times 60 = 240
     \]
   - Now, we subtract 60 from this result to find out how many siblings Janet has:
     \[
     240 - 60 = 180
     \]
   - Therefore, Janet has 180 siblings.

3. **Calculate the number of siblings Carlos has:**
   - The problem states that Carlos has \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many siblings as Masud.
   - We calculate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the number of siblings Masud has:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 60 = 45
     \]
   - Thus, Carlos has 45 siblings.

4. **Determine how many more siblings Janet has than Carlos:**
   - We need to find the difference between the number of siblings Janet has and the number of siblings Carlos has:
     \[
     180 - 45 = 135
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Janet has 135 more siblings than Carlos.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Janet has 60 less than four times as many siblings as Masud.
- Carlos has 3/4 times as many siblings as Masud.
- Masud has 60 siblings.

Step 1: Find the number of siblings Janet has.
Janet has 60 less than four times as many siblings as Masud.
Masud has 60 siblings, so four times as many siblings as Masud is 4 × 60 = 240.
Janet has 240 - 60 = 180 siblings.

Step 2: Find the numbe...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many siblings Janet and Carlos have.

According to the problem, Janet has 60 less than four times as many siblings as Masud. Since Masud has 60 siblings, we can calculate the number of siblings Janet has by multiplying 60 by 4 and then subtracting 60.

60 * 4 = 240
240 - 60 = 180

So, Janet has 180 siblings.

The problem also states that Carlos has 3/4 times as many siblings as Masud. We can find out how many siblings Carlos has by multiplyi...
