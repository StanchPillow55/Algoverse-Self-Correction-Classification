=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to clarify the relationships between the ages of Mason, Sydney, and Mason's father.

1. **Understanding the relationships:**
   - The problem states that Mason is "three times younger than Sydney." This phrase can be a bit confusing, but we can interpret it as follows: if Mason is \( M \) years old and Sydney is \( S \) years old, then:
     \[
     S = M + 3M = 4M
     \]
   - This means Sydney is four times Mason's age.

2. **Given information:**
   - Mason's age \( M = 20 \) years.

3. **Calculating Sydney's age:**
   - Using the relationship we derived:
     \[
     S = 4M = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Understanding the relationship with Mason's father:**
   - The problem states that Sydney is six years younger than Mason's father. If we let \( F \) represent Mason's father's age, we can express this relationship as:
     \[
     F = S + 6
     \]

5. **Calculating Mason's father's age:**
   - Substituting Sydney's age into the equation:
     \[
     F = 80 + 6 = 86 \text{ years old}
     \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, Mason's father is \( \boxed{86} \) years old.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mason is 3 times younger than Sydney.
- Sydney is 6 years younger than Mason's father.
- Mason is 20 years old.

Step 1: Find Sydney's age.
Since Mason is 3 times younger than Sydney, we can use the following equation:
Mason's age = Sydney's age / 3
20 = Sydney's age / 3
Sydney's age = 20 ร 3 = 60 years old

Step 2: Find Mason's father's age.
Since Sydney is 6 years younger than Mason's f...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to carefully interpret the relationships given in the problem and use algebra to find the age of Mason's father.

1. **Understanding the Relationships:**
   - Mason is 20 years old.
   - Mason is three times younger than Sydney. This phrase can be confusing, but typically "three times younger" means that Sydney's age is such that Mason's age is one-fourth of Sydney's age. This is because if Mason is three times younger, it implies Sydney is...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that Mason is three times younger than Sydney. If Mason is 20 years old, then Sydney is 20 * 3 = <<20*3=60>>60 years old.

The problem also states that Sydney is six years younger than Mason's father. Therefore, Mason's father is 60 + 6 = <<60+6=66>>66 years old.

So, Mason's father is 66 years old.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the information given to set up equations and solve for Mason's father's age.

Given:
- Mason is three times younger than Sydney.
- Sydney is six years younger than Mason's father.
- Mason is 20 years old.

Step 1: Let's express Mason's age in terms of Sydney's age.
Mason's age = Sydney's age รท 3

Step 2: Since Mason is 20 years old, we can substitute this value into the equation from Step 1.
20...
