=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To calculate Mr. Jesiah's total income in June from selling milk, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the daily milk production**: 
   Mr. Jesiah's cows produce 200 gallons of milk every day.

2. **Calculate the total milk production for June**:
   June has 30 days. Therefore, the total milk production for the month of June can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total milk production in June} = \text{Daily production} \times \text{Number of days in June}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total milk production in June} = 200 \text{ gallons/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 6000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Determine the selling price of the milk**:
   Mr. Jesiah sells 1 gallon of milk for $3.55.

4. **Calculate the total income from selling milk**:
   The total income from selling all the milk produced in June can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total income} = \text{Total milk production} \times \text{Price per gallon}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total income} = 6000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.55 \text{ dollars/gallon}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total income} = 21300 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Mr. Jesiah's total income in June from selling milk is **$21,300**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{21300}
\]
