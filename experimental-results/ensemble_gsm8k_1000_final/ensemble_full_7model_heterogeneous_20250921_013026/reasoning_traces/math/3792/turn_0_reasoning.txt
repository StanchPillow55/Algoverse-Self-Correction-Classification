=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the number of members in the third group of the choir, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of choir members**: The problem states that the choir has a total of 70 members.

2. **Identify the number of members in the first and second groups**: 
   - The first group has 25 members.
   - The second group has 30 members.

3. **Calculate the total number of members in the first and second groups**:
   \[
   \text{Total members in first and second groups} = \text{Members in first group} + \text{Members in second group}
   \]
   \[
   = 25 + 30 = 55
   \]

4. **Determine the number of members in the third group**: 
   To find the number of members in the third group, we subtract the total number of members in the first and second groups from the overall total number of choir members:
   \[
   \text{Members in third group} = \text{Total choir members} - \text{Total members in first and second groups}
   \]
   \[
   = 70 - 55 = 15
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: The number of members in the third group is 15.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The choir has 3 groups.
- The first group has 25 members.
- The second group has 30 members.
- The overall choir has 70 members.

To find the number of members in the third group, we need to subtract the number of members in the first two groups from the total number of members in the choir.

Step 1: Find the total number of members in the first two groups.
Members in the first group: 25
Membe...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many members are in the third group of the choir. We are given the following information:

1. The total number of choir members is 70.
2. The first group has 25 members.
3. The second group has 30 members.
4. The third group consists of the remaining members.

We can find the number of members in the third group by subtracting the number of members in the first and second groups from the total number of choir members.

Let'...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem tells us that the choir splits into three groups. The first group has 25 members and the second group has 30 members. We are asked to find out how many members are in the third group.

To find this, we first need to add the number of members in the first and second group. 

25 (first group) + 30 (second group) = 55 members

This means that 55 out of the 70 total members are in the first and second groups. 

To find out how many are in the third group, we subtr...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. To find out how many members are in the third group, we need to subtract the number of members in the first and second groups from the total number of choir members.

Given:
- The choir has a total of 70 members.
- The first group has 25 members.
- The second group has 30 members.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of members in the first and second groups.
Members in first and second groups = Members in...
