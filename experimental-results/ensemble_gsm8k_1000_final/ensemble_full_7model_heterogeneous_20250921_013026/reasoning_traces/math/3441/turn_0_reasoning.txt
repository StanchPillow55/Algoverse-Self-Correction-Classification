=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much the pet store sells the geckos for and then calculate their profit based on the purchase price from Brandon.

1. **Determine the selling price of the geckos at the pet store:**
   - Brandon sold the geckos to the pet store for $100.
   - The pet store sells them for $5 more than 3 times the price they paid.
   - We can express this mathematically as follows:

   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = 3 \times \text{Cost Price} + 5
   \]

   Substituting the cost price (which is $100):

   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = 3 \times 100 + 5
   \]

   Now, calculate \(3 \times 100\):

   \[
   3 \times 100 = 300
   \]

   Now add 5:

   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = 300 + 5 = 305
   \]

   So, the pet store sells the geckos for **$305**.

2. **Calculate the profit for the pet store:**
   - Profit is calculated as the selling price minus the cost price.

   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Profit} = 305 - 100
   \]

   Now, calculate the profit:

   \[
   \text{Profit} = 205
   \]

Thus, the pet store's profit from selling the geckos is **$205**.

**Final Answer: $205**

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much the pet store sells the geckos for. According to the problem, the pet store sells the geckos for 5 more than 3 times the price that Brandon sold them for. 

We can express this as an equation: 

Pet store price = 3 * Brandon's price + 5

Substituting the given value of Brandon's price (100$), we get:

Pet store price = 3 * 100 + 5 = 300 + 5 = 305$

Now, to find the profit that the pet store makes, we need to subtract the cost (what the ...
