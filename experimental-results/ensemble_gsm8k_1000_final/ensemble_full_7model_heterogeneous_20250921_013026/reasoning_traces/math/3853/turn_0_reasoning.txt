=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many slices of cheesecake Kiley ate, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of slices in the cheesecake**:
   Each slice of cheesecake contains 350 calories, and the total cheesecake has 2800 calories. To find the total number of slices, we divide the total calories by the calories per slice:

   \[
   \text{Total slices} = \frac{\text{Total calories}}{\text{Calories per slice}} = \frac{2800 \text{ calories}}{350 \text{ calories/slice}}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \text{Total slices} = \frac{2800}{350} = 8
   \]

   So, there are 8 slices of cheesecake in total.

2. **Determine how much cheesecake Kiley ate**:
   Kiley ate 25% of the cheesecake. To find out how many slices this represents, we first calculate 25% of the total number of slices:

   \[
   \text{Slices eaten by Kiley} = 25\% \times \text{Total slices} = 0.25 \times 8
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Slices eaten by Kiley} = 0.25 \times 8 = 2
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   Kiley ate 2 slices of cheesecake.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each slice of cheesecake contains 350 calories.
- There are a total of 2800 calories in every cheesecake.
- Kiley ate 25% of the cheesecake.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices in one cheesecake.
Total calories in one cheesecake / Calories per slice = Total number of slices
2800 calories / 350 calories per slice = 8 slices

Step 2: Calculate the number of slices Kiley ate.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices of cheesecake Kiley ate based on the information given about calories.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Slices in the Cheesecake:**

   We know that each slice of cheesecake contains 350 calories, and the entire cheesecake contains 2800 calories. To find the total number of slices in the cheesecake, we divide the total calories by the calories per slice:

   \[
   \text{Total numbe...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many slices are in a whole cheesecake. To do this, we divide the total number of calories in the cheesecake by the number of calories per slice. 

2800 calories / 350 calories/slice = 8 slices

So, there are 8 slices in a whole cheesecake.

Next, we need to find out how many slices Kiley ate. Since Kiley ate 25% of the cheesecake, we multiply the total number of slices by 25%.

8 slices * 25% = 2 slices

Therefore, Kiley ate 2 slices of che...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Each slice of cheesecake contains 350 calories.
   * The entire cheesecake has a total of 2800 calories.
   * Kiley ate 25% of the cheesecake.

2. Calculate the number of slices in the entire cheesecake:
   * Total calories in the cheesecake = 2800
   * Calories per slice = 350
   * Number of slices = Total calories รท Calories per slice
   * Number of slices = 2800 รท 3...
