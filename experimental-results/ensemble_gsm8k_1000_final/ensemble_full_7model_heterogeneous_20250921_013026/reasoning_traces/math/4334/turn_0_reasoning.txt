=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many more minutes Joan has for each question on the Math exam compared to the English exam, we will first calculate the time allocated per question for each exam.

### Step 1: Calculate time per question for the English exam

The English exam has 30 questions and is to be completed in 1 hour. 

1 hour = 60 minutes.

Now, we calculate the time per question for the English exam:

\[
\text{Time per question (English)} = \frac{\text{Total time (in minutes)}}{\text{Number of questions}} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ questions}} = 2 \text{ minutes per question}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate time per question for the Math exam

The Math exam has 15 questions and is to be completed in 1.5 hours.

1.5 hours = 1.5 × 60 minutes = 90 minutes.

Now, we calculate the time per question for the Math exam:

\[
\text{Time per question (Math)} = \frac{\text{Total time (in minutes)}}{\text{Number of questions}} = \frac{90 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ questions}} = 6 \text{ minutes per question}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in time per question

Now, we find out how many more minutes Joan has for each question on the Math exam compared to the English exam:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Time per question (Math)} - \text{Time per question (English)} = 6 \text{ minutes} - 2 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

Joan has **4 more minutes** for each question on the Math exam than on the English exam.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time Joan spends on each question for both the English and Math exams, and then find the difference in time per question between the two exams.

**Step 1: Calculate the time per question for the English exam.**

- The English exam has 30 questions.
- The total time allotted for the English exam is 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes.

To find the time spent per question on the English exam, we divide the total ti...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many minutes Joan has to complete each exam.

The English exam is to be completed in 1 hour, which is equal to 60 minutes. The Math exam is to be completed in 1.5 hours, which is equal to 90 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how much time Joan has to answer each question on each exam.

For the English exam, Joan has 60 minutes to answer 30 questions. So, she has 60/30 = 2 minutes to answer each question.

For the Math exam, Joan has 90 min...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The English exam has 30 questions and needs to be completed in 1 hour.
   * The Math exam has 15 questions and needs to be completed in 1.5 hours.
   * Joan wants to spend an equal amount of time on each question.

2. Convert the time for both exams into minutes:
   * English exam: 1 hour = 60 minutes
   * Math exam: 1.5 hours = 1.5 × 60 = 90 minutes

3. Calculate the ...
