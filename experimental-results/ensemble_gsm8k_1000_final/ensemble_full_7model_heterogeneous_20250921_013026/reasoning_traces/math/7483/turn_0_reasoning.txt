=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will calculate the number of downloads for each month step by step and then find the total downloads over the three months.

1. **First Month Downloads**:
   - The problem states that there were 60 downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{First Month Downloads} = 60
   \]

2. **Second Month Downloads**:
   - The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Second Month Downloads} = 3 \times \text{First Month Downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month Downloads**:
   - The downloads in the third month were reduced by 30% from the second month. First, we need to calculate 30% of the second month's downloads:
   \[
   \text{30% of Second Month Downloads} = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   - Now, we subtract this amount from the second month's downloads to find the third month's downloads:
   \[
   \text{Third Month Downloads} = \text{Second Month Downloads} - \text{30% of Second Month Downloads} = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months**:
   - Now we add the downloads from all three months together:
   \[
   \text{Total Downloads} = \text{First Month Downloads} + \text{Second Month Downloads} + \text{Third Month Downloads}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Downloads} = 366
   \]

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is **366**.

Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{366}
\]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break this problem down step by step.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the program had three times as many downloads as the first month. This means the program had 60 downloads * 3 = 180 downloads in the second month.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30%. This means the program had 180 downloads * 30/100 = 54 fewer downloads than the second month.

So, in the third month, the program had 180 downloads - ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. First month downloads:
   * The program had 60 downloads in the first month.

2. Second month downloads:
   * The number of downloads in the second month was three times the first month.
   * First month downloads = 60
   * Second month downloads = 60 × 3 = 180

3. Third month downloads:
   * The downloads in the third month were reduced by 30% compared to the second month.
