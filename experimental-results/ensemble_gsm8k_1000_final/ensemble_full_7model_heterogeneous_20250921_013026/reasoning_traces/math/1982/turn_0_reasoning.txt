=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much masking tape Elijah needs to order, we first need to calculate the total width of all the walls in his living room.

1. **Identify the dimensions of the walls**:
   - There are 2 walls that are 4 meters wide.
   - There are 2 walls that are 6 meters wide.

2. **Calculate the total width of the 4-meter walls**:
   \[
   \text{Total width of 4-meter walls} = 2 \times 4 \text{ meters} = 8 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total width of the 6-meter walls**:
   \[
   \text{Total width of 6-meter walls} = 2 \times 6 \text{ meters} = 12 \text{ meters}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total width of all the walls**:
   \[
   \text{Total width of all walls} = \text{Total width of 4-meter walls} + \text{Total width of 6-meter walls}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total width of all walls} = 8 \text{ meters} + 12 \text{ meters} = 20 \text{ meters}
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   Elijah needs enough masking tape to cover the entire width of all the walls, which totals 20 meters.

Therefore, the amount of masking tape Elijah needs to order is:
\[
\boxed{20} \text{ meters}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total width of all the walls that Elijah needs to cover with masking tape.

Given information:
- 2 walls are 4 meters wide.
- 2 walls are 6 meters wide.

Step 1: Calculate the total width of the 2 walls that are 4 meters wide.
Total width of 4-meter walls = 2 × 4 meters = 8 meters

Step 2: Calculate the total width of the 2 walls that are 6 meters wide.
Total width of 6-meter walls = 2 × 6 meters = 12 meters

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how much masking tape Elijah needs to order, we need to calculate the total length of tape required to cover the width of all four walls in his living room.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the dimensions of the walls:**
   - Elijah has two walls that are each 4 meters wide.
   - He also has two walls that are each 6 meters wide.

2. **Calculate the total length of masking tape needed:**
   - For the two walls that are 4 meters wide...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Elijah needs to cover the width of each wall with masking tape. He has 2 walls that are 4 meters wide and 2 walls that are 6 meters wide.

To find the total amount of masking tape he needs, we need to add the width of all the walls together.

First, let's calculate the total width of the 4-meter walls:
2 walls * 4 meters/wall = 8 meters

Then, let's calculate the total width of the 6-meter walls:
2 walls * 6 meters/wall = 12 meters

Finally, let's add these two amounts to...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. To find out how many meters of masking tape Elijah needs to order, we need to calculate the total width of all the walls in his living room.

Given:
- Elijah's living room has 4 walls in total.
- 2 walls are 4 meters wide each.
- The other 2 walls are 6 meters wide each.

Step 1: Calculate the total width of the two 4-meter walls.
Width of two 4-meter walls = 2 × 4 meters = 8 meters

Step 2: Calculate the to...
