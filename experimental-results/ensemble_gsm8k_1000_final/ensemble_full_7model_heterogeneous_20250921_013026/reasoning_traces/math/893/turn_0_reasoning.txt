=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many beads Kylie uses in total to make her jewelry, we need to calculate the number of beads used for each type of jewelry she makes and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of beads used for necklaces

Kylie makes 10 beaded necklaces, and each necklace requires 20 beads.

\[
\text{Total beads for necklaces} = \text{Number of necklaces} \times \text{Beads per necklace}
\]
\[
\text{Total beads for necklaces} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ beads}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of beads used for bracelets

Kylie makes 5 beaded bracelets, and each bracelet requires 10 beads.

\[
\text{Total beads for bracelets} = \text{Number of bracelets} \times \text{Beads per bracelet}
\]
\[
\text{Total beads for bracelets} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ beads}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of beads used for earrings

Kylie makes 7 beaded earrings, and each earring requires 5 beads.

\[
\text{Total beads for earrings} = \text{Number of earrings} \times \text{Beads per earring}
\]
\[
\text{Total beads for earrings} = 7 \times 5 = 35 \text{ beads}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of beads used

Now, we will sum the total number of beads used for necklaces, bracelets, and earrings.

\[
\text{Total beads used} = \text{Total beads for necklaces} + \text{Total beads for bracelets} + \text{Total beads for earrings}
\]
\[
\text{Total beads used} = 200 + 50 + 35
\]
\[
\text{Total beads used} = 285 \text{ beads}
\]

### Final Answer

Kylie uses a total of **285 beads** to make her jewelry.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of beads Kylie uses for each type of jewelry and then sum these amounts to find the total number of beads used.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of beads used for necklaces.**

Kylie makes 10 necklaces on Monday and 2 necklaces on Tuesday. Therefore, the total number of necklaces made is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ necklaces} \]

Each necklace requires 20 beads. Therefore, the total number of beads used for the neck...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to multiply the number of each type of jewelry Kylie makes by the number of beads required to make that type of jewelry. Then we add up all the beads used for each type of jewelry to get the total number of beads used.

First, let's calculate how many beads Kylie uses to make her necklaces. On Monday, she makes 10 necklaces, and each necklace requires 20 beads. So, she uses 10 necklaces * 20 beads/necklace = 200 beads on Monday. On Tuesday, ...

1. Understand the given information:
   * Kylie makes 10 necklaces on Monday and 2 necklaces on Tuesday.
   * On Wednesday, Kylie makes 5 bracelets and 7 earrings.
   * Each necklace requires 20 beads.
   * Each bracelet requires 10 beads.
   * Each earring requires 5 beads.

2. Calculate the total number of necklaces:
   * Total necklaces = Monday's necklaces + Tuesday's necklaces
