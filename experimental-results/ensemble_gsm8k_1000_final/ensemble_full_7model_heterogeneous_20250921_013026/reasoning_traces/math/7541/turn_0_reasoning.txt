=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of boys and girls.**
2. **Calculate the total number of students.**
3. **Determine the number of teachers based on the student-to-teacher ratio.**

### Step 1: Identify the number of boys and girls

We are given that there are 60 girls at Dr. Wertz's school. According to the problem, there are twice as many boys as girls. 

To find the number of boys, we can use the following calculation:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of students

Now that we know the number of boys and girls, we can find the total number of students in the school:

\[
\text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} = 120 + 60 = 180
\]

### Step 3: Determine the number of teachers

We are told that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

\[
\text{Number of teachers} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Students per teacher}} = \frac{180}{5}
\]

Now, we perform the division:

\[
\text{Number of teachers} = 36
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is \( \boxed{36} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school.
- There are 60 girls at the school.
- There are 5 students for every teacher.

Step 1: Find the number of boys at the school.
Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
Number of boys = 2 × Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 × 60 = 120 boys

Step 2: Find the total number of stude...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many boys there are at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we multiply 60 by 2 to find the number of boys.

60 girls * 2 = 120 boys

Next, we need to find the total number of students at the school. We do this by adding the number of boys and girls together.

120 boys + 60 girls = 180 students

Finally, we need to find out how many teachers there are at the school. Since there are 5 studen...
