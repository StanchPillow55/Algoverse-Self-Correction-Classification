=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Selene and Tanya spend together, we will first calculate the total cost for each of them separately and then add those amounts together.

**Step 1: Calculate Selene's total expenditure.**

Selene buys:
- 3 sandwiches
- 1 can of fruit juice

The cost of each item is as follows:
- Sandwich: $2
- Can of fruit juice: $2

Now, we calculate the total cost for Selene:

1. Cost of sandwiches:
   \[
   \text{Cost of sandwiches} = \text{Number of sandwiches} \times \text{Cost per sandwich} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Cost of fruit juice:
   \[
   \text{Cost of fruit juice} = \text{Number of cans} \times \text{Cost per can} = 1 \times 2 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Total cost for Selene:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Selene} = \text{Cost of sandwiches} + \text{Cost of fruit juice} = 6 + 2 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Step 2: Calculate Tanya's total expenditure.**

Tanya buys:
- 2 hamburgers
- 2 cans of fruit juice

The cost of each item is as follows:
- Hamburger: $2
- Can of fruit juice: $2

Now, we calculate the total cost for Tanya:

1. Cost of hamburgers:
   \[
   \text{Cost of hamburgers} = \text{Number of hamburgers} \times \text{Cost per hamburger} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Cost of fruit juice:
   \[
   \text{Cost of fruit juice} = \text{Number of cans} \times \text{Cost per can} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Total cost for Tanya:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Tanya} = \text{Cost of hamburgers} + \text{Cost of fruit juice} = 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total expenditure for both Selene and Tanya.**

Now, we add the total costs for Selene and Tanya:
\[
\text{Total expenditure} = \text{Total cost for Selene} + \text{Total cost for Tanya} = 8 + 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**
Selene and Tanya spend together a total of **$16**.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent by Selene and Tanya separately, and then add them together to find the total amount spent by both of them.

Given information:
- Sandwich: $2 each
- Hamburger: $2 each
- Hotdog: $1 each
- Fruit juice: $2 each

Selene's purchase:
- 3 sandwiches at $2 each = 3 × $2 = $6
- 1 can of fruit juice at $2 each = 1 × $2 = $2
Total amount spent by Selene = $6 + $2 = $8

Tanya's purchase:
- 2 hamb...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent by Selene and Tanya separately, and then add these amounts together to find the total expenditure.

**Step 1: Calculate Selene's total expenditure.**

Selene buys:
- 3 sandwiches
- 1 can of fruit juice

The cost of one sandwich is $2. Therefore, the cost for 3 sandwiches is calculated as follows:
\[ 
3 \text{ sandwiches} \times \$2/\text{sandwich} = \$6 
\]

The cost of one can of fruit juice is ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how much Selene and Tanya each spent.

Selene bought three sandwiches and a can of fruit juice. Each sandwich costs $2, so three sandwiches cost 3 * $2 = $<<3*2=6>>6. The can of fruit juice costs $2. Therefore, Selene spent a total of $6 (for the sandwiches) + $2 (for the fruit juice) = $<<6+2=8>>8.

Tanya bought two hamburgers and two cans of fruit juice. Each hamburger costs $2, so two hamburgers cost 2 * $2 = $<<2*2=4>>4. Each can of fruit j...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * A sandwich costs $2
   * A hamburger costs $2
   * One stick of hotdog costs $1
   * A can of fruit juice costs $2
   * Selene buys three sandwiches and a can of fruit juice
   * Tanya buys two hamburgers and two cans of fruit juice

2. Calculate the amount Selene spends:
   * Cost of three sandwiches = 3 × $2 = $6
   * Cost of one can of fruit juice = $2
   * Total am...
