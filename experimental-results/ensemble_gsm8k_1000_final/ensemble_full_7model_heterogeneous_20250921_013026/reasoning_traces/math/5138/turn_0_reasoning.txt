=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many towels the hotel hands out based on the number of rooms, the number of families in those rooms, and the number of towels each person receives.

1. **Identify the number of rooms**: The hotel has 10 rooms.

2. **Determine the number of families**: Since each room is occupied by a family, there are 10 families in total (one family per room).

3. **Identify the number of people per family**: Each family consists of 3 members.

4. **Calculate the total number of people in the hotel**:
   \[
   \text{Total number of people} = \text{Number of families} \times \text{Number of people per family}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of people} = 10 \text{ families} \times 3 \text{ people/family} = 30 \text{ people}
   \]

5. **Determine the number of towels each person receives**: Each person receives 2 towels.

6. **Calculate the total number of towels handed out**:
   \[
   \text{Total number of towels} = \text{Total number of people} \times \text{Towels per person}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of towels} = 30 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ towels/person} = 60 \text{ towels}
   \]

Thus, the hotel hands out a total of 60 towels.

**Final Answer**: The hotel hands out 60 towels.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Step 1: Find the total number of people in the hotel.
Since each room holds a family of 3 and the hotel has 10 rooms, the total number of people in the hotel is 3 people/room * 10 rooms = 30 people.
