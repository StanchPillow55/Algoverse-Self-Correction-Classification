=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many servings of peanut butter Toby should add to his toast to reach a total of 500 calories for breakfast, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the calories from the bread**:
   - Toby has one piece of bread, which contains 100 calories.

2. **Calculate the remaining calories needed**:
   - Toby wants a total of 500 calories for breakfast. 
   - Since he is consuming 100 calories from the bread, we need to find out how many more calories he needs from the peanut butter.
   \[
   \text{Remaining calories needed} = \text{Total calories desired} - \text{Calories from bread}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining calories needed} = 500 - 100 = 400 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Identify the calories per serving of peanut butter**:
   - A serving of peanut butter has 200 calories.

4. **Calculate the number of servings of peanut butter needed**:
   - To find out how many servings of peanut butter Toby needs to consume to reach the remaining 400 calories, we can use the following formula:
   \[
   \text{Number of servings} = \frac{\text{Remaining calories needed}}{\text{Calories per serving of peanut butter}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of servings} = \frac{400}{200} = 2
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Toby should add 2 servings of peanut butter to his toast to reach a total of 500 calories for breakfast.

Thus, the final answer is that Toby should add **2 servings of peanut butter**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of servings of peanut butter Toby should add to the one piece of bread to reach a total of 500 calories for his breakfast.

Given information:
- A piece of bread has 100 calories.
- A serving of peanut butter has 200 calories.
- Toby wants to have a total of 500 calories for breakfast.
- Toby has one piece of bread.

Step 1: Calculate the number of calories from the one piece of bread.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many servings of peanut butter Toby should add to his toast to reach a total of 500 calories for his breakfast.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the calories from the bread:**
   - Toby is using one piece of bread, and each piece of bread has 100 calories.
   - Therefore, the calories from the bread are \(100\) calories.

2. **Determine the total calorie goal:**
   - Toby wants his breakfast to hav...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Toby wants to have a total of 500 calories for breakfast. He is starting with a piece of bread that has 100 calories. 

So, we subtract the calories from the bread from the total calories he wants:

500 calories (total) - 100 calories (bread) = 400 calories

This means Toby needs to get 400 more calories from the peanut butter. 

Each serving of peanut butter has 200 calories. To find out how many servings of peanut butter Toby needs, we divide the remaining calories by t...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Toby wants his breakfast to have 500 calories.
   * One piece of bread has 100 calories.
   * One serving of peanut butter has 200 calories.
   * Toby is using one piece of bread.

2. Calculate the calories from the bread:
   * Calories from bread = 1 piece Ã— 100 calories per piece
   * Calories from bread = 100 calories

3. Calculate the remaining calories needed from...
