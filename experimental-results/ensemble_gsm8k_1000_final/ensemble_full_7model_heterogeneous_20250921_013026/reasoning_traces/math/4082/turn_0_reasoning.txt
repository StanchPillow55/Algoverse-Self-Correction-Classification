=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify how many balloons Anthony filled up**: 
   According to the problem, Anthony filled up 44 water balloons.

2. **Determine how many balloons Luke filled up**: 
   The problem states that Luke filled up one fourth as many balloons as Anthony. 
   To find out how many balloons Luke filled, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Luke's balloons} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Anthony's balloons} = \frac{1}{4} \times 44
   \]
   Performing the calculation:
   \[
   \text{Luke's balloons} = \frac{44}{4} = 11
   \]
   So, Luke filled up 11 water balloons.

3. **Determine how many balloons Tom filled up**: 
   The problem states that Tom filled up 3 times as many water balloons as Luke. 
   To find out how many balloons Tom filled, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Tom's balloons} = 3 \times \text{Luke's balloons} = 3 \times 11
   \]
   Performing the calculation:
   \[
   \text{Tom's balloons} = 33
   \]
   So, Tom filled up 33 water balloons.

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the final answer is that Tom filled up **33 water balloons**.
