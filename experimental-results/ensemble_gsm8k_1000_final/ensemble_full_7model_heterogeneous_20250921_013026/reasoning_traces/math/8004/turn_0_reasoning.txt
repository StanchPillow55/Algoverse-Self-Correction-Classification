=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem step by step, we will keep track of the number of passengers on the bus after each stop.

1. **Initial Number of Passengers:**
   - The bus starts with 48 passengers.

2. **First Stop:**
   - **Passengers Getting Off:** 8 passengers get off the bus.
   - **Calculating Remaining Passengers:**
     \[
     48 - 8 = 40 \text{ passengers remaining}
     \]
   - **Passengers Getting On:** 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off:
     \[
     5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ passengers get on}
     \]
   - **Calculating Total Passengers After First Stop:**
     \[
     40 + 40 = 80 \text{ passengers}
     \]

3. **Second Stop:**
   - **Passengers Getting Off:** 21 passengers get off the bus.
   - **Calculating Remaining Passengers:**
     \[
     80 - 21 = 59 \text{ passengers remaining}
     \]
   - **Passengers Getting On:** 3 times fewer passengers get on than those who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ passengers get on}
     \]
   - **Calculating Total Passengers After Second Stop:**
     \[
     59 + 7 = 66 \text{ passengers}
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - After the second stop, there are **66 passengers** riding the bus.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{66}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- Initially, there are 48 people riding the bus.
- At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus.
- At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, and 3 times fewer passengers get on.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to track the number of passengers on the bus as people get on and off at each stop. Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Passengers:**
   - The bus starts with 48 passengers.

2. **First Stop:**
   - 8 passengers get off the bus.
   - Therefore, the number of passengers after 8 get off is:
     \[
     48 - 8 = 40
     \]
   - 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers g...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: Determine the number of passengers after the first stop.
We know that 48 people are initially on the bus and 8 people get off at the first stop. So, we subtract 8 from 48 to find the number of people left on the bus after the first stop.
48 - 8 = 40 people

Step 2: Determine the number of passengers who get on the bus at the first stop.
We know that 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the b...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start with the initial number of passengers and then calculate the number of passengers after each stop.

Given:
- Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
- At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus.
- At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, and 3 times fewer passengers get on.
