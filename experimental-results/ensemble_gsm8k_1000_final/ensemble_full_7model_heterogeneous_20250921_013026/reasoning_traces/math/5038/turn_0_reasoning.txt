=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many peanuts remain in the jar after Brock and Bonita have eaten some.

1. **Initial Count of Peanuts**: 
   The jar initially contains 148 peanuts.

2. **Brock's Consumption**:
   Brock ate one-fourth of the peanuts. To find out how many peanuts that is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Peanuts eaten by Brock} = \frac{1}{4} \times 148
   \]
   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 148 = 37
   \]
   So, Brock ate 37 peanuts.

3. **Bonita's Consumption**:
   Bonita ate 29 peanuts. 

4. **Total Peanuts Eaten**:
   Now we need to find the total number of peanuts eaten by both Brock and Bonita:
   \[
   \text{Total peanuts eaten} = \text{Peanuts eaten by Brock} + \text{Peanuts eaten by Bonita}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total peanuts eaten} = 37 + 29 = 66
   \]

5. **Remaining Peanuts**:
   To find out how many peanuts remain in the jar, we subtract the total peanuts eaten from the initial count:
   \[
   \text{Remaining peanuts} = \text{Initial peanuts} - \text{Total peanuts eaten}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Remaining peanuts} = 148 - 66 = 82
   \]

Thus, the number of peanuts remaining in the jar is \( \boxed{82} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- There were 148 peanuts in the jar.
- Brock ate one-fourth of the peanuts.
- Bonita ate 29 peanuts.

Step 1: Calculate how many peanuts Brock ate.
One-fourth of 148 peanuts = 148 รท 4 = 37 peanuts

Step 2: Calculate the total number of peanuts eaten.
Peanuts eaten by Brock + Peanuts eaten by Bonita = 37 + 29 = 66 peanuts

Step 3: Calculate the number of peanuts remaining in the jar.
Total peanut...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many peanuts remain in the jar after Brock and Bonita have eaten some of them.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of peanuts Brock ate.**

Brock ate one-fourth of the peanuts in the jar. Initially, there were 148 peanuts.

To find out how many peanuts Brock ate, we calculate one-fourth of 148:

\[
\text{Peanuts eaten by Brock} = \frac{1}{4} \times 148
\]

To perform this calculation, divide 148 by 4:

\[
148 \div 4 = 37
\]

So...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many peanuts Brock ate. We know that he ate one-fourth of the peanuts, and there were originally 148 peanuts. So, we multiply 148 by 1/4:

148 * 1/4 = 37 peanuts

So, Brock ate 37 peanuts.

Next, we know that Bonita ate 29 peanuts. 

Now, we need to subtract the total number of peanuts that Brock and Bonita ate from the original number of peanuts in the jar. 

148 (original number of peanuts) - 37 (peanuts Brock ate) - 29 (peanuts Bonita ate...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- There were 148 peanuts in the jar initially.
- Brock ate one-fourth (1/4) of the peanuts.
- Bonita ate 29 peanuts.

Step 1: Calculate the number of peanuts Brock ate.
One-fourth of 148 peanuts = 148 รท 4 = 37 peanuts
So, Brock ate 37 peanuts.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of peanuts eaten by Brock and Bonita.
Total peanuts eaten = Peanuts eaten by Brock + Peanuts eaten by Bonita
Total peanuts ...
