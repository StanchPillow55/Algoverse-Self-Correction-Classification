Final Answer: To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box, taking into account the thickness of the walls.

### Step 1: Determine the outer dimensions of one box
The outer dimensions of each box are given as:
- Length = 5 inches
- Width = 6 inches
- Height = 4 inches

### Step 2: Calculate the inner dimensions
Since the walls of the box are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract twice the thickness (1 inch for each side) from each dimension to find the inner dimensions.

- **Inner Length**:
  \[
  \text{Inner Length} = \text{Outer Length} - 2 \times \text{Wall Thickness} = 5 - 2 \times 1 = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ inches}
  \]

- **Inner Width**:
  \[
  \text{Inner Width} = \text{Outer Width} - 2 \times \text{Wall Thickness} = 6 - 2 \times 1 = 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ inches}
  \]

- **Inner Height**:
  \[
  \text{Inner Height} = \text{Outer Height} - 2 \times \text{Wall Thickness} = 4 - 2 \times 1 = 4 - 2 = 2 \text{ inches}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the inner volume of one box
The inner volume \( V \) of one box can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
\[
V = \text{Inner Length} \times \text{Inner Width} \times \text{Inner Height}
\]
Substituting the inner dimensions we found:
\[
V = 3 \times 4 \times 2
\]
Calculating this:
\[
V = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]
\[
V = 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes
Since there are 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
\[
\text{Total Inner Volume} = 3 \times \text{Volume of One Box} = 3 \times 24
\]
Calculating this:
\[
\text{Total Inner Volume} = 72 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

### Final Answer
The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \( \boxed{72} \) cubic inches.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the inner volume of each box and then multiply it by the total number of boxes.

Given information:
- John has 3 boxes.
- Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
- The walls of each box are 1 inch thick.

Step 1: Calculate the inner dimensions of each box.
Outer dimensions of each box:
- Length = 5 inches
- Width = 6 inches
- Height = 4 inches

Inner dimensions of each box:
- Length = 5 inches - (2 × 1 inch...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the dimensions of the box
Each box has external dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls of the box are 1 inch thick. This means the internal dimensions will be reduced by the thickness of the walls on each side.

### Step 2: Calculate the internal dimensions
- **Length:** The external length is 5 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick on each side, th...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The total inner volume of a box is calculated by multiplying its inner length, width, and height. 

Given that the walls of the box are 1 inch thick, this means that the inner dimensions of the box are reduced by 2 inches in each direction (1 inch for each side). 

So, the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * John has 3 boxes.
   * Each box has dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   * The walls of each box are 1 inch thick.

2. Calculate the inner dimensions of each box:
   * The inner length is the total length minus the thickness of two walls.
     - Inner length = 5 inches - (2 × 1 inch) = 3 inches
   * The inner width is the total width minus the thick...
