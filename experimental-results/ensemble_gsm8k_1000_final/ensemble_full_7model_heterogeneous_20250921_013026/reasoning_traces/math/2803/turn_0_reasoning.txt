=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Todd has left after he buys 4 candy bars.

1. **Identify the initial amount of money Todd has:**
   Todd starts with $20.

2. **Determine the cost of one candy bar:**
   Each candy bar costs $2.

3. **Calculate the total cost of 4 candy bars:**
   To find the total cost, we multiply the cost of one candy bar by the number of candy bars Todd buys:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost per candy bar} \times \text{Number of candy bars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 2 \text{ dollars} \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate how much money Todd has left after the purchase:**
   We subtract the total cost of the candy bars from the initial amount of money Todd had:
   \[
   \text{Money left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 20 \text{ dollars} - 8 \text{ dollars} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   After buying the candy bars, Todd has $12 left.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Todd has $20 to start with.
- He buys 4 candy bars that cost $2 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 4 candy bars.
Cost of 1 candy bar = $2
Total cost of 4 candy bars = 4 × $2 = $8

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Todd has left.
Todd's starting amount = $20
Amount spent on candy bars = $8
Amount of money left = $20 - $8 = $12

Therefore, the final answer is that Todd has $12 le...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Todd spends on the candy bars and then subtract that amount from the total money he initially has.

**Step 1: Determine the cost of one candy bar.**

The problem states that each candy bar costs $2.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of 4 candy bars.**

Since Todd buys 4 candy bars, we need to multiply the cost of one candy bar by the number of candy bars he buys:

\[
\text{Total cost of 4 candy bars} = 4 \times...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total cost of the candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $2 and Todd buys 4 of them, we multiply the cost of one candy bar by the number of candy bars. 

So, $2 * 4 = $8

This means that Todd spent $8 on candy bars.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Todd has left. He started with $20 and spent $8 on candy bars. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he had.

So, $20 - $8 = $12

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Todd has $20.
- He buys 4 candy bars.
- Each candy bar costs $2.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the candy bars.
Total cost = Number of candy bars × Cost per candy bar
Total cost = 4 × $2 = $8

Explanation: To find the total cost of the candy bars, we multiply the number of candy bars Todd bought by the cost per candy bar. Todd bought 4 candy bars at $2 each, so the total cost is 4...
