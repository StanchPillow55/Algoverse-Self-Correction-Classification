=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many boxes Tameka sold over the three days, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of boxes sold on Friday:**
   - Tameka sold 40 boxes on Friday.
   \[
   \text{Boxes sold on Friday} = 40
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of boxes sold on Saturday:**
   - On Saturday, Tameka sold 10 fewer than twice the number of boxes sold on Friday.
   - First, we calculate twice the number of boxes sold on Friday:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80
   \]
   - Now, we subtract 10 from this amount to find the number of boxes sold on Saturday:
   \[
   80 - 10 = 70
   \]
   \[
   \text{Boxes sold on Saturday} = 70
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of boxes sold on Sunday:**
   - On Sunday, Tameka sold half as many boxes as she sold on Saturday.
   - We calculate half of the boxes sold on Saturday:
   \[
   \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]
   \[
   \text{Boxes sold on Sunday} = 35
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of boxes sold over the three days:**
   - Now we add the number of boxes sold on each day:
   \[
   \text{Total boxes sold} = \text{Boxes sold on Friday} + \text{Boxes sold on Saturday} + \text{Boxes sold on Sunday}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total boxes sold} = 40 + 70 + 35
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total boxes sold} = 145
   \]

Thus, the total number of boxes Tameka sold over the three days is \(\boxed{145}\).

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Friday, Tameka sold 40 boxes.

On Saturday, she sold 10 fewer than twice the number of boxes she sold on Friday. To find out how many boxes she sold on Saturday, we first need to double the number of boxes she sold on Friday, which is 40 * 2 = 80. Then, we subtract 10 from this number to find out how many boxes she sold on Saturday, which is 80 - 10 = 70 boxes.

The problem states that on Sunday, she sold half as many as Sund...
