=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the jump distances for each competitor based on the information provided.

1. **First Competitor's Jump:**
   - The first competitor jumped a distance of 22 feet.
   \[
   \text{First Competitor's Jump} = 22 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Second Competitor's Jump:**
   - The second competitor jumped one foot farther than the first competitor.
   \[
   \text{Second Competitor's Jump} = 22 \text{ feet} + 1 \text{ foot} = 23 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Third Competitor's Jump:**
   - The third competitor jumped two feet shorter than the second competitor.
   \[
   \text{Third Competitor's Jump} = 23 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 21 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Fourth Competitor's Jump:**
   - The fourth competitor jumped three feet further than the third competitor.
   \[
   \text{Fourth Competitor's Jump} = 21 \text{ feet} + 3 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]

Now that we have calculated the jump distances for all competitors, we can summarize the results:

- First Competitor: 22 feet
- Second Competitor: 23 feet
- Third Competitor: 21 feet
- Fourth Competitor: 24 feet

Finally, the question asks for the distance jumped by the fourth competitor. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{24} \text{ feet}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The first competitor jumped a distance of 22 feet.
- The second competitor jumped one foot farther than the first competitor.
- The third competitor jumped two feet shorter than the third competitor.
- The fourth competitor jumped 3 feet further than the third competitor.

Step 1: Calculate the distance jumped by the second competitor.
Distance jumped by the second competitor = Di...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the jump distances for each competitor and ultimately find out how far the fourth competitor jumped.

1. **First Competitor:**
   - The first competitor jumped a distance of 22 feet.

2. **Second Competitor:**
   - The second competitor jumped one foot farther than the first competitor.
   - Calculation: \(22 \text{ feet} + 1 \text{ foot} = 23 \text{ feet}\)

3. **Third Competitor:**
   - The problem states that the third compe...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem gives us the distances of the jumps in relation to each other. 

We know that the first competitor jumped a distance of 22 feet. 

The second competitor jumped one foot farther than the first competitor. So, the second competitor jumped 22 feet + 1 foot = 23 feet.

The problem states that the third competitor jumped two feet shorter than the third competitor, but this seems to be a mistake. It would make more sense if the third competitor jumped two feet short...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start with the given information and calculate the jump distances for each competitor.

Given:
- The first competitor jumped 22 feet.
- The second competitor jumped one foot farther than the first competitor.
- The third competitor jumped two feet shorter than the second competitor.
- The fourth competitor jumped 3 feet further than the third competitor.

Step 1: Calculate the second competitor's jump ...
