=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much sod Jill needs to cover her yard, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the area of the entire yard.**
2. **Calculate the area of the sidewalk.**
3. **Calculate the area of the flower beds.**
4. **Subtract the areas of the sidewalk and flower beds from the total yard area to find the area that needs sod.**

### Step 1: Calculate the area of the entire yard

The yard is a rectangle with a width of 200 feet and a length of 50 feet.

\[
\text{Area of the yard} = \text{width} \times \text{length} = 200 \, \text{feet} \times 50 \, \text{feet} = 10,000 \, \text{square feet}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the sidewalk

The sidewalk is also a rectangle with a width of 3 feet and a length of 50 feet.

\[
\text{Area of the sidewalk} = \text{width} \times \text{length} = 3 \, \text{feet} \times 50 \, \text{feet} = 150 \, \text{square feet}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the area of the flower beds

There are four flower beds with the following dimensions:

1. Two flower beds that are 4 feet deep by 25 feet long:
   \[
   \text{Area of one flower bed} = 4 \, \text{feet} \times 25 \, \text{feet} = 100 \, \text{square feet}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total area of two flower beds} = 2 \times 100 \, \text{square feet} = 200 \, \text{square feet}
   \]

2. One flower bed that is 10 feet by 12 feet:
   \[
   \text{Area of this flower bed} = 10 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 120 \, \text{square feet}
   \]

3. One flower bed that is 7 feet by 8 feet:
   \[
   \text{Area of this flower bed} = 7 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} = 56 \, \text{square feet}
   \]

Now, we sum the areas of all the flower beds:
\[
\text{Total area of flower beds} = 200 \, \text{square feet} + 120 \, \text{square feet} + 56 \, \text{square feet} = 376 \, \text{square feet}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the area that needs sod

Now we subtract the area of the sidewalk and the area of the flower beds from the total area of the yard:

\[
\text{Area to be covered with sod} = \text{Area of the yard} - \text{Area of the sidewalk} - \text{Total area of flower beds}
\]
\[
\text{Area to be covered with sod} = 10,000 \, \text{square feet} - 150 \, \text{square feet} - 376 \, \text{square feet}
\]
\[
\text{Area to be covered with sod} = 10,000 - 150 - 376 = 9,474 \, \text{square feet}
\]

### Final Answer

Jill will need **9,474 square feet** of sod to cover her yard, minus the sidewalk and flower beds.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total area of the front yard and then subtract the areas of the sidewalk and flower beds.

Given information:
- The plot of land in front of the house is 200 feet wide by 50 feet deep.
- The sidewalk is 3 feet wide and 50 feet long.
- There are four flower beds:
  - Two flower beds in front of the house, each 4 feet deep by 25 feet long.
  - One flower bed that is 10 feet by 12 feet.
  - One flower bed that i...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how many square feet of sod Jill will need, we need to calculate the total area of her yard and then subtract the areas that will not be sodded, which include the sidewalk and the flower beds.

**Step 1: Calculate the total area of the yard.**

The yard is a rectangle that is 200 feet wide and 50 feet long. The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
A = \text{width} \times \text{length}
\]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total area of the yard. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, the total area of the yard is 200 feet * 50 feet = 10,000 square feet.

Next, we need to calculate the area of the sidewalk. The area of the sidewalk is 3 feet * 50 feet = 150 square feet.

Then, we need to calculate the area of the flower beds. The first two flower beds are the same size, so we can calculate the area of one and then mu...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Calculate the total area of the yard:
   * The yard is a rectangle with a width of 200 feet and a length of 50 feet.
   * Area of a rectangle = width × length
   * Total area of the yard = 200 feet × 50 feet = 10,000 square feet

2. Calculate the area of the sidewalk:
   * The sidewalk is also a rectangle with a width of 3 feet and a length of 50 feet.
   * Area of the sidewalk = 3 feet × 50 feet = 150 squa...
