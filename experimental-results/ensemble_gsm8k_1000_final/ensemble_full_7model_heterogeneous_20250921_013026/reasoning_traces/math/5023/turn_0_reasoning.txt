=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many pounds of swords each orc has to carry, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of orcs**: 
   The Dark Lord has 10 squads of 8 orcs each. To find the total number of orcs, we multiply the number of squads by the number of orcs in each squad:

   \[
   \text{Total number of orcs} = \text{Number of squads} \times \text{Number of orcs per squad}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of orcs} = 10 \times 8 = 80
   \]

2. **Determine the total weight of swords**: 
   The total weight of the swords that need to be transported is given as 1200 pounds.

3. **Calculate the weight of swords each orc has to carry**: 
   To find out how many pounds of swords each orc has to carry, we divide the total weight of the swords by the total number of orcs:

   \[
   \text{Weight per orc} = \frac{\text{Total weight of swords}}{\text{Total number of orcs}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weight per orc} = \frac{1200 \text{ pounds}}{80}
   \]

   Now, we perform the division:

   \[
   \text{Weight per orc} = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: 
   Each orc has to carry 15 pounds of swords.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{15} \text{ pounds}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pounds of swords each orc has to carry.

Given information:
- The Dark Lord needs to transport 1200 pounds of swords.
- He has 10 squads of 8 orcs each.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of orcs.
Total number of orcs = 10 squads × 8 orcs per squad = 80 orcs

Step 2: Divide the total weight of swords by the total number of orcs to find the weight of swords each orc has to carry.
Weight of swords per...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pounds of swords each orc has to carry. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of orcs:**
   - We are given that there are 10 squads.
   - Each squad consists of 8 orcs.
   - Therefore, the total number of orcs is calculated by multiplying the number of squads by the number of orcs per squad:
     \[
     \text{Total number of orcs} = 10 \text{ squads} \times 8 \text{ orcs per squad...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many orcs there are in total. Since there are 10 squads of 8 orcs each, we multiply 10 by 8 to get the total number of orcs. 

10 squads * 8 orcs/squad = 80 orcs

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of swords each orc needs to carry. Since there are 1200 pounds of swords and 80 orcs, we divide 1200 by 80 to find out how many pounds each orc needs to carry.

1200 pounds / 80 orcs = 15 pounds/orc

So, each orc needs to carry 15 pounds of...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The Dark Lord needs to transport 1200 pounds of swords.
   * He has 10 squads of orcs.
   * Each squad consists of 8 orcs.

2. Calculate the total number of orcs:
   * Total orcs = Number of squads × Orcs per squad
   * Total orcs = 10 × 8
   * Total orcs = 80

3. Determine the weight of swords each orc needs to carry:
   * Weight per orc = Total weight of swords...
