=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pieces of gum Mitchell chews at once after he has set aside 2 pieces.

1. **Calculate the total number of pieces of gum:**
   Mitchell has 8 packets of gum, and each packet contains 7 pieces. We can find the total number of pieces of gum by multiplying the number of packets by the number of pieces in each packet.

   \[
   \text{Total pieces of gum} = \text{Number of packets} \times \text{Pieces per packet}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total pieces of gum} = 8 \times 7 = 56
   \]

2. **Determine how many pieces he chews:**
   According to the problem, Mitchell chews all the gum except for 2 pieces. Therefore, we need to subtract the 2 pieces he does not chew from the total number of pieces.

   \[
   \text{Pieces chewed} = \text{Total pieces of gum} - \text{Pieces not chewed}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Pieces chewed} = 56 - 2 = 54
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   Thus, the number of pieces of gum that Mitchell chews at once is:

   \[
   \boxed{54}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Mitchell has 8 packets of gum.
- There are 7 pieces of gum in each packet.
- He chews all the gum except for 2 pieces.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Mitchell has.
Total pieces of gum = Number of packets × Number of pieces per packet
Total pieces of gum = 8 × 7 = 56 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces of gum Mitchell chews.
Pieces of gum chewed = T...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pieces of gum Mitchell chews at once, given that he chews all the gum except for 2 pieces.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Pieces of Gum:**
   - Mitchell has 8 packets of gum.
   - Each packet contains 7 pieces of gum.
   - To find the total number of pieces of gum, we multiply the number of packets by the number of pieces per packet:

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many pieces of gum Mitchell has in total. Since he has 8 packets of gum and each packet contains 7 pieces, we multiply 8 by 7 to find the total number of pieces. 

8 packets * 7 pieces/packet = 56 pieces

Mitchell decides to save 2 pieces and not chew them. So, we subtract these 2 pieces from the total number of pieces.

56 pieces - 2 pieces = 54 pieces

Therefore, Mitchell chews 54 pieces of gum at once.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mitchell has 8 packets of gum.
   * Each packet contains 7 pieces of gum.
   * He will chew all the gum except for 2 pieces.

2. Calculate the total number of gum pieces Mitchell has:
   * Total pieces = Number of packets × Pieces per packet
   * Total pieces = 8 × 7
   * Total pieces = 56
   * So, Mitchell has a total of 56 pieces of gum.

3. Subtract the number...
