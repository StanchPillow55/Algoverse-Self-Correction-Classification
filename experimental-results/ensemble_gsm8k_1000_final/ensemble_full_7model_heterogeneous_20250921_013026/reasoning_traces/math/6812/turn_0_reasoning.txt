Final Answer: To find out how much profit Alice made from selling her friendship bracelets, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bracelets Alice sold.**
   - Alice made a total of 52 bracelets.
   - She gave away 8 bracelets.
   - Therefore, the number of bracelets she sold is:
     \[
     \text{Bracelets sold} = \text{Total bracelets} - \text{Bracelets given away} = 52 - 8 = 44
     \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the bracelets.**
   - Alice sells each bracelet for $0.25.
   - The total revenue from selling 44 bracelets is:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = \text{Bracelets sold} \times \text{Price per bracelet} = 44 \times 0.25
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     44 \times 0.25 = 11.00
     \]
   - So, Alice earned $11.00 from selling the bracelets.

3. **Calculate the total cost of making the bracelets.**
   - Alice spent $3.00 on materials to make the bracelets.
   - This is her total cost.

4. **Calculate the profit.**
   - Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 11.00 - 3.00
     \]
   - Performing the subtraction:
     \[
     11.00 - 3.00 = 8.00
     \]

Thus, Alice made a profit of **$8.00** from selling her friendship bracelets.

Final answer: **$8.00**

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many bracelets Alice sold at school. She made 52 bracelets and gave 8 away, so she sold 52 - 8 = 44 bracelets.

Next, we need to calculate how much money she made from selling these bracelets. She sold each bracelet for $0.25, so she made 44 * $0.25 = $11.00.

Finally, we need to subtract the cost of the materials she used to make the bracelets from the money she made selling them to find her profit. Her profit is $11.00 - $3.00 = $8.00.
