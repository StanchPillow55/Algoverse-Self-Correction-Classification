Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of boys and girls at the party**:
   - We are given that there are 40 boys at the party.
   - The problem states that there are four times as many boys as girls. Let \( g \) represent the number of girls.
   - According to the information provided, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     4g = 40
     \]
   - To find \( g \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
     \[
     g = \frac{40}{4} = 10
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 10 girls at the party.

2. **Determine how much each girl paid**:
   - The problem states that each boy paid twice the amount that each girl paid. Let \( p \) represent the amount each girl paid.
   - Since each boy paid $50, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     2p = 50
     \]
   - To find \( p \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     p = \frac{50}{2} = 25
     \]
   - Thus, each girl paid $25 to attend the party.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money collected from boys**:
   - Since there are 40 boys and each boy paid $50, the total amount collected from the boys is:
     \[
     \text{Total from boys} = \text{Number of boys} \times \text{Amount each boy paid} = 40 \times 50 = 2000
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of money collected from girls**:
   - There are 10 girls and each girl paid $25, so the total amount collected from the girls is:
     \[
     \text{Total from girls} = \text{Number of girls} \times \text{Amount each girl paid} = 10 \times 25 = 250
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of money collected at the party**:
   - To find the total amount of money collected at the party, we add the total collected from boys and girls:
     \[
     \text{Total amount collected} = \text{Total from boys} + \text{Total from girls} = 2000 + 250 = 2250
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money collected at the party is \(\boxed{2250}\).

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of money collected at Lulu's party by considering both the boys and the girls.

### Step 1: Determine the number of girls at the party

We are given that there are four times as many boys as girls at the party. Let \( G \) represent the number of girls at the party. According to the problem, the number of boys is four times the number of girls:

\[
B = 4G
\]

We are also given that there are 40 boys at the part...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Step 1: Determine the number of girls at the party.

The problem states that there are four times as many boys at Lulu's party as girls. If there are 40 boys at the party, then to find the number of girls, we divide the number of boys by 4.

Number of girls = 40 boys ÷ 4 = 10 girls

Step 2: Determine how much each girl paid to attend the party.

The problem states that each boy paid twice the money that each girl paid to attend the party. If each boy paid $50, then to fin...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 4 times as many boys as girls at the party.
   * Each boy paid twice the amount each girl paid.
   * There are 40 boys at the party.
   * Each boy paid $50 to attend the party.

2. Find the number of girls at the party:
   * Number of boys = 4 × Number of girls
   * 40 = 4 × Number of girls
   * Number of girls = 40 ÷ 4 = 10
   So, there are 10 girls at...
