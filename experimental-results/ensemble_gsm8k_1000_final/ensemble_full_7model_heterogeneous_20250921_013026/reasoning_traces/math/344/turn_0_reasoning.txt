=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let \( x \) be the number of marbles Archie started with.

1. **Calculate the number of marbles lost to the street:**
   Archie loses 60% of his marbles to the street. Therefore, the number of marbles lost to the street is:
   \[
   0.6x
   \]

   The number of marbles remaining after losing some to the street is:
   \[
   x - 0.6x = 0.4x
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of marbles lost down the sewer:**
   Of the remaining marbles, Archie loses half down a sewer. The number of marbles lost down the sewer is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 0.4x = 0.2x
   \]

   The number of marbles remaining after losing some down the sewer is:
   \[
   0.4x - 0.2x = 0.2x
   \]

3. **Set up the equation based on the number of marbles left:**
   We know that after losing marbles to the street and the sewer, Archie has 20 marbles left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   0.2x = 20
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5:
   \[
   x = 20 \times 5 = 100
   \]

Thus, the number of marbles Archie started with is \( \boxed{100} \). 

### Verification:
- Starting with 100 marbles:
  - Loses 60% to the street: \( 0.6 \times 100 = 60 \) marbles lost.
  - Remaining: \( 100 - 60 = 40 \) marbles.
  - Loses half of the remaining to the sewer: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) marbles lost.
  - Remaining: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) marbles.

The calculations confirm that Archie indeed started with \( \boxed{100} \) marbles.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the final number of marbles Archie has left to find the initial number of marbles he started with.

Given information:
- Archie loses 60% of his marbles into the street.
- Of the remaining marbles, he loses half down a sewer.
- Archie has 20 marbles left.

Step 1: Find the number of marbles Archie had after losing 60% into the street.
Let's call the initial number of marbles "x".
Archie loses 60% of...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Archie ends up with 20 marbles after losing some to the street and some down a sewer.
   - He loses 60% of his marbles to the street.
   - Of the remaining marbles, he loses half down a sewer.

2. **Setting Up the Problem:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of marbles Archie started with.

3. **Calculating the Marbles ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: Archie loses half of his remaining marbles down a sewer and is left with 20. This means that before he lost them down the sewer, he had 20 * 2 = 40 marbles.

Step 2: The 40 marbles Archie had before losing them down the sewer represent the 40% he didn't lose into the street. If 40 marbles represent 40%, then to find out how many marbles Archie started with (which would be 100%), we divide 40 by 40 and multiply by 100. 

So, ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll start with the number of marbles Archie has at the end and work backwards to determine how many he started with.

Given:
- Archie loses 60% of his marbles into the street.
- Of the remaining marbles, he loses half down a sewer.
- He has 20 marbles left.

Step 1: Let's find out how many marbles Archie had before losing half of them down the sewer.
- He has 20 marbles left, which is half of the marble...
