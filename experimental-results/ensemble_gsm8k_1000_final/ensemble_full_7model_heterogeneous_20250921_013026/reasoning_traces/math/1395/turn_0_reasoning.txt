=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much Steve paid in total for the DVD, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of the DVD for Steve**: 
   - Mike paid $5 for his DVD.
   - Steve's DVD costs twice as much as Mike's. 
   \[
   \text{Cost of Steve's DVD} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Shipping costs**:
   - The shipping costs are 80% of the price of the DVD that Steve ordered.
   - First, we need to calculate 80% of the cost of Steve's DVD.
   \[
   \text{Shipping cost} = 0.80 \times \text{Cost of Steve's DVD} = 0.80 \times 10 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total cost for Steve**:
   - To find the total amount Steve paid, we need to add the cost of the DVD and the shipping costs together.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Steve} = \text{Cost of Steve's DVD} + \text{Shipping cost} = 10 + 8 = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Steve paid to get the DVD is **$18**. 

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{18}

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost that Steve paid to get the DVD.

Given information:
- Mike bought the DVD for $5 at the store.
- Steve had to order the DVD online, which cost him twice as much as Mike paid.
- Steve also had to pay shipping costs, which were 80% of the price of the DVD he ordered.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the DVD that Steve ordered online.
Cost of the DVD for Steve = 2 Ã— $5 = $10

Step 2: Calculate the shipp...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost Steve paid for the DVD, including both the price of the DVD and the shipping costs.

1. **Determine the price Steve paid for the DVD:**
   - Mike bought the DVD for $5.
   - Steve paid twice as much for the DVD online.
   - Therefore, the price Steve paid for the DVD is:
     \[
     2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the shipping costs:**
   - The shipping costs are 80% of the price of the D...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much Steve paid for the DVD online. Since the DVD cost twice as much online as it did in the store, we multiply the store price by 2. 

$5 * 2 = $10

So, Steve paid $10 for the DVD online. 

Next, we need to calculate the shipping costs. The problem states that the shipping costs were 80% of the price of the film he ordered. To find 80% of a number, we multiply that number by 0.8. 

$10 * 0.8 = $8

So, the shipping costs were $8. 

Finally, ...
