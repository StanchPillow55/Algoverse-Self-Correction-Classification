=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step and define the variables clearly.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

2. **Defining Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of years after Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill saw it for the first time.
   - Bill's dad is now \( 30 + x \) years old when Bill sees the comet for the first time.
   - Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time will be denoted as \( b \).

3. **Finding the Age of Bill's Dad**:
   - When Bill's dad saw the comet, he was 30 years old.
   - After \( x \) years, he will be \( 30 + x \).

4. **Finding the Age of Bill**:
   - We need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. 
   - We know that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age of his father when he first saw the comet.
   - Bill's dad was 30 years old when he first saw the comet, so three times that age is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) years.

5. **Calculating the Time Until Bill Sees the Comet Again**:
   - The comet appears every 75 years. Therefore, if Bill's dad saw it when he was 30, the next time it appears will be \( 30 + 75 = 105 \) years old for his dad.
   - The time from the first sighting to the second sighting is 75 years.

6. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - When Bill sees the comet for the second time, he is \( b + 75 \) years old.
   - We know that at that time, Bill's dad will be \( 30 + 75 = 105 \) years old.
   - We also know that \( b + 75 = 3 \times (30 + x) \).

7. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - Since Bill's dad will be 105 years old when Bill sees the comet for the second time, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   b + 75 = 3 \times 105
   \]
   \[
   b + 75 = 315
   \]
   \[
   b = 315 - 75
   \]
   \[
   b = 240
   \]

8. **Finding Bill's Age**:
   - Now we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.
   - Since \( b = 240 \) represents the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time, we need to find \( b \) when he saw it for the first time.
   - We know that he saw it for the first time \( 75 \) years before the second sighting, so:
   \[
   \text{Age when he saw it first} = 240 - 75 = 165
   \]

9. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Bill was **165 years old** when he saw the comet for the first time.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{165}
\]

   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the first time.

Given information:
- Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
- Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
- Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.

Step 1: Find the age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet for the first time.
Bill's dad's age when he saw the Comet = 30 years

...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to understand the timeline of events and the relationship between the ages of Bill and his father when they saw Comet Halley.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

2. **Setting Up the Equations:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241210): ANTHROPIC_API_ERROR: Error code: 404 - {'type': 'error', 'error': {'type': 'not_found_error', 'message': 'model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241210'}, 'request_id': 'req_011CTMe5nvy3ZnNFqDTmEXo2'}

Model 5 (replicate:meta/meta-llama-3-70b): REPLICATE_API_ERROR: ReplicateError Details:
title: Unauthenticated
status: 401
detail: You did not pass an authentication token

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. This means that Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

The comet orbits the sun every 75 years, so Bill saw the comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it for the second time. This means that Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   * Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
   * Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.

2. Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time:
   * Bill's age at second sighting = 3 Ã— (Bill's dad's age at first sighting)
   * Bill's...
