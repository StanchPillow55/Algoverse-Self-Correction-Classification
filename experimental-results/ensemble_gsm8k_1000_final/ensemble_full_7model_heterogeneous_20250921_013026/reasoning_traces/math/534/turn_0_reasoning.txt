=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine Jessica's current age based on the information given about her age relative to Claire's age.

1. **Identify Claire's age in two years**:
   We know that in two years, Claire will be 20 years old. This means we can find Claire's current age by subtracting 2 years from 20:
   \[
   \text{Claire's current age} = 20 - 2 = 18 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **Determine Jessica's age**:
   The problem states that Jessica is six years older than Claire. Since we have found that Claire is currently 18 years old, we can find Jessica's current age by adding 6 years to Claire's age:
   \[
   \text{Jessica's current age} = \text{Claire's current age} + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, Jessica is currently 24 years old.

In conclusion, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Jessica's current age is } 24 \text{ years old.}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jessica is six years older than Claire.
- In two years, Claire will be 20 years old.

Step 1: Find Claire's current age.
Claire's age in two years = 20 years
Claire's current age = 20 years - 2 years = 18 years

Step 2: Find the age difference between Jessica and Claire.
Jessica is six years older than Claire.
Age difference between Jessica and Claire = 6 years

Step 3: Find Jessica's current ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine Jessica's current age given the information about Claire's age.

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - Claire will be 20 years old in two years.
   - Jessica is six years older than Claire.

2. **Determine Claire's current age:**
   - If Claire will be 20 years old in two years, we can find her current age by subtracting 2 from 20.
   \[
   \text{Claire's current age} = 20 - 2 = 18
   \]

3. **Determine Jessica's current...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Step 1: Determine Claire's current age

The problem states that Claire will be 20 years old in two years. Therefore, to find Claire's current age, we subtract 2 from 20.

20 - 2 = 18

So, Claire is currently 18 years old.

Step 2: Determine Jessica's current age

The problem also states that Jessica is six years older than Claire. Therefore, to find Jessica's current age, we add 6 to Claire's current age.

18 + 6 = 24

So, Jessica is currently 24 years old.

Final Answer:...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jessica is 6 years older than Claire.
   * In 2 years, Claire will be 20 years old.
   * We need to find Jessica's current age.

2. Find Claire's current age:
   * Claire will be 20 years old in 2 years.
   * To find her current age, we subtract 2 from 20.
   * Claire's current age = 20 - 2 = 18 years old

3. Calculate Jessica's current age:
   * Jessica is 6 yea...
