Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationship between the distances that Selena and Josh ran.

Let's denote the distance that Selena ran as \( S \) miles. According to the problem, Josh ran half of the distance that Selena ran. Therefore, we can express the distance that Josh ran as:

\[
J = \frac{1}{2} S
\]

where \( J \) is the distance Josh ran.

We know from the problem statement that together they ran a total of 36 miles. This can be expressed with the following equation:

\[
S + J = 36
\]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( J \) into this equation:

\[
S + \frac{1}{2} S = 36
\]

Next, we combine the terms on the left side of the equation. Since \( S \) can be thought of as \( \frac{2}{2} S \), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
\frac{2}{2} S + \frac{1}{2} S = 36
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{3}{2} S = 36
\]

To isolate \( S \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{2}{3} \):

\[
S = 36 \times \frac{2}{3}
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
S = 36 \times \frac{2}{3} = 24
\]

Thus, Selena ran \( 24 \) miles.

To find out how far Josh ran, we can substitute \( S \) back into the equation for \( J \):

\[
J = \frac{1}{2} S = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12
\]

Now, we can verify that the total distance they ran adds up to 36 miles:

\[
S + J = 24 + 12 = 36
\]

This confirms our calculations are correct.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Selena ran } 24 \text{ miles.}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Selena ran in the race.

Given information:
- Selena and Josh ran a total of 36 miles together.
- Josh ran half of the distance that Selena ran.

Let's represent the distance Selena ran as x miles.

Step 1: Express the distance Josh ran in terms of Selena's distance.
Since Josh ran half of the distance that Selena ran, we can represent Josh's distance as x/2 miles.

Step 2: Set up an equation to repr...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many miles Selena ran given that together, Selena and Josh ran a total of 36 miles, and Josh ran half of the distance that Selena ran.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) be the number of miles Selena ran.
- Since Josh ran half of the distance that Selena ran, we can express the distance Josh ran as \( \frac{S}{2} \).

According to the problem, the total distance they ran together is 36 miles. Therefore, we can set u...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the distance that Selena ran as S and the distance that Josh ran as J. We know from the problem that S + J = 36 miles. We also know that Josh ran half the distance that Selena ran, so we can express J as 0.5S.

We can substitute J in the first equation with 0.5S to get S + 0.5S = 36. This simplifies to 1.5S = 36.

To find the value of S, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.5. This gives us S = 36 / 1.5 = 24 miles.

So, Selena ran 24 miles.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to set up an equation and solve for the distance Selena ran.

Given:
- Selena and Josh ran a total of 36 miles.
- Josh ran half the distance that Selena ran.

Step 1: Let's express Josh's distance in terms of Selena's.
If we let x be the distance Selena ran, then Josh ran 1/2 of x, or 0.5x.

Step 2: Set up an equation using the total distance.
Selena's distance + Josh's dis...
