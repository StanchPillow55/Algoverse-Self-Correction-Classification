=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money John saves a year by moving to a new apartment with a roommate, we need to calculate his previous rent and compare it to his new rent.

### Step 1: Calculate John's former rent

John's former apartment was 750 square feet, and the rent was $2 per square foot. We can calculate the total rent for the former apartment as follows:

\[
\text{Former Rent} = \text{Area} \times \text{Cost per square foot}
\]
\[
\text{Former Rent} = 750 \, \text{sq ft} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/sq ft} = 1500 \, \text{dollars}
\]

So, John was paying **$1500 per month** for his former apartment.

### Step 2: Calculate John's new rent

John's new apartment costs $2800 per month, which he splits evenly with his roommate. Therefore, John's share of the rent is:

\[
\text{New Rent (John's share)} = \frac{\text{Total New Rent}}{2}
\]
\[
\text{New Rent (John's share)} = \frac{2800 \, \text{dollars}}{2} = 1400 \, \text{dollars}
\]

So, John is now paying **$1400 per month** for his new apartment.

### Step 3: Calculate the monthly savings

To find out how much John saves each month by moving to the new apartment, we subtract his new rent from his former rent:

\[
\text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Former Rent} - \text{New Rent (John's share)}
\]
\[
\text{Monthly Savings} = 1500 \, \text{dollars} - 1400 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the annual savings

To find out how much John saves in a year, we multiply his monthly savings by 12 (the number of months in a year):

\[
\text{Annual Savings} = \text{Monthly Savings} \times 12
\]
\[
\text{Annual Savings} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \times 12 = 1200 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

John saves **$1200 per year** by moving to the new apartment with a roommate.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of John's former apartment and the cost of his new apartment, and then find the difference to determine how much money he saves per year.

Given information:
- John's former rent was $2 per square foot for a 750 square foot apartment.
- John's new apartment costs $2800 per month, which he splits evenly with his roommate.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of John's former apartment.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how much money John saves per year by moving into the new apartment with a roommate, we need to compare his annual rent costs in both the old and new apartments.

### Step 1: Calculate the annual rent for the old apartment

1. **Old Rent Cost per Month:**
   - The old apartment costs $2 per square foot.
   - The size of the old apartment is 750 square feet.
   - Monthly rent for the old apartment = $2/sq ft × 750 sq ft = $1500.

2. **Annual Rent for the Old ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much John was paying for his old apartment per month. 

The cost per square foot was $2 and the apartment was 750 square feet. So, the total monthly rent for the old apartment is 2 * 750 = $1500.

Now, let's calculate how much John is paying for his new apartment per month. 

The total cost of the new apartment is $2800 per month, but he splits this cost evenly with his roommate. So, John's share of the rent is 2800 / 2 = $1400 per month.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * John's former rent was $2 per square foot.
   * His former apartment was 750 square feet.
   * The new apartment costs $2800 per month.
   * John splits the new rent evenly with a roommate.

2. Calculate John's former monthly rent:
   * Former rent per month = Rent per square foot × Square footage
   * Former rent per month = $2 × 750
   * Former rent per month = $1500...
