=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine the total cost of the wedding if John's wife gets her way, we need to calculate the costs associated with the venue and the guests based on the number of guests she wants.

1. **Venue Cost**: 
   The venue cost is given as $10,000.

2. **Number of Guests**: 
   John wants 50 guests. However, his wife wants 60% more than that. We need to calculate how many guests that is.

   - First, calculate 60% of 50:
     \[
     60\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.60 \times 50 = 30
     \]

   - Now, add this to the original number of guests:
     \[
     \text{Total guests} = 50 + 30 = 80
     \]

3. **Cost per Guest**: 
   The cost per guest is $500. Now we need to calculate the total cost for the guests.

   - Total cost for guests:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for guests} = \text{Number of guests} \times \text{Cost per guest} = 80 \times 500
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost for guests} = 40,000
     \]

4. **Total Wedding Cost**: 
   Now, we add the venue cost to the total cost for the guests to find the total wedding cost.

   - Total wedding cost:
     \[
     \text{Total wedding cost} = \text{Venue cost} + \text{Total cost for guests} = 10,000 + 40,000
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total wedding cost} = 50,000
     \]

Thus, if John's wife gets her way, the total cost of the wedding would be **$50,000**. 

Final answer: **$50,000**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The venue cost is $10,000.
- The cost per guest is $500.
- John wants 50 guests.
- John's wife wants 60% more guests than John.

Step 1: Calculate the number of guests John's wife wants.
John wants 50 guests.
John's wife wants 60% more than 50 guests.
60% of 50 = 0.6 × 50 = 30 additional guests.
Total guests John's wife wants = 50 + 30 = 80 guests.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the wedding if John's wife gets her way with the number of guests. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of guests John's wife wants:**
   - John wants 50 guests.
   - John's wife wants 60% more guests than John.
   - To find 60% of 50, we calculate:
     \[
     0.60 \times 50 = 30
     \]
   - Therefore, John's wife wants 50 + 30 = 80 guests.

2. **Calculate the cost for the g...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's figure out how many guests John's wife wants. She wants 60% more than the 50 guests John wants. To find out how many that is, we multiply 50 by 60% (or 0.60 in decimal form):

50 guests * 0.60 = 30 guests

So, John's wife wants 30 more guests than John, which means she wants a total of:

50 guests + 30 guests = 80 guests

Next, we need to calculate how much it will cost for 80 guests. We know that each guest costs $500, so we multiply the number of guests by ...
