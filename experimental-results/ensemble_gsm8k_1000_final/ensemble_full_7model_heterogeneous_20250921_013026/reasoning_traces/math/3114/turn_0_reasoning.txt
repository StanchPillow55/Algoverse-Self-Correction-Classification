=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many boxes Jill has left to sell to reach her goal of selling at least 150 boxes of cookies, we will calculate the total number of boxes sold to her customers step by step.

1. **First Customer**:
   - The first customer buys 5 boxes.
   - Total boxes sold so far: \( 5 \)

2. **Second Customer**:
   - The second customer buys 4 times more than the first customer.
   - Calculation: \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \)
   - Total boxes sold so far: \( 5 + 20 = 25 \)

3. **Third Customer**:
   - The third customer buys half as much as the second customer.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \)
   - Total boxes sold so far: \( 25 + 10 = 35 \)

4. **Fourth Customer**:
   - The fourth customer buys 3 times as much as the third customer.
   - Calculation: \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \)
   - Total boxes sold so far: \( 35 + 30 = 65 \)

5. **Fifth Customer**:
   - The fifth customer buys 10 boxes.
   - Total boxes sold so far: \( 65 + 10 = 75 \)

Now, we have calculated the total number of boxes sold to all customers:
- Total boxes sold: \( 75 \)

Next, we need to find out how many boxes Jill has left to sell to reach her goal of at least 150 boxes.

6. **Calculating Remaining Boxes**:
   - Goal: 150 boxes
   - Boxes sold: 75 boxes
   - Remaining boxes to sell: \( 150 - 75 = 75 \)

Thus, Jill needs to sell **75 more boxes** to reach her goal of selling at least 150 boxes.

**Final Answer**: Jill has 75 boxes left to sell to hit her sales goal.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many boxes of cookies Jill has sold so far and then calculate how many more boxes she needs to sell to reach her goal of 150 boxes.

Let's break down the sales to each customer:

1. **First Customer:**
   - Buys 5 boxes.

2. **Second Customer:**
   - Buys 4 times more than the first customer.
   - Calculation: \(4 \times 5 = 20\) boxes.

3. **Third Customer:**

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Jill's first customer buys 5 boxes.

Her second customer buys 4 times more than her first customer. This means the second customer buys 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 boxes.

Her third customer buys half as much as her second. This means the third customer buys 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 boxes.

The fourth customer buys 3 times as much as her third. This means the fourth customer buys 3 * 10 = <<3*10=30>>30 boxes.

Her final customer buys 10 boxes.

So in total, Jill has sold 5 + 20 + ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll calculate the number of boxes each customer bought and then find out how many boxes Jill has sold in total. Finally, we'll determine how many boxes she has left to sell to reach her goal.

Given:
- Jill's sales goal is at least 150 boxes.
- 1st customer buys 5 boxes.
- 2nd customer buys 4 times more than the 1st customer.
