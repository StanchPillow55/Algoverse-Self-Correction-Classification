=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many marbles Carl and Cal have based on the information given about Sean's marbles.

1. **Identify the number of marbles Sean has**:
   - We are told that Sean has 56 marbles.

2. **Determine how many marbles Cal has**:
   - The problem states that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. This means that if we let \( C \) represent the number of marbles Cal has, we can express this relationship mathematically as:
     \[
     \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times C
     \]
   - Since Sean has 56 marbles, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     56 = \frac{1}{2} \times C
     \]
   - To find \( C \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     C = 56 \times 2 = 112
     \]
   - Therefore, Cal has 112 marbles.

3. **Determine how many marbles Carl has**:
   - The problem states that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. We can express this relationship as:
     \[
     \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles}
     \]
   - Substituting the number of marbles Sean has:
     \[
     \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times 56
     \]
   - Now we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Carl's marbles} = 224
     \]
   - Therefore, Carl has 224 marbles.

4. **Calculate the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined**:
   - Now we need to find the combined total of Carl's and Cal's marbles:
     \[
     \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we found:
     \[
     \text{Total marbles} = 224 + 112
     \]
   - Now we perform the addition:
     \[
     \text{Total marbles} = 336
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - The combined total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have is \( \boxed{336} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.
- Sean has half as many marbles as Cal.
- Sean has 56 marbles.

Step 1: Find how many marbles Cal has.
Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can use the following equation:
Sean's marbles = 1/2 × Cal's marbles
56 = 1/2 × Cal's marbles
Cal's marbles = 56 × 2 = 112 marbles

Step 2: Find how many marbles Carl has.
Since Carl has four time...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can find out how many marbles Cal has by multiplying Sean's number of marbles by 2. 

So, Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles.

Next, let's figure out how many marbles Carl has. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can find out how many marbles Carl has by multiplying Sean's number of marbles by 4.

So, Carl has 5...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the information given to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have, and then add them together to get the total.

Given:
- Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.
- Sean has half as many marbles as Cal.
- Sean has 56 marbles.

Step 1: Express Carl's marbles in terms of Sean's.
Carl's marbles = 4 × Sean's marbles
