=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of people who attended the school meeting, we need to consider both the students and the teachers, as well as the students who are standing.

1. **Identify the number of students and teachers:**
   - Number of students seated: 300
   - Number of teachers: 30
   - Number of students standing: 25

2. **Calculate the total number of students:**
   - Total students = Students seated + Students standing
   - Total students = 300 + 25 = 325

3. **Calculate the total number of attendees:**
   - Total attendees = Total students + Total teachers
   - Total attendees = 325 + 30 = 355

4. **Final answer:**
   - The total number of people who attended the school meeting is **355**.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem involves simple addition. 

First, we have 300 students who are seated. 

Second, we have 30 teachers who are also seated.
