=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will calculate the number of bonnets Mrs. Young made each day from Monday to Friday, then find the total number of bonnets she made, and finally divide that total by the number of orphanages to find out how many bonnets were sent to each orphanage.

1. **Calculate the number of bonnets made each day:**

   - **Monday:** 
     Mrs. Young made 10 bonnets.
     \[
     \text{Bonnets on Monday} = 10
     \]

   - **Tuesday and Wednesday combined:** 
     She made twice more than on Monday. Since she made 10 bonnets on Monday, she made:
     \[
     \text{Bonnets on Tuesday and Wednesday} = 2 \times 10 = 20
     \]
     Since this is the combined total for Tuesday and Wednesday, we will denote the number of bonnets made on Tuesday as \( x \) and on Wednesday as \( y \). We know:
     \[
     x + y = 20
     \]

   - **Thursday:** 
     She made 5 more than on Monday. Therefore:
     \[
     \text{Bonnets on Thursday} = 10 + 5 = 15
     \]

   - **Friday:** 
     She made 5 less than on Thursday. Thus:
     \[
     \text{Bonnets on Friday} = 15 - 5 = 10
     \]

2. **Summarize the bonnets made each day:**
   - Monday: 10
   - Tuesday: \( x \)
   - Wednesday: \( y \)
   - Thursday: 15
   - Friday: 10

3. **Using the equation for Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   We know \( x + y = 20 \). We can choose any values for \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy this equation. For simplicity, let's assume:
   - \( x = 10 \) (Tuesday)
   - \( y = 10 \) (Wednesday)

   This satisfies \( x + y = 20 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of bonnets made:**
   Now we can calculate the total number of bonnets made from Monday to Friday:
   \[
   \text{Total bonnets} = \text{Bonnets on Monday} + \text{Bonnets on Tuesday} + \text{Bonnets on Wednesday} + \text{Bonnets on Thursday} + \text{Bonnets on Friday}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total bonnets} = 10 + 10 + 10 + 15 + 10 = 55
   \]

5. **Divide the total number of bonnets by the number of orphanages:**
   Mrs. Young sends the bonnets to 5 orphanages. Therefore, the number of bonnets sent to each orphanage is:
   \[
   \text{Bonnets per orphanage} = \frac{\text{Total bonnets}}{\text{Number of orphanages}} = \frac{55}{5} = 11
   \]

6. **Final answer:**
   Mrs. Young sent **11 bonnets** to each orphanage.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bonnets Mrs. Young made over the week and then divide that total by the number of orphanages to find out how many bonnets each orphanage received.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bonnets made on Monday:**
   - Mrs. Young made 10 bonnets.

2. **Bonnets made on Tuesday and Wednesday combined:**
   - She made twice as many bonnets as she did on Monday. 
   - Since she made 10 bonnets on Monday...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Monday, Mrs. Young made 10 bonnets.

On Tuesday and Wednesday combined, she made twice more than on Monday. This means she made 2 * 10 = 20 bonnets.

On Thursday, she made 5 more than on Monday. This means she made 10 + 5 = 15 bonnets.

On Friday, she made 5 less than on Thursday. This means she made 15 - 5 = 10 bonnets.

So, in total, Mrs. Young made 10 (Monday) + 20 (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 15 (Thursday) + 10 (Friday) = 55...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll first calculate the total number of bonnets Mrs. Young made throughout the week and then divide that number by the number of orphanages to determine how many bonnets each orphanage received.

Given:
- On Monday, Mrs. Young made 10 bonnets.
- On Tuesday and Wednesday combined, she made twice as many as on Monday.
- On Thursday, she made 5 more than on Monday.
- On Friday, she made 5 less than on Thursda...
