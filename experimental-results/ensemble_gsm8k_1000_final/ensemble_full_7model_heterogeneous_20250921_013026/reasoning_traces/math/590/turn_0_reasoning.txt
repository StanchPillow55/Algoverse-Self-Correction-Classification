=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the percentage of each type of chocolate bar in the box, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars and then calculate the percentage for each type.

1. **Calculate the total number of chocolate bars:**
   - There are 25 milk chocolate bars.
   - There are 25 dark chocolate bars.
   - There are 25 milk chocolate with almond bars.
   - There are 25 white chocolate bars.

   We can find the total number of bars by adding these amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total bars} = 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 100
   \]

2. **Calculate the percentage of each type of chocolate bar:**
   The percentage of each type of chocolate bar can be calculated using the formula:

   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of bars of a type}}{\text{Total number of bars}} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Now we will calculate the percentage for each type:

   - **Milk Chocolate Bars:**
     \[
     \text{Percentage of Milk Chocolate} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
     \]

   - **Dark Chocolate Bars:**
     \[
     \text{Percentage of Dark Chocolate} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
     \]

   - **Milk Chocolate with Almond Bars:**
     \[
     \text{Percentage of Milk Chocolate with Almond} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
     \]

   - **White Chocolate Bars:**
     \[
     \text{Percentage of White Chocolate} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
     \]

3. **Summarize the results:**
   Each type of chocolate bar constitutes 25% of the total box of chocolate bars.

Therefore, the final answer is:
- Milk Chocolate: 25%
- Dark Chocolate: 25%
- Milk Chocolate with Almond: 25%
- White Chocolate: 25%

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage of each type of chocolate bar in the box.

Given information:
- The box contains 25 milk chocolate bars, 25 dark chocolate bars, 25 milk chocolate with almond bars, and 25 white chocolate bars.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of chocolate bars in the box.
Total number of chocolate bars = 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 100 chocolate bars

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of each type of chocolate bar.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine the percentage of each type of chocolate bar in the box, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Chocolate Bars:**

   The box contains:
   - 25 milk chocolate bars
   - 25 dark chocolate bars
   - 25 milk chocolate with almond bars
   - 25 white chocolate bars

   To find the total number of chocolate bars, we add up all the bars:

   \[
   \text{Total number of chocolate bars} = 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 100
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The total number of chocolate bars is the sum of all the different types of bars. So, we have:

25 (milk chocolate) + 25 (dark chocolate) + 25 (milk chocolate with almonds) + 25 (white chocolate) = 100 chocolate bars in total.

To find the percentage of each type of chocolate bar, we divide the number of each type of bar by the total number of bars and then multiply by 100.

For milk chocolate bars, we have:

(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

For dark chocolate bars, we have:

(25 ...
