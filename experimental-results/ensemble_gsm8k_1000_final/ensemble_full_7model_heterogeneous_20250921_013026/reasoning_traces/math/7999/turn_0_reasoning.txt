=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device, and then find the difference between the two amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption

1. **Current daily consumption**: Ada's current daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
2. **Weekly consumption**: Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply her daily consumption by 7:
   \[
   \text{Current weekly consumption} = 12 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 84 \text{ kWh/week}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of Ada's current weekly electric bill

1. **Cost per kilowatt hour**: The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt hour.
2. **Weekly cost**: We multiply the weekly consumption by the cost per kilowatt hour:
   \[
   \text{Current weekly bill} = 84 \text{ kWh/week} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/kWh} = 126 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate Ada's new weekly electric consumption after adding the device

1. **New daily consumption**: After adding the device, the new daily consumption will be:
   \[
   \text{New daily consumption} = 12 \text{ kWh} + 2 \text{ kWh} = 14 \text{ kWh/day}
   \]
2. **New weekly consumption**: We again multiply the new daily consumption by 7:
   \[
   \text{New weekly consumption} = 14 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 98 \text{ kWh/week}
   \]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of Ada's new weekly electric bill

1. **New weekly cost**: We multiply the new weekly consumption by the cost per kilowatt hour:
   \[
   \text{New weekly bill} = 98 \text{ kWh/week} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/kWh} = 147 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

### Step 5: Calculate the difference between the new and old weekly bills

1. **Difference in bills**: We subtract the current weekly bill from the new weekly bill:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{New weekly bill} - \text{Current weekly bill} = 147 \text{ dollars/week} - 126 \text{ dollars/week} = 21 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

### Final Answer

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is **$21.00**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
- Ada is planning to add a device that will consume 2 kilowatts per hour a day.
- The cost of 1 kilowatt per hour is $1.50.

Step 1: Calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device.
Daily electric consumption = 12 kilowatts per hour

Step 2: Calculate Ada's daily electric consumption after adding th...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, and then find the difference between the two bills.

**Step 1: Calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption.**

Ada's current daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour (kWh). To find her weekly consumption, we multiply her daily consumption by the number of days in a week:

\[
12 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 84 \, \text{kWh/w...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate Ada's daily and weekly electric consumption before she adds the new device. 

Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her total daily consumption is 12 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours/day = 288 kilowatts/day. 

To find her weekly consumption, we multiply her daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). So, her weekly consumption is 288 kilowatts/day * 7 days/week = 2016 kilowatts/week.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Ada currently consumes 12 kilowatts per hour daily.
   * She plans to add a device that consumes 2 kilowatts per hour daily.
   * The cost of a kilowatt per hour is $1.50.
   * We need to find the difference in her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device.

2. Calculate Ada's current daily electric consumption cost:
   * Daily consumption = 1...
