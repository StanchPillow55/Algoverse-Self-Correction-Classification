=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many hours James spends writing each week based on the information provided.

1. **Understanding the Writing Rate**:
   - James writes at a rate of 10 pages per hour.

2. **Daily Writing Output**:
   - James writes 5 pages a day to 2 different people.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages he writes in a day is:
     \[
     \text{Total pages per day} = 5 \text{ pages/person} \times 2 \text{ people} = 10 \text{ pages}
     \]

3. **Calculating Daily Writing Time**:
   - Since James writes 10 pages a day and he writes at a rate of 10 pages per hour, we can calculate the time he spends writing each day:
     \[
     \text{Time spent writing per day} = \frac{\text{Total pages per day}}{\text{Pages per hour}} = \frac{10 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/hour}} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

4. **Calculating Weekly Writing Time**:
   - To find out how many hours he spends writing in a week, we need to know how many days he writes in a week. The problem does not specify this, so we will assume he writes every day of the week (7 days).
   - Therefore, the total time spent writing in a week is:
     \[
     \text{Total hours per week} = \text{Time spent writing per day} \times \text{Number of days in a week} = 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - James spends a total of **7 hours** a week writing.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pages James writes per week and then calculate the time it takes him to write those pages.

Given information:
- James writes 10 pages per hour.
- James writes 5 pages a day to 2 different people.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages James writes per day.
Pages written per day = 5 pages × 2 people = 10 pages

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pages James writes per week.
Pages writ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours James spends writing in a week, given the information provided.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Pages James Writes in a Day:**

   James writes 5 pages a day to 2 different people. This means he writes:
   \[
   5 \text{ pages/person} \times 2 \text{ people} = 10 \text{ pages/day}
   \]

2. **Determine the Total Number of Pages James Writes in a Week:**

   Since James writes 10 pa...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many pages James writes in a week. If he writes 5 pages a day to 2 different people, that means he writes 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 pages a day.

There are 7 days in a week, so in a week, James writes 10 * 7 = <<10*7=70>>70 pages.

We know that James writes 10 pages an hour. So to find out how many hours he spends writing in a week, we divide the total number of pages he writes in a week by the number of pages he writes in an hour.

So, 70 / 10 ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * James writes 10 pages per hour.
   * He writes 5 pages a day to 2 different people.
   * We need to find out how many hours a week he spends writing.

2. Calculate the total number of pages James writes per day:
   * Pages per person per day = 5
   * Number of people he writes to = 2
   * Total pages per day = Pages per person per day × Number of people
   * Total page...
