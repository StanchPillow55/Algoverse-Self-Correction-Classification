=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many stamps Bert has in total after he makes his purchase.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Bert had some stamps before he bought more.
   - The problem states that before the purchase, he had only half the number of stamps he bought.
   - Bert bought 300 stamps.

2. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of stamps Bert had before the purchase.
   - According to the problem, Bert had half the number of stamps he bought. Since he bought 300 stamps, we can express this relationship as:
     \[
     x = \frac{1}{2} \times 300
     \]

3. **Calculating the Number of Stamps Bert Had Before the Purchase**:
   - Now, we calculate \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{1}{2} \times 300 = 150
     \]
   - So, Bert had 150 stamps before he made the purchase.

4. **Calculating the Total Number of Stamps After the Purchase**:
   - After buying 300 stamps, the total number of stamps Bert has is the sum of the stamps he had before and the stamps he bought:
     \[
     \text{Total stamps} = x + 300
     \]
   - Substituting the value of \( x \):
     \[
     \text{Total stamps} = 150 + 300 = 450
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, after the purchase, Bert has a total of \( \boxed{450} \) stamps.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by understanding the problem. Bert had half the number of stamps he bought. This means that before the purchase, Bert had 300/2 = 150 stamps.

After purchasing the 300 stamps, Bert's total number of stamps is the number of stamps he had before the purchase plus the number of stamps he bought. 

So, Bert's total number of stamps is 150 (stamps he had before) + 300 (stamps he bought) = 450 stamps.

Therefore, Bert has 450 stamps in total after the purchase.
