=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of dragons slain by each prince based on the information provided.

1. **Prince Thaddeus**:
   - He slew 100 dragons.
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Thaddeus} = 100
   \]

2. **Prince Arthur**:
   - He slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.
   - To find the number of dragons slain by Arthur, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Dragons slain by Thaddeus} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

3. **Prince Walter**:
   - He slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.
   - To find the number of dragons slain by Walter, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Walter} = 2 \times \text{Dragons slain by Arthur} = 2 \times 75 = 150
   \]

4. **Prince Bruce**:
   - He slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.
   - To find the number of dragons slain by Bruce, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times \text{Dragons slain by Walter} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
   \]

Now, we have calculated the number of dragons slain by each prince:
- Prince Thaddeus: 100 dragons
- Prince Arthur: 75 dragons
- Prince Walter: 150 dragons
- Prince Bruce: 30 dragons

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Prince Bruce has slain } \boxed{30} \text{ dragons.}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons with his sword.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many dragons each prince slew, step by step, and then find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew.

1. **Determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew:**
   - Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
   - Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.
   - To find out how many dragons Prince Arthur slew, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
     \]
  ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since he slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, we multiply 100 (the number of dragons Prince Thaddeus slew) by 3/4:

100 * 3/4 = 75 dragons

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Since he slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, we multiply 75 (the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew) by 2:

75 * 2 = 150 dragons

Finally, we find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start with the information given and work our way through to find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew.

Given:
- Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
- Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.
- Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.
- Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.
