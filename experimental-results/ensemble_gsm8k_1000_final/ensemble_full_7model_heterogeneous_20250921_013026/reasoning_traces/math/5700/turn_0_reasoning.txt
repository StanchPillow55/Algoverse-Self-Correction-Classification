=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step, keeping track of the number of snack eaters at each stage.

1. **Initial number of snack eaters**: 
   - There are 100 people who decided to have a snack.

2. **New outsiders join**: 
   - 20 new outsiders join the snack eaters.
   - Total snack eaters now = 100 + 20 = 120.

3. **Half of the snack eaters get full and leave**: 
   - Half of 120 is 120 / 2 = 60.
   - So, 60 snack eaters leave.
   - Remaining snack eaters = 120 - 60 = 60.

4. **More outsiders join**: 
   - 10 new outsiders come to have snacks.
   - Total snack eaters now = 60 + 10 = 70.

5. **30 more snack eaters get their fill and leave**: 
   - 30 snack eaters leave.
   - Remaining snack eaters = 70 - 30 = 40.

6. **Half of the remaining snack eaters leave**: 
   - Half of 40 is 40 / 2 = 20.
   - So, 20 snack eaters leave.
   - Remaining snack eaters = 40 - 20 = 20.

Now, we have tracked the number of snack eaters through each step of the problem. 

**Final Answer**: There are 20 snack eaters left.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it.

Given information:
- There were 200 people participating in the gathering at the town hall.
- 100 people decided to have a snack.
- 20 new outsiders joined in to have a snack.
- Half of the snack eaters got full and left.
- 10 new outsiders came to have snacks.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of snack eaters at each step of the scenario described. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Snack Eaters:**
   - Initially, 100 people decided to have a snack. So, we start with 100 snack eaters.

2. **New Outsiders Join:**
   - 20 new outsiders joined to have a snack. This increases the number of snack eaters by 20.
   - New total of snack eaters = 100 + 20 = 120.

3. **Half of the Snack Eaters Lea...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 200 people at the gathering. Out of these, 100 people decided to have a snack. So, the number of snack eaters is 100.

2. Then, 20 new outsiders joined in to have a snack. This increases the number of snack eaters to 100 + 20 = 120.

3. Half of these snack eaters got full and left. So, the number of snack eaters who left is 1/2 * 120 = 60. This leaves 120 - 60 = 60 snack eaters.

4. Then, 10 new outsider...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll keep track of the number of snack eaters at each stage.

Given:
- 200 people initially participated in the gathering.
- 100 people decided to have a snack.

Step 1: 20 new outsiders joined in to have a snack.
Snack eaters = 100 + 20 = 120

Step 2: Half of the snack eaters got full and left.
Snack eaters who left = 120 รท 2 = 60
Remaining snack eaters = 120 - 60 = 60

Step 3: 10 new outsiders came to hav...
