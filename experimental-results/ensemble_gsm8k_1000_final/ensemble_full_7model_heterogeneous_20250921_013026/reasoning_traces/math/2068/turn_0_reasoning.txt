=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many baseball cards Janessa kept for herself, we will follow the steps outlined in the problem and perform the necessary calculations.

1. **Calculate the total number of cards Janessa initially has:**
   - Janessa has 4 cards of her own.
   - Her father gave her 13 cards.
   - Therefore, the total number of cards she has before the eBay order is:
     \[
     4 + 13 = 17 \text{ cards}
     \]

2. **Add the cards she ordered from eBay:**
   - Janessa ordered 36 cards from eBay.
   - So, the total number of cards after receiving the eBay order is:
     \[
     17 + 36 = 53 \text{ cards}
     \]

3. **Account for the cards that are in bad shape:**
   - Janessa found that 4 of the cards from eBay are in bad shape and she decides to throw them away.
   - Therefore, the number of usable cards after discarding the bad ones is:
     \[
     53 - 4 = 49 \text{ cards}
     \]

4. **Determine how many cards Janessa gave to Dexter:**
   - Janessa gave Dexter 29 cards.

5. **Calculate how many cards Janessa kept for herself:**
   - To find out how many cards Janessa kept, we subtract the number of cards given to Dexter from the total number of usable cards:
     \[
     49 - 29 = 20 \text{ cards}
     \]

Thus, Janessa kept **20 cards** for herself.

Final answer: Janessa kept 20 cards.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many baseball cards Janessa kept for herself after giving some to her brother Dexter. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Cards:**
   - Janessa has 4 cards initially.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Janessa initially had 4 cards and her father gave her 13 more. So, she had 4 + 13 = <<4+13=17>>17 cards.

Then, she ordered 36 more cards from eBay, so her total number of cards became 17 + 36 = <<17+36=53>>53 cards.

However, 4 of these cards were in bad shape, so she threw them away. This left her with 53 - 4 = <<53-4=49>>49 cards.

She gave Dexter 29 cards, so she kept 49 - 29 = <<49-29=20>>20 cards for herself.

So, Janessa kept 20 cards for herself.
