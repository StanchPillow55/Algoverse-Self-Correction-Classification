Final Answer: To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of slices needed**: 
   John has 20 friends, and he wants each friend to have 4 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices required can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total slices needed} = \text{Number of friends} \times \text{Slices per friend}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total slices needed} = 20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Determine how many slices are in one pizza**: 
   Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. Therefore, the number of slices per pizza is:

   \[
   \text{Slices per pizza} = 8
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of pizzas needed**: 
   To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza. Since we cannot order a fraction of a pizza, we will round up to the nearest whole number if necessary.

   \[
   \text{Number of pizzas needed} = \frac{\text{Total slices needed}}{\text{Slices per pizza}} = \frac{80}{8} = 10
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Since 80 slices can be perfectly divided by 8 slices per pizza, John needs to order exactly 10 pizzas.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of slices required and then determine the minimum number of pizzas needed to provide that many slices.

Given information:
- There are 20 friends in total.
- Each friend should have 4 slices.
- Pizzas are sold sliced into 8 portions.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices required.
Total number of slices required = Number of friends × Number of slices per friend
Total number of slices requ...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pizzas John should order so that each of his 20 friends can have 4 slices of pizza. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:

1. **Determine the total number of slices needed:**
   - John has 20 friends, and each friend should receive 4 slices of pizza.
   - Therefore, the total number of slices needed is calculated by multiplying the number of friends by the number of slices each friend should receive:
     \[...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to figure out how many slices of pizza John needs in total. Since he wants each of his 20 friends to have 4 slices, we multiply the number of friends by the number of slices per friend:

20 friends * 4 slices/friend = 80 slices

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas John needs to order. Since each pizza is sliced into 8 portions, we divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:

80 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 10 pizzas

So,...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 20 friends in total.
   * Each friend should get 4 slices of pizza.
   * Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.

2. Calculate the total number of slices needed:
   * Total friends = 20
   * Slices per friend = 4
   * Total slices needed = Total friends × Slices per friend
   * Total slices needed = 20 × 4 = 80 slices

3. Calculate the number of pizzas ne...
