=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the original gym budget.**
2. **Determine the new budget after the 20% increase.**
3. **Calculate how many softballs can be bought with the new budget.**

### Step 1: Calculate the Original Gym Budget

The problem states that in a normal month, the school can buy 15 dodgeballs for $5 each. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the dodgeballs:

\[
\text{Total cost of dodgeballs} = \text{Number of dodgeballs} \times \text{Cost per dodgeball}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of dodgeballs} = 15 \times 5 = 75
\]

Thus, the original gym budget is $75.

### Step 2: Calculate the New Budget After the 20% Increase

Next, we need to find the new budget after adding 20% to the original budget. 

To calculate 20% of the original budget:

\[
\text{Increase} = 0.20 \times \text{Original Budget} = 0.20 \times 75 = 15
\]

Now, we add this increase to the original budget to find the new budget:

\[
\text{New Budget} = \text{Original Budget} + \text{Increase} = 75 + 15 = 90
\]

### Step 3: Calculate How Many Softballs Can Be Bought with the New Budget

Now that we have the new budget of $90, we need to determine how many softballs can be purchased. Each softball costs $9.

To find the number of softballs that can be bought, we divide the new budget by the cost of each softball:

\[
\text{Number of softballs} = \frac{\text{New Budget}}{\text{Cost per softball}} = \frac{90}{9}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Number of softballs} = 10
\]

### Final Answer

The school can buy **10 softballs** with the new budget.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The school's gym budget was increased by 20%.
- In a normal month, they could buy 15 dodgeballs for $5 each if they spent the entire budget.
- Softballs cost $9 each.

Step 1: Calculate the original gym budget.
Since they could buy 15 dodgeballs for $5 each, the original gym budget was:
15 dodgeballs × $5 per dodgeball = $75 original gym budget

Step 2: Calculate the new gym budget after ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the new budget after a 20% increase and then calculate how many softballs can be purchased with this new budget.

### Step 1: Determine the Original Budget

The problem states that in a normal month, the school can buy 15 dodgeballs at $5 each using the entire budget. Therefore, the original budget can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Original Budget} = 15 \text{ dodgeballs} \times 5 \text{ dollars per dodgeball} = 75 \text{...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much the original gym budget was. We know that the school could buy 15 dodgeballs for $5 each with the original budget. So, we multiply the number of dodgeballs by the cost of each dodgeball:

15 dodgeballs * $5/dodgeball = $75

So, the original gym budget was $75.

Next, we need to find out how much the new gym budget is. We know that the school decided to add 20% to the original gym budget. So, we multiply the original gym budget by 20%:

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The school is increasing the gym budget by 20%.
   * With the original budget, they could buy 15 dodgeballs at $5 each.
   * They want to know how many softballs they can buy with the new budget if softballs cost $9 each.

2. Calculate the original gym budget:
   * Original budget = Number of dodgeballs × Price per dodgeball
   * Original budget = 15 × $5
   * Or...
