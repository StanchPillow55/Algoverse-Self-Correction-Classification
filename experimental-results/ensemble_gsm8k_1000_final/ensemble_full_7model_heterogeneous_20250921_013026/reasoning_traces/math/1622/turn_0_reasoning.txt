=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many lemons Jose needs to make 3 dozen lemon cupcakes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed for 3 dozen cupcakes**:
   - Jose needs 12 tablespoons of lemon juice for 1 dozen cupcakes.
   - To find out how much he needs for 3 dozen cupcakes, we multiply the amount needed for 1 dozen by 3:
     \[
     12 \text{ tablespoons} \times 3 = 36 \text{ tablespoons}
     \]

2. **Calculate how many lemons are required to produce 36 tablespoons of lemon juice**:
   - Each lemon provides 4 tablespoons of lemon juice.
   - To find out how many lemons are needed for 36 tablespoons, we divide the total tablespoons needed by the amount of juice each lemon provides:
     \[
     \frac{36 \text{ tablespoons}}{4 \text{ tablespoons per lemon}} = 9 \text{ lemons}
     \]

3. **Final answer**:
   - Jose will need **9 lemons** to make 3 dozen lemon cupcakes.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]
