=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Penny has left after her purchases, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the socks**:
   - Penny buys 4 pairs of socks at a price of $2 per pair.
   - The total cost for the socks can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of socks} = \text{Number of pairs} \times \text{Cost per pair} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the hat**:
   - Penny buys 1 hat for $7.
   - The total cost for the hat is simply:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of hat} = 7 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount spent**:
   - Now, we will add the total cost of the socks and the hat to find the total amount Penny spent:
     \[
     \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of socks} + \text{Total cost of hat} = 8 + 7 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate how much money Penny has left**:
   - Penny started with $20. To find out how much she has left after her purchases, we subtract the total amount spent from her initial amount:
     \[
     \text{Money left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total amount spent} = 20 - 15 = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, after buying the socks and the hat, Penny has **$5 left**.

Final Answer: Penny has $5 left.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Penny has $20 to start with.
- Penny buys 4 pairs of socks for $2 a pair.
- Penny buys a hat for $7.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the socks.
Cost of 4 pairs of socks = 4 × $2 = $8

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the hat.
Cost of the hat = $7

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Penny spent.
Total amount spent = Cost of socks + Cost of hat
Total amount spent = $8 + $7 = $15

Step 4:...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Penny spends and then subtract that amount from the total amount of money she initially has. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total cost of the socks:**
   - Penny buys 4 pairs of socks.
   - Each pair of socks costs $2.
   - To find the total cost of the socks, multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of socks} = 4 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Penny starts with $20.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the socks. Since each pair of socks costs $2 and she buys 4 pairs, we multiply 2 by 4 to get $8. 

Next, we add the cost of the hat, which is $7, to the total cost of the socks. So, 8 + 7 equals $15.

Finally, we subtract the total cost of the socks and the hat from the amount of money Penny started with. So, 20 - 15 equals $5.

Therefore, Penny has $5 left.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the final answer.

Given:
- Penny has $20.
- Penny buys 4 pairs of socks for $2 a pair.
- Penny buys a hat for $7.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the socks.
- Each pair of socks costs $2.
- Penny buys 4 pairs of socks.
Total cost of socks = Price per pair × Number of pairs
