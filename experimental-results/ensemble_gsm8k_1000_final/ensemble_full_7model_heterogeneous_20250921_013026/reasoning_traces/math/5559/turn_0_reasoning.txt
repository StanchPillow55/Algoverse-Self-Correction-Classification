Final Answer: To find the total points Lemuel scored in the game, we need to calculate the points from both the 2-point shots and the 3-point shots he made.

1. **Calculate points from 2-point shots:**
   - Lemuel made 2-point shots 7 times.
   - Each 2-point shot is worth 2 points.
   - Therefore, the total points from 2-point shots can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Points from 2-point shots} = 7 \text{ shots} \times 2 \text{ points/shot} = 14 \text{ points}
     \]

2. **Calculate points from 3-point shots:**
   - Lemuel made 3-point shots 3 times.
   - Each 3-point shot is worth 3 points.
   - Therefore, the total points from 3-point shots can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Points from 3-point shots} = 3 \text{ shots} \times 3 \text{ points/shot} = 9 \text{ points}
     \]

3. **Calculate total points scored:**
   - To find the total points scored in the game, we add the points from the 2-point shots and the points from the 3-point shots:
     \[
     \text{Total points} = \text{Points from 2-point shots} + \text{Points from 3-point shots}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total points} = 14 \text{ points} + 9 \text{ points} = 23 \text{ points}
     \]

Thus, the total number of points Lemuel made in that game is \( \boxed{23} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total points Lemuel scored in the game by considering the points earned from both 2-point shots and 3-point shots.

Given information:
- Lemuel made 2-point shots 7 times.
- Lemuel made 3-point shots 3 times.

Step 1: Calculate the points earned from 2-point shots.
Points from 2-point shots = Number of 2-point shots × 2 points per shot
Points from 2-point shots = 7 × 2 = 14 points

Step 2: Calculate the ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of points Lemuel scored from both his 2-point shots and his 3-point shots.

**Step 1: Calculate the points from 2-point shots.**

Lemuel made 2-point shots 7 times. Each 2-point shot is worth 2 points. Therefore, we calculate the total points from the 2-point shots as follows:

\[
\text{Points from 2-point shots} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ points}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the points from 3-point shots.**

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to multiply the number of shots made by the points each shot is worth and then add those values together.

First, let's calculate the total points Lemuel made from 2-point shots. He made 2-point shots 7 times, so we multiply 2 (points per shot) by 7 (number of shots):

2 points/shot * 7 shots = 14 points

Next, let's calculate the total points Lemuel made from 3-point shots. He made 3-point shots 3 times, so we multiply 3 (points per shot) b...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given information:
- Lemuel made 2-point shots 7 times.
- Lemuel made 3-point shots 3 times (thrice).

Step 1: Calculate the total points from 2-point shots.
- Each 2-point shot is worth 2 points.
- Lemuel made 7 of these shots.
Total points from 2-point shots = 2 points × 7 = 14 points

Step 2: Calculate the total points from 3-point shots.
- Each 3-point shot is worth 3 points.
- Lemuel m...
