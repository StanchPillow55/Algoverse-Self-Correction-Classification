=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of Suki's coffee beans.**
2. **Calculate the total weight of Jimmy's coffee beans.**
3. **Combine the total weights of Suki's and Jimmy's coffee beans.**
4. **Determine how many 8-kilogram containers can be filled with the combined weight.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total weight of Suki's coffee beans

Suki bought 6.5 bags of coffee beans, and each bag weighs 22 kilograms. 

To find the total weight of Suki's coffee beans, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag:

\[
\text{Total weight of Suki's coffee} = 6.5 \text{ bags} \times 22 \text{ kg/bag}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
6.5 \times 22 = 143 \text{ kg}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total weight of Jimmy's coffee beans

Jimmy bought 4.5 bags of coffee beans, and each bag weighs 18 kilograms.

To find the total weight of Jimmy's coffee beans, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag:

\[
\text{Total weight of Jimmy's coffee} = 4.5 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ kg/bag}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
4.5 \times 18 = 81 \text{ kg}
\]

### Step 3: Combine the total weights of Suki's and Jimmy's coffee beans

Now, we add the total weights of Suki's and Jimmy's coffee beans:

\[
\text{Total weight combined} = \text{Total weight of Suki's coffee} + \text{Total weight of Jimmy's coffee}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total weight combined} = 143 \text{ kg} + 81 \text{ kg} = 224 \text{ kg}
\]

### Step 4: Determine how many 8-kilogram containers can be filled

To find out how many 8-kilogram containers can be filled with the total weight of 224 kilograms, we divide the total weight by the weight of each container:

\[
\text{Number of containers} = \frac{\text{Total weight combined}}{\text{Weight per container}} = \frac{224 \text{ kg}}{8 \text{ kg/container}}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\frac{224}{8} = 28
\]

### Final Answer

Suki and Jimmy used **28 containers** to repack their combined coffee beans.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Suki bought 6.5 bags of coffee beans, each weighing 22 kilograms.
- Jimmy bought 4.5 bags of coffee beans, each weighing 18 kilograms.
- Suki and Jimmy combined their coffee beans and then repackaged them into 8-kilogram containers.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of Suki's coffee beans.
Total weight of Suki's coffee beans = 6.5 bags × 22 kilograms/bag = 143 kilograms

Step 2:...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weight of the coffee beans that Suki and Jimmy bought, combine them, and then figure out how many 8-kilogram containers are needed to hold all the coffee beans.

### Step 1: Calculate the total weight of coffee beans Suki bought.
Suki bought 6.5 bags of coffee beans, and each bag weighed 22 kilograms.

\[
\text{Total weight of Suki's coffee beans} = 6.5 \times 22
\]

Calculating this:

\[
6.5 \times 22 = 143
\]

So, S...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many kilograms of coffee beans Suki and Jimmy bought in total.

Suki bought 6.5 bags of coffee beans, each weighing 22 kilograms. So, the total weight of coffee beans that Suki bought is 6.5 bags * 22 kg/bag = 143 kg.

Jimmy bought 4.5 bags of coffee beans, each weighing 18 kilograms. So, the total weight of coffee beans that Jimmy bought is 4.5 bags * 18 kg/bag = 81 kg.

So, the total weight of coffee beans that Suki and Jimmy bought is 143...
