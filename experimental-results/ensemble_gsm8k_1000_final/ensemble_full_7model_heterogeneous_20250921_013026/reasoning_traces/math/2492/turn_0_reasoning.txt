=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the price at which Vanessa sold each dress. We know the following information:

1. Vanessa sold 7 dresses and 4 shirts.
2. She made a total of $69 from these sales.
3. Each shirt was sold for $5.

Let's denote the price of each dress as \( d \).

### Step 1: Calculate the total income from shirts
Since each shirt sells for $5 and she sold 4 shirts, we can calculate the total income from the shirts:

\[
\text{Total income from shirts} = \text{Number of shirts} \times \text{Price per shirt} = 4 \times 5 = 20
\]

### Step 2: Set up the equation for total income
The total income from selling both dresses and shirts is given as $69. Therefore, we can express this as:

\[
\text{Total income} = \text{Income from dresses} + \text{Income from shirts}
\]

Substituting the known values into the equation:

\[
69 = (7 \times d) + 20
\]

### Step 3: Solve for the price of each dress
Now, we need to isolate \( d \) in the equation. First, we subtract the income from shirts from both sides:

\[
69 - 20 = 7d
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
49 = 7d
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 7 to find \( d \):

\[
d = \frac{49}{7} = 7
\]

### Conclusion
The price at which each dress was sold is \( d = 7 \).

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Each dress sold for } \$7.
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much Vanessa made from selling the shirts. Since each shirt was sold for $5, and she sold 4 shirts, she made 5 * 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20 from selling shirts.

Now, let's subtract the money Vanessa made from selling shirts from the total amount she made. This will give us the amount she made from selling dresses. So, 69 - 20 = $<<69-20=49>>49 was made from selling dresses.

Since Vanessa sold 7 dresses, we can find the price of each dress by dividing t...
