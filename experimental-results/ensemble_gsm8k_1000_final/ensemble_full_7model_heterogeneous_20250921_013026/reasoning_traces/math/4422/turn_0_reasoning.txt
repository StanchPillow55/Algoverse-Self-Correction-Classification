=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Melinda, Zoe, and Joel can save by pooling their money together to buy three iPhones at once, we will first calculate the total cost of buying the iPhones individually and then compare it to the cost of buying them together with the discount applied.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of buying individually

The cost of one iPhone X is $600. If each person buys one iPhone individually, the total cost for three iPhones would be:

\[
\text{Total cost individually} = 3 \times 600 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost when buying together with the discount

Since the seller offers a 5% discount for purchasing at least 2 smartphones, we will apply this discount to the total cost when they buy three iPhones together.

First, we calculate the total cost without the discount for three iPhones:

\[
\text{Total cost together} = 3 \times 600 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the discount amount:

\[
\text{Discount} = 5\% \text{ of } 1800 = 0.05 \times 1800 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost after discount} = 1800 - 90 = 1710 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the savings by buying together

Now, we can find the savings by comparing the total cost of buying individually to the total cost of buying together:

\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Total cost individually} - \text{Total cost together after discount}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Savings} = 1800 - 1710 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

By pooling their money together and buying three iPhones at once, Melinda, Zoe, and Joel can save **$90**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of buying three iPhone X phones individually and the total cost of buying them together with the 5% discount, then find the difference between the two to determine the savings.

Given information:
- The cost of an iPhone X is $600.
- The seller offers a 5% discount for customers who buy at least 2 smartphones at once.
- Melinda, Zoe, and Joel want to buy an iPhone X each.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of buying three iPhones individually and compare it to the cost of buying them together with the discount. We will then determine the savings.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of buying three iPhones individually.

Each iPhone X costs $600. If Melinda, Zoe, and Joel each buy an iPhone individually, they will pay:

\[
\text{Cost per iPhone} = \$600
\]

Since there are three people buying one iPhone each, the total ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total cost of three iPhone Xs without any discount. Since each iPhone X costs $600, the total cost would be 3 * $600 = $1800.

Next, let's calculate the amount of the discount. The seller is offering a 5% discount, so the discount would be 5/100 * $1800 = $90.

Therefore, if Melinda, Zoe and Joel pool their money together and buy three iPhones at once from this seller, they can save $90.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The seller offers a 5% discount for buying at least 2 smartphones at once.
   * An iPhone X costs $600.
   * Melinda, Zoe, and Joel each want to buy an iPhone X.

2. Calculate the total cost without the discount:
   * Cost of one iPhone X = $600
   * Number of iPhones they want to buy = 3
   * Total cost without discount = $600 Ã— 3 = $1,800

3. Calculate the disc...
