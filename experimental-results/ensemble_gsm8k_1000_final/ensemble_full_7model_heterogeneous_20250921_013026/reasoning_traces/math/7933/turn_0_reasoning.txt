=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings from recycling and then multiply that by four.

### Step 1: Calculate the weekly earnings from aluminum cans.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda each week. Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents. 

To find the total earnings from aluminum cans in one week, we multiply the number of cans by the value of each can:

\[
\text{Earnings from aluminum cans} = \text{Number of cans} \times \text{Value per can}
\]
\[
\text{Earnings from aluminum cans} = 3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the weekly earnings from plastic bottles.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water each week. Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.

To find the total earnings from plastic bottles in one week, we multiply the number of bottles by the value of each bottle:

\[
\text{Earnings from plastic bottles} = \text{Number of bottles} \times \text{Value per bottle}
\]
\[
\text{Earnings from plastic bottles} = 5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total weekly earnings.

Now we add the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find the total weekly earnings:

\[
\text{Total weekly earnings} = \text{Earnings from aluminum cans} + \text{Earnings from plastic bottles}
\]
\[
\text{Total weekly earnings} = 6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total earnings for a four-week month.

To find out how much Grayson earns in a four-week month, we multiply her total weekly earnings by 4:

\[
\text{Total earnings for four weeks} = \text{Total weekly earnings} \times 4
\]
\[
\text{Total earnings for four weeks} = 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}
\]

### Final Answer

Grayson earns a total of **84 cents** from recycling in a four-week month.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling in a week.

From the aluminum cans, she earns 2 cents per can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, she earns 2 cents/can * 3 cans = 6 cents a week from the aluminum cans.

From the plastic bottles, she earns 3 cents per bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, she earns 3 cents/bottle * 5 bottles = 15 cents a week from the plastic bottles.

Adding these together, Grayson earns 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents a wee...
