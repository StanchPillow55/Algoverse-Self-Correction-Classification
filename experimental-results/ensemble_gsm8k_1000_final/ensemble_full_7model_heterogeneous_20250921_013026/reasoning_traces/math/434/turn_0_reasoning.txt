=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine what percentage Calvin is towards his goal of haircuts, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of haircuts needed**: 
   Calvin has already had 8 haircuts and needs 2 more to reach his goal. Therefore, the total number of haircuts he needs is:
   \[
   \text{Total haircuts needed} = 8 + 2 = 10
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of haircuts he has completed**: 
   Calvin has completed 8 haircuts.

3. **Calculate the percentage of the goal he has achieved**: 
   To find the percentage of the goal that Calvin has achieved, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage achieved} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of haircuts completed}}{\text{Total haircuts needed}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   \text{Percentage achieved} = \left( \frac{8}{10} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform the division**:
   \[
   \frac{8}{10} = 0.8
   \]

5. **Multiply by 100 to convert to percentage**:
   \[
   0.8 \times 100 = 80
   \]

Thus, Calvin is 80% towards his goal of haircuts.

**Final Answer**: Calvin is 80% towards his goal.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of haircuts required to make the wig and then calculate the percentage of the goal that Calvin has achieved so far.

Given information:
- Calvin has gotten 8 haircuts so far.
- He needs 2 more haircuts to reach his goal.

Step 1: Find the total number of haircuts required to make the wig.
Total number of haircuts required = Number of haircuts so far + Number of haircuts needed to reach the goal
T...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine what percentage of his goal Calvin has achieved with his current number of haircuts.

First, let's define the total number of haircuts Calvin needs to reach his goal. According to the problem, Calvin has already had 8 haircuts and needs 2 more to reach his goal. Therefore, the total number of haircuts required is:

\[ 
8 \text{ (current haircuts)} + 2 \text{ (additional haircuts needed)} = 10 \text{ haircuts}
\]

Next, we need ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine the total number of haircuts Calvin needs to reach his goal. We know he has already had 8 haircuts and needs 2 more, so we add these together:

8 haircuts + 2 haircuts = 10 haircuts

This is the total number of haircuts Calvin needs to reach his goal.

Next, we need to determine what percentage of this total Calvin has already achieved. We know he has had 8 haircuts, so we divide this by the total and multiply by 100 to convert the decimal to a...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Calvin needs hair clippings from a total of 10 haircuts to make a wig for his dog.
   * He has already gotten 8 haircuts.

2. Calculate the number of haircuts Calvin still needs:
   * Remaining haircuts = Total required haircuts - Haircuts already gotten
   * Remaining haircuts = 10 - 8 = 2

3. To find the percentage of progress towards his goal, we need to divid...
