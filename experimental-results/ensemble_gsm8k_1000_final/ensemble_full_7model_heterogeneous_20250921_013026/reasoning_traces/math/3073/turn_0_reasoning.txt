=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of items Bailey bought and then figure out how many items were charged to each of the 4 credit cards.

**Step 1: Count the items Bailey bought.**

Bailey bought:
- 8 dog treats
- 2 chew toys
- 10 rawhide bones

Now, we will add these quantities together to find the total number of items.

\[
\text{Total items} = \text{dog treats} + \text{chew toys} + \text{rawhide bones}
\]
\[
\text{Total items} = 8 + 2 + 10
\]
\[
\text{Total items} = 20
\]

**Step 2: Split the total number of items across the 4 credit cards.**

Next, we need to divide the total number of items (20) by the number of credit cards (4) to find out how many items were charged to each card.

\[
\text{Items per card} = \frac{\text{Total items}}{\text{Number of credit cards}}
\]
\[
\text{Items per card} = \frac{20}{4}
\]
\[
\text{Items per card} = 5
\]

**Final Answer:**

Each credit card was charged for 5 items. 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many items Bailey bought in total. 

She bought 8 dog treats, 2 chew toys, and 10 rawhide bones. 

So, the total number of items she bought is 8 + 2 + 10 = 20 items.

Then, she had to split the charges equally across 4 credit cards. 

To find out how many items were included in each charge, we divide the total number of items by the number of credit cards. 

So, 20 items รท 4 credit cards = 5 items per card.

Therefore, each charge included 5...
