Final Answer: To find out how much money the group earned from selling candy bars, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of candy bars sold**: 
   Each of the 20 members sold an average of 8 candy bars. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of candy bars sold by multiplying the number of members by the average number of candy bars sold per member.

   \[
   \text{Total candy bars sold} = \text{Number of members} \times \text{Average candy bars sold per member}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total candy bars sold} = 20 \times 8 = 160
   \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings from candy bar sales**: 
   Each candy bar costs $0.50. To find the total earnings, we multiply the total number of candy bars sold by the price of each candy bar.

   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Total candy bars sold} \times \text{Price per candy bar}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 160 \times 0.50
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   160 \times 0.50 = 80
   \]

3. **Final answer**: 
   The total amount of money earned from the candy bar sales is $80.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{80}
