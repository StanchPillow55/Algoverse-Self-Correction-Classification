=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many stuffed animals McKenna has:**
   - McKenna has 34 stuffed animals.

2. **Calculate how many stuffed animals Kenley has:**
   - Kenley has twice as many stuffed animals as McKenna.
   - Therefore, we calculate Kenley's stuffed animals as follows:
     \[
     \text{Kenley's stuffed animals} = 2 \times \text{McKenna's stuffed animals} = 2 \times 34 = 68
     \]

3. **Calculate how many stuffed animals Tenly has:**
   - Tenly has 5 more stuffed animals than Kenley.
   - Therefore, we calculate Tenly's stuffed animals as follows:
     \[
     \text{Tenly's stuffed animals} = \text{Kenley's stuffed animals} + 5 = 68 + 5 = 73
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of stuffed animals the three girls have:**
   - We add the number of stuffed animals each girl has:
     \[
     \text{Total stuffed animals} = \text{McKenna's stuffed animals} + \text{Kenley's stuffed animals} + \text{Tenly's stuffed animals}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total stuffed animals} = 34 + 68 + 73
     \]

5. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add McKenna's and Kenley's stuffed animals:
     \[
     34 + 68 = 102
     \]
   - Now, add Tenly's stuffed animals to this sum:
     \[
     102 + 73 = 175
     \]

Thus, the total number of stuffed animals that McKenna, Kenley, and Tenly have in all is \( \boxed{175} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- McKenna has 34 stuffed animals.
- Kenley has twice as many stuffed animals as McKenna.
- Tenly has 5 more stuffed animals than Kenley.

Step 1: Find how many stuffed animals Kenley has.
Kenley has twice as many stuffed animals as McKenna.
Kenley's stuffed animals = 2 × McKenna's stuffed animals
Kenley's stuffed animals = 2 × 34 = 68 stuffed animals

Step 2: Find how many stuffed animals Tenly ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of stuffed animals each girl has and then sum them up to find the total.

1. **Determine how many stuffed animals McKenna has:**
   - McKenna has 34 stuffed animals.

2. **Determine how many stuffed animals Kenley has:**
   - Kenley has twice as many stuffed animals as McKenna.
   - Since McKenna has 34 stuffed animals, we calculate Kenley's amount as follows:
     \[
     \text{Kenley's stuffed animals} = 2 \times 3...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many stuffed animals Kenley has. Since Kenley has twice as many as McKenna, we multiply McKenna's number of stuffed animals by 2. 

34 (McKenna's stuffed animals) * 2 = 68 stuffed animals for Kenley.

Next, we find out how many stuffed animals Tenly has. Since Tenly has 5 more than Kenley, we add 5 to Kenley's number of stuffed animals.

68 (Kenley's stuffed animals) + 5 = 73 stuffed animals for Tenly.

Finally, to find out how many stuffed ...
