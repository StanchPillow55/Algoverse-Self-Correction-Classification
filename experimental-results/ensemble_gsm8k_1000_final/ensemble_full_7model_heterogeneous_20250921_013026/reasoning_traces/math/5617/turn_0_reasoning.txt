=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine Kayla's current age based on the information provided about her sister Kimiko's age. Then, we will calculate how long it will take for Kayla to reach the minimum driving age of 18 years.

1. **Determine Kayla's Current Age:**
   - We know that Kayla is currently half the age of her sister Kimiko.
   - Kimiko's age is given as 26 years.
   - Therefore, we can calculate Kayla's age as follows:

   \[
   \text{Kayla's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Kimiko's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Time Until Kayla Reaches 18:**
   - The minimum age for driving in her state is 18 years.
   - We need to determine how many more years it will take for Kayla to reach this age.
   - We can find this by subtracting Kayla's current age from the minimum driving age:

   \[
   \text{Years until Kayla can drive} = 18 - \text{Kayla's age} = 18 - 13 = 5 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**
   - It will take Kayla 5 years to reach the minimum age of driving in her state.

Thus, the final answer is:

**5 years**

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find Kayla's current age and then calculate how long it will take for her to reach the minimum age of driving, which is 18 years old.

Given information:
- Kayla's current age is half the age of her sister Kimiko, who is 26 years old.
- The minimum age of driving in Kayla's state is 18 years old.

Step 1: Find Kayla's current age.
Kayla's age = 1/2 × Kimiko's age
Kayla's age = 1/2 × 26 = 13 years old

Step 2: Calculat...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out Kayla's current age. Since she is half the age of her sister Kimiko who is 26 years old, we can calculate her age by dividing Kimiko's age by 2.

26 / 2 = 13

So, Kayla is currently 13 years old.

Next, we need to find out how many years it will take for Kayla to reach the minimum driving age of 18. We can do this by subtracting her current age from the minimum driving age.

18 - 13 = 5

So, it will take Kayla 5 more years to reach the minimum d...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Kayla's sister Kimiko is 26 years old.
   * Kayla is currently half the age of Kimiko.
   * The minimum age for driving in their state is 18 years old.

2. Calculate Kayla's current age:
   * Kimiko's age = 26 years old
   * Kayla's age = Kimiko's age ÷ 2
   * Kayla's age = 26 ÷ 2 = 13 years old
   So, Kayla is currently 13 years old.

3. Calculate the time Kayla ne...
