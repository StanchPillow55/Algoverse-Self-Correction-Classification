=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many toy cars Gerald has left after donating a portion of them to an orphanage.

1. **Identify the total number of toy cars Gerald initially has**: 
   - Gerald starts with 20 toy cars.

2. **Determine the fraction of toy cars he donates**:
   - Gerald donates \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his toy cars.

3. **Calculate the number of toy cars donated**:
   - To find out how many toy cars this fraction represents, we multiply the total number of toy cars by \( \frac{1}{4} \):
   \[
   \text{Number of toy cars donated} = 20 \times \frac{1}{4}
   \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   20 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]
   - So, Gerald donates 5 toy cars.

4. **Calculate the number of toy cars left after the donation**:
   - To find out how many toy cars Gerald has left, we subtract the number of toy cars donated from the initial total:
   \[
   \text{Toy cars left} = \text{Initial toy cars} - \text{Toy cars donated}
   \]
   - Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Toy cars left} = 20 - 5 = 15
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - After donating 5 toy cars, Gerald has 15 toy cars left.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Gerald had 20 toy cars.
- He donated 1/4 of his toy cars to an orphanage.

Step 1: Calculate how many toy cars Gerald donated to the orphanage.
1/4 of 20 toy cars = 20 ร 1/4 = 5 toy cars

Step 2: Calculate how many toy cars Gerald has left.
Total toy cars - Toy cars donated = Toy cars left
20 toy cars - 5 toy cars = 15 toy cars

Therefore, the final answer is:
Gerald has 15 toy cars left.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toy cars Gerald donated and then subtract that number from his original total to find out how many toy cars he has left.

**Step 1: Determine the number of toy cars donated.**

Gerald donated \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his toy cars. He originally had 20 toy cars. To find out how many cars he donated, we calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 20.

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

So, Gerald donated 5 toy cars.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Gerald had 20 toy cars initially.

He donated 1/4 of his toy cars to an orphanage. To find out how many toy cars he donated, we need to calculate 1/4 of 20. 

To do this, we multiply 20 by 1/4:

20 * 1/4 = 5

So, Gerald donated 5 toy cars to the orphanage.

To find out how many toy cars Gerald has left, we subtract the number of toy cars he donated from the total number he had initially:

20 - 5 = 15

So, Gerald has 15 toy cars left. 

Final Answer: Gerald has 15 toy cars...
