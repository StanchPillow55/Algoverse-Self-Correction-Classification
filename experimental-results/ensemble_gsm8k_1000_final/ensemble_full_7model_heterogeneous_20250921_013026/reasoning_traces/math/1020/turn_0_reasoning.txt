Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate how many words Matt can write with each hand in 5 minutes and then find the difference between the two amounts.

1. **Calculate the number of words written with the right hand:**
   - Matt writes 10 words per minute with his right hand.
   - In 5 minutes, the total number of words written with his right hand can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Words with right hand} = \text{Words per minute} \times \text{Time in minutes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Words with right hand} = 10 \, \text{words/minute} \times 5 \, \text{minutes} = 50 \, \text{words}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of words written with the left hand:**
   - Matt writes 7 words per minute with his left hand.
   - In 5 minutes, the total number of words written with his left hand can be calculated similarly:
     \[
     \text{Words with left hand} = \text{Words per minute} \times \text{Time in minutes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Words with left hand} = 7 \, \text{words/minute} \times 5 \, \text{minutes} = 35 \, \text{words}
     \]

3. **Find the difference in the number of words written with the right hand and the left hand:**
   - We need to subtract the number of words written with the left hand from the number of words written with the right hand:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Words with right hand} - \text{Words with left hand}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 50 \, \text{words} - 35 \, \text{words} = 15 \, \text{words}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Matt would write **15 more words** with his right hand than with his left in 5 minutes.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many words Matt can write with each hand in 5 minutes and then find the difference between the two amounts.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of words Matt writes with his right hand in 5 minutes.**

Matt writes 10 words per minute with his right hand. Therefore, in 5 minutes, he would write:

\[ 
10 \, \text{words/minute} \times 5 \, \text{minutes} = 50 \, \text{words} 
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many words Matt can write with each hand in 5 minutes.

For his right hand, he writes 10 words per minute. So in 5 minutes, he would write:
10 words/minute * 5 minutes = 50 words

For his left hand, he writes 7 words per minute. So in 5 minutes, he would write:
7 words/minute * 5 minutes = 35 words

To find out how many more words Matt would write with his right hand than with his left in 5 minutes, we subtract the number of words he writes ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We need to find the difference between the number of words Matt can write with his right hand and his left hand in 5 minutes.

Given:
- Matt can write 10 words per minute with his right hand.
- Matt can write 7 words per minute with his left hand.
- We need to find the difference in the number of words written in 5 minutes.
