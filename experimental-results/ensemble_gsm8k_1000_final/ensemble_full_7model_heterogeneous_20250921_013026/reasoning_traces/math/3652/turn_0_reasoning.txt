=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To calculate the total bill for the group at Kaleb's Restaurant, we need to break down the costs for the adult meals, children's meals, and sodas separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the cost of adult meals:**
   - There are 6 adults.
   - Each adult meal costs $6.
   - Total cost for adult meals = Number of adults × Cost per adult meal
   \[
   \text{Total cost for adult meals} = 6 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ dollars/adult} = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of children's meals:**
   - There are 2 children.
   - Each children's meal costs $4.
   - Total cost for children's meals = Number of children × Cost per children's meal
   \[
   \text{Total cost for children's meals} = 2 \text{ children} \times 4 \text{ dollars/child} = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of sodas:**
   - There are a total of 8 people (6 adults + 2 children).
   - Each soda costs $2.
   - Total cost for sodas = Total number of people × Cost per soda
   \[
   \text{Total cost for sodas} = 8 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ dollars/person} = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total bill:**
   - Now, we add the total costs from each category:
   \[
   \text{Total bill} = \text{Total cost for adult meals} + \text{Total cost for children's meals} + \text{Total cost for sodas}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total bill} = 36 \text{ dollars} + 8 \text{ dollars} + 16 \text{ dollars} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the final answer for the total bill at Kaleb's Restaurant is:
\[
\boxed{60 \text{ dollars}}
\]
