=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many customers will go home without any fish based on the amount of tuna available and the demand from the customers.

1. **Calculate the total weight of tuna available:**
   - Mr. Ray has 10 tuna, and each tuna weighs 200 pounds.
   - Total weight of tuna = Number of tuna × Weight of each tuna
   \[
   \text{Total weight of tuna} = 10 \, \text{tuna} \times 200 \, \text{pounds/tuna} = 2000 \, \text{pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine how much tuna each customer wants:**
   - Each customer wants 25 pounds of tuna.

3. **Calculate how many customers can be served with the available tuna:**
   - To find out how many customers can be served, we divide the total weight of tuna by the amount each customer wants.
   \[
   \text{Number of customers served} = \frac{\text{Total weight of tuna}}{\text{Weight per customer}} = \frac{2000 \, \text{pounds}}{25 \, \text{pounds/customer}} = 80 \, \text{customers}
   \]

4. **Determine how many customers will go home without any fish:**
   - Mr. Ray has 100 customers waiting in total.
   - If 80 customers can be served, then the number of customers who will go home without any fish is:
   \[
   \text{Customers without fish} = \text{Total customers} - \text{Customers served} = 100 - 80 = 20
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that **20 customers will go home without any fish.**

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many customers Mr. Ray can serve with the tuna he has, and then find out how many customers will go home without any fish.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine the Total Weight of Tuna Available:**
   - Mr. Ray has 10 tuna.
   - Each tuna weighs 200 pounds.
   - Therefore, the total weight of tuna available is:
     \[
     10 \text{ tuna} \times 200 \text{ pounds/tuna} = 2000 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Determine t...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how much tuna Mr. Ray has in total. Since each tuna weighs 200 pounds and he has 10 of them, we multiply 200 by 10 to find the total weight of the tuna. 

200 pounds/tuna * 10 tuna = 2000 pounds

Next, we need to determine how many customers can be served with this amount of tuna. Since each customer wants 25 pounds of tuna, we divide the total weight of the tuna by the amount each customer wants to find out how many customers can be served.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mr. Ray has 100 customers waiting.
   * He has 10 tuna, each weighing 200 pounds.
   * Each customer wants 25 pounds of tuna.
   * The store follows a first come, first served policy.

2. Calculate the total amount of tuna available:
   * Total tuna = Number of tuna × Weight of each tuna
   * Total tuna = 10 × 200 pounds
   * Total tuna = 2,000 pounds
