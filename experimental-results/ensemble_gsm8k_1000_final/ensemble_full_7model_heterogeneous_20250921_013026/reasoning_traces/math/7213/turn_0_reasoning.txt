=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's denote the cost of the Taco Grande Plate as \( x \). 

Since both Mike and John ordered the Taco Grande Plate, the cost for each of them for the main meal is \( x \).

Now, let's calculate Mike's total bill. In addition to the Taco Grande Plate, Mike ordered:
- A side salad for $2
- A plate of cheesy fries for $4
- A diet cola for $2

We can express Mike's total bill as follows:

\[
\text{Mike's total bill} = x + 2 + 4 + 2 = x + 8
\]

John only ordered the Taco Grande Plate, so his total bill is:

\[
\text{John's total bill} = x
\]

According to the problem, Mike's lunch bill was twice as large as John's bill. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + 8 = 2x
\]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract \( x \) from both sides:

\[
8 = 2x - x
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8 = x
\]

Now that we have found \( x \), which is the cost of the Taco Grande Plate, we can calculate the total cost of Mike's and John's lunches.

First, we find Mike's total bill:

\[
\text{Mike's total bill} = x + 8 = 8 + 8 = 16
\]

Next, we find John's total bill:

\[
\text{John's total bill} = x = 8
\]

Now, we can find the combined total cost of Mike's and John's lunches:

\[
\text{Combined total cost} = \text{Mike's total bill} + \text{John's total bill} = 16 + 8 = 24
\]

Thus, the combined total cost of Mike and John's lunch is:

\[
\boxed{24}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of the Taco Grande Plate and then use that information to calculate the total cost of Mike and John's lunch.

Given information:
- Mike and John each ordered the Taco Grande Plate as their main meal.
- Mike also ordered a side salad for $2, a plate of cheesy fries for $4, and a diet cola for $2.
- Mike's lunch bill was twice as large as John's bill.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the Taco Grande Plate and then calculate the total cost of Mike and John's lunch.

Let's define:
- \( T \) as the cost of one Taco Grande Plate.
- \( M \) as the total cost of Mike's lunch.
- \( J \) as the total cost of John's lunch.

From the problem, we know:
1. Mike ordered the Taco Grande Plate, a side salad for $2, a plate of cheesy fries for $4, and a diet cola for $2.
2. John's bill only includes the Taco Gr...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the cost of the Taco Grande Plate as T. 

According to the problem, Mike's total bill was T (for the Taco Grande Plate) + $2 (for the salad) + $4 (for the cheesy fries) + $2 (for the diet cola). So, Mike's total bill was T + $8.

The problem also states that Mike's total bill was twice as large as John's bill. Since John only ordered the Taco Grande Plate, his bill was just T. Therefore, we can set up the equation T + $8 = 2T. 

Solving this equation for T, w...
