=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of roosters and hens:**
   - Mrs. Fredrickson has a total of 80 chickens.
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the chickens are roosters.
   - To find the number of roosters, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of roosters} = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20
     \]
   - The rest of the chickens are hens. To find the number of hens, we subtract the number of roosters from the total number of chickens:
     \[
     \text{Number of hens} = 80 - 20 = 60
     \]

2. **Determine how many hens lay eggs:**
   - The problem states that only three-fourths of the hens lay eggs.
   - To find the number of hens that lay eggs, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of hens that lay eggs} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 = 45
     \]

3. **Determine how many hens do not lay eggs:**
   - To find the number of hens that do not lay eggs, we subtract the number of hens that lay eggs from the total number of hens:
     \[
     \text{Number of hens that do not lay eggs} = 60 - 45 = 15
     \]

4. **Determine the total number of chickens that do not lay eggs:**
   - The only chickens that do not lay eggs are the hens that do not lay eggs and the roosters (since roosters do not lay eggs).
   - We already found that there are 15 hens that do not lay eggs, and we know there are 20 roosters.
   - Therefore, the total number of chickens that do not lay eggs is:
     \[
     \text{Total chickens that do not lay eggs} = 15 + 20 = 35
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The number of chickens that do not lay eggs is \( \boxed{35} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Mrs. Fredrickson has 80 chickens.
- 1/4 of the chickens are roosters.
- The remaining chickens are hens.
- Only three-fourths of the hens lay eggs.

Step 1: Calculate the number of roosters.
1/4 of 80 chickens = 80 × 1/4 = 20 roosters

Step 2: Calculate the number of hens.
Total chickens - Roosters = Hens
80 - 20 = 60 hens

Step 3: Calculate the number of hens that lay eggs.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of roosters:**

   Mrs. Fredrickson has a total of 80 chickens. According to the problem, 1/4 of these chickens are roosters.

   \[
   \text{Number of roosters} = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20
   \]

2. **Determine the number of hens:**

   Since the rest of the chickens are hens, we subtract the number of roosters from the total number of chickens to find the number of hens.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many roosters Mrs. Fredrickson has. Since 1/4 of her 80 chickens are roosters, we multiply 80 by 1/4:

80 * 1/4 = 20 roosters

Since roosters don't lay eggs, these 20 roosters are part of the chickens that do not lay eggs.

Next, let's find out how many hens Mrs. Fredrickson has. Since the rest of her chickens are hens, we subtract the number of roosters from the total number of chickens:

80 - 20 = 60 hens

Now, let's find out how many of these ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mrs. Fredrickson has a total of 80 chickens.
   * 1/4 of the chickens are roosters.
   * The remaining chickens are hens.
   * Only 3/4 of the hens lay eggs.

2. Calculate the number of roosters:
   * Number of roosters = 1/4 of total chickens
   * Number of roosters = 1/4 × 80
   * Number of roosters = 20

3. Calculate the number of hens:
   * Number of hens = Total c...
