=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine Maurice's current age based on the information given about Ron's age.

1. **Identify Ron's current age**: 
   - Ron's current age is given as 43 years.

2. **Determine Ron's age in five years**:
   - In five years, Ron's age will be:
     \[
     43 + 5 = 48 \text{ years}
     \]

3. **Set up the relationship between Ron's and Maurice's ages in five years**:
   - According to the problem, in five years, Ron will be four times as old as Maurice. Let's denote Maurice's current age as \( M \).
   - In five years, Maurice's age will be:
     \[
     M + 5
     \]
   - The relationship can be expressed as:
     \[
     48 = 4(M + 5)
     \]

4. **Solve the equation for \( M \)**:
   - First, expand the equation:
     \[
     48 = 4M + 20
     \]
   - Next, isolate \( 4M \) by subtracting 20 from both sides:
     \[
     48 - 20 = 4M
     \]
     \[
     28 = 4M
     \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( M \):
     \[
     M = \frac{28}{4} = 7
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Maurice's current age is \( 7 \) years.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find Maurice's current age based on the given information about Ron's age and the relationship between their ages.

Given information:
- After five years, Ron will be four times as old as Maurice.
- Ron's age now is 43.

Step 1: Find Ron's age after five years.
Ron's age after five years = Ron's current age + 5 years
Ron's age after five years = 43 + 5 = 48 years

Step 2: Find Maurice's age after five years.
Since aft...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine Maurice's current age given the information about Ron's age now and their ages in five years.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Ron's current age is 43 years.
   - After five years, Ron will be four times as old as Maurice.

2. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( M \) be Maurice's current age.

3. **Determine Ron's age in five years:**
   - Ron's current age is 43. In fiv...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote Maurice's current age as M. 

According to the problem, in five years, Ron will be four times as old as Maurice. We know that Ron is currently 43 years old, so in five years, he will be 43 + 5 = 48 years old.

This means that in five years, Maurice will be one-fourth of Ron's age, so we can write the equation: 

M + 5 = 48 / 4

Solving this equation gives us:

M + 5 = 12

To find Maurice's current age, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

M = 12 - ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find Maurice's current age, given Ron's current age and their ages in five years.

Given:
- After five years, Ron will be four times as old as Maurice.
- Ron's current age is 43.

Step 1: Let's express Ron's age in five years.
Ron's age in 5 years = Ron's current age + 5
Ron's age in 5 years = 43 + 5 = 48

Step 2: Express Maurice's age in five years in terms of his current age.
Maurice's age in...
