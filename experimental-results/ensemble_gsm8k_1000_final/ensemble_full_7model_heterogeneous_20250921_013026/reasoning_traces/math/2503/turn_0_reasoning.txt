=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of nephews Alden has now:**
   - We know that ten years ago, Alden had 50 nephews.
   - The problem states that this number is half of what Alden has now. 
   - Let \( x \) be the number of nephews Alden has now. According to the problem, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{x}{2} = 50
     \]
   - To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     x = 50 \times 2 = 100
     \]
   - Therefore, Alden has 100 nephews now.

2. **Determine the number of nephews Vihaan has:**
   - The problem states that Vihaan has 60 more nephews than Alden has now.
   - Since Alden has 100 nephews, we can express the number of nephews Vihaan has as:
     \[
     \text{Vihaan's nephews} = 100 + 60 = 160
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of nephews Alden and Vihaan have together:**
   - To find the total number of nephews, we add the number of nephews Alden has to the number of nephews Vihaan has:
     \[
     \text{Total nephews} = \text{Alden's nephews} + \text{Vihaan's nephews} = 100 + 160 = 260
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of nephews that Alden and Vihaan have altogether is:
     \[
     \boxed{260}
     \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Alden had 50 nephews ten years ago.
- The number of nephews Alden has now is twice the number he had ten years ago.
- Vihaan has 60 more nephews than Alden has now.

Step 1: Find the number of nephews Alden has now.
Alden's nephews ten years ago = 50
Alden's nephews now = 2 × 50 = 100

Step 2: Find the number of nephews Vihaan has now.
Vihaan's nephews = Alden's nephews now + 60
V...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the current number of nephews Alden and Vihaan have and then find their total.

**Step 1: Determine Alden's current number of nephews.**

We know that ten years ago, Alden had 50 nephews. According to the problem, this number is half the number of nephews Alden has now. Let's denote the current number of nephews Alden has as \( A \).

The relationship given is:
\[
\frac{A}{2} = 50
\]

To find \( A \), we multiply both sides of ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by finding out how many nephews Alden has now. 

Ten years ago, Alden had 50 nephews. According to the problem, this is half the number of nephews he has now. To find the current number of nephews, we multiply the number of nephews he had ten years ago by 2. 

50 nephews * 2 = 100 nephews

So, Alden has 100 nephews now.

The problem also tells us that Vihaan has 60 more nephews than Alden now. To find out how many nephews Vihaan has, we add 60 to the number of...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Ten years ago, Alden had 50 nephews.
   * The number of nephews Alden had ten years ago is half the number he has now.
   * Vihaan has 60 more nephews than Alden has now.

2. Find the number of nephews Alden has now:
   * Alden's nephews now = 50 × 2 (because 50 is half the number he has now)
   * Alden's nephews now = 100

3. Find the number of nephews Vihaan ha...
