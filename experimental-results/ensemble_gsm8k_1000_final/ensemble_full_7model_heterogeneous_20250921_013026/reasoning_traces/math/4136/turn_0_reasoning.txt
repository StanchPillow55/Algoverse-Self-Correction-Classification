=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many more pounds of groceries Mary can fit in her bag, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the groceries Mary has bought.**
   - Mary buys:
     - 4 pounds of green beans
     - 6 pounds of milk
     - Twice the amount of carrots as green beans

   First, we calculate the weight of the carrots:
   \[
   \text{Weight of carrots} = 2 \times \text{Weight of green beans} = 2 \times 4 \text{ pounds} = 8 \text{ pounds}
   \]

   Now, we can find the total weight of all the groceries:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of green beans} + \text{Weight of milk} + \text{Weight of carrots}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 4 \text{ pounds} + 6 \text{ pounds} + 8 \text{ pounds} = 18 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine the maximum capacity of the grocery bag.**
   - The maximum capacity of the grocery bag is 20 pounds.

3. **Calculate how much more weight can fit in the bag.**
   - We find the remaining capacity in the bag by subtracting the total weight of the groceries from the maximum capacity:
   \[
   \text{Remaining capacity} = \text{Maximum capacity} - \text{Total weight}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining capacity} = 20 \text{ pounds} - 18 \text{ pounds} = 2 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Mary can fit **2 more pounds** of groceries in her bag.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The plastic grocery bag can hold a maximum of 20 pounds.
- Mary buys 4 pounds of green beans.
- Mary buys 6 pounds of milk.
- Mary buys twice the amount of carrots as green beans.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of carrots Mary bought.
Amount of carrots = 2 × Amount of green beans
Amount of carrots = 2 × 4 pounds = 8 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of groceries Mary bough...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weight of the groceries Mary has and then find out how much more weight can be added to the bag without exceeding its 20-pound capacity.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the weight of each item:**
   - Green beans: 4 pounds
   - Milk: 6 pounds
   - Carrots: Twice the amount of green beans

2. **Calculate the weight of the carrots:**
   - Since the carrots weigh twice as much as the green bean...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many pounds of carrots Mary bought. Since she bought twice the amount of carrots as green beans, and she bought 4 pounds of green beans, she bought 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 pounds of carrots.

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of groceries Mary has bought in total. To do this, we add the weight of the green beans, milk, and carrots together. This gives us 4 + 6 + 8 = <<4+6+8=18>>18 pounds.

Finally, we need to find out how many more pounds...
