=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times Camden and Susannah swam per week and then find the difference between the two.

1. **Calculate Camden's weekly swimming frequency:**
   - Camden swam a total of 16 times in March.
   - March has 4 weeks.
   - To find out how many times Camden swam per week, we divide the total number of swims by the number of weeks:
     \[
     \text{Camden's swims per week} = \frac{16 \text{ swims}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 4 \text{ swims per week}
     \]

2. **Calculate Susannah's weekly swimming frequency:**
   - Susannah swam a total of 24 times in March.
   - Again, we divide the total number of swims by the number of weeks:
     \[
     \text{Susannah's swims per week} = \frac{24 \text{ swims}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 6 \text{ swims per week}
     \]

3. **Determine how many more times a week Susannah swam than Camden:**
   - We subtract Camden's weekly swims from Susannah's weekly swims:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Susannah's swims per week} - \text{Camden's swims per week} = 6 - 4 = 2
     \]

Thus, Susannah swam 2 more times per week than Camden.

**Final Answer:**
Susannah swam 2 more times a week than Camden.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Camden went swimming 16 times in March.
- Susannah went swimming 24 times in March.
- The number of times they went swimming was divided equally among 4 weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of times they went swimming in March.
Total times they went swimming = Camden's times + Susannah's times
Total times they went swimming = 16 + 24 = 40 times

Step 2: Calculate the number ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times Camden and Susannah each swam per week, and then find the difference between their weekly swimming frequencies.

First, let's calculate the number of times Camden swam per week:

1. Camden swam a total of 16 times in March.
2. March typically has 4 weeks (since we are dividing the total by 4 weeks as stated in the problem).
3. To find the number of times Camden swam per week, we divide the total number of times b...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many times each person swam per week. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide the total number of times each person went swimming by 4. 

For Camden:
16 times / 4 weeks = 4 times per week

For Susannah:
24 times / 4 weeks = 6 times per week

To find out how many more times a week Susannah swam than Camden, we subtract the number of times Camden swam from the number of times Susannah swam.

6 times per week (Susannah) - 4 times per we...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Camden went swimming 16 times in March.
   * Susannah went swimming 24 times in March.
   * The number of times they went swimming was divided equally among 4 weeks.

2. Calculate the number of times Camden went swimming per week:
   * Camden's total swims = 16
   * Number of weeks = 4
   * Camden's swims per week = 16 รท 4 = 4
   So, Camden went swimming 4 times ...
