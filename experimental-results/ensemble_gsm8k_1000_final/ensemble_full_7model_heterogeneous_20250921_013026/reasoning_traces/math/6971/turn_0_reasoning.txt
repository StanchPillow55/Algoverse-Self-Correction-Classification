=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will define variables for the number of each type of card and then use the information given to set up equations.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( H \) be the number of hockey cards.
   - Let \( F \) be the number of football cards.
   - Let \( B \) be the number of baseball cards.

2. **Use the information given:**
   - We know that there are 200 hockey cards:
     \[
     H = 200
     \]

   - The problem states that there are 4 times as many football cards as hockey cards:
     \[
     F = 4H
     \]
     Substituting \( H = 200 \):
     \[
     F = 4 \times 200 = 800
     \]

   - The problem also states that there are 50 fewer baseball cards than football cards:
     \[
     B = F - 50
     \]
     Substituting \( F = 800 \):
     \[
     B = 800 - 50 = 750
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   The total number of cards \( T \) is the sum of hockey cards, football cards, and baseball cards:
   \[
   T = H + F + B
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   T = 200 + 800 + 750
   \]
   Now, we perform the addition:
   \[
   T = 200 + 800 = 1000
   \]
   \[
   T = 1000 + 750 = 1750
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   The total number of cards in the bag is:
   \[
   \boxed{1750}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The bag contains 50 fewer baseball cards than football cards.
- There are 4 times as many football cards as hockey cards.
- There are 200 hockey cards in the bag.

Step 1: Find the number of football cards in the bag.
Since there are 4 times as many football cards as hockey cards, we can use the following equation:
Number of football cards = 4 × Number of hockey cards
Number of fo...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of card in the bag and then sum them up to find the total number of cards.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( h \) represent the number of hockey cards.
- Let \( f \) represent the number of football cards.
- Let \( b \) represent the number of baseball cards.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. There are 200 hockey cards: \( h = 200 \).
2. There are 4 times as many football cards...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that there are 200 hockey cards in the bag.

Second, we know that there are 4 times as many football cards as hockey cards. Since there are 200 hockey cards, we can multiply 200 by 4 to find the number of football cards. 

200 hockey cards * 4 = 800 football cards

Third, we know that there are 50 fewer baseball cards than football cards. Since there are 800 football cards, we can subtract 50 from 800 to find the ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 200 hockey cards in the bag.
   * There are 4 times as many football cards as hockey cards.
   * The bag contains 50 fewer baseball cards than football cards.

2. Calculate the number of football cards:
   * Football cards = 4 × Hockey cards
   * Football cards = 4 × 200
   * Football cards = 800

3. Calculate the number of baseball cards:
   * Baseball cards...
