=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we start by determining how many of the contestants are female.

1. **Identify the total number of contestants**: 
   The problem states that there are 18 contestants in total.

2. **Determine the fraction of contestants that are female**: 
   According to the problem, a third of the contestants are female. This can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   \text{Number of female contestants} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total contestants}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of female contestants**:
   \[
   \text{Number of female contestants} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
   \]

4. **Determine the number of male contestants**: 
   Since the rest of the contestants are male, we can find the number of male contestants by subtracting the number of female contestants from the total number of contestants:
   \[
   \text{Number of male contestants} = \text{Total contestants} - \text{Number of female contestants}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of male contestants} = 18 - 6 = 12
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the number of male contestants is:
   \[
   \boxed{12}
   \]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many contestants are female. Since a third of the contestants are female, we divide the total number of contestants by 3. 

18 ÷ 3 = 6

So, there are 6 female contestants.

Next, we need to find out how many contestants are male. Since the rest of the contestants are male, we subtract the number of female contestants from the total number of contestants.

18 - 6 = 12

So, there are 12 male contestants.

Therefore, the number of male contesta...
