=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of red beans**:
   Susie has a total of 572 beans. One-fourth of these beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red beans} = \frac{1}{4} \times 572 = \frac{572}{4} = 143
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining beans after removing the red beans**:
   To find the remaining beans after accounting for the red beans, we subtract the number of red beans from the total number of beans.
   \[
   \text{Remaining beans} = 572 - 143 = 429
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of white beans**:
   One-third of the remaining beans are white.
   \[
   \text{Number of white beans} = \frac{1}{3} \times 429 = \frac{429}{3} = 143
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining beans after removing the white beans**:
   Now we subtract the number of white beans from the remaining beans.
   \[
   \text{Remaining beans} = 429 - 143 = 286
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of green beans**:
   Half of the remaining beans are green.
   \[
   \text{Number of green beans} = \frac{1}{2} \times 286 = \frac{286}{2} = 143
   \]

Now, we have completed all the calculations. The number of green beans is:

\[
\boxed{143}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Susie has 572 beans in the jar.
- One-fourth of the beans are red.
- One-third of the remaining beans are white.
- Half of the remaining beans are green.

Step 1: Calculate the number of red beans.
One-fourth of 572 beans = 572 รท 4 = 143 red beans

Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining beans after removing the red beans.
Remaining beans = 572 - 143 = 429 beans

Step 3: Calculate the number...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many green beans are in the jar after accounting for the red and white beans. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of red beans:**
   Susie has a total of 572 beans in the jar. One-fourth of these beans are red.

   \[
   \text{Number of red beans} = \frac{1}{4} \times 572 = \frac{572}{4} = 143
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining beans after removing the red beans:**
   Subtract the number o...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many beans are red. Since one-fourth of the beans are red, we multiply 572 by 1/4:

572 * 1/4 = 143 beans

So, 143 beans are red.

Next, we subtract the number of red beans from the total number of beans to find out how many beans are not red:

572 - 143 = 429 beans

So, 429 beans are not red.

Then, we find out how many of these beans are white. Since one-third of the remaining beans are white, we multiply 429 by 1/3:

429 * 1/3 = 143 beans...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start with the total number of beans and work our way through the different colors.

Given:
- Susie has 572 beans in the jar.
- 1/4 of the beans are red.
- 1/3 of the remaining beans (after removing red) are white.
- 1/2 of the remaining beans (after removing red and white) are green.

Step 1: Calculate the number of red beans.
Red beans = 1/4 ร 572
Red beans = 143

Step 2: Calculate the number of bean...
