=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Gabby needs to buy the makeup set, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total cost of the makeup set**: 
   The makeup set costs $65.

2. **Determine how much money Gabby currently has**:
   Gabby already has $35.

3. **Calculate the additional money Gabby receives from her mom**:
   Gabby’s mom gives her an additional $20.

4. **Calculate Gabby's total amount of money after receiving the gift from her mom**:
   We add the money Gabby already has to the money her mom gave her:
   \[
   \text{Total money Gabby has} = \text{Money she has} + \text{Money from mom}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total money Gabby has} = 35 + 20 = 55
   \]

5. **Determine how much more money Gabby needs to buy the makeup set**:
   We subtract the total amount of money Gabby has from the cost of the makeup set:
   \[
   \text{Money needed} = \text{Cost of makeup set} - \text{Total money Gabby has}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Money needed} = 65 - 55 = 10
   \]

Thus, Gabby needs an additional $10 to buy the makeup set.

**Final answer**: Gabby needs $10.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Gabby initially has $35 and her mom gives her an additional $20. We add these two amounts together to find out how much money Gabby has in total.

$35 (Gabby's initial amount) + $20 (amount given by her mom) = $55

Now, we know that the makeup set costs $65. To find out how much more money Gabby needs, we subtract the total amount of money she currently has from the cost of the makeup set.

$65 (cost of the makeup set) - $55 (Gabby's total amount) = $10

So, Gabby needs $...
