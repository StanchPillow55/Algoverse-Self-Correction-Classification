=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to distribute the gold, silver, and bronze coins across the 5 chests and then calculate the total number of coins in each chest.

### Step 1: Distributing the Gold Coins
The pirate has a total of 3500 gold coins. He wants to distribute these equally across 5 chests.

To find out how many gold coins go into each chest, we perform the following calculation:

\[
\text{Gold coins per chest} = \frac{\text{Total gold coins}}{\text{Number of chests}} = \frac{3500}{5}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{3500}{5} = 700
\]

So, each chest will contain **700 gold coins**.

### Step 2: Distributing the Silver Coins
Next, the pirate has a total of 500 silver coins. He will also distribute these equally across the 5 chests.

To find out how many silver coins go into each chest, we perform the following calculation:

\[
\text{Silver coins per chest} = \frac{\text{Total silver coins}}{\text{Number of chests}} = \frac{500}{5}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{500}{5} = 100
\]

So, each chest will contain **100 silver coins**.

### Step 3: Distributing the Bronze Coins
The pirate will put twice as many bronze coins as silver coins. Since we found that there are 500 silver coins in total, we can calculate the total number of bronze coins:

\[
\text{Total bronze coins} = 2 \times \text{Total silver coins} = 2 \times 500 = 1000
\]

Now, we need to distribute these 1000 bronze coins equally across the 5 chests.

To find out how many bronze coins go into each chest, we perform the following calculation:

\[
\text{Bronze coins per chest} = \frac{\text{Total bronze coins}}{\text{Number of chests}} = \frac{1000}{5}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{1000}{5} = 200
\]

So, each chest will contain **200 bronze coins**.

### Step 4: Calculating the Total Coins in Each Chest
Now that we have the number of each type of coin per chest, we can calculate the total number of coins in each chest by adding the number of gold, silver, and bronze coins together:

\[
\text{Total coins per chest} = \text{Gold coins per chest} + \text{Silver coins per chest} + \text{Bronze coins per chest}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total coins per chest} = 700 + 100 + 200
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
700 + 100 + 200 = 1000
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of coins in each chest is **1000 coins**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of coins of each type (gold, silver, and bronze) in each chest.

Given information:
- The pirate has 3500 gold coins.
- The pirate wants to spread the gold coins equally across 5 chests.
- The pirate has 500 silver coins.
- The pirate has twice as many bronze coins as silver coins.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many coins in total will be in each chest after distributing the gold, silver, and bronze coins equally.

### Step 1: Distribute the Gold Coins

The pirate has 3500 gold coins and wants to distribute them equally across 5 chests. To find out how many gold coins go into each chest, we divide the total number of gold coins by the number of chests:

\[
\text{Gold coins per chest} = \frac{3500}{5} = 700
\]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's start with the gold coins. The pirate has 3500 gold coins and he wants to distribute them equally across 5 chests. To find out how many gold coins will be in each chest, we divide the total number of gold coins by the number of chests:

3500 gold coins รท 5 chests = 700 gold coins per chest

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. Distribute the gold coins:
   * The pirate has 3500 gold coins.
   * He wants to spread them equally across 5 chests.
   * To find the number of gold coins per chest, we divide the total by the number of chests:
     3500 gold coins รท 5 chests = 700 gold coins per chest

2. Distribute the silver coins:
   * The pirate has a total of 500 silver coins.
   * These will also be distributed equally acros...
