=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money David has left after buying 16 bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the bolts**: 
   Each bolt costs $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. We can find the total cost by multiplying the cost of one bolt by the number of bolts:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of bolts} \times \text{Cost per bolt}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 16 \times 0.03
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   16 \times 0.03 = 0.48
   \]

   So, the total cost for 16 bolts is $0.48.

2. **Calculate the remaining money after the purchase**:
   David starts with $12.48. To find out how much money he has left after buying the bolts, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount he initially has:

   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 12.48 - 0.48
   \]

   Now, we perform the subtraction:

   \[
   12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   After purchasing the bolts, David has $12.00 left.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12.00}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- David has $12.48
- He wants to buy 16 bolts
- Each bolt costs $0.03

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 16 bolts.
Cost per bolt = $0.03
Total cost of 16 bolts = 16 × $0.03 = $0.48

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money David has left after paying for the bolts.
David's initial amount = $12.48
Total cost of bolts = $0.48
Amount of money left = $12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

Therefore, David has ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the 16 bolts and then subtract that cost from the amount of money David initially has.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the bolts.**

Each bolt costs $0.03. David wants to buy 16 bolts. To find the total cost, we multiply the cost per bolt by the number of bolts:

\[
\text{Total cost of bolts} = \text{Cost per bolt} \times \text{Number of bolts} = 0.03 \times 16
\]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much the total cost of the bolts is. 

To do this, we multiply the cost of one bolt by the number of bolts David wants to buy. 

So, $0.03 * 16 = $0.48

This means that the total cost of the bolts is $0.48.

Next, we need to find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts. 

To do this, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has. 

So, $12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

Therefore, David has $12.00 left aft...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * David has $12.48.
   * He wants to buy 16 bolts.
   * Each bolt costs $0.03.

2. Calculate the total cost of the bolts:
   * Cost per bolt = $0.03
   * Number of bolts = 16
   * Total cost = Cost per bolt × Number of bolts
   * Total cost = $0.03 × 16
   * Total cost = $0.48

3. Calculate the money David has left after paying for the bolts:
   * David's initial amount ...
