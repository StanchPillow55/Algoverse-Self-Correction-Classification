=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the difference between the number of words Cameron could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of words typed before the injury.**
   - Cameron's typing speed before the injury was 10 words per minute.
   - To find out how many words he could type in 5 minutes, we multiply his typing speed by the time:
     \[
     \text{Words before} = \text{Typing speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{words/minute} \times 5 \, \text{minutes} = 50 \, \text{words}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of words typed after the injury.**
   - After breaking his arm, Cameron's typing speed decreased to 8 words per minute.
   - Again, we multiply his new typing speed by the same time period:
     \[
     \text{Words after} = \text{Typing speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{words/minute} \times 5 \, \text{minutes} = 40 \, \text{words}
     \]

3. **Find the difference in the number of words typed before and after the injury.**
   - We subtract the number of words typed after the injury from the number of words typed before the injury:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Words before} - \text{Words after} = 50 \, \text{words} - 40 \, \text{words} = 10 \, \text{words}
     \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   - The difference between the number of words Cameron could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm is:
     \[
     \boxed{10} \, \text{words}
     \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Before breaking his right arm, Cameron could type 10 words per minute on his phone.
- After breaking his right arm, Cameron could only type 8 words per minute using his left hand.
- We need to find the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after breaking his arm.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of words Cameron could type in 5 minutes before he broke his arm and compare it to the number of words he could type in 5 minutes after he broke his arm. We will then find the difference between these two amounts.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of words typed before the injury.**

Before Cameron broke his arm, he could type 10 words per minute. To find out how many words he could type in 5 minutes, we multiply the n...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Before Cameron broke his arm, he could type 10 words per minute. So, in 5 minutes, he could type:

10 words/minute * 5 minutes = 50 words

After he broke his arm, he could only type 8 words per minute. So, in 5 minutes, he could type:

8 words/minute * 5 minutes = 40 words

The difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm is:

50 words - 40 words = 10 words

So, Cameron could type 10 fewer words in 5 minutes after he ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Before breaking his arm, Cameron could type 10 words per minute.
   * After breaking his arm, Cameron could type 8 words per minute.
   * We need to find the difference in the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after breaking his arm.

2. Calculate the number of words Cameron could type in 5 minutes before breaking his arm:
   * Words per minut...
