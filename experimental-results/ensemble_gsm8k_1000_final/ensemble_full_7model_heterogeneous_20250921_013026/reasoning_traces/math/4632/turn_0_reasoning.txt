=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much each person should pay in tips if they want to split a 20% tip for the total meal evenly.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the meal
First, we need to find the total amount spent on food by Julie, Letitia, and Anton.

- Julie's order: $10
- Letitia's order: $20
- Anton's order: $30

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total cost of the meal:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Julie's order} + \text{Letitia's order} + \text{Antonâ€™s order}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 20 + 30 = 60
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total tip amount
Next, we need to calculate the tip amount, which is 20% of the total cost of the meal. To find 20% of the total cost, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Tip} = \text{Total cost} \times \text{Tip percentage}
\]
\[
\text{Tip} = 60 \times 0.20 = 12
\]

### Step 3: Split the tip evenly among the three people
Now that we have the total tip amount, we need to divide this amount evenly among Julie, Letitia, and Anton. Since there are three people, we divide the total tip by 3:

\[
\text{Tip per person} = \frac{\text{Total tip}}{3}
\]
\[
\text{Tip per person} = \frac{12}{3} = 4
\]

### Final Answer
Each person should pay **$4** in tips.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the meal.
2. Calculate the total tip amount.
3. Calculate the amount each person should pay for the tip.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the meal.
Julie's order: $10
Letitia's order: $20
Anton's order: $30
Total cost of the meal = $10 + $20 + $30 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the total tip amount.
The tip is 20% of the total cost of the meal.
Total tip amount = 20% o...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total tip for the meal and then determine how much each person should pay if they split the tip evenly.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost of the Meal
First, we need to find the total cost of the food ordered by Julie, Letitia, and Anton.

- Julie's order: $10
- Letitia's order: $20
- Anton's order: $30

The total cost of the meal is the sum of all their orders:
\[ 
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find the total cost of the meal. We do this by adding together the cost of each person's order:

$10 (Julie's order) + $20 (Letitia's order) + $30 (Anton's order) = $60

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of the tip. We do this by multiplying the total cost of the meal by the tip percentage:

$60 * 20% = $12

Finally, we need to divide the total tip amount by the number of people (3) to find out how much each person should contribute to the tip:...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Julie ordered $10 worth of food
   * Letitia ordered $20 worth of food
   * Anton ordered $30 worth of food
   * They want to split a 20% tip for the whole meal evenly

2. Calculate the total cost of the meal:
   * Total cost = Julie's order + Letitia's order + Anton's order
   * Total cost = $10 + $20 + $30
   * Total cost = $60

3. Calculate the total tip amount:
