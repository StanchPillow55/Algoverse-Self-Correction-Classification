=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many fried chickens Steph can make, we first need to calculate the number of breast parts she has.

1. **Identify the number of drumsticks and breast parts:**
   - Steph bought 24 pieces of drumsticks.
   - She bought 4 fewer breast parts than drumsticks.

2. **Calculate the number of breast parts:**
   \[
   \text{Number of breast parts} = \text{Number of drumsticks} - 4
   \]
   Substituting the number of drumsticks:
   \[
   \text{Number of breast parts} = 24 - 4 = 20
   \]

3. **Determine how many complete fried chickens can be made:**
   A complete fried chicken typically consists of 1 drumstick and 1 breast part. Therefore, the number of complete fried chickens that can be made is limited by the smaller quantity of either drumsticks or breast parts.

4. **Compare the quantities:**
   - Drumsticks: 24
   - Breast parts: 20

5. **Calculate the number of complete fried chickens:**
   Since each fried chicken requires one drumstick and one breast part, the number of complete fried chickens is determined by the smaller quantity, which is the number of breast parts:
   \[
   \text{Number of complete fried chickens} = \min(\text{Number of drumsticks}, \text{Number of breast parts}) = \min(24, 20) = 20
   \]

Thus, Steph can make a total of **20 fried chickens**.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of chicken pieces Steph has and then determine how many fried chickens she can make.

Given information:
- Steph bought 24 pieces of drumstick.
- Steph bought 4 fewer breast parts than drumstick.

Step 1: Find the number of breast parts Steph bought.
Number of breast parts = Number of drumstick - 4
Number of breast parts = 24 - 4 = 20 breast parts

Step 2: Find the total number of chicken pieces ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many fried chickens Steph can make given the number of drumsticks and breast parts she has.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Number of Drumsticks:**
   - Steph bought 24 pieces of drumsticks.

2. **Determine the Number of Breast Parts:**
   - Steph bought 4 fewer breast parts than drumsticks.
   - Therefore, the number of breast parts is \( 24 - 4 = 20 \).

3. **Understand the Composition of a Whole Chicken:**...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Steph bought 24 pieces of drumstick. The problem states that she bought 4 fewer breast parts than drumsticks. 

To find out how many breast parts she bought, we subtract 4 from the number of drumsticks:

24 drumsticks - 4 = 20 breast parts

So, Steph bought 20 breast parts.

To find out the total number of fried chickens Steph can make, we add the number of drumsticks and breast parts together:

24 drumsticks + 20 breast parts = 44 fried chickens

So, Steph can make 44 fr...
