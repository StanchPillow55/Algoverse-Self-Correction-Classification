=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the original price of the iPhone cases, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the discount**: The problem states that if you buy more than fifteen units, you can lower the price by 20%. This means that the price you pay for each unit when buying 18 units is 80% of the original price.

2. **Define variables**:
   - Let \( P \) be the original price of one iPhone case.
   - Since you get a 20% discount, the price you pay per unit when buying more than fifteen units is \( 0.8P \).

3. **Calculate the total cost for 18 units**:
   - If you buy 18 units at the discounted price, the total cost can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Units} \times \text{Discounted Price per Unit}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   500 = 18 \times (0.8P)
   \]

4. **Solve for \( P \)**:
   - First, simplify the equation:
   \[
   500 = 18 \times 0.8P
   \]
   \[
   500 = 14.4P
   \]
   - Now, to find \( P \), divide both sides by 14.4:
   \[
   P = \frac{500}{14.4}
   \]

5. **Calculate \( P \)**:
   - Performing the division:
   \[
   P = \frac{500}{14.4} \approx 34.72
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   - The original price of one iPhone case is approximately \( \boxed{34.72} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the original price of the iPhone cases before the 20% discount.

Given information:
- The price can be lowered by 20% if you buy more than fifteen units.
- You paid $500 to buy 18 units.

Step 1: Calculate the discounted price per unit.
Discounted price per unit = Total cost / Number of units
Discounted price per unit = $500 / 18 = $27.78

Step 2: Calculate the original price per unit before the 20% discount.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the original price of one iPhone case before the 20% discount is applied. We know that the total cost for 18 units after the discount is $500.

Let's denote the original price of one iPhone case as \( P \).

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Discount:**
   - A 20% discount means that the price is reduced by 20% of the original price.
   - Therefore, the price after the discount is 80% of the original price.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that the price paid, $500, is after a 20% discount was applied because more than 15 units were purchased. To find the original price, we need to reverse the discount.

Let's denote the original price as X. 

Since a 20% discount was applied, it means you paid 80% of the original price. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

0.80 * X = $500

To find the original price (X), we need to divide $500 by 0.80:

X = $500 / 0.80
X = $625

So, the orig...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find the original price of the iPhone cases before the 20% discount was applied.

Given:
- If you buy more than 15 units, you get a 20% discount.
- You paid $500 for 18 units.

Step 1: Let's find the discounted price per unit.
Total price = Number of units × Price per unit
$500 = 18 × Price per unit
Price per unit = $500 ÷ 18
Price per unit ≈ $27.78 (rounded to the nearest cent)

Step 2: Now, w...
