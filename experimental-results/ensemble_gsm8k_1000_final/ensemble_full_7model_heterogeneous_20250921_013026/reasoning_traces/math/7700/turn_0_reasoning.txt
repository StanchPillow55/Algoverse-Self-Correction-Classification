=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much Chad owes after ordering his burrito and using his gift card, we will break down the costs step by step.

1. **Base Burrito Cost**: 
   The cost of the base burrito is $6.50.

2. **Add-Ons**:
   - Extra meat: $2.00
   - Extra cheese: $1.00
   - Avocado: $1.00
   - 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so for 2 sauces: 
     \[
     2 \times 0.25 = 0.50
     \]

3. **Total Cost of Add-Ons**:
   Now, we will sum up the costs of the add-ons:
   \[
   \text{Total Add-Ons} = 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 4.50
   \]

4. **Total Cost of Burrito with Add-Ons**:
   Now we add the cost of the base burrito to the total cost of the add-ons:
   \[
   \text{Total Burrito Cost} = 6.50 + 4.50 = 11.00
   \]

5. **Upgrade Cost**:
   Chad decides to upgrade his meal for an extra $3.00. We add this to the total burrito cost:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost with Upgrade} = 11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00
   \]

6. **Gift Card**:
   Chad has a gift card for $5.00 that he uses at checkout. We subtract the gift card amount from the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Amount Owed} = 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00
   \]

Thus, after calculating all the costs and applying the gift card, Chad still owes **$9.00**.

**Final Answer**: Chad owes $9.00.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total cost of the burrito with all the extras Chad added. 

The base burrito costs $6.50. 

He added extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each. 

So, the cost of the extras is $2.00 (meat) + $1.00 (cheese) + $1.00 (avocado) + 2*$0.25 (sauces) = $4.50. 

Adding this to the cost of the base burrito, we get $6.50 (base burrito) + $4.50 (extras) = $11.00. 

Then, Chad decides to upgrade his mea...
