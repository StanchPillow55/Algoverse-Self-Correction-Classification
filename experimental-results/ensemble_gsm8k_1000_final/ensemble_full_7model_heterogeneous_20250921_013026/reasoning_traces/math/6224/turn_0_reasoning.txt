=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find Eliza's height, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total height of all siblings**: We know that the total height of all 5 siblings combined is 330 inches.

2. **Determine the heights of the known siblings**:
   - Two siblings are both 66 inches tall.
   - One sibling is 60 inches tall.

3. **Calculate the total height of the known siblings**:
   \[
   \text{Total height of known siblings} = 66 + 66 + 60
   \]
   \[
   = 132 + 60 = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Calculate the height of the last sibling**:
   Since the total height of all siblings is 330 inches, we can find the height of the last sibling by subtracting the total height of the known siblings from the total height:
   \[
   \text{Height of the last sibling} = 330 - 192
   \]
   \[
   = 138 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Determine Eliza's height**:
   We know that Eliza is 2 inches shorter than the last sibling. Therefore, we can calculate Eliza's height as follows:
   \[
   \text{Eliza's height} = \text{Height of the last sibling} - 2
   \]
   \[
   = 138 - 2 = 136 \text{ inches}
   \]

Thus, Eliza's height is \( \boxed{136} \) inches.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Eliza has 4 siblings, for a total of 5 siblings.
- The total height of all 5 siblings combined is 330 inches.
- Two of her siblings are both 66 inches tall.
- Another sibling is 60 inches tall.
- Eliza is 2 inches shorter than the last sibling.

Step 1: Calculate the total height of the three siblings whose heights are given.
Height of two siblings at 66 inches each = 66 inches + 66 inche...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the height of Eliza given the heights of her siblings and the total height of all siblings combined.

Let's break down the information provided:

1. There are 5 siblings in total, including Eliza.
2. The total height of all 5 siblings is 330 inches.
3. Two siblings are each 66 inches tall.
4. Another sibling is 60 inches tall.
5. Eliza is 2 inches shorter than the last sibling.

Let's denote the height of the last sibling as \(...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out the total height of the three siblings whose heights are given. 

Two siblings are 66 inches tall, so their combined height is 2 * 66 = 132 inches. 

Adding the height of the third sibling, who is 60 inches tall, we get 132 + 60 = 192 inches. 

We know that the total height of all 5 siblings is 330 inches. So, the combined height of Eliza and the last sibling is 330 - 192 = 138 inches.

We're told that Eliza is 2 inches shorter than the last sib...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Eliza has 4 siblings, so there are 5 siblings in total.
   * The total height of all 5 siblings combined is 330 inches.
   * Two of her siblings are both 66 inches tall.
   * Another sibling is 60 inches tall.
   * Eliza is 2 inches shorter than the last sibling.

2. Calculate the total height of the siblings with known heights:
   * Two siblings are 66 inches tall ...
