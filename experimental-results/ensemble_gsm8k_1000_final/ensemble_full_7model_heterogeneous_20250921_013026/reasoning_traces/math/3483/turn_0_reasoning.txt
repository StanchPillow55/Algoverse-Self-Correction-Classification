Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of households Mark visits.**
   - Mark visits 20 households each day for 5 days.
   - Total households visited = Number of households per day × Number of days
   \[
   \text{Total households} = 20 \text{ households/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ households}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many households gave him money.**
   - According to the problem, half of the households he visits give him a pair of $20 bills.
   - Number of households that gave money = Total households ÷ 2
   \[
   \text{Households that gave money} = \frac{100 \text{ households}}{2} = 50 \text{ households}
   \]

3. **Determine how much money he collected from those households.**
   - Each of the households that gave money gave him a pair of $20 bills. A pair means 2 bills.
   - The total amount collected from one household is:
   \[
   \text{Amount from one household} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Now, we calculate the total amount collected from all households that gave money:
   \[
   \text{Total amount collected} = \text{Households that gave money} \times \text{Amount from one household}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount collected} = 50 \text{ households} \times 40 \text{ dollars/household} = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   - Therefore, the total amount Mark collected is:
   \[
   \boxed{2000} \text{ dollars}
   \]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total number of households Mark visits in 5 days. He visits 20 households a day, so over 5 days, he visits 20 households/day * 5 days = 100 households.

Half of these households give him a pair of 20s. So, the number of households that give him money is 100 households / 2 = 50 households.

Each of these households gives him a pair of 20s, which means they each give him 20 dollars * 2 = 40 dollars.

So, the total amount of money Mark collects is ...
