=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many hours John volunteers at the shelter per year, we can break the problem down into a few simple steps.

1. **Identify the frequency of volunteering**: John volunteers twice a month.

2. **Determine the duration of each volunteering session**: Each time he volunteers, he spends 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the total hours volunteered per month**:
   - Since John volunteers twice a month and each session is 3 hours, we can calculate the total hours per month as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total hours per month} = \text{Number of sessions per month} \times \text{Hours per session}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total hours per month} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total hours volunteered per year**:
   - There are 12 months in a year, so we can calculate the total hours volunteered in a year by multiplying the total hours per month by the number of months in a year:
   \[
   \text{Total hours per year} = \text{Total hours per month} \times \text{Number of months in a year}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total hours per year} = 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, John volunteers a total of **72 hours per year**.

Final answer: **72 hours**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of hours John volunteers per year.

Given information:
- John volunteers at a shelter twice a month.
- Each volunteer session lasts 3 hours.

Step 1: Find the total number of hours John volunteers per month.
Number of volunteer sessions per month × Duration of each session = Total hours per month
2 × 3 hours = 6 hours per month

Step 2: Find the total number of hours John volunteers per year.
Tot...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of determining how many hours John volunteers per year, we need to break down the information given and perform some calculations step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the Number of Volunteering Sessions per Year

John volunteers twice a month. To find out how many times he volunteers in a year, we need to consider the number of months in a year:

- There are 12 months in a year.

Since John volunteers twice each month, we calculate the total number o...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): John volunteers twice a month, so in a year (which has 12 months), he volunteers:

2 times/month * 12 months/year = 24 times/year

Each time he volunteers, he does so for 3 hours. Therefore, in a year, he volunteers for:

24 times/year * 3 hours/time = 72 hours/year

So, John volunteers for 72 hours per year.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * John volunteers at a shelter twice a month.
   * Each time he volunteers, he spends 3 hours.

2. Calculate the total number of hours John volunteers per month:
   * Hours per visit = 3
   * Visits per month = 2
   * Hours per month = Hours per visit × Visits per month
   * Hours per month = 3 × 2 = 6 hours

3. Calculate the total number of hours John volunteers per yea...
