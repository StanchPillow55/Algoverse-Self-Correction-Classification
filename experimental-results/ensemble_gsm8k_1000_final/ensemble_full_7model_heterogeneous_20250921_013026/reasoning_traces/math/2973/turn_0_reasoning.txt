=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many stuffies Jean keeps:**
   Jean has a total of 60 stuffies. She keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of them.

   \[
   \text{Stuffies kept} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]

2. **Calculate how many stuffies Jean gives away:**
   To find out how many stuffies she gives away, we subtract the number of stuffies she keeps from the total number of stuffies.

   \[
   \text{Stuffies given away} = 60 - 20 = 40
   \]

3. **Determine how many stuffies Janet receives:**
   Jean gives \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the stuffies she gave away to her sister Janet. We need to calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the 40 stuffies she gave away.

   \[
   \text{Stuffies given to Janet} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the number of stuffies that Janet gets is:

   \[
   \boxed{10}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jean has 60 stuffies.
- She keeps 1/3 of them and gives away the rest.
- She gives 1/4 of the given away stuffies to her sister Janet.

Step 1: Calculate how many stuffies Jean keeps.
1/3 of 60 stuffies = 60 ร 1/3 = 20 stuffies

Step 2: Calculate how many stuffies Jean gives away.
Stuffies given away = Total stuffies - Stuffies kept
Stuffies given away = 60 - 20 = 40 stuffies

Step 3: Calculat...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps to determine how many stuffies Janet received. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine how many stuffies Jean keeps:**

   Jean has a total of 60 stuffies. She keeps 1/3 of them. To find out how many she keeps, we calculate:

   \[
   \text{Number of stuffies Jean keeps} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]

2. **Determine how many stuffies Jean gives away:**

   Since Jean keeps 20 stuffies, the rest are...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many stuffies Jean kept. Since she kept 1/3 of her stuffies, we multiply 60 (the total number of stuffies) by 1/3:

60 * 1/3 = 20 stuffies

This means Jean kept 20 stuffies and gave away the rest. To find out how many she gave away, we subtract the number she kept from the total number of stuffies:

60 - 20 = 40 stuffies

So, Jean gave away 40 stuffies. Now, we need to find out how many stuffies Jean gave to her sister Janet. Since she gave ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jean has a total of 60 stuffies.
   * She keeps 1/3 of her stuffies.
   * She gives away the remaining stuffies.
   * Janet receives 1/4 of the stuffies Jean gave away.

2. Calculate the number of stuffies Jean keeps:
   * Jean keeps 1/3 of her stuffies.
   * 1/3 of 60 = 60 รท 3 = 20 stuffies
   * So, Jean keeps 20 stuffies.

3. Calculate the number of stuffies Jean ...
