=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pencils Paul makes in a week.**
2. **Determine the total number of pencils he has at the beginning of the week.**
3. **Subtract the number of pencils sold during the week from the total number of pencils he has at the end of the week.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pencils made in a week

Paul makes 100 pencils a day and works five days a week. Therefore, the total number of pencils he makes in a week can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total pencils made in a week} = \text{Pencils per day} \times \text{Number of days}
\]
\[
\text{Total pencils made in a week} = 100 \text{ pencils/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 500 \text{ pencils}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the total number of pencils at the beginning of the week

Paul starts the week with 80 pencils in stock. 

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of pencils at the end of the week

Now, we need to find out how many pencils he has at the end of the week. To do this, we will add the pencils he made during the week to the pencils he started with, and then subtract the pencils he sold.

\[
\text{Total pencils at the end of the week} = \text{Initial stock} + \text{Pencils made} - \text{Pencils sold}
\]
\[
\text{Total pencils at the end of the week} = 80 \text{ pencils} + 500 \text{ pencils} - 350 \text{ pencils}
\]

Now, let's perform the calculations step by step:

1. Add the initial stock and the pencils made:
   \[
   80 + 500 = 580 \text{ pencils}
   \]

2. Subtract the number of pencils sold:
   \[
   580 - 350 = 230 \text{ pencils}
   \]

### Final Answer

At the end of the week, Paul has **230 pencils** in stock.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many pencils Paul has at the end of the week. We will do this by considering the number of pencils he starts with, the number he produces during the week, and the number he sells.

**Step 1: Determine the number of pencils Paul produces in a week.**

Paul makes 100 pencils a day and works five days a week. Therefore, the total number of pencils he produces in a week is calculated as follows:

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Paul makes 100 pencils a day for five days. So, the total number of pencils he makes in a week is 100 pencils/day * 5 days/week = 500 pencils/week.

He started the week with 80 pencils in his stock. So, the total number of pencils he had before selling any is 80 pencils + 500 pencils = 580 pencils.

During the week, he sold 350 pencils. So, the number of pencils he had left at the end of the week is 580 pencils - 350 pencils = 230 pencils.

Therefore, Paul had 230 pencils...
