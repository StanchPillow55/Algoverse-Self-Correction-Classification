=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we start by determining the total number of years in a century. A century consists of 100 years. Therefore, we can say:

\[
\text{Number of marbles Gideon has} = 100
\]

Next, we analyze the situation where Gideon gives away \( \frac{3}{4} \) of his marbles to his sister. If he has 100 marbles, the number of marbles he gives to his sister is:

\[
\text{Marbles given to sister} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
\]

After giving away 75 marbles, the number of marbles remaining with Gideon is:

\[
\text{Remaining marbles} = 100 - 75 = 25
\]

According to the problem, Gideon then multiplies the number of remaining marbles by 2. Thus, we calculate:

\[
\text{Marbles after multiplication} = 2 \times 25 = 50
\]

The problem states that this result equals Gideon's age five years from now. Let \( x \) represent Gideon's current age. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
x + 5 = 50
\]

To find Gideon's current age, we solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 50 - 5
\]
\[
x = 45
\]

Thus, Gideon's current age is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps and use the information given:

1. **Identify the total number of marbles Gideon has:**
   - The problem states that the total number of years in a century is the same as the number of marbles Gideon has. 
   - A century consists of 100 years.
   - Therefore, Gideon has 100 marbles.

2. **Determine how many marbles Gideon gives to his sister:**
   - Gideon gives 3/4 of his marbles to his sister.
   - Calculate 3/4 of 100...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): A century is 100 years, so Gideon has 100 marbles.

If he gives 3/4 of his marbles to his sister, he gives away 3/4 * 100 = 75 marbles.

This means he has 100 - 75 = 25 marbles left.

If he multiplies the number of remaining marbles by 2, he gets his age five years from now. So, 25 * 2 = 50 years old.

This means Gideon is 50 - 5 = 45 years old now.

So, Gideon is 45 years old.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * A century has 100 years.
   * Gideon has the same number of marbles as the number of years in a century.
   * Gideon gives 3/4 of his marbles to his sister.
   * When he multiplies the remaining marbles by 2, he gets his age five years from now.

2. Find the number of marbles Gideon has:
   * Gideon's marbles = Number of years in a century = 100 marbles

3. Calcu...
