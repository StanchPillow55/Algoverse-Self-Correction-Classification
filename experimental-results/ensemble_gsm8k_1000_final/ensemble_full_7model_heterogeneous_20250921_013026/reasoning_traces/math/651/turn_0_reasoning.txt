=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Olivia made this week, we need to calculate her total earnings based on the hours she worked each day and her hourly wage.

1. **Identify Olivia's hourly wage**: 
   Olivia earns $9 per hour.

2. **Calculate the total hours worked**:
   - On Monday, Olivia worked 4 hours.
   - On Wednesday, she worked 3 hours.
   - On Friday, she worked 6 hours.

   Now, we will add these hours together to find the total hours worked in the week:

   \[
   \text{Total hours} = \text{Hours on Monday} + \text{Hours on Wednesday} + \text{Hours on Friday}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = 4 + 3 + 6
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = 13 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate total earnings**:
   To find out how much Olivia made, we multiply her total hours worked by her hourly wage:

   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Total hours} \times \text{Hourly wage}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 13 \text{ hours} \times 9 \text{ dollars/hour}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 117 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, Olivia made a total of **$117** this week.

In conclusion, Olivia earned **$117** for the week based on her hourly wage and the hours she worked.
