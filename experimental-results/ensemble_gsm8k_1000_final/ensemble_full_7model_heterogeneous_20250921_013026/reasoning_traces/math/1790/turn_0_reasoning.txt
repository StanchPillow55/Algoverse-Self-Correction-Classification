=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of infections during the second wave over a period of 2 weeks, given that the number of infections increased by four times the initial rate.

1. **Identify the initial rate of infections**: 
   The problem states that during the first wave, there were 300 infections per day.

2. **Calculate the new rate of infections during the second wave**:
   The number of cases increased by four times the initial rate. Therefore, we calculate the new rate as follows:
   \[
   \text{New rate} = 300 \text{ infections/day} \times 4 = 1200 \text{ infections/day}
   \]

3. **Determine the duration of the second wave in days**:
   The problem specifies that we are looking at a duration of 2 weeks. Since 1 week has 7 days, we calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total days} = 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of infections during the second wave**:
   To find the total number of infections over the 14 days at the new rate of 1200 infections per day, we perform the following calculation:
   \[
   \text{Total infections} = \text{New rate} \times \text{Total days} = 1200 \text{ infections/day} \times 14 \text{ days}
   \]
   Now, we calculate:
   \[
   1200 \times 14 = 16800
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   The total number of infections during the second wave over the course of 2 weeks is:
   \[
   \boxed{16800}
   \]

* Therefor...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of coronavirus infections per day during the second wave and then calculate the total number of infections over a 2-week period.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of infections per day during the second wave:**

   - We are given that during the first wave, the number of infections was 300 per day.
   - During the second wave, the number of cases increased by four times more per day. This means t...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The number of coronavirus cases during the first wave was 300 infections per day. When the second wave hit, the number of cases increased by four times more per day. This means the number of cases per day during the second wave was 300 infections/day * 4 = 1200 infections/day.

To find the total number of infections during the second wave in 2 weeks, we need to multiply the number of infections per day by the number of days in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so there...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * During the first wave, the number of coronavirus cases was 300 infections per day.
   * In the second wave, the number of cases increased by four times more per day.
   * We need to find the total number of infections during the second wave in 2 weeks.

2. Calculate the number of infections per day during the second wave:
   * Infections per day in the second wave = 4 ...
