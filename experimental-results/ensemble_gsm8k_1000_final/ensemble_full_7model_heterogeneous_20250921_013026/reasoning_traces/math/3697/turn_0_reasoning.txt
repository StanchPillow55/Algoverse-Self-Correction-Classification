=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Winnings**: Opal won $100.00 from betting on a horse race.

2. **Dividing the Winnings**: 
   - Opal puts half of her winnings into savings. 
   - Half of $100.00 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Half of } 100 = \frac{100}{2} = 50
     \]
   - Therefore, Opal puts $50.00 into savings.

3. **Betting the Other Half**: 
   - The other half of her winnings, which is also $50.00, is used for another bet.

4. **Calculating the Profit from the Second Bet**:
   - Opal makes a 60% profit on the $50.00 she bet. 
   - To find the profit, we calculate 60% of $50.00:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = 0.60 \times 50 = 30
     \]
   - This means she earns an additional $30.00 from her second bet.

5. **Total Earnings from the Second Bet**:
   - To find the total amount she has after the second bet, we add the original amount she bet ($50.00) to the profit ($30.00):
     \[
     \text{Total Earnings} = 50 + 30 = 80
     \]

6. **Putting Half of the Earnings into Savings**:
   - Now, Opal puts half of her total earnings from the second bet into savings:
   - Half of $80.00 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Half of } 80 = \frac{80}{2} = 40
     \]
   - Therefore, Opal puts $40.00 into savings from her second bet.

7. **Total Amount in Savings**:
   - Now we can calculate the total amount Opal has put into savings:
   - From the first bet, she saved $50.00, and from the second bet, she saved $40.00:
     \[
     \text{Total Savings} = 50 + 40 = 90
     \]

Finally, the amount Opal put into her savings from both bets is:

\[
\text{Final Answer: } 90
\] 

Thus, Opal put a total of **$90.00** into her savings.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Opal won $100.00 betting on a horse race.

2. She put half of her winnings into savings, which means she put $50.00 into savings.

3. She bet the other half of her winnings, which was also $50.00.

4. On the second bet, she made a 60% profit. 
   * To calculate the profit, we take 60% of $50.00, which is $30.00.
   * So, her new winnings are $50.00 + $30.00 = $80.00.

5. Again, she put half of her earnings...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to track Opal's winnings and how much she puts into savings at each step.

1. **Initial Winnings:**
   Opal won $100.00 from the horse race.

2. **First Savings:**
   She put half of her winnings into savings. 
   \[
   \text{Amount put into savings} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   So, she saved $50.00 initially.

3. **Amount Bet Again:**
   The other half of her winnings was bet again.
   \[
   \text{Amount bet again...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Opal initially won $100.00. She put half of this into savings, which is $100.00 / 2 = $50.00.

She then bet the other half of her winnings, which is also $50.00. She made a 60% profit on this bet. To calculate this profit, we multiply the amount she bet by 60%, or $50.00 * 0.60 = $30.00.

So, her total earnings from the second bet are the original amount she bet plus her profit, or $50.00 + $30.00 = $80.00.

She then put half of these earnings into savings, which is $80.0...
