=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will define the ages of Peter and Harriet using variables and then set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( P \) be Peter's current age.
   - Let \( H \) be Harriet's current age.

2. **Information Given**:
   - In four years, Peter will be twice as old as Harriet.
   - Peter's current age is half of his mother's age, and his mother is 60 years old.

3. **Set Up Equations**:
   - From the information about Peter's mother, we can express Peter's current age:
     \[
     P = \frac{60}{2} = 30
     \]
   - Now we know Peter's current age is 30.

4. **Use the Future Age Condition**:
   - In four years, Peter's age will be:
     \[
     P + 4 = 30 + 4 = 34
     \]
   - In four years, Harriet's age will be:
     \[
     H + 4
     \]
   - According to the problem, in four years, Peter will be twice as old as Harriet:
     \[
     34 = 2(H + 4)
     \]

5. **Solve for Harriet's Age**:
   - Expand the equation:
     \[
     34 = 2H + 8
     \]
   - Subtract 8 from both sides:
     \[
     34 - 8 = 2H
     \]
     \[
     26 = 2H
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     H = \frac{26}{2} = 13
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Harriet's current age is \( \boxed{13} \). 

This solution follows logically from the information provided, and all calculations have been shown step by step.

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will define the ages of Peter and Harriet using variables and then set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( P \) be Peter's current age.
   - Let \( H \) be Harriet's current age.

2. **Information Given**:
   - In four years, Peter will be twice as old as Harriet.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find Peter's current age.
2. Find Peter's age in four years.
3. Find Harriet's age in four years.
4. Find Harriet's current age.

Step 1: Find Peter's current age.
* Peter's age is currently half of his mother's age, who is 60.
* Peter's current age = 60 / 2 = 30 years old.

Step 2: Find Peter's age in four years.
* Peter's age in four years = 30 + 4 = 34 years old.

Step 3: Find Harriet's age ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the current age of Harriet based on the information provided about Peter and his mother.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine Peter's Current Age:**
   - We know that Peter's current age is half of his mother's age.
   - Peter's mother is 60 years old.
   - Therefore, Peter's current age is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) years old.

2. **Set Up the Equation for Future Ages:**
   - In four years, Peter will be 30...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out Peter's current age. If Peter's age is currently half of his mother's age, and his mother is 60, then Peter must be 60 / 2 = 30 years old.

In four years, Peter will be 30 + 4 = 34 years old.

The problem states that in four years, Peter will be twice as old as Harriet. So, if Peter will be 34 years old in four years, that means Harriet will be 34 / 2 = 17 years old in four years.

However, we want to know Harriet's current age, not her age in ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Peter will be twice as old as Harriet in four years.
   * Peter's current age is half of his mother's age.
   * Peter's mother is 60 years old.

2. Find Peter's current age:
   * Peter's age = 1/2 × Mother's age
   * Peter's age = 1/2 × 60
   * Peter's age = 30
   So, Peter is currently 30 years old.

3. Express Peter's age in four years:
   * Peter's age in four...
