=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many fish Jason and Ryan caught based on the information given about Jeffery's catch.

1. **Identify the number of fish Jeffery caught**: 
   We know from the problem that Jeffery caught 60 fish.

2. **Determine how many fish Ryan caught**: 
   The problem states that Jeffery caught twice the number of fish that Ryan caught. We can express this relationship mathematically:
   \[
   \text{Jeffery's fish} = 2 \times \text{Ryan's fish}
   \]
   Substituting the known value:
   \[
   60 = 2 \times \text{Ryan's fish}
   \]
   To find the number of fish Ryan caught, we divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   \text{Ryan's fish} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

3. **Determine how many fish Jason caught**: 
   The problem states that Ryan caught three times the number of fish that Jason caught. We can express this relationship as:
   \[
   \text{Ryan's fish} = 3 \times \text{Jason's fish}
   \]
   Substituting the known value for Ryan's fish:
   \[
   30 = 3 \times \text{Jason's fish}
   \]
   To find the number of fish Jason caught, we divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   \text{Jason's fish} = \frac{30}{3} = 10
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of fish caught by all three**: 
   Now that we have the number of fish caught by each person:
   - Jason caught 10 fish
   - Ryan caught 30 fish
   - Jeffery caught 60 fish

   We can find the total by adding these amounts together:
   \[
   \text{Total fish} = \text{Jason's fish} + \text{Ryan's fish} + \text{Jeffery's fish}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total fish} = 10 + 30 + 60 = 100
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: 
   Therefore, the total number of fish caught by Jason, Ryan, and Jeffery is:
   \[
   \boxed{100}
   \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ryan caught three times the number of fish that Jason caught.
- Jeffery caught twice the number of fish that Ryan got.
- Jeffery caught 60 fish.

Step 1: Find the number of fish Ryan caught.
Since Jeffery caught twice the number of fish that Ryan got, we can use this information to find Ryan's catch.
Jeffery's catch = 2 × Ryan's catch
60 = 2 × Ryan's catch
Ryan's catch = 60 / 2 = 30 fish
...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of fish each person caught and then sum these amounts to find the total number of fish caught by Jason, Ryan, and Jeffery.

Let's define some variables to represent the number of fish each person caught:

- Let \( J \) represent the number of fish Jason caught.
- Let \( R \) represent the number of fish Ryan caught.
- Let \( F \) represent the number of fish Jeffery caught.

We are given the following information:

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out how many fish Ryan caught. Since Jeffery caught twice the number of fish that Ryan caught, and we know Jeffery caught 60 fish, we can divide 60 by 2 to find out how many fish Ryan caught. 

60 ÷ 2 = 30

So, Ryan caught 30 fish. 

Next, let's figure out how many fish Jason caught. Since Ryan caught three times the number of fish that Jason caught, we can divide the number of fish Ryan caught by 3 to find out how many fish Jason caught. 

30 ÷ 3 ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start with the information given and work our way to the total number of fish caught by all three of them.

Given:
- Jeffery caught 60 fish.
- Jeffery caught twice the number of fish that Ryan caught.
- Ryan caught three times the number of fish that Jason caught.

Step 1: Determine the number of fish Ryan caught.
Since Jeffery caught twice the number of fish that Ryan caught, we can express this as:
