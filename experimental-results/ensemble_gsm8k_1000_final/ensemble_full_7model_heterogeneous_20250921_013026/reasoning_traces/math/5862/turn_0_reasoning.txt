Final Answer: To determine how much Arnold spends on gas each month, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the mileage driven by each car**:
   Arnold drives a total of 450 miles each month and splits this mileage equally among his three cars. Therefore, the mileage driven by each car is:

   \[
   \text{Mileage per car} = \frac{\text{Total mileage}}{\text{Number of cars}} = \frac{450 \text{ miles}}{3} = 150 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the gallons of gas used by each car**:
   Next, we need to calculate how many gallons of gas each car uses based on its miles per gallon (mpg) rating.

   - For the **first car** (50 mpg):
     \[
     \text{Gallons used} = \frac{\text{Mileage}}{\text{mpg}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{50 \text{ mpg}} = 3 \text{ gallons}
     \]

   - For the **second car** (10 mpg):
     \[
     \text{Gallons used} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ mpg}} = 15 \text{ gallons}
     \]

   - For the **third car** (15 mpg):
     \[
     \text{Gallons used} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mpg}} = 10 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total gallons of gas used**:
   Now, we sum the gallons used by all three cars:

   \[
   \text{Total gallons used} = 3 \text{ gallons} + 15 \text{ gallons} + 10 \text{ gallons} = 28 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of gas**:
   Given that gas costs $2 per gallon, we can calculate the total cost of gas for the month:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total gallons used} \times \text{Cost per gallon} = 28 \text{ gallons} \times 2 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 56 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, Arnold spends a total of **$56** on gas each month.

\[
\boxed{56}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of gas consumed by each car and then calculate the total cost of gas for all three cars.

Given information:
- Arnold owns three cars.
- The first car averages 50 miles per gallon of gas.
- The second car averages 10 miles per gallon of gas.
- The third car averages 15 miles per gallon of gas.
- Arnold splits his 450-mile monthly driving mileage equally amongst his three cars.
- Gas costs $2 per gallon...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how much Arnold spends on gas each month, we need to calculate the amount of gas each car uses and then find the total cost based on the price of gas.

1. **Determine the mileage driven by each car:**

   Arnold drives a total of 450 miles each month, and he splits this mileage equally among his three cars. Therefore, each car is driven:

   \[
   \frac{450 \text{ miles}}{3} = 150 \text{ miles per car}
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many miles each car is driven each month. Since Arnold splits his 450-mile monthly driving mileage equally amongst his three cars, each car is driven 450 miles / 3 cars = 150 miles per car.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas each car uses each month. 

For the first car, which averages 50 miles per gallon, it uses 150 miles / 50 miles per gallon = 3 gallons of gas.

For the second car, which averages 10 miles per gallon, it...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Arnold owns three cars with different gas mileage: 50 mpg, 10 mpg, and 15 mpg.
   * He drives a total of 450 miles per month.
   * He splits the mileage equally among the three cars.
   * Gas costs $2 per gallon.

2. Calculate the miles driven by each car:
   * Total miles per month = 450 miles
   * Number of cars = 3
   * Miles driven by each car = Total miles รท Numbe...
