=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many of Peter's birds are chickens and then calculate the cost to feed those chickens.

1. **Determine the number of ducks:**
   Peter has a total of 15 birds, and 1/3 of them are ducks. We can calculate the number of ducks as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of ducks} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5
   \]

2. **Determine the number of chickens:**
   Since we know the total number of birds and the number of ducks, we can find the number of chickens by subtracting the number of ducks from the total number of birds:
   \[
   \text{Number of chickens} = \text{Total birds} - \text{Number of ducks} = 15 - 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost to feed the chickens:**
   Each chicken requires special feed that costs $2. Therefore, the total cost to feed the chickens can be calculated by multiplying the number of chickens by the cost per chicken:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of chickens} \times \text{Cost per chicken} = 10 \times 2 = 20
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   The total cost to feed the chickens is $20.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Peter has 15 birds total
- 1/3 of the birds are ducks
- The remaining birds are chickens
- The special feed for the chickens costs $2 per bird

Step 1: Calculate the number of ducks.
1/3 of 15 birds = 15 × 1/3 = 5 ducks

Step 2: Calculate the number of chickens.
Total birds - Ducks = Chickens
15 - 5 = 10 chickens

Step 3: Calculate the cost of feeding the chickens.
Cost per chicken × Numb...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of Peter's birds are chickens and then calculate the cost of feeding them.

1. **Determine the number of ducks:**
   - Peter has a total of 15 birds.
   - According to the problem, \(\frac{1}{3}\) of these birds are ducks.
   - To find the number of ducks, we calculate \(\frac{1}{3}\) of 15:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5
     \]
   - Therefore, Peter has 5 ducks.

2. **Determine the number of chickens:**
   - ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many of Peter's birds are ducks and how many are chickens. 

Since 1/3 of his birds are ducks, we multiply the total number of birds, which is 15, by 1/3. 

15 * 1/3 = 5

So, Peter has 5 ducks.

To find out how many chickens he has, we subtract the number of ducks from the total number of birds. 

15 - 5 = 10

So, Peter has 10 chickens.

The special feed for the chickens costs $2 per bird. So, to find out how much it costs to feed all the c...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Peter has a total of 15 birds.
   * 1/3 of the birds are ducks.
   * The remaining birds are chickens.
   * The special feed for chickens costs $2 per bird.

2. Calculate the number of ducks:
   * Number of ducks = 1/3 of total birds
   * Number of ducks = 1/3 × 15
   * Number of ducks = 5

3. Calculate the number of chickens:
   * Number of chickens = Total birds -...
