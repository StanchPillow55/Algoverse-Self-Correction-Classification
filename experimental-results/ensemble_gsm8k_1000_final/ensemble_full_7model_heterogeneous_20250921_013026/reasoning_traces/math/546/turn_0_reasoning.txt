=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of gifts John received between his 12th and 13th birthdays, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of gifts received on the 12th birthday.**
   - According to the problem, John received 20 gifts on his 12th birthday.

2. **Determine the number of gifts received on the 13th birthday.**
   - The problem states that he received 8 fewer gifts on his 13th birthday compared to his 12th birthday. 
   - To find the number of gifts he received on his 13th birthday, we subtract 8 from the number of gifts he received on his 12th birthday:
     \[
     \text{Gifts on 13th birthday} = \text{Gifts on 12th birthday} - 8
     \]
     \[
     \text{Gifts on 13th birthday} = 20 - 8 = 12
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of gifts received between the two birthdays.**
   - Now, we add the number of gifts received on both birthdays:
     \[
     \text{Total gifts} = \text{Gifts on 12th birthday} + \text{Gifts on 13th birthday}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total gifts} = 20 + 12 = 32
     \]

Thus, the total number of gifts John received between his 12th and 13th birthdays is \( \boxed{32} \).

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): John received 20 gifts on his 12th birthday. 

On his 13th birthday, he received 8 fewer gifts than he did on his 12th birthday. To find out how many gifts he received on his 13th birthday, we subtract 8 from the number of gifts he received on his 12th birthday. 

So, 20 (gifts on 12th birthday) - 8 (fewer gifts on 13th birthday) = 12 gifts on his 13th birthday.

To find out how many total gifts he received on both birthdays, we add the number of gifts he received on his ...
