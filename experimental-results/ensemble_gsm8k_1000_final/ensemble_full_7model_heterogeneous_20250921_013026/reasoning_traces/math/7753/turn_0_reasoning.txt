Final Answer: To find out how much Peter paid in total for the popsicles and ice cream bars, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately and then sum those costs.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the popsicles.**

Peter purchased 20 popsicles, and each popsicle costs $0.25. We can calculate the total cost of the popsicles using the formula:

\[
\text{Total cost of popsicles} = \text{Number of popsicles} \times \text{Cost per popsicle}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total cost of popsicles} = 20 \times 0.25
\]

Now, performing the multiplication:

\[
20 \times 0.25 = 5.00
\]

So, the total cost of the popsicles is **$5.00**.

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the ice cream bars.**

Peter also purchased 4 ice cream bars, and each ice cream bar costs $0.50. We can calculate the total cost of the ice cream bars using the same formula:

\[
\text{Total cost of ice cream bars} = \text{Number of ice cream bars} \times \text{Cost per ice cream bar}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total cost of ice cream bars} = 4 \times 0.50
\]

Now, performing the multiplication:

\[
4 \times 0.50 = 2.00
\]

So, the total cost of the ice cream bars is **$2.00**.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid.**

Now, we need to add the total cost of the popsicles and the total cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:

\[
\text{Total amount paid} = \text{Total cost of popsicles} + \text{Total cost of ice cream bars}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total amount paid} = 5.00 + 2.00
\]

Now, performing the addition:

\[
5.00 + 2.00 = 7.00
\]

Thus, the total amount Peter paid is **$7.00**.

**Final Answer:**
Peter paid a total of **$7.00**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each.
- Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the popsicles.
Cost of 20 popsicles = 20 × $0.25 = $5.00

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the ice cream bars.
Cost of 4 ice cream bars = 4 × $0.50 = $2.00

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Peter paid.
Total amount paid = Cost of popsicles + Cost of ice cream ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then add these amounts together to find the total amount Peter paid.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the popsicles.**

Peter purchased 20 popsicles, and each popsicle costs $0.25. To find the total cost of the popsicles, we multiply the number of popsicles by the cost per popsicle:

\[
\text{Total cost of popsicles} = 20 \times 0.25
\]

Calculating this:

\[...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total cost of the popsicles. Since each popsicle costs $0.25 and Peter bought 20 of them, we multiply the cost of each popsicle by the number of popsicles:

$0.25 * 20 = $5.00

Next, we calculate the total cost of the ice cream bars. Each ice cream bar costs $0.50 and Peter bought 4 of them, so we multiply the cost of each ice cream bar by the number of ice cream bars:

$0.50 * 4 = $2.00

Finally, we add the total cost of the popsicles and ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Peter bought 20 popsicles.
   * Each popsicle costs $0.25.
   * He also bought 4 ice cream bars.
   * Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.

2. Calculate the total cost of the popsicles:
   * Cost of popsicles = Number of popsicles × Price per popsicle
   * Cost of popsicles = 20 × $0.25
   * Cost of popsicles = $5.00

3. Calculate the total cost of the ice cream bars:
   * ...
