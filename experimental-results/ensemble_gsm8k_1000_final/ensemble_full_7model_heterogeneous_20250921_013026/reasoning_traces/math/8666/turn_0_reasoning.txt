=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Jason earned in a two-week period, we will calculate the earnings from each task he completed and then sum them up.

1. **Earnings from doing laundry**:
   - Jason did his laundry once.
   - The payment for doing laundry is $3.00.
   - Total earnings from laundry = \( 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00 \).

2. **Earnings from cleaning his room**:
   - Jason cleaned his room once.
   - The payment for cleaning his room is $1.50.
   - Total earnings from cleaning his room = \( 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50 \).

3. **Earnings from taking the trash to the curb**:
   - Jason took the trash out twice.
   - The payment for taking the trash out is $0.75.
   - Total earnings from taking the trash out = \( 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50 \).

4. **Earnings from emptying the dishwasher**:
   - Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times.
   - The payment for emptying the dishwasher is $0.50.
   - Total earnings from emptying the dishwasher = \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \).

Now, we will sum all of Jason's earnings from the different tasks:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from laundry} + \text{Earnings from cleaning} + \text{Earnings from trash} + \text{Earnings from dishwasher}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 3.00
\]

Now, we will perform the addition step-by-step:

1. \( 3.00 + 1.50 = 4.50 \)
2. \( 4.50 + 1.50 = 6.00 \)
3. \( 6.00 + 3.00 = 9.00 \)

Thus, Jason earned a total of **$9.00** over the two-week period.

Final answer: **$9.00**.
