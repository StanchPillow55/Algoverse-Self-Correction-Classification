Final Answer: To find out how many carnations were in the third bouquet, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: We know the number of carnations in the first two bouquets and the average number of carnations across all three bouquets. We need to find the number of carnations in the third bouquet.

2. **Identify the known quantities**:
   - Number of carnations in the first bouquet: \(9\)
   - Number of carnations in the second bouquet: \(14\)
   - Average number of carnations in the three bouquets: \(12\)

3. **Set up the equation for the average**: The average number of items is calculated by dividing the total number of items by the number of items. In this case, the average number of carnations in the three bouquets can be expressed as:

   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of carnations}}{\text{Number of bouquets}}
   \]

   Since we have three bouquets, we can express this as:

   \[
   12 = \frac{9 + 14 + x}{3}
   \]

   where \(x\) is the number of carnations in the third bouquet.

4. **Calculate the total number of carnations**: To find the total number of carnations, we can rearrange the equation:

   \[
   12 \times 3 = 9 + 14 + x
   \]

   This simplifies to:

   \[
   36 = 9 + 14 + x
   \]

5. **Combine the known quantities**: Now, we can add \(9\) and \(14\):

   \[
   9 + 14 = 23
   \]

   So, we can substitute this back into our equation:

   \[
   36 = 23 + x
   \]

6. **Solve for \(x\)**: To find \(x\), we subtract \(23\) from both sides:

   \[
   x = 36 - 23
   \]

   This gives us:

   \[
   x = 13
   \]

7. **Conclusion**: The number of carnations in the third bouquet is \(13\).

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{13}
\]

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many carnations were in the third bouquet, given that the average number of carnations in the three bouquets is 12.

Let's denote the number of carnations in the third bouquet as \( x \).

We know the following:
- The first bouquet has 9 carnations.
- The second bouquet has 14 carnations.
- The average number of carnations in the three bouquets is 12.

The formula for the average of three numbers is:

\[
\text{Average} = \f...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The average number of carnations in the bouquets is calculated by adding up the total number of carnations and dividing by the number of bouquets. 

We know that the average number of carnations is 12 and there are 3 bouquets. Therefore, the total number of carnations is 12 * 3 = 36.

We also know that the first bouquet had 9 carnations and the second had 14 carnations. Therefore, the total number of carnations in the first two bouquets is 9 + 14 = 23.

Given:
- Trevor buys three bouquets of carnations.
- The first bouquet has 9 carnations.
- The second bouquet has 14 carnations.
- The average number of carnations in the three bouquets is 12.

Step 1: Let's define a variable for the unknown quantity.
Let x be the number of carnations in the third bouquet.

Step 2: Understand the concept of average.
