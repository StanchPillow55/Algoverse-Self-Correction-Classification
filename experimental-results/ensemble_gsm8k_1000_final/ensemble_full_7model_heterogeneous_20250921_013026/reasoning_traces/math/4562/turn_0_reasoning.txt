=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many holes remain unfilled after Maynard filled in 75% of the holes dug by his dog.

1. **Identify the total number of holes dug**: 
   Maynard's dog dug a total of 8 holes.

2. **Calculate the number of holes filled**:
   Maynard filled in 75% of the holes. To find out how many holes this represents, we can calculate 75% of 8 holes.

   \[
   \text{Number of holes filled} = 75\% \times 8
   \]

   To convert 75% to a decimal, we divide by 100:

   \[
   75\% = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

   Now we can calculate:

   \[
   \text{Number of holes filled} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of holes remaining unfilled**:
   To find the number of holes that remain unfilled, we subtract the number of holes filled from the total number of holes dug.

   \[
   \text{Number of holes unfilled} = \text{Total holes} - \text{Holes filled}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Number of holes unfilled} = 8 - 6 = 2
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the number of holes that remain unfilled is:

   \[
   \boxed{2}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Maynard's dog dug 8 holes in the lawn.
- Maynard filled in 75% of the holes with dirt.

To find the number of holes that remain unfilled, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of holes that were filled with dirt.
75% of 8 holes = 0.75 × 8 = 6 holes filled

Step 2: Calculate the number of holes that remain unfilled.
Number of holes remaining unfilled = Total holes - Holes...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of the 8 holes remain unfilled after Maynard fills in 75% of them.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Total Number of Holes:**
   - Maynard's dog dug a total of 8 holes.

2. **Determine the Percentage of Holes Filled:**
   - Maynard filled in 75% of the holes.

3. **Calculate the Number of Holes Filled:**
   - To find out how many holes were filled, we calculate 75% of 8.
   - Convert the percentage to a de...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many holes Maynard filled. 

Since Maynard filled 75% of the holes, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of holes by 75% (or 0.75 in decimal form).

So, 8 holes * 0.75 = 6 holes

This means Maynard filled 6 holes.

To find out how many holes remain unfilled, we subtract the number of filled holes from the total number of holes.

So, 8 holes - 6 holes = 2 holes

Therefore, 2 holes remain unfilled.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Maynard's dog dug 8 holes in the lawn.
   * Maynard filled 75% of the holes with dirt.

2. Calculate the number of holes Maynard filled:
   * 75% of 8 holes = 0.75 × 8
   * 0.75 × 8 = 6 holes

   So, Maynard filled 6 holes with dirt.

3. Calculate the number of holes that remain unfilled:
   * Total holes - Filled holes = Unfilled holes
   * 8 holes - 6 holes = 2...
