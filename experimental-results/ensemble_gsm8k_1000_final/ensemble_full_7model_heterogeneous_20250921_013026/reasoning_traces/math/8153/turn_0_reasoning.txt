=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults exceeds the maximum load of the elevator, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the weight of one adult**: 
   The problem states that an adult weighs an average of 80 kg.

2. **Calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults**:
   Since Jack is riding with 8 other adults, the total number of adults in the elevator is:
   \[
   1 \text{ (Jack)} + 8 \text{ (other adults)} = 9 \text{ adults}
   \]
   Now, we can calculate the total weight of these 9 adults:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Number of adults} \times \text{Weight of one adult}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 9 \times 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Identify the maximum load of the elevator**:
   The maximum load the elevator can support is given as 700 kg.

4. **Calculate the excess weight**:
   To find out how much they exceed the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
   \[
   \text{Excess weight} = \text{Total weight} - \text{Maximum load}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Excess weight} = 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg}
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   The total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults exceeds the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{They have exceeded the maximum load by } 20 \text{ kg.}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total weight of the people in the elevator and then calculate the amount by which they have exceeded the maximum load.

Given information:
- The elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg.
- An adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
- Jack rides the elevator with 8 other adults.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the people in the elevator.
Total weight = Weight of Jack + Weight of the 8 other adults
Total wei...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults riding the elevator and compare it to the maximum load the elevator can support.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of people in the elevator.**

Jack is riding the elevator with 8 other adults. Therefore, the total number of people in the elevator is:
\[ 1 + 8 = 9 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total weight of all the people in the elevator.**

Each adult weighs an average of 80 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The total number of adults in the elevator is Jack plus 8 other adults, which is 1 + 8 = 9 adults.

If each adult weighs an average of 80 kg, then the total weight of the 9 adults is 9 * 80 = 720 kg.

The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg, so the total weight of the adults exceeds the maximum load by 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

Therefore, Jack and the 8 other adults will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The elevator's maximum load is 700 kg.
   * An average adult weighs 80 kg.
   * Jack is riding the elevator with 8 other adults.

2. Calculate the total weight of the people in the elevator:
   * Total people in the elevator = Jack + 8 other adults = 1 + 8 = 9 people
   * Weight of one adult = 80 kg
   * Total weight of people = Number of people Ã— Weight of one a...
