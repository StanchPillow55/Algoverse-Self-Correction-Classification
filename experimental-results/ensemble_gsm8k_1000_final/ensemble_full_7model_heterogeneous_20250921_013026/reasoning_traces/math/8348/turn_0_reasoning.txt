=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of marbles Paul has.**
   - Paul starts with 52 marbles.

2. **Add the marbles given to him by his friend.**
   - His friend gives him 28 marbles.
   - We calculate the total number of marbles after receiving the marbles from his friend:
     \[
     \text{Total marbles after receiving from friend} = 52 + 28 = 80
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of marbles Paul lost.**
   - Paul lost \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his total marbles.
   - First, we need to find \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 80:
     \[
     \text{Marbles lost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20
     \]

4. **Determine the number of marbles Paul has left after losing some.**
   - We subtract the number of marbles lost from the total number of marbles he had after receiving from his friend:
     \[
     \text{Marbles left} = 80 - 20 = 60
     \]

5. **State the final answer.**
   - After all calculations, Paul has 60 marbles left.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Paul initially has 52 marbles.
- His friend gave him 28 more marbles.
- He then lost 1/4 of his total marbles.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after his friend gave him 28 more.
Total marbles = Initial marbles + Marbles received from friend
Total marbles = 52 + 28 = 80 marbles

Step 2: Calculate the number of marbles Paul lost, which is 1/4 of the total.
Marbles lost = ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events described and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Marbles:**
   Paul starts with 52 marbles.

2. **Marbles Received from Friend:**
   Paul's friend gives him 28 more marbles. To find out how many marbles Paul has after receiving these additional marbles, we add the number of marbles he received to the number he initially had:
   \[
   52 + 28 = 80
   \]
   So, after recei...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Step 1: Add the number of marbles Paul initially had to the number of marbles his friend gave him.
52 marbles + 28 marbles = 80 marbles

Step 2: Calculate the number of marbles Paul lost. He lost 1/4 of his total number of marbles, so multiply the total number of marbles by 1/4.
80 marbles * 1/4 = 20 marbles

Step 3: Subtract the number of marbles Paul lost from his total number of marbles to find out how many marbles he has left.
80 marbles - 20 marbles = 60 marbles

So,...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step, showing all the calculations and explaining the reasoning behind each step.

Given:
- Paul has 52 marbles initially.
- His friend gives him 28 marbles.
- He then loses 1/4 of his marbles.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after receiving the marbles from his friend.
Total marbles = Initial marbles + Marbles received from his friend
Total marbles = 52 + 28 = 80
