=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of adults attending the concert.
   - Since there are three times as many children as adults, the number of children will be \( 3a \).

2. **Ticket Prices:**
   - The cost of an adult ticket is $7.
   - The cost of a child's ticket is $3.

3. **Total Revenue:**
   - The total revenue from adult tickets is \( 7a \) (since each adult pays $7).
   - The total revenue from child tickets is \( 3(3a) = 9a \) (since each child pays $3 and there are \( 3a \) children).
   - Therefore, the total revenue collected from both adults and children is:
     \[
     7a + 9a = 16a
     \]

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - We know the total revenue collected is $6,000. Thus, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     16a = 6000
     \]

5. **Solve for \( a \):**
   - To find \( a \), we divide both sides of the equation by 16:
     \[
     a = \frac{6000}{16} = 375
     \]

6. **Calculate the Number of Children:**
   - Since the number of children is \( 3a \):
     \[
     3a = 3 \times 375 = 1125
     \]

7. **Total Number of People:**
   - The total number of people who bought tickets is the sum of adults and children:
     \[
     \text{Total} = a + 3a = 375 + 1125 = 1500
     \]

8. **Final Answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of people who bought tickets is:
     \[
     \boxed{1500}
     \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of adults and children who bought tickets for the concert.

Given information:
- Three times as many children as adults attend the concert.
- An adult ticket costs $7, and a child's ticket costs $3.
- The theater collected a total of $6,000.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of adults who bought tickets.
- Then, the number of children who bought tickets is 3x.

Step 1: Set up an equati...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of adults and children who attended the concert, given the total amount of money collected and the relationship between the number of adults and children.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( a \) be the number of adults who attended the concert.
- Since there are three times as many children as adults, the number of children is \( 3a \).

Next, we calculate the total revenue from the ticket sales:
- The revenue fro...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of adults as A and the number of children as C. 

From the problem, we know that three times as many children as adults attend the concert, so we can write this relationship as:

C = 3A

We also know that the total money collected from selling tickets is $6,000. Given that an adult ticket costs $7 and a child's ticket costs $3, we can write this relationship as:

7A + 3C = 6000

Now we can substitute C = 3A from the first equation into the second e...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use variables to represent the unknown quantities and set up an equation to solve for the total number of people who bought tickets.

Given:
- There are three times as many children as adults attending the concert.
- An adult ticket costs $7, and a child's ticket costs $3.
- The theater collected a total of $6,000.

Step 1: Define variables
Let x = the number of adults attending the concert
