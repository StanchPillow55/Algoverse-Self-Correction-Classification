=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars among the total available cars for rent, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of cars**: We know that there are 20 cars available for rent.

2. **Identify the number of automatic and manual cars**: 
   - There are 12 automatic cars.
   - There are 4 manual cars.

3. **Calculate the number of semi-automatic cars**: 
   To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are accounted for by the automatic and manual cars. We can do this by adding the number of automatic and manual cars together:

   \[
   \text{Number of automatic cars} + \text{Number of manual cars} = 12 + 4 = 16
   \]

   Now, we subtract this total from the overall number of cars to find the number of semi-automatic cars:

   \[
   \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total number of cars} - \text{Number of automatic and manual cars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 16 = 4
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars**: 
   To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula for percentage:

   \[
   \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Now, we perform the division:

   \[
   \frac{4}{20} = 0.2
   \]

   Next, we multiply by 100 to convert it to a percentage:

   \[
   0.2 \times 100 = 20
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is 

   \[
   \boxed{20\%}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 20 available cars for rent.
- 12 of the cars are automatic.
- 4 of the cars are manual.

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find the number of semi-automatic cars.

Step 1: Find the number of semi-automatic cars.
Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4
Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - Automatic cars - Manual cars
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 1...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many cars are semi-automatic. We know that there are 20 cars in total, and that 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. 

So, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars to find out how many are semi-automatic. 

20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4 semi-automatic cars

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the total number of cars are semi-automatic. 

To do this, we divide the ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are a total of 20 cars available for rent.
   * 12 of these cars are automatic.
   * 4 of these cars are manual.
   * The remaining cars are semi-automatic.

2. Calculate the number of semi-automatic cars:
   * Total cars = Automatic cars + Manual cars + Semi-automatic cars
   * 20 = 12 + 4 + Semi-automatic cars
   * Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 12 - 4
   * S...
