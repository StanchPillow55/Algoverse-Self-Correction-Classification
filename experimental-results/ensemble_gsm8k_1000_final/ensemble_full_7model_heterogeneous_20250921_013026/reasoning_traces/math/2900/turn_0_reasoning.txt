=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let \( x \) be the total amount of money James won in the raffle.

1. **Donating Half**: James donated half of his winnings back to the charity. Therefore, the amount he donated is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

2. **Calculating Remaining Amount After Donation**: After donating half, the amount he has left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{2}
   \]

3. **Spending on a Hot Dog**: James then spent $2 on a hot dog. The amount he has left after this expense is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} - 2
   \]

4. **Amount Left Over**: According to the problem, after all these transactions, James has $55 left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} - 2 = 55
   \]

5. **Solving the Equation**:
   - First, add 2 to both sides of the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} = 55 + 2
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} = 57
   \]

   - Next, multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 57 \times 2
   \]
   \[
   x = 114
   \]

6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the total amount of money James won is:
   \[
   \boxed{114}
   \] 

This means James won $114 in the charity raffle.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the information given to find the original amount James won at the charity raffle.

Given information:
- James donated half of his winnings back to the charity.
- He spent $2 on a hot dog.
- He had $55 left over.

Let's represent the original amount James won as "x".

Step 1: Calculate the amount James donated to the charity.
Amount donated = 1/2 of the original amount won
Amount donated = 1/2 Ã— x =...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, let's define the total amount of money James won as \( x \).

1. **Donation Calculation:**
   - James donated half of his winnings back to the charity. Therefore, the amount he donated is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

2. **Spending on Hot Dog:**
   - After donating, James spent $2 on a hot dog.

3. **Amount Left Over:**
   - After donating and buying the hot dog, James had $55 left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Amount left} = \te...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the amount of money James won as X.

According to the problem, James donated half of his winnings back to the charity. This means he was left with X/2 dollars.

Then, he spent $2 on a hot dog. This means he was left with X/2 - 2 dollars.

The problem states that after these actions, James had $55 left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

X/2 - 2 = 55

To solve for X, we first add 2 to both sides of the equation to isolate X/2 on one side:

X/2 =...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to set up an equation and solve for the amount James won.

Given:
- James won a money prize at a charity raffle.
- He donated half of his winnings back to the charity.
- He spent $2 on a hot dog.
- He had $55 left over.

Step 1: Let's define a variable for the unknown amount.
Let x = the amount of money James won in dollars.

Step 2: Express the amount James had left over i...
