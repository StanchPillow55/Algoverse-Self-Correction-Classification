=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate how much Toby gives to each brother**: Toby gives each of his two brothers \( \frac{1}{7} \) of $343. 

   First, we calculate \( \frac{1}{7} \) of $343:

   \[
   \frac{1}{7} \times 343 = \frac{343}{7}
   \]

   Now, we perform the division:

   \[
   343 \div 7 = 49
   \]

   So, each brother receives $49.

2. **Calculate the total amount given to both brothers**: Since Toby has two brothers, we need to multiply the amount given to one brother by 2:

   \[
   49 \times 2 = 98
   \]

   Therefore, Toby gives a total of $98 to his two brothers.

3. **Calculate how much money Toby has left**: Now we subtract the total amount given to his brothers from the original amount Toby received:

   \[
   343 - 98 = 245
   \]

   Thus, Toby has $245 left after sharing with his brothers.

4. **Final answer**: The amount of money left for Toby is:

   \[
   \boxed{245}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Toby's father gave him $343 for passing the test.
- Toby decided to share it with his two brothers.
- Toby gave each of his brothers 1/7 of $343.

Step 1: Calculate the amount Toby gave to each of his brothers.
1/7 of $343 = $343 รท 7 = $49

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Toby gave to his two brothers.
Amount given to each brother = $49
Total amount given to two brothers = 2 ร $49 = $98

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Toby gives to each of his two brothers and then calculate how much money he has left for himself.

1. **Determine the amount given to each brother:**

   Toby gives each brother \(\frac{1}{7}\) of $343. To find out how much this is, we calculate:

   \[
   \frac{1}{7} \times 343 = \frac{343}{7}
   \]

   To perform the division, we divide 343 by 7:

   \[
   343 \div 7 = 49
   \]

   So, each brother receives $49...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Toby's father gave him $343. He decided to give each of his two brothers 1/7 of this amount. 

First, we need to calculate how much money each brother will receive. 

1/7 of $343 can be calculated as follows:

(1/7) * $343 = $49

So, each brother will receive $49. 

Since Toby has two brothers, he will give away a total of:

$49 * 2 = $98

Now, we need to subtract this amount from the original amount Toby received from his father to find out how much money Toby has left. ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Toby's father gave him $343.
   * Toby decided to share the money with his two brothers.
   * He gave each of his brothers 1/7 of $343.

2. Calculate the amount Toby gave to each of his brothers:
   * 1/7 of $343 = $343 รท 7
   * $343 รท 7 = $49
   * So, Toby gave $49 to each of his brothers.

3. Calculate the total amount Toby gave to his brothers:
   * Toby gave $49...
