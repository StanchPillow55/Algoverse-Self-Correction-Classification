=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the ratio of men to women**: The ratio of men to women is given as 5:9. This means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women.

2. **Set up the equation based on the ratio**: Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

3. **Calculate the total number of passengers**: The total number of passengers on the bus is given as 84. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   5x + 9x = 84
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   14x = 84
   \]

4. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   \[
   x = \frac{84}{14} = 6
   \]

5. **Find the number of men and women**:
   - Number of men:
     \[
     5x = 5 \times 6 = 30
     \]
   - Number of women:
     \[
     9x = 9 \times 6 = 54
     \]

6. **Determine how many women alight from the bus**: We know that 20 women alight from the bus.

7. **Calculate the remaining number of women**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining women} = \text{Initial number of women} - \text{Women alighting}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining women} = 54 - 20 = 34
   \]

8. **Final answer**: The number of women remaining on the bus after 20 women alight is:
   \[
   \boxed{34}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9.
- The total number of passengers on the bus is 84.
- 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop.

Step 1: Find the total number of men and women on the bus.
Ratio of men to women = 5:9
Total number of passengers = 84
Let's represent the number of men as 5x and the number of women as 9x, where x is a common factor.
5x + 9x = 84
14x = 84
x = 6
Numb...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially, and then calculate how many women remain after some have alighted.

### Step 1: Determine the initial number of men and women

The ratio of men to women on the bus is given as 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. Let's denote the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers on the bu...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9. This means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total ratio is therefore 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

The total number of passengers on the bus is 84. This means that each part in the ratio represents 84 รท 14 = 6 passengers.

Since the ratio of women is 9, there were originally 9 ร 6 = 54 women on the bus.

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is 54 - 20 = 34 women.

Therefore...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9.
   * The total number of passengers on the bus is 84.
   * 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop.

2. Find the total number of parts in the ratio:
   * Men : Women = 5 : 9
   * Total parts = Men + Women = 5 + 9 = 14

3. Calculate the number of men and women on the bus initially:
   * Each part represents: 84 รท ...
