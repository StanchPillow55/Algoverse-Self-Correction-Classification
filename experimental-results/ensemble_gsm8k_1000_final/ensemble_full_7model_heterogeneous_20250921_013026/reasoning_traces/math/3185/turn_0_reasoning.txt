=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many meals Gordon's three restaurants serve per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of meals served per day by all three restaurants.**
   - First restaurant serves: 20 meals
   - Second restaurant serves: 40 meals
   - Third restaurant serves: 50 meals

   We add these numbers together to find the total meals served per day:

   \[
   \text{Total meals per day} = 20 + 40 + 50
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   20 + 40 = 60
   \]
   \[
   60 + 50 = 110
   \]

   So, the total number of meals served per day by all three restaurants is **110 meals**.

2. **Calculate the total number of meals served per week.**
   - There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the total meals served per day by the number of days in a week:

   \[
   \text{Total meals per week} = \text{Total meals per day} \times 7
   \]

   Substituting the value we found:

   \[
   \text{Total meals per week} = 110 \times 7
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   110 \times 7 = 770
   \]

Thus, the total number of meals served by Gordon's three restaurants per week is **770 meals**.

Final answer: **770 meals**.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many meals each restaurant serves per day, then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

Gordon's first restaurant serves 20 meals per day. So in a week (7 days), it serves 20 meals/day * 7 days/week = 140 meals/week.

His second restaurant serves 40 meals per day. So in a week, it serves 40 meals/day * 7 days/week = 280 meals/week.

His third restaurant serves 50 meals per day. So in a week, it serves 50 meals/d...
