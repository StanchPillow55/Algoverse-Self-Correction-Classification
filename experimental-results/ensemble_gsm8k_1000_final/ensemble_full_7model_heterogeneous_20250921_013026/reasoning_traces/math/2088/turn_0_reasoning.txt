=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine the cost per serving of Sam's spaghetti and meatballs dinner, we need to calculate the total cost of all the ingredients and then divide that total by the number of servings.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the ingredients

1. **Cost of pasta**: 
   - Sam needs 1 box of pasta, which costs $1.00.
   - Total cost for pasta = $1.00

2. **Cost of sauce**: 
   - Sam needs 1 jar of sauce, which costs $2.00.
   - Total cost for sauce = $2.00

3. **Cost of meatballs**: 
   - Sam needs 1 pound of meatballs, which costs $5.00.
   - Total cost for meatballs = $5.00

### Step 2: Add up the total cost of all ingredients

Now, we sum the costs of all the ingredients:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Pasta} + \text{Cost of Sauce} + \text{Cost of Meatballs}
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 1.00 + 2.00 + 5.00
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 8.00
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost per serving

Sam wants to stretch this meal into 8 servings. To find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[
\text{Cost per Serving} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of Servings}}
\]

\[
\text{Cost per Serving} = \frac{8.00}{8}
\]

\[
\text{Cost per Serving} = 1.00
\]

### Final Answer

The cost of each serving is **$1.00**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The pasta costs $1.00 per box.
- A jar of sauce costs $2.00.
- 1 pound of meatballs costs $5.00.
- Sam wants to stretch this meal into 8 servings.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the ingredients.
Cost of pasta = $1.00 per box
Cost of sauce = $2.00 per jar
Cost of meatballs = $5.00 per pound
Total cost of ingredients = $1.00 + $2.00 + $5.00 = $8.00

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine the cost per serving of Sam's spaghetti and meatballs meal, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide that total by the number of servings.

Let's break down the costs:

1. **Cost of Pasta:**
   - The pasta costs $1.00 per box. 
   - Assume Sam uses 1 box of pasta for the meal.

   \[
   \text{Total cost of pasta} = 1 \times 1.00 = \$1.00
   \]

2. **Cost of Sauce:**
   - A jar of sauce costs $2.00.
   - Assume Sam uses 1 jar of ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we first need to add up the total cost of the ingredients. 

The cost of the pasta is $1.00, the sauce is $2.00, and the meatballs are $5.00. 

So, the total cost of the ingredients is $1.00 + $2.00 + $5.00 = $8.00.

Sam wants to stretch this meal into 8 servings. To find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost of the ingredients by the number of servings. 

So, $8.00 รท 8 servings = $1.00 per serving.

Therefore, each serving of spaghetti and...
