=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of meals available**: 
   Colt and Curt initially prepared 113 meals. Sole Mart provided an additional 50 meals. Therefore, the total number of meals can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total meals} = \text{Meals prepared by Colt and Curt} + \text{Meals provided by Sole Mart}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total meals} = 113 + 50 = 163
   \]

2. **Determine how many meals have been given away**: 
   According to the problem, Colt and Curt have already given away 85 meals.

3. **Calculate the remaining meals**: 
   To find out how many meals are left to be distributed, we subtract the number of meals given away from the total number of meals:

   \[
   \text{Remaining meals} = \text{Total meals} - \text{Meals given away}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining meals} = 163 - 85 = 78
   \]

Thus, the number of meals left to be distributed is:

\[
\boxed{78}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Colt and Curt initially prepared 113 meals.
- Unexpectedly, Sole Mart provided 50 more meals.
- Colt and Curt have already given away 85 meals.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of meals available.
Initial meals prepared by Colt and Curt = 113
Additional meals provided by Sole Mart = 50
Total meals available = 113 + 50 = 163 meals

Step 2: Calculate the number of meals that have already...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many meals are left to be distributed after accounting for the meals prepared, the additional meals provided, and the meals already given away.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Meals Prepared:**
   Colt and Curt initially prepared 113 meals.

2. **Additional Meals Provided:**
   Sole Mart unexpectedly provided an additional 50 meals.

   To find the total number of meals available after the addition...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Colt and Curt initially prepared 113 meals. Sole Mart provided an additional 50 meals. Therefore, the total number of meals is 113 meals + 50 meals = 163 meals.

Colt and Curt have already given away 85 meals. Therefore, the number of meals left to be distributed is the total number of meals minus the number of meals already given away.

So, 163 meals - 85 meals = 78 meals.

Therefore, there are 78 more meals left to be distributed.

--- Model 7 Response ---
