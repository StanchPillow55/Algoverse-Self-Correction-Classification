=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much Pam had in her bank account at the beginning of the year, we can work through the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the problem**: 
   - Let \( x \) be the initial balance in Pam's bank account at the beginning of the year.
   - According to the problem, her balance tripled during the year. Therefore, at the end of the year, her balance would be \( 3x \).
   - After tripling her balance, Pam withdrew $250. Thus, her balance after the withdrawal would be \( 3x - 250 \).
   - We know that after this withdrawal, her current balance is $950.

2. **Setting up the equation**:
   - We can set up the equation based on the information given:
   \[
   3x - 250 = 950
   \]

3. **Solving the equation**:
   - First, we will add 250 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   3x - 250 + 250 = 950 + 250
   \]
   \[
   3x = 1200
   \]

   - Next, we will divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{1200}{3}
   \]
   \[
   x = 400
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the amount Pam had in her bank account at the beginning of the year was **$400**.

Final answer: **$400**.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the current balance to find the initial balance at the beginning of the year.

Given information:
- Pam's bank account balance tripled during the year.
- At the end of the year, Pam withdrew $250.
- Pam's current balance is $950.

Step 1: Find the balance of the account before the $250 withdrawal.
Current balance + Withdrawal = Balance before withdrawal
$950 + $250 = $1,200

Step 2: Find the balance...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given about Pam's bank account.

1. **Understand the final situation:**
   - At the end of the year, after withdrawing $250, Pam's balance is $950.

2. **Determine the balance before the withdrawal:**
   - Since Pam withdrew $250 and was left with $950, we can find the balance before the withdrawal by adding the $250 back to the $950.
   \[
   \text{Balance before withdrawal} = 950 + 250 = 1200
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the initial amount of money Pam had in her bank account at the beginning of the year as X.

According to the problem, Pam's bank account balance tripled during the year. So, by the end of the year, she had 3X dollars in her account.

Then, Pam withdrew $250 from her account. This means that she subtracted $250 from the tripled amount, which gives us 3X - $250.

We know that after this withdrawal, Pam's current balance is $950. So, we can set up the following ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Pam's bank account balance tripled during the year.
   * At the end of the year, she withdrew $250.
