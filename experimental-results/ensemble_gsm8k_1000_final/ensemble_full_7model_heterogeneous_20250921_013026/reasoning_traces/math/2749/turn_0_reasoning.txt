=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many baskets Alex made:**
   - According to the problem, Alex made 8 baskets.

2. **Calculate how many baskets Sandra made:**
   - The problem states that Sandra made three times as many baskets as Alex. 
   - Therefore, we can calculate Sandra's baskets as follows:
     \[
     \text{Sandra's baskets} = 3 \times \text{Alex's baskets} = 3 \times 8 = 24
     \]

3. **Calculate how many baskets Hector made:**
   - The problem states that Hector made two times the number of baskets that Sandra made.
   - We can calculate Hector's baskets as follows:
     \[
     \text{Hector's baskets} = 2 \times \text{Sandra's baskets} = 2 \times 24 = 48
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of baskets made by Alex, Sandra, and Hector:**
   - Now we need to add the number of baskets made by each person:
     \[
     \text{Total baskets} = \text{Alex's baskets} + \text{Sandra's baskets} + \text{Hector's baskets}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total baskets} = 8 + 24 + 48
     \]

5. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add Alex's and Sandra's baskets:
     \[
     8 + 24 = 32
     \]
   - Now add Hector's baskets:
     \[
     32 + 48 = 80
     \]

Thus, the total number of baskets made by Alex, Sandra, and Hector is:
\[
\text{Total baskets} = 80
\]

**Final Answer:**
The total number of baskets made by Alex, Sandra, and Hector is **80**.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many baskets Sandra made. Since Sandra made three times as many baskets as Alex, we multiply Alex's number of baskets by 3:

8 baskets * 3 = 24 baskets

So, Sandra made 24 baskets.

Next, let's find out how many baskets Hector made. Since Hector made two times the number of baskets that Sandra made, we multiply Sandra's number of baskets by 2:

24 baskets * 2 = 48 baskets

So, Hector made 48 baskets.

Finally, to find out how many baskets they ma...
