=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Mia has based on the information given about Darwin's money.

1. **Identify how much money Darwin has**: 
   According to the problem, Darwin has $45.

2. **Understand the relationship between Mia's and Darwin's money**: 
   The problem states that Mia has $20 more than twice the amount of money Darwin has. We can express this relationship with a mathematical equation.

3. **Set up the equation**:
   Let \( D \) represent the amount of money Darwin has, and let \( M \) represent the amount of money Mia has. The relationship can be expressed as:
   \[
   M = 2D + 20
   \]

4. **Substitute Darwin's amount into the equation**:
   Since we know that \( D = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:
   \[
   M = 2(45) + 20
   \]

5. **Calculate twice Darwin's amount**:
   First, calculate \( 2 \times 45 \):
   \[
   2 \times 45 = 90
   \]

6. **Add $20 to this result**:
   Now, add $20 to the result from the previous step:
   \[
   M = 90 + 20
   \]

7. **Final calculation**:
   \[
   M = 110
   \]

8. **Conclusion**:
   Therefore, Mia has $110.

Final answer: Mia has $110.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mia has $20 more than twice as much money as Darwin.
- Darwin has $45.

Step 1: Find how much money Darwin has.
Darwin has $45.

Step 2: Find how much money Mia has.
Mia has $20 more than twice as much money as Darwin.
Twice as much money as Darwin = 2 × $45 = $90
Mia has $20 more than $90, so Mia has $90 + $20 = $110.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Mia has $110.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Mia has based on the information given about Darwin's money.

1. **Identify the known values:**
   - Darwin has $45.

2. **Understand the relationship between Mia's and Darwin's money:**
   - Mia has $20 more than twice the amount of money Darwin has.

3. **Translate the relationship into a mathematical expression:**
   - Let \( D \) represent the amount of money Darwin has. According to the problem, \( D = 45 \)....

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much twice as much money as Darwin has. Since Darwin has $45, twice as much money as Darwin has would be 2 * $45 = $90.

The problem states that Mia has $20 more than twice as much money as Darwin has. So, we add the $20 to the $90.

$90 + $20 = $110

So, Mia has $110.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to set up an equation and solve for the amount of money Mia has.

Given:
- Mia has $20 more than twice as much money as Darwin.
- Darwin has $45.

Step 1: Let's express Mia's money in terms of Darwin's.
Mia's money = 2 × Darwin's money + $20

Step 2: Substitute the amount of money Darwin has into the equation.
Mia's money = 2 × $45 + $20

Step 3: Solve the equation by first mu...
