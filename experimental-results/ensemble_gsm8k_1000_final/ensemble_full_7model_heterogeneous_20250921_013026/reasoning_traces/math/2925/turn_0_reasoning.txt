=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many seats were taken in the school play given the total number of seats and the number of unoccupied seats.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of seats.**

We know that there are 40 rows of chairs and each row has 20 chairs. To find the total number of seats, we multiply the number of rows by the number of chairs per row:

\[
\text{Total seats} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Chairs per row}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total seats} = 40 \times 20
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total seats} = 800
\]

So, there are a total of 800 seats.

**Step 2: Determine the number of occupied seats.**

We are told that 10 seats were not occupied. To find the number of occupied seats, we subtract the number of unoccupied seats from the total number of seats:

\[
\text{Occupied seats} = \text{Total seats} - \text{Unoccupied seats}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Occupied seats} = 800 - 10
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Occupied seats} = 790
\]

**Final Answer:**

The number of seats that were taken is \( \boxed{790} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 40 rows of chairs set up for the school play.
- Each row has 20 chairs.
- Only 10 seats were not occupied.

To find the number of seats that were taken, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of chairs set up.
Total number of chairs = Number of rows × Number of chairs per row
Total number of chairs = 40 × 20 = 800 chairs

Step 2: Calculate the number of se...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of seats that were taken for the school play.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Seats

First, we need to find out how many seats were set up in total. We know there are 40 rows of chairs and each row contains 20 chairs. To find the total number of seats, we multiply the number of rows by the number of chairs per row:

\[
\text{Total number of seats} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Number of chairs ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out the total number of chairs that were set up for the school play. We do this by multiplying the number of rows by the number of chairs in each row. 

So, 40 rows * 20 chairs/row = 800 chairs in total.

Next, we know that 10 seats were not occupied. To find out how many seats were taken, we subtract the number of unoccupied seats from the total number of seats.

So, 800 chairs - 10 unoccupied chairs = 790 chairs were taken.

Therefore, 790 seats w...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 40 rows of chairs set up for the school play.
   * Each row has 20 chairs.
   * Only 10 seats were not occupied.

2. Calculate the total number of seats:
   * Total seats = Number of rows × Chairs per row
   * Total seats = 40 × 20
   * Total seats = 800
   
   So, there are 800 seats in total.

3. Find the number of occupied seats:
