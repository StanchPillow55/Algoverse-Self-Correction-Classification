Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of puppies John gives away:**
   - John has a total of 8 puppies.
   - He gives away half of them: 
     \[
     \text{Puppies given away} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of puppies remaining after giving some away:**
   - After giving away 4 puppies, the number of puppies left is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining puppies} = 8 - 4 = 4
     \]

3. **Identify the number of puppies John keeps:**
   - John keeps one of the remaining puppies, so:
     \[
     \text{Puppies kept} = 1
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of puppies available for sale:**
   - The number of puppies left for sale after keeping one is:
     \[
     \text{Puppies for sale} = 4 - 1 = 3
     \]

5. **Determine the total revenue from selling the puppies:**
   - Each of the 3 puppies is sold for $600, so the total revenue from selling the puppies is:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = 3 \times 600 = 1800
     \]

6. **Account for the cost paid to the owner of the stud:**
   - John has to pay the owner of the stud $300, so we subtract this cost from the total revenue to find the profit:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Cost to stud owner} = 1800 - 300 = 1500
     \]

7. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, John's profit from selling the puppies is:
     \[
     \boxed{1500}
     \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. John's dog has a litter of 8 puppies.
2. He gives away half of them.
   * 8 puppies / 2 = 4 puppies given away
   * 8 puppies - 4 puppies = 4 puppies remaining

3. He keeps one of the remaining puppies.
   * 4 puppies - 1 puppy = 3 puppies remaining

4. He sells the remaining 3 puppies for $600 each.
   * 3 puppies x $600 = $1,800 total

5. He had to give the owner of the stud $300.
   * $1,800 - $...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculations step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Puppies:**
   - John starts with a litter of 8 puppies.

2. **Giving Away Half of the Puppies:**
   - John gives away half of the puppies. To find out how many puppies he gives away, we calculate half of 8:
     \[
     \frac{8}{2} = 4
     \]
   - So, John gives away 4 puppies.

3. **Remaining Puppies After Giving Away:**
   - After giving away 4 puppie...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): John's dog has a litter of 8 puppies. If he gives away half of them, he gives away 8/2 = <<8/2=4>>4 puppies.

This leaves him with 8 - 4 = <<8-4=4>>4 puppies.

He keeps one of these puppies, so he sells 4 - 1 = <<4-1=3>>3 puppies.

He sells each of these puppies for $600, so he makes 3 * $600 = $<<3*600=1800>>1800 from selling puppies.

He had to give the owner of the stud $300, so his profit is $1800 - $300 = $<<1800-300=1500>>1500.

So, John's profit is $1500.
