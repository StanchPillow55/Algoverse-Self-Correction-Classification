Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to find out how much more a pint of strawberries costs when they are not on sale compared to when they are on sale.

1. **Identify the variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the price per pint of strawberries when they are not on sale.
   - Let \( y \) be the price per pint of strawberries when they are on sale.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given**:
   - The supermarket sold 54 pints of strawberries for a total of $216 when they were on sale. This gives us the equation:
     \[
     54y = 216
     \]
   - From this equation, we can solve for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{216}{54} = 4
     \]
   - So, the price per pint when on sale is \( y = 4 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the price without the sale**:
   - We know that selling the same number of pints without the sale would have made them $108 more than what they made on sale. Therefore, the total revenue without the sale is:
     \[
     216 + 108 = 324
     \]
   - This gives us another equation:
     \[
     54x = 324
     \]
   - Now, we can solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{324}{54} = 6
     \]
   - So, the price per pint when not on sale is \( x = 6 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the difference in price**:
   - The difference in price per pint between the sale price and the regular price is:
     \[
     x - y = 6 - 4 = 2
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the amount by which the price of a pint of strawberries increases when not on sale is \( \boxed{2} \) dollars.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of a pint of strawberries when it's not on sale and then calculate the difference between the sale price and the regular price.

Given information:
- The supermarket sold 54 pints of strawberries during the sale.
- They made $216 from the sale.
- They would have made $108 more if the strawberries were not on sale.

Step 1: Find the regular price of a pint of strawberries.
Let's assume the regular price o...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the difference in price per pint of strawberries between the sale price and the regular price. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Sale Price per Pint:**
   - The supermarket sold 54 pints of strawberries for a total of $216.
   - To find the sale price per pint, we divide the total revenue by the number of pints sold:
     \[
     \text{Sale Price per Pint} = \frac{\text{Total Revenue}}{\text{Number o...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the sale price of a pint of strawberries as S and the regular price as R. 

From the problem, we know that the supermarket sold 54 pints of strawberries for $216. Therefore, we can write the equation:

54S = $216

Solving for S, we get:

S = $216 / 54 = $4

This means that each pint of strawberries was sold for $4 during the sale.

We also know from the problem that the supermarket would have made $108 more if the strawberries were sold at the regular price. ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The supermarket sold 54 pints of strawberries on sale.
   * They made $216 from the sale.
   * If they had sold the same number of pints without the sale, they would have made $108 more.

2. Calculate the total amount they would have made without the sale:
   * Amount without sale = Amount with sale + Additional amount
   * Amount without sale = $216 + $108
   * ...
