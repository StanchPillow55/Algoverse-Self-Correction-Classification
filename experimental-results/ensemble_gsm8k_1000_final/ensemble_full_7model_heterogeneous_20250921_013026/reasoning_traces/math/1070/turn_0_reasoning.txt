=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many eggs Jason will consume in two weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of eggs Jason eats per day**: According to the problem, Jason eats 3 eggs every morning.

2. **Calculate the number of days in two weeks**: 
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, in two weeks, the number of days is:
     \[
     2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed in two weeks**:
   - Since Jason eats 3 eggs each day, we can find the total number of eggs consumed over the 14 days by multiplying the number of eggs per day by the number of days:
     \[
     3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ eggs}
     \]

4. **Final answer**: Jason will consume a total of 42 eggs in two weeks.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{42}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of eggs Jason consumes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in two weeks.

Given information:
- Jason eats an omelet made using three eggs every morning.

Step 1: Find the number of eggs Jason consumes in a day.
Number of eggs per omelet × Number of omelets per day = Number of eggs consumed per day
3 eggs × 1 omelet = 3 eggs consumed per day

Step 2: Find the number of days in two weeks....

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many eggs Jason consumes in two weeks if he eats an omelet made with three eggs every morning.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of days in two weeks:**
   - A week consists of 7 days.
   - Therefore, two weeks consist of:
     \[
     2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ days}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of eggs consumed per day:**
   - Jason eats an omelet made with 3 eggs every morning.
   -...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Jason eats an omelet made using three eggs every morning. This means that in one day, he consumes 3 eggs.

In a week, which has 7 days, the number of eggs he consumes is 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

Therefore, in two weeks, Jason will consume 21 eggs/week * 2 weeks = 42 eggs.

So, Jason will consume 42 eggs in two weeks.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jason eats an omelet made with three eggs every morning.
   * We need to find out how many eggs Jason will consume in two weeks.

2. Determine the number of days in two weeks:
   * 1 week = 7 days
   * 2 weeks = 7 days × 2
   * 2 weeks = 14 days

3. Calculate the number of eggs consumed per day:
   * Jason uses 3 eggs to make his omelet each morning.
   * So, he ...
