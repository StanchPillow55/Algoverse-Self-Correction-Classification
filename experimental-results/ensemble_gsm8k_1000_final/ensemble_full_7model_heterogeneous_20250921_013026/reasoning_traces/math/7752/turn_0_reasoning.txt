=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let \( R \) be Ruby's current age and \( S \) be Sam's current age. According to the problem, we have the following two relationships:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
   \[
   R = 6S
   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation.

Substituting \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Now, we will simplify the right side of the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Next, we will isolate \( S \) by moving all terms involving \( S \) to one side and constant terms to the other side. Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[
6S - 3S + 9 = 27
\]
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Now, subtract 9 from both sides:
\[
3S = 27 - 9
\]
\[
3S = 18
\]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( S \):
\[
S = \frac{18}{3} = 6
\]

Thus, Sam's current age is \( S = 6 \).

To find Ruby's current age, we can substitute \( S \) back into the equation for \( R \):
\[
R = 6S = 6 \times 6 = 36
\]

Now, let's verify the second condition:
In 9 years, Sam will be:
\[
S + 9 = 6 + 9 = 15
\]
In 9 years, Ruby will be:
\[
R + 9 = 36 + 9 = 45
\]

We check if Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[
3 \times 15 = 45
\]

Since both conditions are satisfied, we conclude that the solution is correct.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Sam's current age is } \boxed{6}.
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information and then solve for Sam's current age.

Given information:
- Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
- In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be Sam's current age.
- Then, Ruby's current age is 6x.

Step 1: Set up the equation based on the information that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.
Ruby's age in 9 years = 6x + ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( R \) as Ruby's current age.
- \( S \) as Sam's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
   \[
   R = 6S
   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, let's solve this system of equations step by step.

### Step 1: Substitute the first equation ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote Sam's current age as S and Ruby's current age as R. 

From the problem, we know two things:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which can be written as R = 6S.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

We can now solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of S and R.

Let's substitute the first equation (R = 6S) into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

This simplifies to:

6S + 9 = 3S + ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find Sam's current age.

Given:
- Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
- In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

Step 1: Let's express Ruby's current age in terms of Sam's age.
Ruby's age = 6 × Sam's age

Step 2: Express Ruby's age in 9 years.
Ruby's age in 9 years = Ruby's current age + 9
Ruby's age in 9 years = 6 × Sam's age + 9

Step 3: Express Sam's age in 9 years.
Sam's age in 9 years ...
