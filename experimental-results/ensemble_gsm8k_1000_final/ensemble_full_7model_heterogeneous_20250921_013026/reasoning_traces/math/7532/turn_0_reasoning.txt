=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of raspberries on the bush, we need to calculate the total number of fruit from the clusters and then add the number of individual fruit.

1. **Calculate the total number of fruit in the clusters:**
   - There are 6 clusters, and each cluster has 20 fruit.
   - We can calculate the total number of fruit in the clusters by multiplying the number of clusters by the number of fruit per cluster:
     \[
     \text{Total fruit in clusters} = \text{Number of clusters} \times \text{Fruit per cluster} = 6 \times 20
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     6 \times 20 = 120
     \]
   - So, there are 120 fruit in the clusters.

2. **Add the individual fruit:**
   - We know there are 67 individual fruit scattered across the bush.
   - To find the total number of raspberries, we add the total from the clusters to the individual fruit:
     \[
     \text{Total raspberries} = \text{Total fruit in clusters} + \text{Individual fruit} = 120 + 67
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     120 + 67 = 187
     \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of raspberries on the bush is:
     \[
     \boxed{187}
     \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of raspberries on the bush by adding the number of raspberries in the clusters and the number of individual raspberries.

Given information:
- The raspberry bush has 6 clusters of 20 fruit each.
- The raspberry bush has 67 individual fruit scattered across the bush.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters.
Number of clusters × Number of fruit per cluster = Total number ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of raspberries on the bush by considering both the clusters of fruit and the individual scattered fruit.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Raspberries in Clusters:**

   We are given that there are 6 clusters of raspberries, and each cluster contains 20 raspberries. To find the total number of raspberries in all the clusters, we multiply the number of clusters by the number of rasp...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many raspberries are in the clusters. We do this by multiplying the number of clusters by the number of fruit in each cluster. 

So, 6 clusters * 20 fruit/cluster = 120 fruit.

Next, we add the number of individual fruit to the number of fruit in the clusters to find the total number of raspberries.

So, 120 fruit + 67 fruit = 187 fruit.

Therefore, there are a total of 187 raspberries on the bush.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The raspberry bush has 6 clusters of fruit
- Each cluster has 20 fruit
- There are also 67 individual fruit scattered across the bush

Step 1: Calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters.
- Each cluster has 20 fruit
- There are 6 clusters
To find the total, multiply the number of clusters by the number of fruit per cluster:
6 clusters × 20 fruit/cluster = 120 fruit in cluster...
