=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many stickers Riku has, we start by understanding the relationship between the number of stickers Riku has and the number of stickers Kristoff has.

1. **Identify the number of stickers Kristoff has**: 
   Kristoff has 85 stickers.

2. **Understand the relationship**: 
   Riku has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff. This means we need to multiply the number of stickers Kristoff has by 25 to find out how many stickers Riku has.

3. **Set up the calculation**: 
   We can express the number of stickers Riku has (let's call it \( R \)) as:
   \[
   R = 25 \times \text{(number of stickers Kristoff has)}
   \]
   Substituting in the number of stickers Kristoff has:
   \[
   R = 25 \times 85
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication**:
   Now we calculate \( 25 \times 85 \):
   \[
   25 \times 85 = 2125
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: 
   Therefore, Riku has 2125 stickers.

Final answer: Riku has **2125 stickers**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of stickers Riku has and the number of stickers Kristoff has, and then use that information to calculate the number of stickers Riku has.

Given information:
- Riku has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff.
- Kristoff has 85 stickers.

Step 1: Understand the relationship between Riku's and Kristoff's stickers.
Riku has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff.
This means that Riku'...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of determining how many stickers Riku has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given that Kristoff has 85 stickers.
   - Riku has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff.

2. **Translate the Problem into a Mathematical Expression:**
   - If Kristoff has 85 stickers, and Riku has 25 times more than Kristoff, we can express the number of stickers Riku has as:
     \[
     \text{Riku's stickers} = 25 \times \text{Kris...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to multiply the number of stickers Kristoff has by 25 because Riku has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff.

So, we calculate:

85 (Kristoff's stickers) * 25 = 2125

Therefore, Riku has 2125 stickers.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to calculate how many stickers Riku has.

Given:
- Riku has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff.
- Kristoff has 85 stickers.

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the relationship between Riku's and Kristoff's stickers.
Let's denote Riku's stickers as R and Kristoff's stickers as K.
R = 25 Ã— K

Step 2: Substitute the known value of Kristoff's stickers into the equation.
K ...
