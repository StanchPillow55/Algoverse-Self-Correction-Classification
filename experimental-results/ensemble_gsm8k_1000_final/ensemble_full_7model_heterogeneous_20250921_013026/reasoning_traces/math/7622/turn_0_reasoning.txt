=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to establish relationships between the number of Facebook friends that Charlie, Dorothy, and James have.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( D \) represent the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has.
   - According to the problem, Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, so we can express Charlie's friends as:
     \[
     C = 3D
     \]
   - James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we can express James's friends as:
     \[
     J = 4D
     \]

2. **Given information:**
   - We know that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook:
     \[
     C = 12
     \]

3. **Set up the equation using Charlie's friends:**
   - From the relationship we established earlier, we can substitute \( C \) with 12:
     \[
     3D = 12
     \]

4. **Solve for \( D \):**
   - To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
     \[
     D = \frac{12}{3} = 4
     \]
   - So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

5. **Calculate James's friends:**
   - Now that we know \( D \), we can find the number of friends James has using the equation for \( J \):
     \[
     J = 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16
     \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook.

In conclusion, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
- James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
- Charlie has 12 Facebook friends.

Step 1: Find the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has.
Since Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, we can use the following equation:
Charlie's friends = 3 × Dorothy's friends
12 = 3 × Dorothy's friends
Doroth...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Facebook friends James has, given the relationships between the number of friends Charlie, Dorothy, and James have.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( D \) represent the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has.
   - According to the problem, Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, Charlie's number of friends can be expressed as \( 3D \).
   - James ha...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

3D = 12

where D represents the number of Dorothy's Facebook friends. To solve for D, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

D = 12 / 3
D = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.

Next, we need to find out how many Facebook friends James has. Since James has four times as many fri...
