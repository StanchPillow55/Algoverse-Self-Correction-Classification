=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to establish some variables and equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( T \) = points scored by Taro
- \( V \) = points scored by Vlad
- \( P \) = total points scored by both Taro and Vlad

From the problem, we know that:
1. Taro and Vlad earn 5 points for every win.
2. They played a total of 30 rounds, so the total points scored can be expressed as:
   \[
   P = T + V
   \]
3. Taro scored 4 points less than \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total points scored. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   T = \frac{3}{5}P - 4
   \]

Now, since each round results in 5 points being awarded (for a win), the total points scored can also be calculated as:
\[
P = 5 \times \text{(number of wins)}
\]
Since they played 30 rounds, the maximum total points scored can be:
\[
P = 5 \times 30 = 150
\]

Now we can substitute \( P \) into the equation for \( T \):
\[
T = \frac{3}{5}(150) - 4
\]
Calculating \( \frac{3}{5}(150) \):
\[
\frac{3}{5}(150) = 90
\]
Now substituting this back into the equation for \( T \):
\[
T = 90 - 4 = 86
\]

Now that we have \( T \), we can find \( V \):
\[
P = T + V \implies 150 = 86 + V
\]
Solving for \( V \):
\[
V = 150 - 86 = 64
\]

Thus, the total points scored by Vlad is:
\[
\boxed{64}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Taro and Vlad earn 5 points for every win.
- They played a total of 30 rounds.
- Taro scored 4 points less than 3/5 of the total points scored.

Step 1: Find the total points scored in the 30 rounds.
Total points scored = 5 points per win × 30 rounds = 150 points

Step 2: Find Taro's score.
Taro's score = 3/5 of the total points scored - 4 points
Taro's score = (3/5 × 150) - 4 = 9...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total points scored by Vlad, given the conditions of the game and Taro's score.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( T \) be the total points scored by Taro.
   - Let \( V \) be the total points scored by Vlad.
   - The total points scored by both Taro and Vlad together is \( T + V \).

2. **Points per Win:**
   - Each win earns 5 points. Since they played 30 rounds, the total nu...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many total points were scored in the competition. Since each win earns 5 points and there were 30 rounds, the total points scored would be 5 points/round * 30 rounds = 150 points.

According to the problem, Taro scored 4 points less than 3/5 of the total points scored. So, let's find out how many points Taro scored. 

3/5 of the total points scored is (3/5) * 150 points = 90 points. 

Since Taro scored 4 points less than this, Taro scored 90 poin...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Taro and Vlad earn 5 points for every win.
   * They played a total of 30 rounds.
   * Taro scored 4 points less than 3/5 of the total points scored.

2. Calculate the total points scored by both Taro and Vlad:
   * Total rounds played = 30
   * Points per win = 5
   * Total points scored = 30 × 5 = 150 points

3. Calculate 3/5 of the total points:
   * 3/5 of to...
