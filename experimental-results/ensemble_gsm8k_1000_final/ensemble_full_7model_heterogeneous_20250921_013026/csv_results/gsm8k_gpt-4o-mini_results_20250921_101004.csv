To find out how much she makes from haircuts, we multiply the number of haircuts by the earnings per haircut:
\text{Total earnings from haircuts} = \text{Number of haircuts} \times \text{Earnings per haircut}
\text{Total earnings from haircuts} = 8 \times 12 = 96

Jane sews 2 dresses a day for 7 days. We can calculate the total number of dresses sewn during this period as follows:
### Step 2: Calculate the number of dresses sewn in the next 2 days.
Next, Jane sews 3 dresses a day for 2 days. We calculate the total number of dresses sewn during this period:

Final Answer: To solve the problem of how many quarts John drinks in a week, we need to follow these steps:
1. **Convert gallons to quarts**: We know that there are 4 quarts in 1 gallon. Therefore, to convert gallons to quarts, we multiply the number of gallons by 4.
2. **Calculate daily water intake in quarts**: Since John drinks 1.5 gallons of water a day, we can calculate his daily intake in quarts as follows:
3. **Calculate weekly water intake in quarts**: Now that we know John drinks 6 quarts of water each day, we can find out how much he drinks in a week (7 days) by multiplying his daily intake by 7:
Thus, after performing the calculations step by step, we find that John drinks a total of **42 quarts** of water in a week.

To find her annual salary, we multiply her monthly salary by the number of months in a year:
So, Sylvie's initial annual salary is $7200.
The increase is calculated as follows:
Therefore, the increase in her salary after five years is $720.

Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many minutes Lena and her brother played video games together last weekend.
Lena played for 3.5 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert hours to minutes by multiplying by 60.
So, Lena played for **210 minutes**.
According to the problem, her brother played 17 minutes more than Lena. Therefore, we add 17 minutes to Lena's playtime to find out how long her brother played.
So, her brother played for **227 minutes**.
