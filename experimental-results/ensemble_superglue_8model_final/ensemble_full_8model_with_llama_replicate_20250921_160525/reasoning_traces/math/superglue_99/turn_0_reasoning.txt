--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 99," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is incomplete and lacks specific details, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by assuming a hypothetical problem. Let's assume the problem involves solving a quadratic equation, which is a common type of math problem.

### Hypothetical Problem:
Solve the quadratic equation: \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 ...
