=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: It seems like you referenced "Sample reasoning question 54," but I don't have the specific details of that question. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems step by step. If you provide the specific question, I can give a detailed solution.

For now, let’s assume a hypothetical math problem to illustrate the process:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
The equation given is:
\[
2x + 3 = 11
\]

### Step 3: Isolate the Variable
To isolate \( x \), we first need to eliminate the constant term on the left side. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation.

\[
2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x = 8
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.

\[
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x = 4
\]

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation.

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
Calculating the left side:
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
Since both sides are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer
Thus, the solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]

If you have a specific math problem or question in mind, please provide it, and I will work through it step by step as demonstrated above.
