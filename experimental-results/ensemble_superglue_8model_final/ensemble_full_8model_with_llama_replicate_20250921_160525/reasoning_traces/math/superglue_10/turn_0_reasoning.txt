Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

Sample Reasoning Question 10:

Given information:
- The sum of two numbers is 45.
- The difference between the two numbers is 15.

Let's call the two numbers x and y.

Step 1: Write an equation for the sum of the two numbers.
x + y = 45

Step 2: Write an equation for the difference between the two numbers.
x - y = 15

Step 3: Solve the system of equations to find the values of x and y.
From the second equat...
