=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: It seems like your request is a bit vague, as "Sample reasoning question 300" does not specify a particular math problem. However, I can demonstrate how to solve a general math problem step by step. 

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A store sells pencils at $0.50 each and erasers at $0.75 each. If a student buys a total of 10 items (pencils and erasers) and spends $6.00, how many pencils and how many erasers did the student buy?

**Step 1: Define Variables**
Let:
- \( x \) = number of pencils
- \( y \) = number of erasers

**Step 2: Set Up Equations**
From the problem, we can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of items (pencils and erasers) is 10:
   \[
   x + y = 10
   \]

2. The total cost of the items is $6.00:
   \[
   0.50x + 0.75y = 6.00
   \]

**Step 3: Simplify the Cost Equation**
To make calculations easier, we can eliminate the decimals in the second equation by multiplying everything by 100:
\[
50x + 75y = 600
\]

**Step 4: Solve the System of Equations**
Now we have the following system of equations:
1. \( x + y = 10 \)
2. \( 50x + 75y = 600 \)

We can solve the first equation for \( y \):
\[
y = 10 - x
\]

Now, substitute \( y \) in the second equation:
\[
50x + 75(10 - x) = 600
\]

Distributing the 75:
\[
50x + 750 - 75x = 600
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
-25x + 750 = 600
\]

Subtract 750 from both sides:
\[
-25x = 600 - 750
\]
\[
-25x = -150
\]

Divide by -25:
\[
x = 6
\]

**Step 5: Find \( y \)**
Now substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
\[
y = 10 - 6 = 4
\]

**Step 6: Conclusion**
The student bought:
- \( x = 6 \) pencils
- \( y = 4 \) erasers

**Final Answer:**
The student bought 6 pencils and 4 erasers.
