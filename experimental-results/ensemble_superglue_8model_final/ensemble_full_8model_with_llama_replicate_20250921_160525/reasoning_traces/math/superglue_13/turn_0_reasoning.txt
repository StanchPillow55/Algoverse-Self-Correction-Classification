Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

Sample Reasoning Question 13:

Given information:
- The sum of three consecutive integers is 36.

To solve this problem, we need to find the three consecutive integers.

Let's represent the first integer as x.
Then, the second integer would be x + 1, and the third integer would be x + 2.

The sum of the three consecutive integers is 36, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 36

Simplifying t...
