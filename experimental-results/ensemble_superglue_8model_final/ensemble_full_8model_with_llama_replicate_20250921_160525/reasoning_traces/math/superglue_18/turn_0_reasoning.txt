Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

Sample Reasoning Question 18:

Given information:
- The sum of two numbers is 45.
- The difference between the two numbers is 9.

Let's define the two numbers as x and y.

Step 1: Write an equation for the sum of the two numbers.
x + y = 45

Step 2: Write an equation for the difference between the two numbers.
x - y = 9

Step 3: Solve the system of equations to find the values of x and y.
From the second eq...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): Without the actual problem, it's impossible to provide a solution. Please provide the math problem you need solved.

--- Model 8 Response ---
Model 8 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1) The question states that the sample reasoning question is number 18. However, no actual question or problem statement is provided.

2) Without a specific question or problem to solve, it is not possible to show any work, reasoning, or calculations.

3) Since no mathematical problem has been presented, there is no final answer to provide.

Therefore, in order to solve a math problem and show the work and reaso...
