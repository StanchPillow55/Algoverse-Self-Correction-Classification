=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: It seems like you referenced "Sample reasoning question 24," but I don't have the specific details of that question. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems step by step. If you provide me with the specific problem, I can give you a detailed solution.

Here’s a general framework for solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem**: Read the problem carefully and identify what is being asked. Look for key information and what you need to find.

2. **Identify the Given Information**: Write down all the known values and variables in the problem.

3. **Choose a Strategy**: Decide on the mathematical operations or formulas that might be useful in solving the problem. This could involve algebra, geometry, calculus, etc.

4. **Set Up the Equations**: If applicable, set up equations based on the relationships between the known and unknown values.

5. **Perform Calculations**: Carry out the necessary calculations step by step. Be careful with arithmetic and algebraic manipulations.

6. **Check Your Work**: Once you arrive at a solution, review your calculations and reasoning to ensure they are correct.

7. **State Your Final Answer**: Clearly present your final answer, including units if applicable.

If you provide the specific math problem, I can apply this framework and show you the complete reasoning and work for that particular question.
