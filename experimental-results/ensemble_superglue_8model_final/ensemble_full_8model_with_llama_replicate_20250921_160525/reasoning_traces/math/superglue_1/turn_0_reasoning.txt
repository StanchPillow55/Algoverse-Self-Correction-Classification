--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (openai:gpt-4): Without a specific question provided, I'll create a sample problem to solve.

Problem: Solve for x in the equation 3x - 7 = 2x + 5.

Step 1: The first step in solving this equation is to isolate the variable x. To do this, we need to get rid of 2x from the right side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2x from both sides of the equation.

3x - 2x = 2x - 2x + 5 + 7

This simplifies to:

x = 5 + 7

Step 2: Now, we just need to simplify the right side of the equat...
