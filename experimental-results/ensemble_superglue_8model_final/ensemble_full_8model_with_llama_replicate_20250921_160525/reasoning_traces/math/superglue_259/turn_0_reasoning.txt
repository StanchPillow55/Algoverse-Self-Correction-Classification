--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 259" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a generic math problem and demonstrate how to approach solving a typical math problem step by step. Let's assume the problem involves solving a quadratic equation, as this is a common type of math problem.

**Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**
