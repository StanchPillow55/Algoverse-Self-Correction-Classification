--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 212" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific type of reasoning or logic problem. Without specific details, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic reasoning problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Identify the Type of Problem**: Determine if it's a numerical reasoning, logical reasoning, pattern recognition...
