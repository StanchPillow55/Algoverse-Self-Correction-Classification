Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

Sample Reasoning Question 6:

Given information:
- The sum of two numbers is 45.
- The difference between the two numbers is 9.

Let's call the two numbers x and y.

Step 1: Write an equation for the sum of the two numbers.
x + y = 45

Step 2: Write an equation for the difference between the two numbers.
x - y = 9

Step 3: Solve the system of equations to find the values of x and y.
From the second equation...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 6" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. After reaching City B...
