Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 47." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. Let's consider a sample problem:

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variabl...
