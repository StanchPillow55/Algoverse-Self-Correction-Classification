Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

Sample Reasoning Question 19:

Given information:
- The sum of three consecutive integers is 36.

To solve this problem, we need to find the three consecutive integers.

Let's represent the first integer as x.
Then, the second integer will be x + 1, and the third integer will be x + 2.

The sum of the three consecutive integers is 36, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 36

Simplifying the...
