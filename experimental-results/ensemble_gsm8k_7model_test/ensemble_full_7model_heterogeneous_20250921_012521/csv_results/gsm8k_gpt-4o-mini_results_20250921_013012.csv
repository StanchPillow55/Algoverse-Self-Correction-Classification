Final Answer: To determine how much Weng earned for babysitting for 50 minutes, we can follow these steps:
1. **Convert the time worked from minutes to hours**: Since Weng earns $12 per hour, we need to express 50 minutes in terms of hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert minutes to hours by dividing the number of minutes by 60.
2. **Calculate the earnings**: Now that we know Weng worked \(\frac{5}{6}\) of an hour, we can calculate her earnings by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours worked.
