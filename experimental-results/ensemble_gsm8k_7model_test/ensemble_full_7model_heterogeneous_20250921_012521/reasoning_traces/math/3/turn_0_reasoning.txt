=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many pages Julie has read so far:**
   - Yesterday, Julie read 12 pages.
   - Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. Therefore, the number of pages she read today is:
     \[
     \text{Pages read today} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ pages}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of pages Julie has read:**
   - Total pages read so far is the sum of pages read yesterday and today:
     \[
     \text{Total pages read} = 12 + 24 = 36 \text{ pages}
     \]

3. **Determine how many pages are remaining in the book:**
   - The total number of pages in the book is 120. To find the remaining pages, we subtract the total pages read from the total pages in the book:
     \[
     \text{Remaining pages} = 120 - 36 = 84 \text{ pages}
     \]

4. **Calculate how many pages Julie wants to read tomorrow:**
   - Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow. Therefore, we calculate half of the remaining pages:
     \[
     \text{Pages to read tomorrow} = \frac{84}{2} = 42 \text{ pages}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Julie should read **42 pages** tomorrow.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{42}
\]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many pages Julie has read so far. 

Yesterday, she read 12 pages. Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pages. 

So, in total, Julie has read 12 + 24 = <<12+24=36>>36 pages so far. 

The book has 120 pages, so the number of pages she has left to read is 120 - 36 = <<120-36=84>>84 pages. 

If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, she should read 84 / 2 = <<84/2=42>>42 pages. 

So, Julie should rea...
