=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many clips Natalia sold in both April and May.

1. **Determine the number of clips sold in April**:
   - According to the problem, Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April.
   - Therefore, the number of clips sold in April is:
     \[
     \text{Clips sold in April} = 48
     \]

2. **Determine the number of clips sold in May**:
   - The problem states that she sold half as many clips in May as she did in April.
   - To find the number of clips sold in May, we calculate half of the clips sold in April:
     \[
     \text{Clips sold in May} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Clips sold in April} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48
     \]
   - Performing the calculation:
     \[
     \text{Clips sold in May} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of clips sold in April and May**:
   - Now, we add the number of clips sold in April to the number of clips sold in May to find the total:
     \[
     \text{Total clips sold} = \text{Clips sold in April} + \text{Clips sold in May} = 48 + 24
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     \text{Total clips sold} = 72
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of clips Natalia sold altogether in April and May is:
     \[
     \boxed{72}
     \]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): In April, Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends.

In May, she sold half as many clips as she did in April. To find out how many clips she sold in May, we divide the number of clips she sold in April by 2:
