=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Weng earned for babysitting for 50 minutes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert the time worked from minutes to hours**: Since Weng earns $12 per hour, we need to express 50 minutes in terms of hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert minutes to hours by dividing the number of minutes by 60.

   \[
   \text{Hours worked} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{50}{60} \text{ hours}
   \]

   Simplifying \(\frac{50}{60}\):

   \[
   \frac{50}{60} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the earnings**: Now that we know Weng worked \(\frac{5}{6}\) of an hour, we can calculate her earnings by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours worked.

   \[
   \text{Earnings} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours Worked}
   \]

   Substituting in the values:

   \[
   \text{Earnings} = 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \times \frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}
   \]

   To perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Earnings} = 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{12 \times 5}{6} = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Final answer**: Weng earned $10 for babysitting for 50 minutes.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting.
- Yesterday, she did 50 minutes of babysitting.

To find the amount Weng earned, we need to convert the time she worked (50 minutes) into hours and then multiply it by her hourly rate.

Step 1: Convert the time worked from minutes to hours.
50 minutes = 50 / 60 = 0.833 hours

Step 2: Calculate the amount earned by multiplying the time worked (in hours) b...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how much Weng earned for babysitting for 50 minutes at a rate of $12 per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert minutes to hours**: Since Weng's pay rate is given in dollars per hour, we need to convert the time she worked from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we convert 50 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

   \[
   \text{Hours worked} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = \frac{50}{60} \text{ hours}

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to convert the minutes into hours because Weng's rate is given in dollars per hour. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, 50 minutes is 50/60 = 0.833 hours.

Weng earns $12 per hour. So, for 0.833 hours of work, she would earn 0.833 * $12 = $10.

Therefore, Weng earned $10 for 50 minutes of babysitting.
