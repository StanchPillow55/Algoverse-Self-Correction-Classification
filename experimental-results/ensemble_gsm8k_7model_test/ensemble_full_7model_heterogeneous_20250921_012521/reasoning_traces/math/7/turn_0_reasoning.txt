Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Weight of the Box**: 
   Let the initial weight of the empty box be \( W \) pounds.

2. **Adding Jelly Beans**:
   Ken pours enough jelly beans into the box to bring the total weight to 2 pounds. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   W + \text{weight of jelly beans} = 2
   \]
   This means the weight of the jelly beans added is:
   \[
   \text{weight of jelly beans} = 2 - W
   \]

3. **Adding Brownies**:
   Next, Ken adds brownies that cause the weight to triple. The new weight after adding the brownies is:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   Therefore, the weight of the brownies added is:
   \[
   \text{weight of brownies} = 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Adding More Jelly Beans**:
   Ken then adds another 2 pounds of jelly beans. The new total weight becomes:
   \[
   6 + 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Adding Gummy Worms**:
   Finally, Ken adds enough gummy worms to double the weight. The new weight after adding the gummy worms is:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   Therefore, the weight of the gummy worms added is:
   \[
   \text{weight of gummy worms} = 16 - 8 = 8 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, let's summarize the total weight step by step:

- Initial weight of the box: \( W \) pounds
- After adding jelly beans: \( 2 \) pounds
- After adding brownies: \( 6 \) pounds
- After adding 2 pounds of jelly beans: \( 8 \) pounds
- After adding gummy worms: \( 16 \) pounds

Thus, the final weight of the box of goodies is:
\[
\boxed{16} \text{ pounds}
\]

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Weight of the Box**: 
   Let the initial weight of the empty box be \( W \) pounds.

2. **Adding Jelly Beans**:
   Ken pours enough jelly beans into the box to bring the total weight to 2 pounds. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   W + \text{weight of jelly beans} = 2

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Ken starts with a box on the scale, and adds enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.
   * Initial weight of the box = X pounds
   * Weight of jelly beans added = 2 - X pounds

2. Ken then adds enough brownies to triple the weight.
   * New weight = 3 * (2 - X) pounds

3. Ken then adds another 2 pounds of jelly beans.
   * New weight = 3 * (2 - X) + 2 pounds

4. Ken then adds enough gummy worms ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the weight of the box as Ken adds different items to it. We'll go through each step of the process and calculate the weight at each stage.

1. **Initial Weight with Jelly Beans:**
   - Ken starts by placing a box on a scale and adds jelly beans until the weight is 2 pounds.
   - Therefore, the initial weight of the box with jelly beans is 2 pounds.

2. **Adding Brownies:**
   - Ken then adds enough brownies to triple the ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Ken first added jelly beans to the box until it weighed 2 pounds.

2. Then, he added brownies which tripled the weight. So, the weight after adding the brownies is 2 pounds * 3 = 6 pounds.

3. Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans. So, the weight after adding more jelly beans is 6 pounds + 2 pounds = 8 pounds.

4. Finally, he added gummy worms which doubled the weight. So, the final weight after adding the gummy worm...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll keep track of the weight of the box as Ken adds each item.

Given:
- Ken starts with an empty box on a scale.
- He adds jelly beans until the weight reaches 2 pounds.
- He adds brownies until the weight triples.
- He adds another 2 pounds of jelly beans.
- Finally, he adds gummy worms until the weight doubles.

Step 1: Ken adds jelly beans to the empty box until the weight reaches 2 pounds.
