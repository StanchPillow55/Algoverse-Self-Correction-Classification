=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many pages James writes in a year, we can break the problem down into smaller steps.

1. **Identify the number of pages written per letter**: 
   James writes a 3-page letter.

2. **Identify the number of friends**: 
   He writes to 2 different friends.

3. **Calculate the total pages written per week**:
   Since James writes to 2 friends and each letter is 3 pages, the total pages he writes in one session (writing to both friends) is:
   \[
   \text{Pages per session} = 3 \text{ pages} \times 2 \text{ friends} = 6 \text{ pages}
   \]
   He does this twice a week, so the total pages he writes in a week is:
   \[
   \text{Pages per week} = 6 \text{ pages/session} \times 2 \text{ sessions/week} = 12 \text{ pages/week}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of weeks in a year**:
   There are 52 weeks in a year.

5. **Calculate the total pages written in a year**:
   To find the total number of pages written in a year, we multiply the number of pages he writes in a week by the number of weeks in a year:
   \[
   \text{Total pages in a year} = 12 \text{ pages/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 624 \text{ pages/year}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{624}
\] 

James writes a total of 624 pages in a year.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pages James writes in a year.

Given information:
- James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends.
- He writes these letters twice a week.

Step 1: Find the number of pages James writes per week.
Number of pages per letter × Number of friends = Pages per week
3 pages × 2 friends = 6 pages per week

Step 2: Find the number of weeks in a year.
There are 52 weeks in a year.

Step 3: Calcula...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how many pages James writes in a year, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pages written per letter:**
   - James writes a 3-page letter to each friend.

2. **Determine the number of friends:**
   - James writes to 2 different friends.

3. **Calculate the total number of pages written per session:**
   - Since James writes a 3-page letter to each of the 2 friends, the total number of pages he writes per session is:
 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): James writes a 3-page letter to 2 friends, so that's 3 pages * 2 friends = 6 pages each time he writes.

He writes twice a week, so that's 6 pages * 2 times = 12 pages per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so that's 12 pages * 52 weeks = 624 pages per year.

So, James writes 624 pages a year.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * James writes a 3-page letter to each friend.
   * He writes to 2 different friends.
   * He does this twice a week.
   * We need to find out how many pages he writes in a year.

2. Calculate the number of pages James writes per week:
   * Pages per letter = 3
   * Number of friends = 2
   * Letters per week = 2
   * Pages per week = Pages per letter × Number of...
