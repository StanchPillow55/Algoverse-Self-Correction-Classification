=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of flowers in Mark's garden, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of yellow flowers**:
   - Mark has 10 yellow flowers.

2. **Calculate the number of purple flowers**:
   - We know that there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers. 
   - To find the number of purple flowers, we first calculate 80% of the number of yellow flowers:
     \[
     80\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.8 \times 10 = 8
     \]
   - Now, we add this to the number of yellow flowers to find the total number of purple flowers:
     \[
     \text{Number of purple flowers} = \text{Number of yellow flowers} + 80\% \text{ of yellow flowers} = 10 + 8 = 18
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of yellow and purple flowers**:
   - Now we add the number of yellow and purple flowers together:
     \[
     \text{Total yellow and purple flowers} = \text{Number of yellow flowers} + \text{Number of purple flowers} = 10 + 18 = 28
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of green flowers**:
   - We are told that there are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. 
   - To find the number of green flowers, we calculate 25% of the total number of yellow and purple flowers:
     \[
     25\% \text{ of } 28 = 0.25 \times 28 = 7
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden**:
   - Finally, we add the number of yellow, purple, and green flowers together to find the total number of flowers in the garden:
     \[
     \text{Total flowers} = \text{Number of yellow flowers} + \text{Number of purple flowers} + \text{Number of green flowers} = 10 + 18 + 7 = 35
     \]

Thus, the total number of flowers in Mark's garden is \(\boxed{35}\).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Mark has 10 yellow flowers in his garden.
- The number of purple flowers is 80% more than the number of yellow flowers.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many purple flowers there are. We know that there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers. To find out how many that is, we can calculate 80% of the number of yellow flowers, which is 10. 

80% of 10 is (80/100) * 10 = 8.

So, there are 8 more purple flowers than yellow flowers, which means there are 10 + 8 = 18 purple flowers.

Next, let's find out how many green flowers there are. We know that there are 25% as many green flowers as ther...
