=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Tina makes in a week, we need to calculate her regular pay for the first 8 hours of each day and her overtime pay for the additional hours she works.

1. **Calculate Regular and Overtime Pay Rates:**
   - Tina's hourly wage is $18.00.
   - Overtime pay is calculated as her hourly wage plus half of her hourly wage:
     \[
     \text{Overtime Rate} = \text{Hourly Wage} + \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{Hourly Wage}\right) = 18.00 + \left(\frac{1}{2} \times 18.00\right)
     \]
     \[
     \text{Overtime Rate} = 18.00 + 9.00 = 27.00
     \]

2. **Determine Daily Work Hours:**
   - Tina works 10 hours each day.

3. **Calculate Regular and Overtime Hours:**
   - For each day, she works 10 hours, which includes:
     - Regular hours: 8 hours
     - Overtime hours: \(10 - 8 = 2\) hours

4. **Calculate Daily Earnings:**
   - Regular pay for 8 hours:
     \[
     \text{Regular Pay} = \text{Regular Hours} \times \text{Hourly Wage} = 8 \times 18.00 = 144.00
     \]
   - Overtime pay for 2 hours:
     \[
     \text{Overtime Pay} = \text{Overtime Hours} \times \text{Overtime Rate} = 2 \times 27.00 = 54.00
     \]
   - Total daily earnings:
     \[
     \text{Total Daily Earnings} = \text{Regular Pay} + \text{Overtime Pay} = 144.00 + 54.00 = 198.00
     \]

5. **Calculate Weekly Earnings:**
   - Tina works 5 days a week, so her total earnings for the week are:
     \[
     \text{Weekly Earnings} = \text{Total Daily Earnings} \times \text{Number of Days} = 198.00 \times 5 = 990.00
     \]

Thus, Tina makes a total of **$990.00** in a week. 

Final answer: **$990.00**

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate Tina's earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours, and then add them together to find the total amount of money she makes.

Given information:
- Tina's hourly wage is $18.00.
- If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime.
- Overtime pay is calculated as her hourly wage + 1/2 of her hourly wage.
- Tina works 10 hours every day for 5 days.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate Tina's earnings for the week, taking into account her regular and overtime hours.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine Regular and Overtime Hours per Day:**
   - Tina works 10 hours each day.
   - Regular hours are up to 8 hours per day.
   - Overtime hours are any hours worked beyond 8 hours per day.

   Therefore, each day:
   - Regular hours = 8 hours
   - Overtime hours = 10 hours - 8 hours = 2 hours

2. **Calcula...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much Tina earns in a regular 8-hour shift. 

Her hourly wage is $18.00, so for an 8-hour shift, she earns 18 * 8 = $<<18*8=144.00>>144.00.

Next, let's calculate her overtime pay. She works 10 hours a day, so she has 2 hours of overtime each day. Her overtime pay is her hourly wage plus half her hourly wage, which is 18 + (1/2 * 18) = $27.00 per hour.

So, for 2 hours of overtime, she earns 27 * 2 = $<<27*2=54.00>>54.00.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Tina's regular hourly wage is $18.00.
   * If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime.
   * Overtime pay is calculated as her regular hourly wage + 1/2 of her regular hourly wage.
   * Tina works 10 hours every day for 5 days.

2. Calculate Tina's overtime hourly wage:
   * Overtime hourly wage = Regular hourly wage + 1/2 of regular ...
