To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of clips Natalia sold in both April and May.
1. **Determine the number of clips sold in April:**
- According to the problem, Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April. Therefore, the number of clips sold in April is 48.
2. **Determine the number of clips sold in May:**
- The problem states that Natalia sold half as many clips in May as she did in April.

To determine how much Weng earned for babysitting for 50 minutes, we need to calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate and the time she worked.
2. **Convert minutes to hours**: Since her rate is per hour, we need to convert the 50 minutes she worked into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we convert minutes to hours by dividing the number of minutes by 60.
3. **Simplify the fraction**: The fraction \(\frac{50}{60}\) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10.
4. **Calculate earnings**: Now that we know Weng worked \(\frac{5}{6}\) of an hour, we can calculate her earnings by multiplying the fraction of the hour she worked by her hourly rate.

Let’s make A the number of nuggets Alyssa ate. We know all three girls ate 100 nuggets total, so 100 nuggets = A (how many Alyssa ate) + 2A (how many Keely ate) + 3A (how many Kendall ate) or 100 = A + 2A + 3A which is 100 = 5A
Then we will divide each side by 5 to figure out how many nuggets Alyssa ate, 100/5 = 5A/5 or 20 = A.
#### 20",1,0.6,Confirmation,0.6,0.6,"Key reasoning steps:
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many chicken nuggets Alyssa ate, given that Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many nuggets as Alyssa, and the total number of nuggets consumed by all three is 100.
- Similarly, Kendall also ate twice as many as Alyssa, so Kendall ate \( 2A \) nuggets.
The total number of nuggets eaten by Alyssa, Keely, and Kendall is given as 100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
To find the value of \( A \), divide both sides of the equation by 5:

After spending $480 on textbooks, we subtract this amount from the initial $960 to find out how much money he has left:
Derek spends a quarter of the remaining amount on school supplies. To find out how much he spends on school supplies, we calculate a quarter of the remaining $480:
After spending $120 on school supplies, we subtract this amount from the remaining $480 to find out how much money he has left:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the wholesale price of the pants given that the retail price is $36 and the store owner adds 80% to the wholesale price to set the retail price.
We know the retail price is $36, so we can set up the equation:
To find the wholesale price \( W \), we need to solve this equation for \( W \). We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.8:
1. Calculate 80% of the wholesale price: \( 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \).
2. Add this to the wholesale price to find the retail price: \( 20 + 16 = 36 \).

- Adults: Julia's mom, dad, and grandma are attending. This makes a total of 3 adults.
- Children: Julia has three little sisters attending. This makes a total of 3 children.
- Since there are 3 adults, we calculate the total cost for adult tickets as follows:
\text{Total cost for adults} = 3 \times 12 = 36

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of items
Add up all the items:
\text{Total items} = \text{Pretzels} + \text{Goldfish} + \text{Suckers} = 64 + 256 + 32

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of matchsticks Michael originally had. Let's break down the problem step by step:
2. **Calculate the Total Number of Matchsticks Used:**
- Since each house uses 10 matchsticks and he creates 30 houses, the total number of matchsticks used is:
- Michael used all the matchsticks he intended to use, which is half of his original pile. Therefore, the 300 matchsticks represent half of his original number of matchsticks.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the original number of matchsticks Michael had before he decided to use only half of them for his project.
Let's break down the problem step by step:
- Therefore, the total number of matchsticks used is calculated by multiplying the number of houses by the number of matchsticks per house:
\text{Total matchsticks used} = 30 \times 10 = 300

To determine how much James's favorite basketball player gets paid for the week, we need to calculate the average number of points he scored per game over the week. Based on this average, we can then decide whether he earns $10,000 or $8,000.
### Step-by-Step Calculation:
2. **Calculate the total points scored over the week:**
\text{Total points} = 30 + 28 + 32 + 34 + 26

To determine how much James's favorite basketball player gets paid for the week, we need to calculate his average points per game over the five games and then apply the payment criteria.
**Step 1: Calculate the total points scored over the week.**
Total points = 30 + 28 + 32 + 34 + 26
Let's calculate this step by step:
So, the total points scored over the five games is 150.
