A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A for $10 per unit and Type B for $15 per unit. Last month, the company produced a total of 1000 widgets, consisting of both Type A and Type B, and made a total revenue of $12,000. How many units of each type were produced?
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
- From the problem, we know the total number of widgets produced is 1000. Therefore, we have:
- We also know the total revenue from selling the widgets is $12,000. The revenue from Type A is \( 10x \) and from Type B is \( 15y \). Therefore, we have:
