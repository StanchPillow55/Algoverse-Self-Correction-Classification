To find the total number of food items donated by the five companies, we will calculate the donations from each company step by step.
2. **American Summits**:
- American Summits donated twice the number of bottled water than the number of dressed chickens donated by Foster Farms.
- Since Foster Farms donated 45 chickens, American Summits donated:
- **Donation from American Summits**: 90 bottles of water.

To determine how many cars Frank needs to sell in the remaining days of the month to meet his quota, we can break the problem down step by step.
1. **Identify the total quota**: Frank needs to sell a total of 50 cars in 30 days.
2. **Calculate sales for the first 3 days**:
- Frank sold 5 cars each day for the first 3 days.
- Total cars sold in the first 3 days = 5 cars/day Ã— 3 days = 15 cars.

To determine how many months in jail Jean is facing, we need to calculate the total sentence based on the counts of arson, burglary, and petty larceny.
- Arson: 3 counts
First, we calculate the number of petty larceny charges:
- Each arson count has a sentence of 36 months.
