A company produces two types of products: A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $30, and the profit from each unit of product B is $50. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per week. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 150 units per week. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
x + y \leq 150 \quad \text{(total production constraint)}
- Additionally, \( x \geq 0 \) and \( y \geq 0 \) since negative production is not possible.
