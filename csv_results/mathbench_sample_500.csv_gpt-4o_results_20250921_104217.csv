Let's explore a few mathematical aspects of the number 243:
### Step 1: Prime Factorization
1. **Divide by 3**: Since 243 is odd, it is not divisible by 2. We check divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 243 is \(2 + 4 + 3 = 9\), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 243 is divisible by 3.
2. **Divide 81 by 3**: Again, the sum of the digits of 81 is \(8 + 1 = 9\), which is divisible by 3.
3. **Divide 27 by 3**: The sum of the digits of 27 is \(2 + 7 = 9\), which is divisible by 3.

To solve the problem, we need to understand what ""Sample math problem 500"" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume that ""500"" is the number we need to work with. Let's explore some mathematical operations and concepts involving the number 500.
### Step 1: Basic Properties of 500
- **Prime or Composite**: 500 is a composite number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself.
### Step 2: Prime Factorization
To find the prime factorization of 500, we divide it by the smallest prime numbers until we reach 1.

Certainly! Let's tackle the problem step by step. However, it seems like the problem statement ""Sample math problem 500"" is not clear. It appears to be a placeholder or an incomplete problem statement. To proceed, I'll assume you want to solve a problem involving the number 500. Let's consider a few possibilities:
- 125 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next prime number, which is 3.
- 125 is not divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 1 + 2 + 5 = 8, is not divisible by 3).
- Therefore, the prime factorization of 500 is \( 2^2 \times 5^3 \).
- The square root of 100 is 10, so:
