To determine how many chores Gerald needs to average per month to save up for his baseball supplies, we can break down the problem step by step.
1. **Calculate Total Expenses for Baseball Supplies**:
Gerald spends $100 a month on baseball supplies, and his season lasts for 4 months. Therefore, the total amount he spends on baseball supplies during the season is calculated as follows:
\text{Total Expenses} = \text{Monthly Expense} \times \text{Number of Months}

Arnel shares the remaining pencils equally with his five friends. This means he shares the remaining pencils among 6 people (Arnel and his 5 friends). Each friend receives 8 pencils, so the total number of pencils shared among the friends is:
Since the total number of pencils left after Arnel kept 10 is equal to the total number of pencils shared (which is 40), we can set up the equation:

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many dust particles were on the porch before Samuel swept it. We know the following:
### Step 1: Determine the number of dust particles left after sweeping
Since Samuel cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles, this means he left one-tenth of the dust particles on the porch after sweeping. Therefore, the number of dust particles left after sweeping can be expressed as:
### Step 2: Set up the equation for dust particles after walking across
After Samuel walked across the porch, he left 223 dust particles behind. Thus, the total number of dust particles remaining on the porch after he walked across it is:

When Jack helps they finish 2 in 15 minutes. Sam has finished 1 widget and has begun working on another one, and Jack finishes the second one at 15 minutes. So it takes Jack 15 minutes to complete a widget.
Sam worked for 6 hours yesterday, so he was able to complete 6 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 10 minutes per widget = <<6*60/10=36>>36 widgets.
Jack worked for 4 hours, so he was able to complete 4 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 15 minutes per widget = <<4*60/15=16>>16 widgets.
Sam, Jack, and Tony were able to complete 68 widgets together. So of those, Tony personally completed 68 widgets - 36 widgets - 16 widgets = <<68-36-16=16>>16 widgets.
It took Tony 8 hours to complete those 16 widgets, so he takes 8 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 16 widgets = <<8*60/16=30>>30 minutes per widget.

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many chickens Lao sold based on the profit he made. We will break down the problem step by step.
Lao makes a profit of $65 from selling chickens. Profit is calculated as the total revenue from sales minus the total costs (expenses).
Each chicken is sold for $1.50. If we let \( n \) be the number of chickens sold, then the total revenue from selling the chickens can be expressed as:
\text{Total Revenue} = 1.50n
Each chicken requires 2 pounds of feed. Therefore, the total amount of feed needed for \( n \) chickens is:

To solve the problem, we need to determine the current number of people on the dance team after accounting for the changes in membership.
The problem states that Leticia, Nina, and Rosalie have a total of 25 people on their dance team.
We are told that 8 people quit the team. To find the number of people remaining after these 8 people quit, we subtract 8 from the initial number of people.
Next, we learn that 13 new people joined the team. To find the total number of people now on the team, we add the number of new people to the number of people remaining after the quitters.
\text{Total after new members} = 17 + 13 = 30
