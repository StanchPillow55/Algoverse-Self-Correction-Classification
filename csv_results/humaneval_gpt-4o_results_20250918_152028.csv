To solve the problem of finding a zero of a polynomial given its coefficients, we need to understand the nature of polynomials and how to find their roots. The problem specifies that the list of coefficients will have an even number of elements and the largest non-zero coefficient, which guarantees a solution. This suggests that the polynomial is non-trivial and has at least one real root.

To solve the problem of finding a zero of a polynomial given its coefficients, we need to implement the `find_zero` function. The function `poly` is already provided, which evaluates a polynomial at a given point. Our task is to find a root of the polynomial, i.e., a value of \( x \) such that the polynomial evaluates to zero.

To solve the problem of determining whether a list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, we need to understand what these terms mean:
1. **Monotonically Increasing**: A sequence is monotonically increasing if each element is greater than or equal to the previous one. For example, [1, 2, 2, 3] is monotonically increasing.
2. **Monotonically Decreasing**: A sequence is monotonically decreasing if each element is less than or equal to the previous one. For example, [5, 4, 4, 1] is monotonically decreasing.

To solve the problem of finding sorted unique common elements between two lists, we can break down the task into several steps:
1. **Identify Common Elements**: We need to find elements that are present in both lists. A straightforward way to do this is by using set operations, which are efficient for such tasks. Specifically, the intersection of two sets will give us the common elements.
2. **Ensure Uniqueness**: By converting the lists to sets, we automatically ensure that the elements are unique, as sets do not allow duplicate values.

To solve the problem of summing numbers from 1 to \( n \), we can use a mathematical approach that leverages the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers can be calculated using the formula:
\[ S = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \]
This formula is derived from the observation that if you list the numbers from 1 to \( n \) and then reverse them, pairing each number from the start with a number from the end, each pair sums to \( n + 1 \). For example, with \( n = 5 \):

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of changes needed to make an array palindromic, we need to understand the properties of a palindromic array. A palindromic array reads the same forwards and backwards, meaning that the first element should be equal to the last element, the second element should be equal to the second-to-last element, and so on.
### Step-by-Step Approach:
1. **Identify Pairs**: For an array of length `n`, we need to compare pairs of elements: the first with the last, the second with the second-to-last, and so on. Specifically, we compare `arr[i]` with `arr[n-1-i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n//2 - 1`.

To solve the problem of determining if the length of a string is a prime number, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:

To solve this problem, we need to create a function `encrypt` that takes a string `s` and returns a new string where each letter is shifted down the alphabet by a certain number of places. The problem specifies that the shift should be ""two multiplied to two places,"" which I interpret as shifting each letter by 4 positions forward in the alphabet (since 2 * 2 = 4).

To solve the problem of counting the number of ""boredoms"" in a given string, we need to identify sentences that start with the word ""I"". Sentences are delimited by '.', '?', or '!', which means these characters mark the end of one sentence and the potential start of another.
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can approach this problem:
1. **Identify Sentence Boundaries**: We need to split the input string into individual sentences. This can be done by using the delimiters '.', '?', and '!' as splitting points.

To solve the problem of finding all prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer `n`, we need to understand what a prime number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

To solve the problem of multiplying the unit digits of two integers, we need to follow these steps:

To solve the problem of splitting a string into words, we need to consider the delimiters that separate the words. According to the problem statement, the words in the string are separated by either commas or spaces. Our task is to split the string based on these delimiters and return a list of words.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Right Shift Operation**: A right shift operation moves all elements of the array one position to the right, with the last element wrapping around to the first position. For example, a right shift on `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]` results in `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`.

To solve the problem, we need to perform the following steps:

2. **Check for Palindrome**: After obtaining the modified string, we need to check if this string is a palindrome. A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards. We can check this by comparing the string to its reverse.

To solve the problem of determining whether the length of the intersection of two intervals is a prime number, we need to follow these steps:
1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given two intervals, each defined by a pair of integers (start, end). The intervals are closed, meaning they include both the start and end points. We need to find the intersection of these intervals and check if the length of this intersection is a prime number.
2. **Intersection of Intervals**: The intersection of two intervals (a, b) and (c, d) is defined by:

To solve the problem of determining if a string of square brackets contains a valid subsequence where at least one bracket is nested, we need to understand the concept of nested brackets. A bracket is considered nested if it is enclosed within another pair of brackets. For example, in the string `[[]]`, the inner `[]` is nested within the outer `[]`.

To solve the problem of determining if a string of square brackets contains a valid nested subsequence, we need to understand what ""nested"" means in this context. A nested subsequence is one where at least one pair of brackets is properly enclosed within another pair. For example, in the string ""[[]]"", the inner ""[]"" is nested within the outer ""[]"".

To solve this problem, we need to compare two inputs, which can be integers, floats, or strings representing real numbers. The goal is to return the larger of the two inputs in its original type, or `None` if they are equal.
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to approach this problem:
1. **Input Types**: The inputs can be integers, floats, or strings. Strings can represent real numbers with either a dot (`.`) or a comma (`,`) as the decimal separator.

To solve the problem of determining whether the product of two fractions results in a whole number, we need to follow these steps:
1. **Parse the Input**: Both `x` and `n` are given as strings in the format ""numerator/denominator"". We need to extract the numerator and denominator from these strings.
2. **Convert to Integers**: Once we have the numerators and denominators, we convert them from strings to integers for mathematical operations.

To solve the problem of sorting a list of integers based on the sum of their digits, we need to consider a few key points:
1. **Sum of Digits Calculation**: We need a way to calculate the sum of the digits of each integer. This includes handling negative numbers correctly, where the negative sign should not be considered as a digit.
2. **Stable Sorting**: The problem specifies that if two numbers have the same sum of digits, they should remain in the order they appear in the original list. This means we need a stable sorting algorithm.

To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We are given a positive integer `n` and need to create an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a[i]` is calculated using the formula `a[i] = i * i - i + 1`. We then need to find the number of triples `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` such that `i < j < k` and the sum `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is a multiple of 3.
2. **Generate the Array**: First, we will generate the array `a` using the given formula. This is straightforward as we can iterate from 1 to `n` and compute each element.

To solve the problem, we need to handle two main cases based on the content of the string `s`:
1. **Case 1: The string contains letters.**
- For each character in the string, if it is a letter, we need to reverse its case. This means converting lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa.
