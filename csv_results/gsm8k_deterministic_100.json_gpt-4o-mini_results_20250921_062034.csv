To solve the problem, we need to determine how many kilograms of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother after buying 20 sacks of rice.
**Step 1: Calculate the total number of sacks given away.**
Total sacks given away = 3 sacks + 4 sacks = 7 sacks
**Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the rice given away.**
We know that each sack of rice weighs 25 kilograms. Therefore, to find the total weight of the rice given away, we multiply the total number of sacks given away by the weight per sack.

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Wendy wants to place in her shelving system based on the information given.
The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns. To find the total capacity of the shelving system, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns:
\text{Total capacity} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Number of columns} = 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ books}
We know that the total capacity of the shelving system is 36 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, given that they traded 2 old records for 1 new record and left with a total of 7 new records.
2. **Calculating Old Records for New Records**: Since the 5 people left with 7 new records, we can calculate how many old records they must have traded in to receive these new records.
- Therefore, for 7 new records, the total number of old records traded in is:
\text{Total old records} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records}
3. **Conclusion**: The total number of old records that the 5 people brought in is 14.

Together, Alani and her brother Braylen had written 120+60 = <<120+60=180>>180 stories.
When Margot doubled the number of stories she wrote in the first week in the second week, she wrote 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 stories in the second week.
In total, she wrote 60+120= <<60+120=180>>180 stories.
Altogether, the three siblings wrote 180+180 = <<180+180=360>>360 stories in the two weeks.

To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot over the two weeks, we will follow these steps:
1. **Calculate the number of stories written in the first week:**
We can find the total number of stories written in the first week by adding these amounts together:
\text{Total stories in the first week} = \text{Alani's stories} + \text{Braylen's stories} + \text{Margot's stories}
\text{Total stories in the first week} = 20 + 40 + 60

To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can break the problem down step by step.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of kids in the park, which includes both girls and boys.
2. **Determine the number of boys**: The problem states that there are twice the number of boys as there are girls. Since we know there are 6 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
3. **Calculate the total number of kids**: To find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of girls and the number of boys together:
\text{Total number of kids} = \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of boys} = 6 + 12 = 18

\text{Total height from 4-inch heels} = 3 \text{ women} \times 4 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches}
\text{Total height from 2-inch heels} = 3 \text{ women} \times 2 \text{ inches} = 6 \text{ inches}

To find out how much Ted spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils separately, and then add those two amounts together.
**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the books.**
Ted buys 3 books, and each book costs $16. We can calculate the total cost of the books using the formula:
\text{Total cost of books} = \text{Number of books} \times \text{Cost per book}
\text{Total cost of books} = 3 \times 16

The problem states that Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel. Therefore, we can find Ned's height by subtracting 2 feet from Isabel's height.
3. **Calculate Carl's height**:
The problem states that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. Thus, we can find Carl's height by adding 1 foot to Ned's height.

If the twenty dozen cups cost $34800, each cup costs $34800/240=$<<34800/240=145>>145

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.
- Therefore, the total cost of half a dozen plates is:
- According to the problem, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. We can express this relationship mathematically:
- Now, we need to find the cost of each cup. We have the total cost of the cups and the total number of cups:
\text{Cost per cup} = \frac{\text{Total cost of cups}}{\text{Total number of cups}} = \frac{34800}{240}

To find the total count of the activities Darren has done over the two days, we will first calculate the number of each exercise he performed on both days and then sum them up.
- Pushups: On the second day, Darren does 20 more pushups than on the first day. Therefore:
- Squats: On the second day, he does ten fewer squats than on the first day. Therefore:
- Dumbbell presses: On the second day, he doubles the number of dumbbell presses from the first day. Therefore:

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used after distributing them to the restaurants.
1. **Identify the total amount of carrots**: We start with 200 pounds of carrots.
3. **Calculate the total amount of carrots distributed**: Since there are 40 restaurants, we can calculate the total amount of carrots distributed by multiplying the number of restaurants by the amount each restaurant receives:
\text{Total distributed} = \text{Number of restaurants} \times \text{Pounds per restaurant}
\text{Total distributed} = 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ pounds}

So Paul waits for the first train for 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 minutes.
The second train arrives after half an hour, which is the same as 60 minutes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 minutes.
It then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.
So Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes.
The third train arrives an hour later, which is the same as 60 minutes * 1 hour = <<60*1=60>>60 minutes.
After the final wait, Paul has waited a total of 30 minutes for the first train + 35 minutes for the second train + 60 minutes for the third train + 20 minutes final wait = <<30+35+60+20=145>>145 minutes.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the arrival times of each train and how long Paul will wait for the fourth train. Let's break it down step by step.
- The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 125 minutes.
- **Total wait time:**
Thus, the total time Paul will wait for his train is **135 minutes**.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, a total of 3*22 = <<3*22=66>>66 chairs
The total number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have is 66+22 = <<66+22=88>>88
Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the total number of sofas she has is 66-2 = <<66-2=64>>64 sofas.
The total number of sofas Ophelia and Jenna have is 64+20 = <<64+20=84>>84 sofas
Together, they have 84 sofas+88 chairs = <<84+88=172>>172

Let's denote the number of chairs and sofas that Ophelia has as follows:
- Let \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has.
From the problem, we know that Ophelia has 20 sofas:
According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Therefore, we can express the number of chairs Ophelia has in terms of the number of sofas:
So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle based on the information given about her cat.
3. **Solve for \( x \)**:
To find the speed of the turtle, we need to isolate \( x \). We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:
So, the turtle crawls at a speed of 3 feet per second.
