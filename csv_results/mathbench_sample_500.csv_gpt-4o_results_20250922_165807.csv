- We will also determine if 24 is a prime number.
- A factor is a number that divides another number without leaving a remainder.
- To find the factors of 24, we start with 1 and go up to 24, checking which numbers divide 24 evenly.

2. Now, take the quotient 49 and check for divisibility by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since 49 is not divisible by 3 (as the sum of the digits, 4 + 9 = 13, is not divisible by 3), we move to the next prime number, which is 5. 49 is not divisible by 5 either (as it does not end in 0 or 5).

To solve the problem ""Sample math problem 360,"" we first need to clarify what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it involves basic operations or properties related to the number 360. Let's explore some possibilities:
Finding the factors of 360 involves determining all the integers that divide 360 without leaving a remainder.
- 360 is even, so divide by 2: \( 360 \div 2 = 180 \)
- 180 is even, so divide by 2 again: \( 180 \div 2 = 90 \)
- 90 is even, so divide by 2 again: \( 90 \div 2 = 45 \)
