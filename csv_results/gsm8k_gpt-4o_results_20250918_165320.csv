To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of clips Natalia sold in both April and May.
1. **Determine the number of clips sold in April:**
- According to the problem, Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April. Therefore, the number of clips sold in April is 48.
2. **Determine the number of clips sold in May:**
- The problem states that Natalia sold half as many clips in May as she did in April. Since she sold 48 clips in April, we need to find half of 48 to determine the number of clips sold in May.

To solve the problem of how much Weng earned for babysitting for 50 minutes at a rate of $12 per hour, we need to follow these steps:
2. **Convert minutes to hours**: Since Weng babysat for 50 minutes, we need to convert this time into hours because her rate is given per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we convert minutes to hours by dividing the number of minutes by 60.
3. **Simplify the fraction**: The fraction \(\frac{50}{60}\) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10.
4. **Calculate earnings**: Now that we know Weng worked for \(\frac{5}{6}\) of an hour, we can calculate her earnings by multiplying the fraction of the hour she worked by her hourly rate.
5. **Perform the multiplication**: Multiply \(\frac{5}{6}\) by 12.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs for making pizza. Let's break down the problem step by step:
2. **Calculate the amount of salt needed:**
- Since there are 16 cups of flour, we calculate the salt as follows:
3. **Determine the total combined quantity:**
- We need to add the quantities of water, flour, and salt together. However, we must ensure that all measurements are in the same unit. Since water and flour are measured in cups and salt is measured in teaspoons, we need to convert teaspoons to cups or vice versa. For simplicity, let's assume we are summing them directly as they are, acknowledging that they are different units but focusing on the numerical total.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people Marcy can apply makeup to with the lip gloss she is bringing.
First, we need to calculate the total number of tubes of lip gloss Marcy is bringing:
- Since each tub contains 2 tubes, and Marcy is bringing 6 tubs, we calculate the total number of tubes as follows:
\text{Total tubes} = 6 \text{ tubs} \times 2 \text{ tubes per tub} = 12 \text{ tubes}

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Marvin and Tina each made from selling candy bars and then find the difference between the two amounts.

Marvin sold 35 candy bars. According to the problem, Tina sold three times the number of candy bars as Marvin. Therefore, the number of candy bars Tina sold is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of candy bars Tina sold} = 3 \times 35 = 105 \]

- They work together for 4 hours initially, so the total number of blocks they fill in this time is:
- The truck's total capacity is 6000 blocks, and 2000 blocks have already been filled.
- Therefore, the remaining number of blocks to be filled is:

- To find out how old Herbert will be next year, we simply add 1 year to his current age.
Therefore, Herbert will be 15 years old next year.

### Step 1: Determine the number of weekdays and weekends in a month
For simplicity, let's assume a typical month with 30 days. In a 30-day month, there are usually 4 weeks and 2 extra days. A week consists of 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) and 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).
Now, we need to account for the 2 extra days. These extra days could be either weekdays or weekend days, depending on the starting day of the month. For simplicity, let's assume these 2 extra days are weekdays (this is a common scenario).

Lily sells the first ticket for $1. Each successive ticket is sold for $1 more than the previous ticket. Therefore, the selling prices of the tickets are as follows:
### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling all tickets
To find the total revenue, we sum up the prices of all the tickets:

To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle helps us calculate the number of elements in the union of two sets when we know the number of elements in each set and the number of elements in their intersection.

- \(|S| = 22\), the number of people who took soda.
We want to find the total number of people at the gathering, which is the number of people who took at least one of the drinks. This is represented by the union of the two sets, \(|W \cup S|\).

1. **Determine the correct total cost for the furniture:**
We know that each piece of furniture costs $134. Remy purchased 150 pieces. To find the correct total cost, we multiply the number of pieces by the cost per piece:
\text{Correct Total Cost} = 150 \times 134

1. **Understand the Ratio**: The ratio of oil to peanuts is 2:8. This means for every 8 ounces of peanuts, Sonja uses 2 ounces of oil. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both numbers by 2, resulting in a simplified ratio of 1:4. This tells us that for every 4 ounces of peanuts, 1 ounce of oil is used.

To solve the problem of determining how long it will take David to wash all 64 windows, we need to first understand the rate at which David washes windows and then apply that rate to the total number of windows.
**Step 1: Determine David's rate of washing windows.**

To subtract these, we need a common denominator. Convert 10 kilograms to a fraction with a denominator of 10:
Now subtract:
So, Rose has \( \frac{91}{10} \) kilograms of rice remaining after the morning.

The problem states that a year ago, the cost of a lawnmower was \(\frac{2}{5}\) times less than the current cost. This can be a bit confusing, so let's clarify what this means.
- If something is \(\frac{2}{5}\) times less, it means the past cost was \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the current cost. This is because ""2/5 times less"" implies that the past cost is the remaining part of the whole after subtracting 2/5, which is \(1 - \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}\).
