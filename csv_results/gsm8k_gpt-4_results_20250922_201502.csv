Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April.
In May, she sold half as many clips as she did in April. To find out how many clips she sold in May, we divide the number of clips she sold in April by 2.

To find out how many clips Natalia sold altogether in April and May, we add the number of clips she sold in April to the number of clips she sold in May.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how much salt is in 2 liters of seawater. Given that the seawater is 20% salt, we can calculate the amount of salt by taking 20% of the total volume of the seawater.
First, we need to convert the volume of seawater from liters to milliliters because the final answer needs to be in milliliters. We know that 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters, so 2 liters is equal to 2000 milliliters.
Next, we calculate 20% of 2000 milliliters. We can do this by multiplying 2000 by 20% (or 0.20 in decimal form).
So, Jack will get 400 ml of salt when all the water evaporates.

So, in the second earthquake, 2 * 4 = 8 buildings would collapse.
In the third earthquake, we double the number of buildings that collapsed in the second earthquake, so 2 * 8 = 16 buildings would collapse.
In the fourth earthquake, we again double the number of buildings that collapsed in the third earthquake, so 2 * 16 = 32 buildings would collapse.
To find the total number of buildings that collapsed, we add the number of buildings that collapsed in each earthquake:

#### 60",1,0.6,Confirmation,0.6,0.6,"Key reasoning steps:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the number of buildings collapsing after each earthquake. According to the problem, each earthquake causes double the number of buildings to collapse compared to the previous one.
For the second earthquake, the number of collapsing buildings would be double the number from the first earthquake. So, we calculate 4 (from the first earthquake) times 2, which equals 8.
For the third earthquake, the number of collapsing buildings would be double the number from the second earthquake. So, we calculate 8 (from the second earthquake) times 2, which equals 16.
For the fourth earthquake, the number of collapsing buildings would be double the number from the third earthquake. So, we calculate 16 (from the third earthquake) times 2, which equals 32.
To find the total number of buildings that collapsed, we add the number of buildings that collapsed in each earthquake. So, we calculate 4 (from the first earthquake) + 8 (from the second earthquake) + 16 (from the third earthquake) + 32 (from the fourth earthquake), which equals 60.

Let's break down the problem step by step.
So, after the first three hours, she had 15 coins (from the first hour) + 35 coins (from the next two hours) = 50 coins.
In the fourth hour, she collected 50 coins. So, before giving any coins to her coworker, she had 50 coins (from the first three hours) + 50 coins (from the fourth hour) = 100 coins.
But then she gave 15 coins to her coworker. So, after giving away these coins, she had 100 coins - 15 coins = 85 coins.
So, after the fourth hour, Joanne had 85 coins.

To solve this problem, we need to add up all the coins Joanne collected and then subtract the coins she gave to her coworker.
So far, she has collected a total of 15 coins + 35 coins = 50 coins.
In the fourth hour, she collected another 50 coins, bringing her total to 50 coins + 50 coins = 100 coins.
However, she gave 15 coins to her coworker, so we need to subtract these from her total.

He will spend a total of 32 hours watching games + 64 hours watching practice = <<32+64=96>>96 hours.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours Jerry's daughters will spend playing games. Since each daughter has 8 games and each game lasts 2 hours, each daughter will spend 8 games * 2 hours/game = 16 hours playing games. Since Jerry has two daughters, he will spend 16 hours/daughter * 2 daughters = 32 hours watching games.
Next, let's calculate the total number of hours Jerry's daughters will spend practicing. Since each daughter has 8 games and each team practices 4 hours for every game, each daughter will spend 8 games * 4 hours/game = 32 hours practicing. Since Jerry has two daughters, he will spend 32 hours/daughter * 2 daughters = 64 hours watching practices.
Adding these two amounts together, Jerry will spend 32 hours watching games + 64 hours watching practices = 96 hours at the field watching his daughters play and practice altogether.
So, the final answer is 96 hours.

Then figure out what proportion of the aquarium is full after Nancy refills it: 3 * 1/4 = 3/4

#### 54",1,0.6,Confirmation,0.6,0.6,"Key reasoning steps:
First, we need to find the volume of the aquarium. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is what this aquarium is) is found by multiplying the length, width, and height. So, the volume of the aquarium is 4 feet * 6 feet * 3 feet = 72 cubic feet.
Nancy initially fills the aquarium halfway, so she fills it with 72 cubic feet / 2 = 36 cubic feet of water.
Finally, Nancy comes back and triples the amount of water in the aquarium. This means she adds 2 times the current amount of water, because tripling something means adding two more of it. So, she adds 18 cubic feet * 2 = 36 cubic feet of water.
Adding this to the 18 cubic feet of water already in the aquarium, we find that the aquarium now contains 18 cubic feet + 36 cubic feet = 54 cubic feet of water.
So, the final answer is that there are 54 cubic feet of water in the aquarium.

#### 15",1,0.6,Confirmation,0.6,0.6,"Key reasoning steps:
First, we need to calculate the cost of Dale's breakfast. He had 2 slices of toast and 2 eggs. Since a slice of toast costs £1, two slices would cost 2*£1 = £2. Similarly, since an egg costs £3, two eggs would cost 2*£3 = £6. Therefore, the total cost of Dale's breakfast is £2 (for the toast) + £6 (for the eggs) = £8.
Next, we need to calculate the cost of Andrew's breakfast. He had 1 slice of toast and 2 eggs. The toast costs £1 and the two eggs cost 2*£3 = £6. Therefore, the total cost of Andrew's breakfast is £1 (for the toast) + £6 (for the eggs) = £7.
Finally, to find the total cost of their breakfast, we add the cost of Dale's breakfast to the cost of Andrew's breakfast. This gives us £8 (for Dale's breakfast) + £7 (for Andrew's breakfast) = £15.

Next, let's figure out how many fish each tank can hold. Gail follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish. So, in the second tank, which holds 24 gallons, she can keep 24/2 = 12 two-inch fish. In the first tank, which holds 48 gallons, she can keep 48/3 = 16 three-inch fish.
However, if one of the fish in the first tank eats another, then there would be one less fish in the first tank. So, the first tank would then hold 16 - 1 = 15 fish.
Finally, to find out how many more fish Gail would have in the first tank than the second tank, we subtract the number of fish in the second tank from the number of fish in the first tank. So, 15 - 12 = 3.
Therefore, Gail would have 3 more fish in the first tank than the second tank if one of the first tank fish eats another.

Following her rule, Gail keeps 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 two-inch fish in the second tank.
She keeps 48 / 3 = <<48/3=16>>16 fish in the first tank.
If one fish in the first tank ate another, she would have 16 - 1 = <<16-1=15>>15 fish in the first tank.
Thus, Gail would have 15 - 12 = <<15-12=3>>3 more fish in the first tank.
