# Resumable Checkpoint System

## Overview

Your Algoverse Self-Correction Classification system now has a **fully functional, production-ready resumable checkpoint system** that enables robust, fault-tolerant experiments. This system allows you to run large-scale studies without worrying about losing progress due to interruptions, API failures, or other issues.

## ✅ Current Status

**The checkpoint system is FULLY IMPLEMENTED and TESTED** with the following features:

### Key Features
- ✅ **Atomic JSONL writes** with file locking for concurrent safety
- ✅ **Resumable experiments** - skip already processed samples
- ✅ **Error logging and recovery** - errors don't crash entire runs
- ✅ **Deterministic resuming** - restore random states for reproducibility
- ✅ **Shard support** - enable parallel processing across multiple machines
- ✅ **Stable run IDs** - consistent naming for checkpoints
- ✅ **Progress tracking** - periodic checkpointing and status updates
- ✅ **Cost optimization** - avoid reprocessing expensive API calls

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage

Run experiments with checkpointing enabled (default):

```bash
python src/main.py run --dataset data/gsm8k.csv --resume
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Start fresh, delete existing checkpoints
python src/main.py run --dataset data/gsm8k.csv --overwrite

# Disable resuming 
python src/main.py run --dataset data/gsm8k.csv --no-resume

# Custom checkpoint frequency (every 5 samples)
python src/main.py run --dataset data/gsm8k.csv --checkpoint-every 5

# Run only a shard (for parallel processing)
python src/main.py run --dataset data/gsm8k.csv --shard 2/4  # Process shard 2 of 4
```

### Full-Scale Studies

Large studies automatically use checkpointing:

```bash
python run_full_scale_study.py --models gpt-4o,claude-sonnet --datasets gsm8k,humaneval
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Checkpoint Files

The system creates these files:
- `{stable_run_id}.jsonl` - Main checkpoint file with results
- `{stable_run_id}_resume_state.json` - Resume state with metadata
- `{stable_run_id}_errors.log` - Human-readable error log

### Stable Run IDs

Run IDs are generated deterministically based on:
- Dataset name
- Model identifier  
- Configuration hash
- Date (for daily separation)

Example: `20241217_gsm8k_gpt-4_a1b2c3d4.jsonl`

### Error Handling

The system handles errors gracefully:
- Individual sample failures don't crash entire runs
- Errors are logged with full context
- Failed samples can be retried on resume
- Error count tracking for monitoring

## 🧪 Testing

A comprehensive test suite verifies all functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
python test_checkpoint.py

# Run specific tests
python test_checkpoint.py --test basic
python test_checkpoint.py --test error
python test_checkpoint.py --test concurrent
python test_checkpoint.py --test resume
python test_checkpoint.py --test integration
```

### Test Coverage

## 🎯 Example Workflow

### Initial Run
```bash
python src/main.py run --dataset large_dataset.csv --checkpoint-every 10
```

Output:
```
📋 Checkpoint system enabled: outputs/20241217_large_dataset_gpt-4_a1b2c3d4.jsonl
Processing sample q1... ✅
Processing sample q2... ✅
...
💾 Checkpoint saved: 10 completed, 0 errors
Processing sample q11... ❌ Error processing sample q25: APIError
❌ Recorded error for q25: APIError
...
^C (Interrupted at sample 47)
```

### Resume Run
```bash
python src/main.py run --dataset large_dataset.csv  # --resume is default
```

Output:
```
📋 Loading existing checkpoint from outputs/20241217_large_dataset_gpt-4_a1b2c3d4.jsonl
✅ Loaded 46 completed samples from checkpoint
🔄 Restored random state for deterministic resume
⏭️ Skipping completed sample: q1
⏭️ Skipping completed sample: q2
⏭️ ... (skipping 44 more completed samples)
Processing sample q47... ✅
```

## 🔍 Monitoring Progress

Check checkpoint statistics:
```python
from src.utils.checkpoint import CheckpointManager

manager = CheckpointManager("outputs/experiment.jsonl")
stats = manager.get_stats()
print(f"Completed: {stats['completed_samples']}")
print(f"Errors: {stats['error_count']}")
print(f"Last checkpoint: {stats['last_checkpoint']}")
```
