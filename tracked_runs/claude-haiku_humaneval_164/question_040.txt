Response:
Certainly! Let's break down the problem and think through the solution step by step.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The function `prime_fib` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`-th number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number.

2. **Fibonacci Numbers**: Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The Fibonacci sequence is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on.

3. **Prime Numbers**: Prime numbers are positive integers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. Examples of prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and so on.

4. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we need to find the Fibonacci numbers and then check if each one is a prime number. We can keep track of the count of Fibonacci numbers that are also prime until we reach the `n`-th one.

5. **Implementation Steps**:
   a. Define a function to check if a number is prime.
   b. Define a function to generate Fibonacci numbers up to a certain limit.
   c. Combine the two functions to find the `n`-th Fibonacci number that is also a prime number.

Implementation:

```python
def is_prime(n: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a number is prime.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Generates the n-th Fibonacci number.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return (fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2))

def prime_fib(n: int) -> int:
    """
    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.
    """
    count = 0
    i = 0
    while True:
        fib_num = fibonacci(i)
        if is_prime(fib_num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return fib_num
        i += 1
```

Explanation:

1. The `is_prime` function checks if a given number `n` is prime. It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns `False`. Then, it checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number (inclusive). If it finds a divisor, it returns `False`, indicating that the number is not prime. Otherwise, it returns `True`, indicating that the number is prime.

2. The `fibonacci` function generates the `n`-th Fibonacci number. It uses recursion to calculate the Fibonacci sequence, where the `n`-th Fibonacci number is the sum of the `(n-1)`-th and `(n-2)`-th Fibonacci numbers.

3. The `prime_fib` function is the main function that solves the problem. It initializes a counter `count` to keep track of the number of Fibonacci numbers that are also prime. It then enters a loop that generates Fibonacci numbers one by one, checking if each Fibonacci number is prime using the `is_prime` function. If a Fibonacci number is prime, the `count` is incremented. Once the `count` reaches the input `n`, the function returns the corresponding Fibonacci number.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n * sqrt(n)), where n is the input, as the `is_prime` function checks for divisors up to the square root of the number.

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The function `prime_fib` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`-th number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
   a. Generate Fibonacci numbers until we have enough numbers to find the `n`-th Fibonacci number that is also prime.
   b. Check each Fibonacci number to see if it is a prime number.
   c. Keep track of the count of prime Fibonacci numbers and return the `n`-th one.

3. **Generating Fibonacci Numbers**: We can generate Fibonacci numbers using a simple recursive function or an iterative approach. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`, where `F(0) = 0` and `F(1) = 1`. We can start with the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1) and generate the sequence until we have enough numbers to find the `n`-th prime Fibonacci number.

4. **Checking for Prime Numbers**: To check if a number is prime, we can use a simple function that checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number. If no such divisor is found, the number is considered prime.

5. **Keeping Track of Prime Fibonacci Numbers**: As we generate and check the Fibonacci numbers, we can keep track of the count of prime Fibonacci numbers. Once we reach the `n`-th prime Fibonacci number, we can return it.

Implementation:

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def is_prime(n: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a given number is prime.
    """
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Generates the n-th Fibonacci number.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return (fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2))

def prime_fib(n: int) -> int:
    """
    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.
    """
    count = 0
    i = 0
    while True:
        fib_num = fibonacci(i)
        if is_prime(fib_num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return fib_num
        i += 1
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` and returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise. It checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number.

2. The `fibonacci` function takes an integer `n` and returns the `n`-th Fibonacci number. It uses a recursive approach to generate the Fibonacci sequence.

3. The `prime_fib` function is the main function that solves the problem. It initializes a counter `count` to keep track of the number of prime Fibonacci numbers found, and a variable `i` to keep track of the current Fibonacci number being checked.

4. The function enters a loop that continues until the `n`-th prime Fibonacci number is found. Inside the loop, it generates the `i`-th Fibonacci number using the `fibonacci` function, and then checks if the number is prime using the `is_prime` function.

5. If the Fibonacci number is prime, the `count` is incremented. If the `count` reaches `n`, the function returns the current Fibonacci number, which is the `n`-th prime Fibonacci number.

6. The loop continues to the next Fibonacci number by incrementing `i`.

This implementation ensures that the function correctly finds and returns the `n`-th prime Fibonacci number, as per the provided examples.

Response:

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
   a. Generate Fibonacci numbers until we have enough prime Fibonacci numbers to return the `n`-th one.
   b. Check if each Fibonacci number is prime.
   c. Keep track of the count of prime Fibonacci numbers and return the `n`-th one.

3. **Generating Fibonacci Numbers**: We can generate Fibonacci numbers using a simple recursive or iterative approach. For this problem, we'll use an iterative approach to generate the Fibonacci sequence.

4. **Checking for Primality**: To check if a number is prime, we can use the following logic:
   a. A number is prime if it is greater than 1 and has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   b. We can check this by iterating through all the numbers from 2 up to the square root of the given number and checking if any of them divide the number evenly.

5. **Keeping Track of Prime Fibonacci Numbers**: As we generate and check the Fibonacci numbers for primality, we'll keep a count of the number of prime Fibonacci numbers encountered. Once we reach the `n`-th prime Fibonacci number, we'll return it.

Implementation:

```python
def is_prime(n: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a given number is prime.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def prime_fib(n: int) -> int:
    """
    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")

    fib1, fib2 = 0, 1
    prime_fib_count = 0

    while True:
        if is_prime(fib2):
            prime_fib_count += 1
            if prime_fib_count == n:
                return fib2
        fib1, fib2 = fib2, fib1 + fib2
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` and returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise. It checks if the number is greater than 1 and has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. The `prime_fib` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`-th number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 0, we raise a `ValueError` because `n` must be a positive integer.
   - We initialize the Fibonacci sequence with `fib1 = 0` and `fib2 = 1`.
   - We also initialize a counter `prime_fib_count` to keep track of the number of prime Fibonacci numbers encountered.
   - We then enter a loop that continues until we have found the `n`-th prime Fibonacci number.
   - Inside the loop, we first check if the current Fibonacci number `fib2` is prime using the `is_prime` function.
   - If `fib2` is prime, we increment the `prime_fib_count`.
   - If the `prime_fib_count` is equal to `n`, we return the current Fibonacci number `fib2`, as it is the `n`-th prime Fibonacci number.
   - Finally, we update the Fibonacci sequence by setting `fib1 = fib2` and `fib2 = fib1 + fib2`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n * sqrt(fib_n)), where `fib_n` is the `n`-th Fibonacci number, as we need to generate the Fibonacci sequence and check each number for primality.
