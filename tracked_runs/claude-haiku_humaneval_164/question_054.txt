Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem is to implement a function `add(x, y)` that takes two integers `x` and `y` as input and returns their sum.

2. **Approach**: The approach to solving this problem is straightforward. We need to perform the addition operation on the two input numbers and return the result.

3. **Handling Input Types**: The problem statement specifies that the input parameters `x` and `y` are of type `int`. This means that we can assume the input will always be integers, and we don't need to perform any type checking or conversion.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: In this case, there are no specific edge cases mentioned in the problem statement. However, it's always a good practice to consider potential edge cases and handle them appropriately. For example, if the input values are extremely large and exceed the maximum integer size, we may need to handle that scenario.

5. **Implementing the Solution**: The implementation of the `add(x, y)` function is a simple one-liner that performs the addition operation and returns the result.

Implementation:

```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y
```

Here's the step-by-step explanation of the implementation:

1. The function signature `def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:` specifies that the function takes two integer parameters `x` and `y`, and it returns an integer value.

2. The docstring `"""Add two numbers x and y"""` provides a brief description of the function's purpose.

3. The implementation of the function is a single line of code: `return x + y`. This line performs the addition operation on the input parameters `x` and `y` and returns the result.

4. The provided doctest examples `>>> add(2, 3)` and `>>> add(5, 7)` demonstrate the expected behavior of the function, which is to correctly add the two input numbers and return the sum.

This implementation is straightforward and meets the requirements of the problem statement. It handles the input types as specified and does not require any additional error handling or edge case considerations.
