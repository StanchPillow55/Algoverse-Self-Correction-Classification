Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem is to write a function `is_palindrome` that takes a string `text` as input and returns `True` if the string is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

2. **Approach**: To determine if a string is a palindrome, we can compare the characters at the beginning of the string with the characters at the end of the string, and continue this process until we reach the middle of the string. If all the characters match, then the string is a palindrome.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: We need to consider the following edge cases:
   - An empty string should be considered a palindrome.
   - The function should be case-insensitive, meaning that "Aba" should be considered a palindrome.

4. **Pseudocode**:
   1. Check if the input string is empty. If it is, return `True` as an empty string is considered a palindrome.
   2. Convert the input string to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive.
   3. Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning of the string and one at the end of the string.
   4. Iterate through the string, comparing the characters at the two pointers.
   5. If the characters match, move the pointers inward.
   6. If the characters do not match, return `False` as the string is not a palindrome.
   7. If the loop completes without returning `False`, return `True` as the string is a palindrome.

Implementation:

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if given string is a palindrome.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The input string to be checked.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the input string is a palindrome, False otherwise.
    
    >>> is_palindrome('')
    True
    >>> is_palindrome('aba')
    True
    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')
    True
    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')
    False
    """
    # Check if the input string is empty
    if not text:
        return True
    
    # Convert the input string to lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    
    # Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the string
    left = 0
    right = len(text) - 1
    
    # Iterate through the string, comparing the characters at the two pointers
    while left < right:
        # If the characters at the two pointers do not match, the string is not a palindrome
        if text[left] != text[right]:
            return False
        
        # Move the pointers inward
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    
    # If the loop completes without returning False, the string is a palindrome
    return True
```

Explanation:

1. The function first checks if the input string is empty. If it is, the function returns `True` as an empty string is considered a palindrome.
2. The input string is then converted to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive.
3. Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are initialized to the beginning and end of the string, respectively.
4. The function then enters a loop that continues as long as the `left` pointer is less than the `right` pointer.
5. Inside the loop, the function compares the characters at the `left` and `right` pointers. If they do not match, the function returns `False` as the string is not a palindrome.
6. If the characters match, the function moves the `left` pointer one step to the right and the `right` pointer one step to the left.
7. If the loop completes without returning `False`, the function returns `True` as the string is a palindrome.

The provided docstring includes examples that demonstrate the expected behavior of the `is_palindrome` function.
