Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the problem**: The problem requires us to write a function called `multiply` that takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the product of their unit digits.

2. **Identifying the key steps**: To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
   a. Extract the unit digit of each input number.
   b. Multiply the unit digits.
   c. Return the result.

3. **Extracting the unit digit**: To extract the unit digit of a number, we can use the modulo operator `%`. The modulo operator gives us the remainder when the number is divided by 10, which is the unit digit.

4. **Multiplying the unit digits**: Once we have the unit digits of both numbers, we can simply multiply them to get the final result.

5. **Handling negative numbers**: The problem statement mentions that the input is always valid, but it's a good practice to handle negative numbers as well. When one or both of the input numbers are negative, the product of the unit digits should still be positive.

Implementation:

Here's the complete function definition with the reasoning explained:

```python
def multiply(a, b):
    """Complete the function that takes two integers and returns 
    the product of their unit digits.
    Assume the input is always valid.
    Examples:
    multiply(148, 412) should return 16.
    multiply(19, 28) should return 72.
    multiply(2020, 1851) should return 0.
    multiply(14,-15) should return 20.
    """
    # Extract the unit digits of the input numbers
    a_unit = abs(a) % 10
    b_unit = abs(b) % 10

    # Multiply the unit digits
    product = a_unit * b_unit

    # Return the result
    return product
```

Explanation:

1. We start by extracting the unit digits of the input numbers `a` and `b`. To do this, we use the `abs()` function to get the absolute value of the numbers, and then use the modulo operator `%` to get the remainder when divided by 10, which gives us the unit digit.

2. Next, we multiply the unit digits `a_unit` and `b_unit` to get the product.

3. Finally, we return the product as the result of the function.

The `abs()` function is used to handle negative numbers. By taking the absolute value of the input numbers, we ensure that the unit digits are always positive, and the final product will also be positive, as required by the problem statement.

This solution covers all the examples provided in the problem statement and should work for any valid input.

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the problem**: The function `multiply(a, b)` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the product of their unit digits. The function should handle both positive and negative integers, and the input is always valid.

2. **Analyzing the examples**: The examples provided give us a good understanding of the expected behavior of the function:
   - `multiply(148, 412)` should return `16` (the unit digits of 8 and 2 are 8 and 2, respectively, and their product is 16).
   - `multiply(19, 28)` should return `72` (the unit digits of 9 and 8 are 9 and 8, respectively, and their product is 72).
   - `multiply(2020, 1851)` should return `0` (the unit digits of 0 and 1 are 0 and 1, respectively, and their product is 0).
   - `multiply(14, -15)` should return `20` (the unit digits of 4 and 5 are 4 and 5, respectively, and their product is 20).

3. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Extract the unit digits of the input numbers `a` and `b`.
   b. Multiply the unit digits and return the result.

4. **Handling negative numbers**: The problem statement mentions that the function should handle both positive and negative integers. To handle negative numbers, we can take the absolute value of the unit digits before multiplying them.

Implementation:

```python
def multiply(a, b):
    """Complete the function that takes two integers and returns 
    the product of their unit digits.
    Assume the input is always valid.
    Examples:
    multiply(148, 412) should return 16.
    multiply(19, 28) should return 72.
    multiply(2020, 1851) should return 0.
    multiply(14, -15) should return 20.
    """
    # Extract the unit digits of a and b
    a_unit = abs(a % 10)
    b_unit = abs(b % 10)
    
    # Multiply the unit digits and return the result
    return a_unit * b_unit
```

Explanation:

1. The function `multiply(a, b)` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.
2. To extract the unit digits of `a` and `b`, we use the modulo operator `%` to get the remainder when divided by 10. This gives us the unit digit of each number.
3. To handle negative numbers, we take the absolute value of the unit digits using the `abs()` function before multiplying them.
4. The function then returns the product of the unit digits.

This solution covers all the examples provided and should work for any valid input of positive or negative integers.
