Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to write a function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest prime factor of `n`. We are given the assumption that `n` is greater than 1 and is not a prime number.

2. **Approach**: To find the largest prime factor of a number, we can use the following steps:
   - Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.
   - Divide the input number `n` by the current prime number and check if the result is divisible by the current prime number.
   - If the result is divisible, then the current prime number is a factor of `n`. We can continue dividing the result by the current prime number until the result is no longer divisible.
   - Once the result is no longer divisible by the current prime number, we move on to the next prime number and repeat the process.
   - We continue this process until we reach the square root of `n`, as any factor larger than the square root of `n` will have a corresponding factor that is smaller than the square root of `n`.
   - The largest prime factor we encounter during this process will be the answer.

3. **Implementation**:

```python
def largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
    # Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2
    prime = 2
    
    # Initialize the largest prime factor to 1
    largest_prime = 1
    
    # Iterate until we reach the square root of n
    while prime * prime <= n:
        # If n is divisible by the current prime number
        if n % prime == 0:
            # Update the largest prime factor
            largest_prime = prime
            
            # Divide n by the current prime number
            n //= prime
        else:
            # Move on to the next prime number
            if prime == 2:
                prime = 3
            else:
                prime += 2
    
    # If n is still greater than 1, it must be the largest prime factor
    if n > 1:
        largest_prime = n
    
    return largest_prime
```

Explanation of the Implementation:

1. We start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.
2. We initialize the `largest_prime` variable to 1, which will be updated as we find larger prime factors.
3. We iterate until we reach the square root of `n`, as any factor larger than the square root of `n` will have a corresponding factor that is smaller than the square root of `n`.
4. Inside the loop, we check if `n` is divisible by the current prime number. If it is, we update the `largest_prime` variable and divide `n` by the current prime number.
5. If `n` is not divisible by the current prime number, we move on to the next prime number. We start with 2 and then increment by 2 for the subsequent prime numbers (since all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd).
6. After the loop, if `n` is still greater than 1, it must be the largest prime factor, so we update the `largest_prime` variable accordingly.
7. Finally, we return the `largest_prime` as the result.

Example Usage:

```python
print(largest_prime_factor(13195))  # Output: 29
print(largest_prime_factor(2048))   # Output: 2
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(sqrt(n)), as we iterate until we reach the square root of `n`. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.
