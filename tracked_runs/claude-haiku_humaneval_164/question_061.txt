Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The `sum_to_n` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is a common mathematical problem known as the "sum of the first `n` natural numbers".

2. **Identifying the Pattern**: When we look at the examples provided, we can observe a pattern. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers can be calculated using the formula:

   ```
   sum_to_n(n) = n * (n + 1) / 2
   ```

   This formula is derived from the fact that the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is equal to the average of the first and last numbers multiplied by the total number of numbers.

3. **Considering Edge Cases**: We should also consider the edge cases, such as when `n` is 1 or 0. In these cases, the sum should be 1 and 0, respectively.

4. **Implementing the Solution**: Based on the pattern and the edge cases, we can implement the `sum_to_n` function as follows:

Implementation:

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the range of numbers to sum.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the first n natural numbers.
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * (n + 1) // 2
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We define the function `sum_to_n` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer.
2. We add a docstring to the function, which explains the purpose of the function, the input parameter, and the return value.
3. We handle the edge cases:
   - If `n` is 0, we return 0 because the sum of the first 0 natural numbers is 0.
   - If `n` is 1, we return 1 because the sum of the first 1 natural number is 1.
4. For all other cases, we calculate the sum using the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2`. The `//` operator performs integer division, which ensures that the result is an integer.

This implementation covers all the test cases provided in the problem statement and should work for any positive integer `n`.
