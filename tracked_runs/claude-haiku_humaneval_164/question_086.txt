Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem statement asks us to write a function `add(lst)` that takes a non-empty list of integers `lst` as input and returns the sum of the even elements that are at odd indices.

2. **Identifying the Key Elements**: The key elements in this problem are:
   - The input is a non-empty list of integers.
   - We need to identify the even elements that are at odd indices.
   - We need to add up those even elements at odd indices and return the sum.

3. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Iterate through the list, starting from the first element (index 0).
   b. Check if the current index is odd.
   c. If the index is odd and the element is even, add it to the running sum.
   d. Return the final sum.

4. **Implementation**: Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def add(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices.

    Args:
        lst (list): A non-empty list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the even elements at odd indices.
    """
    total = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 2 != 0 and num % 2 == 0:
            total += num
    return total
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We initialize a variable `total` to keep track of the running sum.
2. We use the `enumerate()` function to iterate through the list `lst`. This gives us both the index `i` and the corresponding element `num`.
3. Inside the loop, we check if the current index `i` is odd (using the modulo operator `%`). If the index is odd and the element `num` is even (also using the modulo operator `%`), we add the element to the `total` variable.
4. Finally, we return the `total` sum.

Example Usage:

```python
print(add([4, 2, 6, 7]))  # Output: 2
```

In the example, the list `[4, 2, 6, 7]` is passed to the `add()` function. The even elements at odd indices are `2` (at index 1) and `6` (at index 2). The sum of these even elements is `2 + 6 = 8`, which is the expected output.

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem statement asks us to write a function `add(lst)` that takes a non-empty list of integers `lst` as input and returns the sum of the even elements that are at odd indices.

2. **Analyzing the Example**: The example provided states that for the input list `[4, 2, 6, 7]`, the function should return `2`. This is because the even element at the odd index (index 1) is `2`, and there are no other even elements at odd indices in the list.

3. **Identifying the Key Steps**: To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
   a. Iterate through the list and identify the even elements at odd indices.
   b. Add up the values of these even elements.
   c. Return the final sum.

4. **Developing the Solution**: Here's the step-by-step approach to implement the `add(lst)` function:
   a. Initialize a variable `total` to keep track of the sum of the even elements at odd indices.
   b. Iterate through the list using a `for` loop, starting from index 1 (the first odd index) and incrementing the index by 2 (to skip the even indices).
   c. For each odd index, check if the element at that index is even. If it is, add it to the `total` variable.
   d. After the loop, return the final value of `total`.

Implementation:

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def add(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices."""
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            total += lst[i]
    return total
```

Let's break down the implementation:

1. The function takes a non-empty list of integers `lst` as input.
2. We initialize a variable `total` to keep track of the sum of the even elements at odd indices.
3. We use a `for` loop to iterate through the list, starting from index 1 (the first odd index) and incrementing the index by 2 (to skip the even indices).
4. For each odd index `i`, we check if the element `lst[i]` is even using the modulo operator `%`. If the remainder is 0, it means the number is even, and we add it to the `total` variable.
5. After the loop, we return the final value of `total`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, as we need to iterate through the entire list once.
