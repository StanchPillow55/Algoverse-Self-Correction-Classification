Response:
Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step and provide a solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the problem**: The function `file_name_check` takes a string `file_name` as input and returns 'Yes' if the file name is valid, and 'No' otherwise. The file name is considered valid if it meets the following conditions:
   - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
   - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
   - The substring before the dot should not be empty and should start with a letter from the Latin alphabet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
   - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll'].

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Check the number of digits in the file name.
   - Check if the file name contains exactly one dot.
   - Check if the substring before the dot is not empty and starts with a letter from the Latin alphabet.
   - Check if the substring after the dot is one of the valid extensions: 'txt', 'exe', or 'dll'.

3. **Implementation**:

```python
def file_name_check(file_name):
    """

    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    """
    # Check the number of digits in the file name
    digits_count = sum(1 for char in file_name if char.isdigit())
    if digits_count > 3:
        return 'No'

    # Check if the file name contains exactly one dot
    dot_count = file_name.count('.')
    if dot_count != 1:
        return 'No'

    # Split the file name into the substring before and after the dot
    parts = file_name.split('.')
    prefix, extension = parts[0], parts[1]

    # Check if the prefix is not empty and starts with a letter from the Latin alphabet
    if not prefix or not prefix[0].isalpha():
        return 'No'

    # Check if the extension is one of the valid extensions
    valid_extensions = ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    if extension not in valid_extensions:
        return 'No'

    # If all conditions are met, the file name is valid
    return 'Yes'
```

Explanation:

1. The function first checks the number of digits in the file name using a loop and the `sum()` function. If there are more than three digits, the function returns 'No'.
2. Next, the function checks if the file name contains exactly one dot using the `count()` method. If the count is not 1, the function returns 'No'.
3. The function then splits the file name into the prefix (the substring before the dot) and the extension (the substring after the dot) using the `split()` method.
4. The function checks if the prefix is not empty and starts with a letter from the Latin alphabet using the `isalpha()` method. If the condition is not met, the function returns 'No'.
5. Finally, the function checks if the extension is one of the valid extensions ('txt', 'exe', or 'dll') using a list comparison. If the extension is not valid, the function returns 'No'.
6. If all the conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.

This solution covers all the requirements specified in the problem statement and provides a clear and concise implementation.

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the problem**: The function `file_name_check` takes a string `file_name` as input and returns 'Yes' if the file name is valid, and 'No' otherwise. The file name is considered valid if it meets the following conditions:
   - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
   - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
   - The substring before the dot should not be empty and should start with a letter from the Latin alphabet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
   - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll'].

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can break down the problem into smaller steps and use various string manipulation and validation techniques in Python.

3. **Step 1: Count the number of digits in the file name**: We can use a regular expression to count the number of digits in the file name. If the count is greater than 3, the file name is invalid.

4. **Step 2: Check if the file name contains exactly one dot**: We can use the `count()` method to check if the file name contains exactly one dot.

5. **Step 3: Check if the substring before the dot is not empty and starts with a Latin alphabet letter**: We can use string slicing to get the substring before the dot and check if it's not empty and starts with a letter from the Latin alphabet.

6. **Step 4: Check if the substring after the dot is one of the valid extensions**: We can use string slicing to get the substring after the dot and check if it's one of the valid extensions: 'txt', 'exe', or 'dll'.

7. **Step 5: Combine the results and return the appropriate response**: If all the conditions are met, we return 'Yes'; otherwise, we return 'No'.

Implementation:

```python

    if after_dot not in valid_extensions:
        return 'No'

    # Step 5: Combine the results and return the appropriate response
    return 'Yes'
```

Explanation:

1. In the first step, we use a regular expression `r'\d'` to count the number of digits in the file name. If the count is greater than 3, we return 'No'.

2. In the second step, we use the `count()` method to check if the file name contains exactly one dot. If not, we return 'No'.
