Response:
Certainly! Let's break down the problem and think through the solution step by step.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the problem**: The function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` takes a number `n` as input and evaluates whether it can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.

2. **Identifying the constraints**: The function should return `True` if the given number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers, and `False` otherwise.

3. **Developing the approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Check if the given number `n` is divisible by 4. If it's not, then it cannot be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers, and we can return `False`.
   b. If `n` is divisible by 4, we can try to find 4 positive even numbers that add up to `n`.
   c. To find the 4 positive even numbers, we can start with the smallest even number (2) and keep adding 2 until the sum of the 4 numbers is equal to `n`.

4. **Implementing the solution**:

```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers"""
    # Check if n is divisible by 4
    if n % 4 != 0:
        return False

    # Find 4 positive even numbers that add up to n
    even_num = 2
    sum_even = 0
    while sum_even < n:
        sum_even += even_num
        even_num += 2

    # Check if the sum of the 4 even numbers is equal to n
    return sum_even == n
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. The function first checks if the given number `n` is divisible by 4. If it's not, then it cannot be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers, and the function returns `False`.

2. If `n` is divisible by 4, the function initializes the `even_num` variable to 2 (the smallest positive even number) and the `sum_even` variable to 0.

3. The function then enters a loop that continues until the `sum_even` variable is greater than or equal to `n`. In each iteration of the loop, the function adds the current `even_num` to the `sum_even` variable and increments the `even_num` by 2 (to get the next even number).

4. After the loop, the function checks if the `sum_even` variable is equal to `n`. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` can be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach ensures that the function correctly evaluates whether the given number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` takes a number `n` as input and evaluates whether it can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.

2. **Analyzing the Examples**: The provided examples give us some insight into the problem:
   - `is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False`: 4 cannot be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers.
   - `is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False`: 6 cannot be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers.
   - `is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True`: 8 can be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers (2 + 2 + 2 + 2).

3. **Identifying the Constraints**: The problem statement indicates that we need to find a way to determine if a given number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.

4. **Developing the Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Check if the given number `n` is divisible by 4. If it's not, then it cannot be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers, and we can return `False`.
   b. If `n` is divisible by 4, we can check if it can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers. We can do this by iterating through all possible combinations of four positive even numbers that add up to `n`.

5. **Implementing the Solution**: Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers"""
    # Check if n is divisible by 4
    if n % 4 != 0:
        return False

    # Check if n can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers
    for i in range(2, n // 4 + 1, 2):
        for j in range(i, n // 2 + 1, 2):
            for k in range(j, n - j - i + 1, 2):
                if i + j + k + (n - i - j - k) == n:
                    return True

    return False
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We first check if the given number `n` is divisible by 4. If it's not, then it cannot be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers, and we return `False`.
2. If `n` is divisible by 4, we start a nested loop to iterate through all possible combinations of four positive even numbers that add up to `n`.
   - The outer loop iterates through the first even number `i` from 2 to `n // 4 + 1` (inclusive) with a step of 2 (to only consider even numbers).
   - The second loop iterates through the second even number `j` from `i` to `n // 2 + 1` (inclusive) with a step of 2.
   - The third loop iterates through the third even number `k` from `j` to `n - j - i + 1` (inclusive) with a step of 2.
   - The fourth number is calculated as `n - i - j - k`.
3. If we find a combination of four positive even numbers that add up to `n`, we return `True`.
4. If we've exhausted all possible combinations and haven't found a solution, we return `False`.

This approach ensures that we check all possible combinations of four positive even numbers that add up to the given number `n`. If we find a valid combination, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to write a function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` that evaluates whether the given number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.

2. **Analyzing the Examples**: The provided examples give us some insights into the problem:
   - `is_equal_to_sum_even(4)` should return `False` because 4 cannot be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers.
   - `is_equal_to_sum_even(6)` should return `False` because 6 cannot be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers.
   - `is_equal_to_sum_even(8)` should return `True` because 8 can be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers (2 + 2 + 2 + 2).

3. **Developing the Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Check if the given number `n` is divisible by 4. If it's not, then it cannot be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers, and we can return `False`.
   b. If `n` is divisible by 4, we can check if it can be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers by trying different combinations of even numbers.
   c. We can start with the smallest even number, which is 2, and try to find 4 even numbers that add up to `n`.
   d. If we can find 4 even numbers that add up to `n`, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

4. **Implementing the Solution**:

```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers"""
    # Check if n is divisible by 4
    if n % 4 != 0:
        return False

    # Try to find 4 even numbers that add up to n
    even_num = 2
    while even_num <= n // 4:
        if (n - 4 * even_num) >= 0 and (n - 4 * even_num) % 4 == 0:
            return True
        even_num += 2

    return False
```

Explanation of the Implementation:

1. We first check if the given number `n` is divisible by 4. If it's not, then it cannot be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers, and we return `False`.
2. If `n` is divisible by 4, we start with the smallest even number, which is 2, and try to find 4 even numbers that add up to `n`.
3. We use a `while` loop to iterate through the even numbers, starting from 2 and incrementing by 2 (since all even numbers are divisible by 2).
4. Inside the loop, we check if the difference between `n` and 4 times the current even number (`n - 4 * even_num`) is greater than or equal to 0 and is also divisible by 4. If this condition is met, it means we have found 4 even numbers that add up to `n`, and we return `True`.
5. If we cannot find 4 even numbers that add up to `n` after iterating through all possible even numbers up to `n // 4`, we return `False`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n/4), which is effectively O(n), as we iterate through the even numbers up to `n // 4`.
