Question:

def tri(n):
    """Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
    the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Examples:
    tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]

Response:
Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to implement a function `tri(n)` that returns a list of the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. The Tribonacci sequence is defined by the following recurrence relation:
   - `tri(1) = 3`
   - `tri(n) = 1 + n / 2`, if `n` is even
   - `tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1)`, if `n` is odd

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. We'll define a helper function that calculates the Tribonacci sequence for a given `n` and then return the first `n + 1` elements of the sequence.

3. **Implementing the Solution**: Here's the step-by-step implementation:

   a. Define the `tri` function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
   b. Inside the `tri` function, define a helper function `tribonacci` that calculates the Tribonacci sequence for a given `n`.
   c. In the `tribonacci` function, handle the base cases:
      - If `n` is 1, return 3 (as per the problem statement).
      - If `n` is even, return `1 + n / 2`.
      - If `n` is odd, recursively calculate `tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1)`.
   d. In the `tri` function, call the `tribonacci` function for values from 0 to `n` and store the results in a list.
   e. Return the list of the first `n + 1` Tribonacci numbers.

        else:
            return tribonacci(n - 1) + tribonacci(n - 2) + tribonacci(n + 1)

    result = []
    for i in range(n + 1):
        result.append(tribonacci(i))
    return result
```

Explanation:

1. The `tri` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
2. Inside the `tri` function, we define a helper function `tribonacci` that calculates the Tribonacci number for a given `n`.
3. The `tribonacci` function handles the base cases:
   - If `n` is 1, it returns 3 (as per the problem statement).
   - If `n` is even, it returns `1 + n / 2`.
   - If `n` is odd, it recursively calculates `tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1)`.
4. In the `tri` function, we call the `tribonacci` function for values from 0 to `n` and store the results in a list.
5. Finally, we return the list of the first `n + 1` Tribonacci numbers.

This solution uses a recursive approach to calculate the Tribonacci sequence, which ensures that the correct values are generated based on the problem statement. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), as we need to calculate each Tribonacci number up to the nth one.

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to implement a function `tri(n)` that returns a list of the first `n + 1` numbers in the Tribonacci sequence. The Tribonacci sequence is defined by the following recurrence relation:
   - `tri(1) = 3`
   - `tri(n) = 1 + n / 2` if `n` is even
   - `tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1)` if `n` is odd

2. **Identifying the Base Case**: The base case for the Tribonacci sequence is `tri(1) = 3`. This will be the starting point for our recursive function.

3. **Handling Even and Odd Cases**: The problem statement provides the formulas for calculating `tri(n)` when `n` is even and when `n` is odd. We need to implement these cases in our function.

4. **Generating the List**: The function should return a list of the first `n + 1` numbers in the Tribonacci sequence. We can achieve this by iterating from `1` to `n + 1` and appending the calculated values to the list.

Implementation:

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def tri(n):
    """
    Returns a list of the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.

    Args:
        n (int): A non-negative integer representing the number of Tribonacci numbers to generate.

    Returns:
        list: A list of the first n + 1 Tribonacci numbers.
    """
    if n == 0:
        return [3]

    tribonacci_sequence = [3]  # Initialize the sequence with the base case

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            tribonacci_sequence.append(1 + i // 2)
        else:
            prev_1 = tribonacci_sequence[-1] if i > 1 else 0
            prev_2 = tribonacci_sequence[-2] if i > 2 else 0
            next_1 = tribonacci_sequence[i // 2] if i > 1 else 0
            tribonacci_sequence.append(prev_1 + prev_2 + next_1)

    return tribonacci_sequence
```

Explanation:

1. The function first checks if `n` is 0. If so, it returns a list containing only the base case value of 3.
2. The function initializes the `tribonacci_sequence` list with the base case value of 3.
3. It then iterates from 1 to `n + 1` (inclusive) to generate the remaining Tribonacci numbers.
4. For each iteration, the function checks if the current index `i` is even or odd.
   - If `i` is even, the function calculates the Tribonacci number using the formula `1 + i // 2` and appends it to the `tribonacci_sequence` list.
   - If `i` is odd, the function calculates the Tribonacci number using the formula `tribonacci_sequence[-1] + tribonacci_sequence[-2] + tribonacci_sequence[i // 2]` and appends it to the `tribonacci_sequence` list.
5. Finally, the function returns the `tribonacci_sequence` list.

This implementation handles the base case, the even case, and the odd case as specified in the problem statement. It generates the Tribonacci sequence and returns the list of the first `n + 1` Tribonacci numbers.

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to implement a function `tri(n)` that returns a list of the first `n + 1` numbers in the Tribonacci sequence. The Tribonacci sequence is defined by the following recurrence relation:
   - `tri(1) = 3`
   - `tri(n) = 1 + n / 2` if `n` is even
   - `tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1)` if `n` is odd

2. **Analyzing the Examples**: The provided examples help us understand the expected behavior of the function:
   - `tri(3)` should return `[1, 3, 2, 8]`
   - `tri(2)` should return `[1, 3, 2]`
   - `tri(4)` should return `[1, 3, 2, 8, 3]`

3. **Approach**: To implement the `tri(n)` function, we can follow these steps:
   - Initialize a list to store the Tribonacci sequence.
   - Add the base case value `tri(1) = 3` to the list.
   - Iterate from 2 to `n`, and for each `i`, calculate the next Tribonacci number based on the given recurrence relation.
   - Append the calculated Tribonacci number to the list.
   - Return the list.

4. **Edge Cases**: We should consider the following edge cases:
   - If `n` is 0 or negative, we should return an empty list.
   - If `n` is 1, we should return a list with a single element `[3]`.

Implementation:

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def tri(n):

    Args:
        n (int): A non-negative integer representing the number of Tribonacci numbers to generate.

    Returns:
        list: A list of the first n + 1 Tribonacci numbers.
    """
    if n < 0:
        return []
    elif n == 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [3]
    else:
        tribonacci_sequence = [1, 3, 2]
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                tribonacci_sequence.append(1 + i // 2)
            else:
                tribonacci_sequence.append(tribonacci_sequence[i - 1] + tribonacci_sequence[i - 2] + tribonacci_sequence[i])
        return tribonacci_sequence
```

Explanation:

1. We start by handling the edge cases:
   - If `n` is negative, we return an empty list.
   - If `n` is 0, we return an empty list.
   - If `n` is 1, we return a list with a single element `[3]`.

2. For the general case, we initialize the `tribonacci_sequence` list with the first three Tribonacci numbers: `[1, 3, 2]`.

3. We then iterate from 3 to `n + 1` (inclusive) and calculate the next Tribonacci number based on the given recurrence relation:
   - If `i` is even, we calculate `tri(i) = 1 + i / 2` and append it to the `tribonacci_sequence` list.
   - If `i` is odd, we calculate `tri(i) = tri(i - 1) + tri(i - 2) + tri(i + 1)` and append it to the `tribonacci_sequence` list.

4. Finally, we return the `tribonacci_sequence` list, which now contains the first `n + 1` Tribonacci numbers.

This implementation covers all the provided examples and handles the edge cases correctly. It follows the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the final solution.
