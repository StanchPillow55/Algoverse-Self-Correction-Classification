Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to write a function `filter_by_substring` that takes a list of strings `strings` and a substring `substring` as input, and returns a new list containing only the strings from the input list that contain the given substring.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can use a list comprehension to iterate through the input list of strings and filter out the ones that contain the given substring.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The problem statement provides two test cases, one with an empty input list and one with a non-empty input list. We need to ensure that our function handles these edge cases correctly.

4. **Implementation**: Here's the step-by-step implementation of the `filter_by_substring` function:

```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Filter an input list of strings only for ones that contain the given substring.

    Args:
        strings (List[str]): The input list of strings to be filtered.
        substring (str): The substring to be used for filtering.

    Returns:
        List[str]: A new list containing only the strings from the input list that contain the given substring.
    """
    # Handle the edge case of an empty input list
    if not strings:
        return []

    # Use a list comprehension to filter the input list based on the given substring
    filtered_strings = [s for s in strings if substring in s]

    return filtered_strings
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. The function takes two arguments: `strings` (a list of strings) and `substring` (the substring to be used for filtering).
2. We first handle the edge case of an empty input list by returning an empty list.
3. We then use a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `strings` and create a new list `filtered_strings` containing only the strings that contain the given `substring`.
4. Finally, we return the `filtered_strings` list.

This implementation covers the two test cases provided in the problem statement:

```python
>>> filter_by_substring([], 'a')
[]
>>> filter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
['abc', 'bacd', 'array']
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list `strings`, as we need to iterate through the entire list once. The space complexity is also O(n), as we create a new list `filtered_strings` with the same length as the input list (in the worst case, all strings contain the given substring).
