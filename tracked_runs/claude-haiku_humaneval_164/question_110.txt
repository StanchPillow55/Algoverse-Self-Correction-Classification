Question:

def move_one_ball(arr):
    """We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
    the following operation on the given array:
        You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.
    
    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
    position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

    If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
    then return True else return False.
    If the given array is empty then return True.

    Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

    For Example:
    
    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
    Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
                 be achieved for the given array.
    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
    Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given
                array by performing any number of right shift operations.

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the problem**: The problem asks us to determine if it is possible to sort an array in non-decreasing order by performing a right shift operation on the array any number of times. The right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one position to the right, with the last element being moved to the starting position (index 0).

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Check if the given array is empty. If it is, return `True` as an empty array is already sorted.
   b. Iterate through the array and check if the elements are in non-decreasing order. If they are, return `True` as no right shift operation is needed.
   c. If the elements are not in non-decreasing order, we need to check if it is possible to sort the array by performing right shift operations.
   d. To do this, we can iterate through the array and check if the current element is the smallest element in the remaining unsorted part of the array. If it is, we can perform a right shift operation to move this element to the beginning of the array.
   e. If we can perform the right shift operation for all elements, we can sort the array, and the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.

3. **Implementation**:

```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    """
    Determines if it is possible to sort an array in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations.
    
    Args:
        arr (list): An array of integers.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if it is possible to sort the array, False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if the array is empty
    if not arr:
        return True
    
    # Check if the array is already sorted
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i+1] for i in range(len(arr)-1)):
        return True
    
    # Iterate through the array and check if the current element is the smallest in the remaining unsorted part
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if all(arr[i] <= arr[j] for j in range(i, len(arr))):
            # Perform a right shift operation
            arr = [arr[-1]] + arr[:-1]
            # Check if the array is now sorted
            if all(arr[i] <= arr[i+1] for i in range(len(arr)-1)):
                return True
    
    # If we couldn't sort the array, return False
    return False
```

Explanation of the implementation:

1. We first check if the given array is empty. If it is, we return `True` as an empty array is already sorted.
2. Next, we check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, we return `True` as no right shift operation is needed.
3. If the array is not sorted, we iterate through the array and check if the current element is the smallest element in the remaining unsorted part of the array.
4. If the current element is the smallest, we perform a right shift operation by moving the last element to the beginning of the array.
5. After the right shift operation, we check if the array is now sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, we return `True`.
6. If we couldn't sort the array by performing any number of right shift operations, we return `False`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array, as we need to iterate through the array multiple times to check if the current element is the smallest in the remaining unsorted part.
