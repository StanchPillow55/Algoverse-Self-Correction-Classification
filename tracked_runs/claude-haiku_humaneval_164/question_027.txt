Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem statement asks us to write a function `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers `numbers` as input and returns a new list where all elements that occur more than once have been removed. The order of the remaining elements should be preserved.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary (or a set) to keep track of the elements and their frequencies. We'll iterate through the input list and add each element to the dictionary, keeping track of the count. Then, we'll create a new list containing only the elements that have a count of 1.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
   a. Initialize an empty dictionary (or set) to store the elements and their frequencies.
   b. Iterate through the input list `numbers`.
      i. For each element, check if it's already in the dictionary (or set).
      ii. If the element is not in the dictionary (or set), add it with a count of 1.
      iii. If the element is already in the dictionary (or set), increment its count.
   c. Create a new list and iterate through the dictionary (or set).
      i. For each element in the dictionary (or set), check if its count is 1.
      ii. If the count is 1, add the element to the new list.
   d. Return the new list.

4. **Implementation**:

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """
    # Step 1: Initialize an empty dictionary to store the elements and their frequencies
    element_counts = {}

    # Step 2: Iterate through the input list and update the dictionary
    for num in numbers:
        if num in element_counts:
            element_counts[num] += 1
        else:
            element_counts[num] = 1

    # Step 3: Create a new list with elements that have a count of 1
    result = [num for num, count in element_counts.items() if count == 1]

    return result
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We initialize an empty dictionary `element_counts` to store the elements and their frequencies.
2. We iterate through the input list `numbers` and update the `element_counts` dictionary. If an element is already in the dictionary, we increment its count. If it's not in the dictionary, we add it with a count of 1.
3. We create a new list `result` using a list comprehension. We iterate through the `element_counts` dictionary and add an element to the `result` list if its count is 1.
4. Finally, we return the `result` list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, as we need to iterate through the list once to update the dictionary, and then iterate through the dictionary to create the result list.

The space complexity is also O(n), as we need to store the elements and their frequencies in the dictionary.
