Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The Fib4 number sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but it's defined differently. The sequence is defined as follows:
   - `fib4(0) = 0`
   - `fib4(1) = 0`
   - `fib4(2) = 2`
   - `fib4(3) = 0`
   - `fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)`

2. **Approach**: Since the problem states that we should not use recursion, we can use an iterative approach to compute the Fib4 sequence. We can store the previous four values of the sequence and use them to compute the next value.

3. **Implementation**: To implement the `fib4` function, we can follow these steps:
   - Initialize a list to store the first four values of the sequence: `[0, 0, 2, 0]`.
   - Iterate from 4 to the given `n` and compute the next value of the sequence by summing the previous four values.
   - Append the new value to the list and remove the oldest value.
   - Return the last value in the list.

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def fib4(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Compute the n-th element of the Fib4 number sequence.

    Args:
        n (int): The index of the Fib4 number to compute.

    Returns:
        int: The n-th Fib4 number.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a non-negative integer")
    if n < 4:
        return [0, 0, 2, 0][n]

    fib4_sequence = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    for _ in range(4, n + 1):
        next_fib4 = sum(fib4_sequence)
        fib4_sequence.append(next_fib4)
        fib4_sequence.pop(0)

    return fib4_sequence[-1]
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We first handle the base cases where `n` is less than 4. In these cases, we can simply return the corresponding value from the list `[0, 0, 2, 0]`.
2. We initialize the `fib4_sequence` list with the first four values of the sequence: `[0, 0, 2, 0]`.
3. We then iterate from 4 to the given `n` and compute the next value of the sequence by summing the previous four values. We append the new value to the list and remove the oldest value.
4. Finally, we return the last value in the `fib4_sequence` list, which is the `n`-th Fib4 number.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), as we only need to store the last four values of the sequence.
