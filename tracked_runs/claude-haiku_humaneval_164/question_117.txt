Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to sort an array of non-negative integers based on the number of ones in their binary representation. If two numbers have the same number of ones, they should be sorted based on their decimal value.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Convert each number in the array to its binary representation.
   b. Count the number of ones in the binary representation of each number.
   c. Sort the array based on the number of ones, and if two numbers have the same number of ones, sort them based on their decimal value.

3. **Implementation**:

```python
def sort_array(arr):
    """

    """
    # Convert each number to its binary representation and count the number of ones
    binary_counts = [(bin(num).count('1'), num) for num in arr]

    # Sort the array based on the number of ones and decimal value
    sorted_binary_counts = sorted(binary_counts)

    # Extract the sorted numbers from the sorted binary counts
    sorted_arr = [num for _, num in sorted_binary_counts]

    return sorted_arr
```

Explanation:

1. We start by converting each number in the input array to its binary representation using the `bin()` function. We then count the number of ones in the binary representation using the `count('1')` method.
2. We create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of ones in the binary representation and the original number.
3. We sort the list of tuples based on the number of ones (the first element of each tuple) and the decimal value (the second element of each tuple) using the `sorted()` function.
4. Finally, we extract the sorted numbers from the sorted list of tuples and return the resulting sorted array.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and a space complexity of O(n) due to the additional list of tuples we create.

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to sort an array of non-negative integers based on the number of ones in their binary representation. If two numbers have the same number of ones, they should be sorted based on their decimal value.

2. **Analyzing the Examples**: The provided examples give us a clear understanding of the expected behavior:
   - `sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`: The array is sorted based on the number of ones in the binary representation, and numbers with the same number of ones are sorted based on their decimal value.
   - `sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]) == [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]`: The function should also handle negative numbers.
   - `sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4]) == [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`: The function should handle the case where there are numbers with the same number of ones.

3. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Convert each number in the input array to its binary representation.
   b. Count the number of ones in the binary representation of each number.
   c. Sort the array based on the number of ones, and if two numbers have the same number of ones, sort them based on their decimal value.

    sorted_binary_counts = sorted(binary_counts)

    # Extract the sorted numbers from the sorted binary counts
    sorted_arr = [num for _, num in sorted_binary_counts]

    return sorted_arr
```

Explanation of the implementation:

1. We use a list comprehension to convert each number in the input array to its binary representation and count the number of ones. The result is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the count of ones and the original number.

2. We then sort the list of tuples based on the count of ones (the first element of each tuple) and the decimal value (the second element of each tuple). The `sorted()` function will sort the list based on these criteria.

3. Finally, we extract the sorted numbers from the sorted list of tuples and return the resulting sorted array.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the length of the input array. The space complexity is O(n) due to the additional list of tuples we create to store the binary representation and the count of ones.

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to sort an array of non-negative integers based on the number of ones in their binary representation. If two numbers have the same number of ones, they should be sorted based on their decimal value.

2. **Analyzing the Examples**: The provided examples give us a good understanding of the expected behavior of the function.
   - The first example `sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])` should return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. This is because the binary representation of these numbers has the following number of ones: `1 (1), 2 (1), 3 (2), 4 (1), 5 (2)`. So, the array is sorted first by the number of ones and then by the decimal value.
   - The second example `sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6])` should return `[-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]`. This is because the problem statement mentions that the function should work for non-negative integers, so the negative numbers are not a concern.
   - The third example `sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4])` should return `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. This is because the numbers are already sorted by the number of ones in their binary representation, which is `0, 1, 1, 2, 1`, respectively.

3. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Convert each number in the input array to its binary representation.
   - Count the number of ones in the binary representation of each number.
   - Sort the array based on the number of ones, and if two numbers have the same number of ones, sort them based on their decimal value.

4. **Implementation**: Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def sort_array(arr):
    """
    Sort an array of non-negative integers according to the number of ones in their binary representation.
    If two numbers have the same number of ones, sort them based on their decimal value.

    Args:
        arr (list): An array of non-negative integers.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted array.
    """
    return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x))
```

Explanation:

1. The `sorted()` function is used to sort the input array `arr`.
2. The `key` parameter of the `sorted()` function is used to define the sorting criteria.
3. The `lambda` function `lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x)` is used as the `key` function.
   - `bin(x)` converts the integer `x` to its binary representation as a string.
   - `bin(x).count('1')` counts the number of ones in the binary representation of `x`.
   - The tuple `(bin(x).count('1'), x)` is used as the sorting key, where the first element is the number of ones, and the second element is the decimal value of the number.
4. The sorted array is returned as the result.

This solution ensures that the array is sorted first by the number of ones in the binary representation of each number, and then by the decimal value of the numbers if they have the same number of ones.
