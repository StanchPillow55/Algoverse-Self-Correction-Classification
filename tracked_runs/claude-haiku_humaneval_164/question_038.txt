Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem statement asks us to write a function `sort_even(l)` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` with the following properties:
   - The values at the odd indices in `l'` are the same as the values at the odd indices in `l`.
   - The values at the even indices in `l'` are the same as the values at the even indices in `l`, but sorted.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Identify the even and odd indices in the input list `l`.
   b. Extract the values at the even indices and sort them.
   c. Create a new list `l'` by combining the values at the odd indices from `l` and the sorted even values.

3. **Implementation**:

```python
def sort_even(l: list) -> list:
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal
    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
    [5, 4, 3, 6]
    """
    even_values = sorted([l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 2 == 0])
    return [l[i] if i % 2 != 0 else even_values[i // 2] for i in range(len(l))]
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We start by creating a list `even_values` that contains the values at the even indices of the input list `l`. We use a list comprehension to achieve this: `[l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 2 == 0]`. This will give us a list of all the values at the even indices.
2. We then sort the `even_values` list using the built-in `sorted()` function.
3. Finally, we create the output list `l'` by iterating through the indices of the input list `l`. If the current index is odd, we take the value from the original list `l`. If the current index is even, we take the corresponding value from the sorted `even_values` list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input list `l`. This is because the sorting operation on the `even_values` list takes O(n log n) time, and the rest of the operations are linear.

The space complexity is O(n), as we need to create a new list `even_values` to store the even values from the input list.
