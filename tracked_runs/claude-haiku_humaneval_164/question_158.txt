    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to write a function `right_angle_triangle` that takes three arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. The function should return `True` if the three sides form a right-angled triangle, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Identifying the Criteria for a Right-Angled Triangle**: A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one of the angles is a right angle, or 90 degrees. This means that the square of the length of the longest side (the hypotenuse) should be equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This is known as the Pythagorean Theorem.

3. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Identify the longest side of the triangle (the hypotenuse).
   b. Calculate the square of the length of the hypotenuse.
   c. Calculate the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
   d. Compare the two values. If they are equal, the triangle is a right-angled triangle, and the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.

Implementation:

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''
    # Identify the longest side (the hypotenuse)
    hypotenuse = max(a, b, c)
    
    # Calculate the square of the length of the hypotenuse
    hypotenuse_squared = hypotenuse ** 2
    
    # Calculate the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides
    other_sides_squared = a ** 2 + b ** 2 + c ** 2 - hypotenuse_squared
    
    # Compare the two values
    if hypotenuse_squared == other_sides_squared:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

Explanation:

1. We start by identifying the longest side of the triangle, which is the hypotenuse. We use the `max()` function to find the largest of the three sides.
2. We then calculate the square of the length of the hypotenuse using the `**` operator.
3. Next, we calculate the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. We do this by adding the squares of all three sides and then subtracting the square of the hypotenuse.
4. Finally, we compare the square of the hypotenuse to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. If they are equal, the triangle is a right-angled triangle, and we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(1) since it performs a constant number of operations, and a space complexity of O(1) since it only uses a constant amount of additional memory.
