Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem statement asks us to write a function `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of numbers (at least two elements) as input and applies a linear transformation to the list such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest number becomes 1.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
   a. Find the minimum and maximum values in the input list.
   b. Apply a linear transformation to the input list using the minimum and maximum values.
   c. Return the transformed list.

3. **Detailed Explanation**:
   a. **Finding the Minimum and Maximum Values**: We can use the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the input list, respectively.
   b. **Applying the Linear Transformation**: The linear transformation can be expressed as:
      `transformed_value = (original_value - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)`
      This formula ensures that the smallest value in the list becomes 0 and the largest value becomes 1.
   c. **Returning the Transformed List**: We can apply the linear transformation to each element in the input list and return the transformed list.

Implementation:

```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """
    Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): The input list of numbers.

    Returns:
        List[float]: The transformed list of numbers.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input list has less than two elements.

    Example:
        >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
        [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
    """
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must have at least two elements.")

    min_value = min(numbers)
    max_value = max(numbers)

    transformed_numbers = [(x - min_value) / (max_value - min_value) for x in numbers]
    return transformed_numbers
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We start by checking if the input list has at least two elements. If not, we raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message.
2. We use the `min()` and `max()` functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the input list, respectively.
3. We apply the linear transformation to each element in the input list using the formula `(x - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)`, where `x` is the original value. This ensures that the smallest value becomes 0 and the largest value becomes 1.
4. We return the transformed list of numbers.

The `Example` section in the docstring demonstrates the expected behavior of the function, where the input list `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]` is transformed to `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`.
