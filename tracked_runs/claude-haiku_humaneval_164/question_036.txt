Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to write a function `max_element` that takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list.

2. **Approach**: To find the maximum element in a list, we can iterate through the list and keep track of the largest element seen so far. We can start with the first element as the initial maximum and then compare each subsequent element to update the maximum if a larger element is found.

3. **Pseudocode**:
   - Initialize a variable `max_val` to store the maximum element, setting it to the first element of the list.
   - Iterate through the rest of the list, comparing each element with the current `max_val`.
   - If a larger element is found, update `max_val` to the new maximum.
   - After the loop, return the `max_val`.

4. **Edge Cases**: We should consider the following edge cases:
   - What if the list is empty? In this case, we should return `None` or raise an appropriate exception.
   - What if the list contains only one element? In this case, we should return that single element.

Implementation:

Here's the complete function definition with the reasoning and implementation:

```python
def max_element(l: list) -> int:
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    """
    if not l:
        raise ValueError("Input list cannot be empty")

    max_val = l[0]  # Initialize max_val to the first element of the list

    for element in l[1:]:  # Iterate through the rest of the list
        if element > max_val:
            max_val = element  # Update max_val if a larger element is found

    return max_val
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a list `l` as input and returns the maximum element in the list as an integer.
2. We first check if the input list is empty. If so, we raise a `ValueError` because the problem statement specifies that the list cannot be empty.
3. We initialize the `max_val` variable to the first element of the list, as this will be the initial maximum.
4. We then iterate through the rest of the list, starting from the second element (using `l[1:]`). For each element, we compare it with the current `max_val`. If the current element is larger, we update `max_val` to the new maximum.
5. After the loop, we return the final `max_val`, which represents the maximum element in the list.

The provided doctest examples are used to verify the correctness of the `max_element` function.
