Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to write a function called `triangle_area` that takes three arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. The function should return the area of the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. If the three sides do not form a valid triangle, the function should return `-1`.

2. **Defining a Valid Triangle**: According to the problem statement, three sides form a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. This is a well-known property of triangles, often referred to as the Triangle Inequality.

3. **Calculating the Area**: To calculate the area of a triangle, we can use the Heron's formula, which states that the area of a triangle with sides `a`, `b`, and `c` is given by:

   ```
   s = (a + b + c) / 2
   area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
   ```

   where `s` is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.

4. **Handling Invalid Triangles**: If any of the three sides do not satisfy the Triangle Inequality, the function should return `-1` to indicate that the three sides do not form a valid triangle.

5. **Rounding the Result**: The problem statement requires the area to be rounded to 2 decimal points, so we will use the `round()` function to achieve this.

Implementation:

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
import math

def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise return -1
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.
    Example:
    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00
    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1
    '''
    # Check if the three sides form a valid triangle
    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return -1

    # Calculate the semi-perimeter
    s = (a + b + c) / 2

    # Calculate the area using Heron's formula
    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))

    # Round the area to 2 decimal points
    return round(area, 2)
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We import the `math` module to use the `sqrt()` function for calculating the area using Heron's formula.

2. The `triangle_area()` function takes three arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the lengths of the three sides of the triangle.

3. We first check if the three sides form a valid triangle by verifying the Triangle Inequality. If any of the conditions `a + b <= c`, `a + c <= b`, or `b + c <= a` are true, we return `-1` to indicate that the three sides do not form a valid triangle.

4. If the three sides form a valid triangle, we calculate the semi-perimeter `s` using the formula `(a + b + c) / 2`.

5. We then use Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle, which is given by `math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))`.

6. Finally, we round the calculated area to 2 decimal points using the `round()` function and return the result.

This implementation covers all the requirements specified in the problem statement, including handling invalid triangles and rounding the area to 2 decimal points.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to write a function `triangle_area` that takes three arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. The function should return the area of the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. If the three sides do not form a valid triangle, the function should return `-1`.

2. **Identifying the Conditions for a Valid Triangle**: The problem statement mentions that "Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side." This means that for the three sides to form a valid triangle, the following conditions must be met:
   - `a + b > c`
   - `a + c > b`
   - `b + c > a`

3. **Calculating the Area of a Triangle**: The area of a triangle can be calculated using Heron's formula, which is:
   ```
   area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
   where s = (a + b + c) / 2
   ```

4. **Implementing the Solution**: Based on the understanding of the problem and the required calculations, we can implement the `triangle_area` function as follows:

```python
import math

def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise return -1
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.
    Example:
    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00
    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1
    '''
    # Check if the three sides form a valid triangle
    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return -1

    # Calculate the semi-perimeter
    s = (a + b + c) / 2

    # Calculate the area using Heron's formula
    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))

    # Round the area to 2 decimal points
    return round(area, 2)
```

Explanation of the Code:

1. We import the `math` module to use the `sqrt` function for calculating the area using Heron's formula.
2. The `triangle_area` function takes three arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the lengths of the three sides of the triangle.
3. We first check if the three sides form a valid triangle by verifying that the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If this condition is not met, we return `-1`.
4. If the three sides form a valid triangle, we calculate the semi-perimeter `s` using the formula `(a + b + c) / 2`.
5. We then calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula, which involves the semi-perimeter and the three side lengths.
6. Finally, we round the calculated area to 2 decimal points and return the result.

This solution covers the given examples and handles the case where the three sides do not form a valid triangle.
