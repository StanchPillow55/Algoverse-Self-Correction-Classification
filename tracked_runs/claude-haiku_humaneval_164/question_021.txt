Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to find the two closest elements in a list of numbers and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Sort the list of numbers in ascending order.
   b. Iterate through the sorted list, comparing the difference between consecutive elements.
   c. Keep track of the pair of elements with the smallest difference.
   d. Return the pair of elements with the smallest difference.

3. **Edge Cases**: We need to consider the following edge cases:
   a. If the list has less than two elements, we cannot find the closest pair, so we should return an empty tuple.
   b. If there are multiple pairs of elements with the same smallest difference, we should return the pair with the smaller values.

4. **Implementation**:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).
    
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
    (2.0, 2.2)
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
    (2.0, 2.0)
    """
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return ()

    numbers.sort()
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (numbers[0], numbers[1])

    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        diff = abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i-1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i-1], numbers[i])

    return closest_pair
```

Explanation of the implementation:

1. We first check if the input list has less than two elements. If so, we return an empty tuple, as we cannot find a pair of closest elements.
2. We sort the list of numbers in ascending order using the built-in `sort()` method.
3. We initialize `min_diff` to positive infinity and `closest_pair` to the first two elements of the sorted list.
4. We then iterate through the sorted list, starting from the second element. For each pair of consecutive elements, we calculate the absolute difference between them and update `min_diff` and `closest_pair` if a smaller difference is found.
5. Finally, we return the `closest_pair` tuple.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space.
