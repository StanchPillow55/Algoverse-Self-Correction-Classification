Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide the complete function definition.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem is to write a function called `strlen` that takes a string as input and returns the length of the given string.

2. **Approach**: To find the length of a string, we can use a simple iterative approach. We can start with an initial count of 0 and then increment the count for each character in the string.

3. **Edge Cases**: We need to consider the edge cases, such as an empty string. In this case, the length of the string should be 0.

4. **Implementation**: Here's the step-by-step implementation of the `strlen` function:

   a. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the length of the string.
   b. Iterate through each character in the input string.
   c. Increment the `count` variable for each character.
   d. After the loop, return the final value of `count`.

5. **Docstring**: The docstring provided in the problem statement explains the expected behavior of the function. It includes two examples: one for an empty string and one for a string with three characters.

6. **Type Hints**: The problem statement also includes type hints for the function. The input parameter `string` is of type `str`, and the return value is of type `int`.

Complete Function Definition:

```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Return length of given string.

    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> strlen('abc')
    3
    """
    count = 0
    for _ in string:
        count += 1
    return count
```

Explanation:

1. The function `strlen` takes a single parameter `string` of type `str`.
2. We initialize a variable `count` to 0, which will keep track of the length of the string.
3. We then iterate through each character in the `string` using a `for` loop. The loop variable `_` is not used, as we are only interested in the number of iterations, not the specific characters.
4. For each iteration, we increment the `count` variable by 1.
5. After the loop, we return the final value of `count`, which represents the length of the input string.

This implementation satisfies the requirements specified in the problem statement, including the provided docstring examples.
