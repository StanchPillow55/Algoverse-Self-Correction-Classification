Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to write a function that takes two planet names as input and returns a tuple containing all the planets whose orbits are located between the orbits of the two input planets, sorted by their proximity to the Sun.

2. **Identifying the Planets**: The problem statement mentions that there are eight planets in our solar system, and they are listed in order of proximity to the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

3. **Handling Invalid Planet Names**: The function should return an empty tuple if either of the input planet names is not a valid planet name.

4. **Sorting the Planets**: The function should return the planets in the tuple sorted by their proximity to the Sun.

5. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

   a. Create a list of the planet names in the order of their proximity to the Sun.
   b. Check if the input planet names are valid by checking if they exist in the list of planet names.
   c. If both planet names are valid, find the indices of the two planets in the list.
   d. Slice the list of planets between the two indices (inclusive) to get the planets between the two input planets.
   e. Return the resulting tuple.

Implementation:

```python

    The function should return a tuple containing all planets whose orbits are 
    located between the orbit of planet1 and the orbit of planet2, sorted by 
    the proximity to the sun. 
    The function should return an empty tuple if planet1 or planet2
    are not correct planet names. 
    Examples
    bf("Jupiter", "Neptune") ==> ("Saturn", "Uranus")
    bf("Earth", "Mercury") ==> ("Venus")
    bf("Mercury", "Uranus") ==> ("Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn")
    '''
    # List of planet names in order of proximity to the Sun
    planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]

    # Check if the input planet names are valid
    if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:
        return ()

    # Find the indices of the input planets in the list
    index1 = planets.index(planet1)
    index2 = planets.index(planet2)

    # Slice the list of planets between the two indices (inclusive)
    result = planets[min(index1, index2):max(index1, index2) + 1]

    return tuple(result)
```

Explanation:

1. We start by creating a list of planet names in the order of their proximity to the Sun.
2. We then check if the input planet names are valid by checking if they exist in the list of planet names. If either of the planet names is not valid, we return an empty tuple.
3. If both planet names are valid, we find the indices of the two planets in the list.
4. We then slice the list of planets between the two indices (inclusive) to get the planets between the two input planets.
5. Finally, we return the resulting tuple.

This solution has a time complexity of O(1) for the initial checks and list indexing, and O(n) for the slicing operation, where n is the number of planets between the two input planets.

    # Sort the result by proximity to the Sun
    result.sort()
    return tuple(result)
```

Explanation:

1. We start by creating a list `planets` that contains the names of the planets in the order they appear in the solar system.
2. We then check if both `planet1` and `planet2` are valid planet names by checking if they are present in the `planets` list. If either of them is not valid, we return an empty tuple.
3. Next, we find the indices of the input planets in the `planets` list using the `index()` method.
4. We then extract the planets between the two input planets by slicing the `planets` list based on the indices. If `index1` is less than `index2`, we take the slice from `index1 + 1` to `index2`. Otherwise, we take the slice from `index2 + 1` to `index1`.
5. Finally, we sort the resulting list of planets by their proximity to the Sun using the `sort()` method and return the result as a tuple.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of planets between the two input planets. The space complexity is O(n) as we create a new list to store the result.

    return tuple(result)
```

Explanation:

1. We define a list `planets` that contains the names of the planets in the order specified in the problem statement.
2. We check if both `planet1` and `planet2` are valid planet names by checking if they are present in the `planets` list. If either of them is not valid, we return an empty tuple.
3. We find the indices of `planet1` and `planet2` in the `planets` list using the `index()` method.
4. We extract the planets between the two input planets (inclusive) by slicing the `planets` list using the minimum and maximum of the two indices. This ensures that the order of the planets is preserved, regardless of the order in which the input planets are provided.
5. We sort the extracted planets using the `sorted()` function and return the result as a tuple.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of planets between the two input planets. The space complexity is O(n) since we create a new tuple to store the result.
