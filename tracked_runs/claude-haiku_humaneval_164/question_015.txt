Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to write a function `all_prefixes` that takes a string as input and returns a list of all prefixes of the input string, ordered from shortest to longest.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can use a simple iterative approach. We'll start with the first character of the input string, then add the next character, and so on, until we have the complete string. At each step, we'll add the current substring to the result list.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize an empty list to store the prefixes.
   - Iterate through the input string, starting from the first character.
   - At each iteration, take a slice of the string from the beginning up to the current index and add it to the result list.
   - Return the result list.

4. **Implementation**:

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
from typing import List

def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Return a list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string.

    Args:
        string (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        List[str]: A list of all prefixes of the input string, ordered from shortest to longest.

    Examples:
        >>> all_prefixes('abc')
        ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """
    prefixes = []
    for i in range(1, len(string) + 1):
        prefixes.append(string[:i])
    return prefixes
```

Let's break down the implementation:

1. We start by initializing an empty list `prefixes` to store the prefixes.
2. We then use a `for` loop to iterate through the input string, starting from the first character (index 1) and going up to the last character (index `len(string)`).
3. At each iteration, we take a slice of the string from the beginning up to the current index (`string[:i]`) and append it to the `prefixes` list.
4. Finally, we return the `prefixes` list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string, as we need to create a new string slice for each prefix. The space complexity is O(n), as we store all the prefixes in the result list.

This solution should work for the given example and any other valid input string.
