Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a slightly different definition. The sequence is defined as follows:
   - `fibfib(0) == 0`
   - `fibfib(1) == 0`
   - `fibfib(2) == 1`
   - `fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3)`

2. **Approach**: To efficiently compute the n-th element of the FibFib number sequence, we can use a dynamic programming approach. This involves storing the previously computed values and using them to calculate the next value in the sequence.

3. **Implementation**: We can implement the `fibfib` function using a list to store the previously computed values. Here's the step-by-step process:

   a. Initialize a list `fib_fib` to store the FibFib numbers, with the first three values set to 0, 0, and 1, respectively.
   b. Create a loop that iterates from 3 to `n` (inclusive).
   c. For each iteration, calculate the current FibFib number by adding the previous three FibFib numbers and append the result to the `fib_fib` list.
   d. Return the `n`-th element of the `fib_fib` list.

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def fibfib(n: int) -> int:
    """

    fibfib(0) == 0

    fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).
    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence.
    >>> fibfib(1)
    0
    >>> fibfib(5)
    4
    >>> fibfib(8)
    24
    """
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1

    fib_fib = [0, 0, 1]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        current_fib_fib = fib_fib[-1] + fib_fib[-2] + fib_fib[-3]
        fib_fib.append(current_fib_fib)
    return fib_fib[n]
```

Let's go through the function step by step:

1. The function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the index of the FibFib number to be computed.
2. We handle the base cases first:
   - If `n` is 0 or 1, the FibFib number is 0.
   - If `n` is 2, the FibFib number is 1.
3. We initialize a list `fib_fib` with the first three FibFib numbers: 0, 0, and 1.
4. We then use a loop to iterate from 3 to `n` (inclusive).
5. For each iteration, we calculate the current FibFib number by adding the previous three FibFib numbers and append the result to the `fib_fib` list.
6. Finally, we return the `n`-th element of the `fib_fib` list, which represents the `n`-th FibFib number.

This approach ensures that we only compute each FibFib number once and store it in the `fib_fib` list, making the computation efficient for larger values of `n`.
