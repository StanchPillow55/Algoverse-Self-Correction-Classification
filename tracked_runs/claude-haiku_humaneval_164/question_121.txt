Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to return a sorted list of the `k` maximum numbers from the given array `arr`. The array can contain both positive and negative integers, and the value of `k` can be any integer between 0 and the length of the array.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:
   - Sort the input array `arr` in descending order.
   - Return the first `k` elements of the sorted array.

3. **Justification**: Sorting the array in descending order will ensure that the largest `k` elements are at the beginning of the array. This is because the sorting algorithm will place the largest numbers first, followed by the smaller numbers. By taking the first `k` elements, we will get the `k` maximum numbers from the array.

4. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input array `arr`. This is because the dominant operation is sorting the array, which has a time complexity of O(n log n) for most efficient sorting algorithms (e.g., Quicksort, Mergesort).

5. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity of this solution is O(1), as we are not using any additional data structures that grow with the size of the input. The only extra space used is for the output list, which has a size of `k`, which is constant.

Implementation:

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list
    of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.

    Args:
        arr (list): The input array of integers.
        k (int): The number of maximum elements to return.

    Returns:
        list: A sorted list of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.
    """
    # Sort the input array in descending order
    arr.sort(reverse=True)

    # Return the first k elements of the sorted array
    return arr[:k]
```

Here's how the function works:

1. The `sort()` method is called on the input array `arr` with the `reverse=True` argument, which sorts the array in descending order.
2. The first `k` elements of the sorted array are then returned using slicing `arr[:k]`.

This solution satisfies all the requirements mentioned in the problem statement:

1. The length of the array will be in the range of [1, 1000].
2. The elements in the array will be in the range of [-1000, 1000].
3. The value of `k` will be between 0 and the length of the array.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input array `arr`, and the space complexity is O(1).

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to return a sorted list of the `k` maximum numbers from the given array `arr`. The array can contain both positive and negative integers, and the value of `k` can be any integer between 0 and the length of the array.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Sort the array in descending order.
   b. Return the first `k` elements of the sorted array.

3. **Sorting the Array**: We can use the built-in `sorted()` function in Python to sort the array in descending order. The `sorted()` function returns a new sorted list, leaving the original array unchanged.

4. **Returning the First `k` Elements**: Once we have the sorted array, we can simply return the first `k` elements of the list using slicing.

Implementation:

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list 
    of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.

    Example 1:
        Input: arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3
        Output: [-4, -3, 5]

    Example 2:
        Input: arr = [4, -4, 4], k = 2
        Output: [4, 4]

    Example 3:
        Input: arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1
        Output: [2]

    Note:
        1. The length of the array will be in the range of [1, 1000].
        2. The elements in the array will be in the range of [-1000, 1000].
        3. 0 <= k <= len(arr)
    """
    # Sort the array in descending order
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)

    # Return the first k elements of the sorted array
    return sorted_arr[:k]
```

Explanation:

1. The `maximum()` function takes two arguments: `arr` (the input array) and `k` (the number of maximum elements to return).
2. Inside the function, we use the `sorted()` function to sort the input array `arr` in descending order. The `reverse=True` argument ensures that the array is sorted in descending order.
3. After sorting the array, we use slicing to return the first `k` elements of the sorted array, which represent the `k` maximum numbers.
4. The function returns the sorted list of the `k` maximum numbers from the input array.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input array. The space complexity is O(1) since we are not using any additional data structures that grow with the input size.

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to implement a function `maximum(arr, k)` that takes an array `arr` of integers and a positive integer `k`, and returns a sorted list of length `k` with the maximum `k` numbers in `arr`.

2. **Analyzing the Examples**: The examples provided give us a good understanding of the problem:
   - Example 1: `arr = [-3, -4, 5]` and `k = 3`, the output should be `[-4, -3, 5]`.
   - Example 2: `arr = [4, -4, 4]` and `k = 2`, the output should be `[4, 4]`.
   - Example 3: `arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1]` and `k = 1`, the output should be `[2]`.

3. **Identifying the Key Aspects**: The main aspects of the problem are:
   - The function should return the `k` maximum numbers from the input array `arr`.
   - The output should be a sorted list.
   - The length of the output list should be `k`.
   - The input array can have both positive and negative integers, and the range of the elements is from `-1000` to `1000`.
   - The length of the input array can be from `1` to `1000`.
   - The value of `k` can be from `0` to the length of the input array.

4. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Sort the input array `arr` in descending order.
   - Return the first `k` elements of the sorted array.

5. **Implementation**: Here's the Python function that implements the solution:

```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list 
    of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.
    """
    # Sort the input array in descending order
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Return the first k elements of the sorted array
    return arr[:k]
```

Explanation of the implementation:

1. We first sort the input array `arr` in descending order using the `sort()` method with the `reverse=True` argument.
2. After sorting, we return the first `k` elements of the sorted array using slicing `arr[:k]`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input array `arr`. The space complexity is O(1) since we are not using any additional data structures that grow with the input size.

The function handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem statement, including the case where `k` is 0 or greater than the length of the input array.
