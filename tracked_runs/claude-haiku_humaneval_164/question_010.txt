Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to write a function called `rolling_max` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list of integers. The new list should contain the maximum element found in the input list up to the current index.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can use a simple iterative approach. We'll iterate through the input list and keep track of the maximum element seen so far. At each step, we'll append the current maximum to the output list.

3. **Pseudocode**:
   - Initialize an empty list to store the rolling maximum values.
   - Iterate through the input list:
     - If the current element is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum.
     - Append the current maximum to the output list.
   - Return the output list.

4. **Implementation**:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
    in the sequence.
    >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """
    result = []
    current_max = float('-inf')

    for num in numbers:
        current_max = max(current_max, num)
        result.append(current_max)

    return result
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We initialize an empty list called `result` to store the rolling maximum values.
2. We initialize a variable called `current_max` to keep track of the current maximum element. We set it to negative infinity to ensure that the first element of the input list is always the first element of the output list.
3. We iterate through the input list `numbers`:
   - At each step, we update the `current_max` variable to be the maximum of the current `current_max` and the current element `num`.
   - We then append the current `current_max` to the `result` list.
4. Finally, we return the `result` list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, as we need to iterate through the entire list once. The space complexity is also O(n), as we need to store the rolling maximum values in the output list.

This solution is efficient and easy to understand. It uses a simple iterative approach to solve the problem, and the implementation is straightforward.
