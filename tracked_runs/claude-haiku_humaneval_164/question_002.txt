Response:
Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The input to the function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. The goal is to separate these groups into separate strings and return them as a list.

2. **Identifying the Key Requirements**:
   - The groups of parentheses should be balanced, meaning each open parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis.
   - The groups should not be nested within each other.
   - Any spaces in the input string should be ignored.

3. **Approach**:
   - We will use a stack-based approach to keep track of the opening and closing parentheses.
   - We will iterate through the input string and maintain a stack to keep track of the current group of parentheses.
   - Whenever we encounter a closing parenthesis and the stack is empty, it means we have found a complete group of parentheses, and we will add it to the result list.
   - We will also need to handle the case where there are multiple groups of parentheses in the input string.

4. **Algorithm**:
   1. Initialize an empty list to store the separate groups of parentheses.
   2. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of the current group of parentheses.
   3. Iterate through the input string:
      - If the current character is an opening parenthesis, push it onto the stack.
      - If the current character is a closing parenthesis:
        - If the stack is empty, it means we have found a complete group of parentheses, so we add it to the result list.
        - Otherwise, pop the corresponding opening parenthesis from the stack.
      - Ignore any spaces in the input string.
   4. Return the list of separate groups of parentheses.

Implementation:

```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses.
    Your goal is to separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    Ignore any spaces in the input string.
    >>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
    ['()', '(())', '(()())']
    """
    result = []
    stack = []

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append('(' + ')')
            else:
                stack.pop()
        else:
            continue

    return result
```

Explanation of the Implementation:

1. We initialize an empty list `result` to store the separate groups of parentheses.
2. We initialize an empty stack `stack` to keep track of the current group of parentheses.
3. We iterate through the input string `paren_string`:
   - If the current character is an opening parenthesis `(`, we push it onto the stack.
   - If the current character is a closing parenthesis `)`:
     - If the stack is empty, it means we have found a complete group of parentheses, so we add `'(' + ')'` to the `result` list.
     - Otherwise, we pop the corresponding opening parenthesis from the stack.
   - If the current character is a space, we ignore it.
4. Finally, we return the `result` list containing the separate groups of parentheses.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as we iterate through the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), as we use a stack to keep track of the current group of parentheses.

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The input to the function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. The goal is to separate these groups into separate strings and return them as a list.

2. **Identifying the Key Requirements**:

   - The groups are not nested within each other.
   - Spaces in the input string should be ignored.

3. **Approach**:
   - We can use a stack-based approach to keep track of the opening and closing parentheses.
   - Iterate through the input string and push the characters onto the stack.
   - When we encounter a closing parenthesis, we can start building a new group by popping the characters from the stack until we find the corresponding opening parenthesis.
   - Once a group is complete, we can add it to the result list.
   - Repeat this process until we have processed the entire input string.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the input string is empty, we should return an empty list.
   - If the input string contains unbalanced parentheses, we should handle this case gracefully.

5. **Implementation**:

```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    """

    Your goal is to separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.

    Ignore any spaces in the input string.

    >>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
    ['()', '(())', '(()())']
    """
    stack = []
    result = []
    current_group = ""

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == "(":
            stack.append(char)
            current_group += char
        elif char == ")":
            if stack:
                stack.pop()
                current_group += char
                if not stack:
                    result.append(current_group)
                    current_group = ""
        elif char == " ":
            continue

    return result
```

Explanation of the implementation:

1. We initialize an empty list `stack` to keep track of the opening parentheses, an empty list `result` to store the separated groups, and an empty string `current_group` to build the current group.

2. We iterate through each character in the input string `paren_string`.

3. If the current character is an opening parenthesis `(`, we push it onto the `stack` and append it to the `current_group`.

4. If the current character is a closing parenthesis `)`, we check if the `stack` is not empty. If it's not empty, we pop the top element from the `stack` and append it to the `current_group`. If the `stack` becomes empty after this, it means we have completed a group, so we append the `current_group` to the `result` list and reset the `current_group` to an empty string.

5. If the current character is a space ` `, we ignore it and continue to the next character.

6. Finally, we return the `result` list containing the separated groups of parentheses.

The provided example usage demonstrates that the function correctly separates the input string into the expected list of groups.
