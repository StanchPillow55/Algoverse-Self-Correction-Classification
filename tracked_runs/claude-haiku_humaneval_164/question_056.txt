Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem is to write a function `fib(n)` that returns the n-th Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The first few Fibonacci numbers are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, and so on.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. The Fibonacci sequence can be defined recursively as follows:

   - `fib(0) = 0`
   - `fib(1) = 1`
   - `fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)` for `n >= 2`

   This means that the n-th Fibonacci number can be calculated by adding the (n-1)-th and (n-2)-th Fibonacci numbers.

3. **Implementation**: Here's the Python function that implements the Fibonacci sequence using the recursive approach:

```python
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    """Return n-th Fibonacci number.
    >>> fib(10)
    55
    >>> fib(1)
    1
    >>> fib(8)
    21
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

- The function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the position of the Fibonacci number we want to calculate.
- The function uses a conditional statement to handle the base cases:
  - If `n` is 0, the function returns 0, as the 0-th Fibonacci number is 0.
  - If `n` is 1, the function returns 1, as the 1-st Fibonacci number is 1.
- For all other cases (`n >= 2`), the function recursively calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments, and returns the sum of the results.
- The recursive calls continue until the base cases are reached, at which point the function starts returning the results back up the call stack.

This recursive implementation is straightforward and easy to understand, but it can be inefficient for large values of `n` due to the repeated calculations. To improve the efficiency, you can use memoization or dynamic programming techniques.
