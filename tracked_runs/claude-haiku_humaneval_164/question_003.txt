def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem statement asks us to write a function `truncate_number` that takes a positive floating-point number as input and returns the decimal part of the number.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:
   - Separate the integer part and the decimal part of the input number.
   - Return the decimal part of the number.

3. **Implementing the Solution**:

   a. **Separating the Integer and Decimal Parts**:
      - We can use the built-in `int()` function to get the integer part of the number.
      - To get the decimal part, we can subtract the integer part from the original number.

   b. **Returning the Decimal Part**:
      - Since the problem statement specifies that the function should return the decimal part, we can simply return the result of the subtraction.

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    0.5
    """
    integer_part = int(number)
    decimal_part = number - integer_part
    return decimal_part
```

Let's break down the implementation:

1. The function takes a `float` as input and returns a `float` as output.
2. Inside the function, we use the `int()` function to get the integer part of the input number. This gives us the largest integer that is smaller than the input number.
3. We then subtract the integer part from the original number to get the decimal part.
4. Finally, we return the decimal part.

Here are some test cases to verify the correctness of the function:

```python
print(truncate_number(3.5))  # Output: 0.5
print(truncate_number(7.9))  # Output: 0.9
print(truncate_number(2.0))  # Output: 0.0
```

The function correctly handles the given examples and returns the decimal part of the input number.
