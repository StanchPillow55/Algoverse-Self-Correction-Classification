Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to find the largest number that divides a given number `n` evenly, where the divisor is smaller than `n`.

2. **Approach**: To find the largest divisor of `n` that is smaller than `n`, we can use the following approach:
   - Start with the largest possible divisor, which is `n // 2` (since a number cannot be divided by a number greater than half of itself).
   - Iterate through the possible divisors, starting from `n // 2` and decrementing by 1 until we find the first divisor that evenly divides `n`.
   - Return the first divisor found.

3. **Edge Cases**: We need to consider the following edge cases:
   - If `n` is 1, there is no divisor smaller than `n`, so we can return 1.
   - If `n` is even, the largest divisor will be `n // 2`.
   - If `n` is odd, the largest divisor will be `n // 2` (integer division).

4. **Implementation**:

```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number to find the largest divisor for.
    
    Returns:
        int: The largest divisor of n that is smaller than n.
    """
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    
    for i in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
    
    return 1
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We start by checking if `n` is 1. If it is, there is no divisor smaller than `n`, so we return 1.
2. We then use a `for` loop to iterate through the possible divisors, starting from `n // 2` and decrementing by 1 until we reach 1.
3. Inside the loop, we check if the current number `i` evenly divides `n` using the modulo operator `%`. If it does, we have found the largest divisor and we return it.
4. If we have gone through all the possible divisors and haven't found any, we return 1 as the default value.

This implementation covers the edge cases and follows the approach we discussed earlier.

Example usage:

```python
print(largest_divisor(15))  # Output: 5
print(largest_divisor(20))  # Output: 10
print(largest_divisor(7))   # Output: 1
```
