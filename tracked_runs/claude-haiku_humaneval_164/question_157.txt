Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to convert a positive integer (between 1 and 1000) to its equivalent Roman numeral representation as a lowercase string.

2. **Identifying the Roman Numeral System**: The Roman numeral system uses the following symbols to represent different values:
   - I (1), V (5), X (10), L (50), C (100), D (500), M (1000)

3. **Analyzing the Restrictions**: The problem statement specifies that the input number must be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.

4. **Developing the Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Create a dictionary that maps the Roman numeral symbols to their corresponding integer values.
   b. Iterate through the input number, starting from the largest Roman numeral symbol (M) and working our way down to the smallest (I).
   c. For each symbol, we need to determine the number of times it appears in the Roman numeral representation and append the corresponding lowercase symbol to the result string.
   d. Handle special cases where a smaller symbol is placed before a larger symbol (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9) by subtracting the value of the smaller symbol from the current number.

5. **Implementing the Solution**: Based on the reasoning process, we can provide the following implementation:

```python
def int_to_mini_roman(number):
    """
    Given a positive integer, obtain its roman numeral equivalent as a string,
    and return it in lowercase.

    >>> int_to_mini_roman(152) == 'clii'
    >>> int_to_mini_roman(426) == 'cdxxvi'
    """
    roman_symbols = {
        'M': 1000,
        'CM': 900,
        'D': 500,
        'CD': 400,
        'C': 100,
        'XC': 90,
        'L': 50,
        'XL': 40,
        'X': 10,
        'IX': 9,
        'V': 5,
        'IV': 4,
        'I': 1
    }

    result = ''
    for symbol, value in roman_symbols.items():
        count = number // value
        result += symbol * count
        number -= value * count

    return result
```

Explanation:

1. We start by creating a dictionary `roman_symbols` that maps the Roman numeral symbols to their corresponding integer values.

2. We initialize an empty string `result` to store the final Roman numeral representation.

3. We iterate through the `roman_symbols` dictionary, starting from the largest symbol (M) and working our way down to the smallest (I).

4. For each symbol, we calculate the number of times it appears in the Roman numeral representation by dividing the current number by the symbol's value (`number // value`). We then append the symbol to the `result` string the appropriate number of times.

5. After appending the symbol, we subtract the value of the symbol multiplied by the number of times it appears from the current number (`number -= value * count`). This ensures that we move on to the next smaller symbol in the next iteration.

6. Finally, we return the `result` string, which contains the Roman numeral representation of the input number.

This solution has a time complexity of O(1) since the number of iterations is bounded by the size of the `roman_symbols` dictionary, which is a constant. The space complexity is also O(1) since we only use a fixed-size dictionary and a string to store the result.

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to write a function `int_to_mini_roman` that takes a positive integer as input and returns its equivalent Roman numeral representation as a lowercase string. The input integer is restricted to the range of 1 to 1000.

2. **Analyzing the Examples**: The provided examples give us a good understanding of the expected output format. The Roman numerals should be in lowercase, and the function should handle different ranges of numbers correctly.

3. **Identifying the Roman Numeral System**: The Roman numeral system uses seven basic symbols: I (1), V (5), X (10), L (50), C (100), D (500), and M (1000). These symbols are combined in specific patterns to represent different numbers.

4. **Developing the Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Create a dictionary that maps the Roman numeral symbols to their corresponding integer values.
   - Iterate through the input number, starting from the largest Roman numeral symbol, and repeatedly subtract the largest possible value from the number until it becomes zero.
   - Append the corresponding Roman numeral symbol to the result string for each subtraction.
   - Return the final result string.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The problem statement mentions that the input number is restricted to the range of 1 to 1000. We should ensure that the function correctly handles this range and returns the appropriate Roman numeral representation.

    """

    roman_symbols = {

        'L': 50, 'XL': 40, 'X': 10, 'IX': 9, 'V': 5, 'IV': 4, 'I': 1
    }

    # Initialize the result string
    result = ''

    # Iterate through the Roman numeral symbols, starting from the largest
    for symbol, value in roman_symbols.items():
        # Repeatedly subtract the largest possible value from the number
        while number >= value:
            result += symbol
            number -= value

    return result
```

Explanation:

1. We define a dictionary `roman_symbols` that maps the Roman numeral symbols to their corresponding integer values. This will help us determine the largest possible value that can be subtracted from the input number.

2. We initialize an empty string `result` to store the final Roman numeral representation.

3. We iterate through the `roman_symbols` dictionary, starting from the largest symbol (M) and going down to the smallest (I).

4. For each symbol, we repeatedly subtract the corresponding integer value from the input number as long as the number is greater than or equal to the value. We append the symbol to the `result` string for each subtraction.

5. After the loop, the `result` string will contain the complete Roman numeral representation of the input number, and we return it.

This solution has a time complexity of O(1) since the number of iterations is bounded by the size of the `roman_symbols` dictionary, which is a constant. The space complexity is also O(1) since we only use a constant amount of additional space to store the `roman_symbols` dictionary and the `result` string.

   - Append the corresponding Roman numeral symbols to a string, ensuring that the output is in lowercase.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The problem statement mentions that the input is restricted to the range of 1 to 1000. We should ensure that the function correctly handles input values within this range.

            number -= value

    return roman_numeral
```

Explanation of the Implementation:

1. We define a dictionary `roman_symbols` that maps the Roman numeral symbols to their corresponding integer values. This will help us determine the largest possible value that can be subtracted from the input number.

2. We initialize an empty string `roman_numeral` to store the final Roman numeral representation.

3. We iterate through the `roman_symbols` dictionary, starting from the largest symbol (M) and going down to the smallest (I).

4. For each symbol, we repeatedly subtract the corresponding integer value from the input number as long as the number is greater than or equal to the value. We append the symbol to the `roman_numeral` string during this process.

5. Once the input number becomes less than the current symbol's value, we move on to the next symbol and repeat the process until the input number becomes zero.

6. Finally, we return the `roman_numeral` string, which now contains the Roman numeral representation of the input number.

This implementation ensures that the function correctly handles the input range of 1 to 1000 and produces the expected Roman numeral representation in lowercase.
