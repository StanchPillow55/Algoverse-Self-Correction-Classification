Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to take two lists, `operator` and `operand`, and use them to build an algebraic expression. The `operator` list contains basic algebra operations, and the `operand` list contains integers. The length of the `operator` list is one less than the length of the `operand` list. We need to evaluate the expression and return the result.

2. **Identifying the Constraints**: The problem statement provides the following constraints:
   - The `operator` list contains the following basic algebra operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), floor division (`//`), and exponentiation (`**`).
   - The `operand` list contains non-negative integers.
   - The length of the `operator` list is equal to the length of the `operand` list minus one.
   - The `operator` list has at least one operator, and the `operand` list has at least two operands.

3. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Iterate through the `operator` list and the `operand` list simultaneously.
   b. For each iteration, perform the corresponding operation on the two operands.
   c. Store the result of the operation and use it as the first operand for the next iteration.
   d. After the loop, return the final result.

4. **Implementation**: Here's the complete function definition:

    """

    => result = 9

    Note:
        The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.
        Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.
        Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.

    """
    result = operand[0]  # Initialize the result with the first operand
    for i in range(len(operator)):
        op = operator[i]
        a = result
        b = operand[i + 1]
        if op == '+':
            result = a + b
        elif op == '-':
            result = a - b
        elif op == '*':
            result = a * b
        elif op == '//':
            result = a // b
        elif op == '**':
            result = a ** b
    return result
```

Explanation:

1. We initialize the `result` variable with the first operand from the `operand` list.
2. We then iterate through the `operator` list and the `operand` list simultaneously using a `for` loop.
3. In each iteration, we extract the current operator and the next operand.
4. We perform the corresponding operation on the current `result` and the next operand, and update the `result` variable.
5. After the loop, we return the final `result`.

This solution adheres to the problem constraints and correctly evaluates the algebraic expression based on the given `operator` and `operand` lists.

    return result
```

Explanation:

1. We initialize the `result` variable with the first operand from the `operand` list.
2. We then iterate through the `operator` list and the `operand` list simultaneously using a `for` loop.
3. For each iteration, we get the current operator (`op`) and the two operands (`a` and `b`) from the respective lists.
4. We perform the corresponding operation on the `result` and the current operand `a`, updating the `result` variable.
5. After iterating through all the operators and operands, we return the final `result`.

This solution satisfies the given constraints and correctly evaluates the algebraic expression based on the provided `operator` and `operand` lists.
