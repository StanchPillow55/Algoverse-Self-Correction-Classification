    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem statement asks us to write a function called `anti_shuffle` that takes a string `s` as input and returns an "ordered version" of the string. The ordered version of the string is defined as a new string where all the words (separated by spaces) are replaced by a new word where all the characters are arranged in ascending order based on their ASCII values. The order of the words and blank spaces in the original sentence should be preserved.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Split the input string into a list of words.
   b. For each word in the list, sort the characters in the word in ascending order based on their ASCII values.
   c. Join the sorted words back into a new string, preserving the original order of the words and blank spaces.

3. **Implementation**:

```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
    """
    # Split the input string into a list of words
    words = s.split()

    # Sort the characters in each word and join them back
    sorted_words = [''.join(sorted(word)) for word in words]

    # Join the sorted words back into a new string, preserving the original order
    result = ' '.join(sorted_words)

    return result
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. **Splitting the Input String**: We start by splitting the input string `s` into a list of words using the `split()` method. This will give us a list of words, where each word is a separate element in the list.

2. **Sorting the Characters in Each Word**: For each word in the list of words, we sort the characters in the word in ascending order based on their ASCII values using the `sorted()` function. We then join the sorted characters back into a new string using the `join()` method with an empty string `''` as the separator. This gives us a list of sorted words.

3. **Joining the Sorted Words**: Finally, we join the sorted words back into a new string, separating them with a space `' '` using the `join()` method. This preserves the original order of the words and blank spaces in the input string.

4. **Returning the Result**: The final result is the new string with the ordered version of the input string.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n * m * log(m)), where n is the number of words in the input string, and m is the length of the longest word. The space complexity is O(n), as we are creating a new list of words and a new string as the result.

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to write a function called `anti_shuffle` that takes a string as input and returns an "ordered version" of the string. The ordered version of the string is defined as follows:
   - Each word (separated by spaces) in the input string is replaced by a new word where all the characters are arranged in ascending order based on their ASCII values.
   - The order of the words and the blank spaces in the original sentence must be preserved.

2. **Identifying the Key Steps**: To solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:
   - Split the input string into individual words.
   - For each word, rearrange the characters in ascending order.
   - Combine the rearranged words back into a new string, preserving the original order of the words and spaces.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: We should consider the following edge cases:
   - The input string is empty.
   - The input string contains only one word.
   - The input string contains only whitespace characters.

4. **Approach**: Here's the step-by-step approach to solve the problem:
   a. Split the input string into a list of words using the `split()` method.
   b. For each word in the list, convert it to a list of characters, sort the characters in ascending order, and then join them back into a new word.
   c. Join the rearranged words back into a new string, preserving the original order of the words and spaces.

Implementation:

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in

    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
    """
    # Handle edge cases
    if not s:
        return ""
    if len(s.split()) == 1:
        return "".join(sorted(s))

    # Split the input string into words
    words = s.split()

    # Rearrange the characters in each word
    rearranged_words = [
        "".join(sorted(word)) for word in words
    ]

    # Join the rearranged words back into a new string
    result = " ".join(rearranged_words)

    return result
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We first handle the edge cases:
   - If the input string is empty, we return an empty string.
   - If the input string contains only one word, we simply return the string with its characters rearranged in ascending order.

2. We split the input string into a list of words using the `split()` method.

3. We then use a list comprehension to rearrange the characters in each word. For each word, we convert it to a list of characters, sort the characters in ascending order using the `sorted()` function, and then join the sorted characters back into a new word.

4. Finally, we join the rearranged words back into a new string, separating them with spaces using the `join()` method.

This solution preserves the order of the words and the blank spaces in the original sentence, as required by the problem statement.

    # Reassemble the modified words back into a new string

    return result
```

Explanation:

1. We first handle the edge cases where the input string is empty or contains only whitespace characters. In these cases, we return the input string as is.
2. We split the input string into a list of words using the `split()` method.
3. We then iterate through the list of words and rearrange the characters in each word in ascending order using the `sorted()` function. We join the sorted characters back into a new word using the `join()` method.
