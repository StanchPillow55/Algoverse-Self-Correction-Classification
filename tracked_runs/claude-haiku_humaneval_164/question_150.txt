Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to write a function that takes a list of strings as input, deletes the strings with odd lengths, and returns the resulting list in sorted order. The sorting should be done first by the length of the words, and then alphabetically if two words have the same length.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

   a. **Filter the list**: We need to filter the list to remove the strings with odd lengths. We can use a list comprehension for this.
   b. **Sort the list**: Once we have the filtered list, we need to sort it. We can use the built-in `sorted()` function and provide a custom key function to sort first by the length of the words and then alphabetically.
   c. **Return the sorted list**: Finally, we return the sorted list.

3. **Implementation**:

```python
def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    """
    Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,
    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,
    and returns the resulted list with a sorted order.
    The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,
    and it may contain duplicates.
    The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you
    should return the list sorted by that rule.
    If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.
    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.
    You may assume that all words will have the same length.
    For example:
    assert list_sort(["aa", "a", "aaa"]) => ["aa"]
    assert list_sort(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) => ["ab", "cd"]
    """
    # Filter the list to remove strings with odd lengths
    filtered_list = [word for word in lst if len(word) % 2 == 0]

    # Sort the filtered list by length, then alphabetically
    sorted_list = sorted(filtered_list, key=lambda x: (len(x), x))

    return sorted_list
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. **Filtering the list**: We use a list comprehension to create a new list `filtered_list` that contains only the strings with even lengths. The condition `len(word) % 2 == 0` checks if the length of the word is even.

2. **Sorting the list**: We use the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the `filtered_list`. The `key` parameter is used to provide a custom sorting order. In this case, we use a lambda function that takes two keys: the length of the word (`len(x)`) and the word itself (`x`). This ensures that the list is first sorted by the length of the words, and then alphabetically if two words have the same length.

3. **Returning the sorted list**: Finally, we return the `sorted_list`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input list. The space complexity is O(n) as we create a new list to store the filtered and sorted words.

Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The function `sorted_list_sum` takes a list of strings as input and performs the following operations:
   - Deletes the strings that have odd lengths from the list.
   - Sorts the resulting list in ascending order based on the length of each word.
   - If two words have the same length, sorts the list alphabetically.
   - Returns the sorted list of strings.

2. **Identifying the Key Steps**: To solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:
   - Filter the list to remove strings with odd lengths.
   - Sort the resulting list based on the length of each word.
   - If two words have the same length, sort them alphabetically.
   - Return the sorted list.

    # Filter the list to remove strings with odd lengths
    even_length_strings = [s for s in lst if len(s) % 2 == 0]

    # Sort the resulting list based on the length of each word, and if two words have the same length, sort them alphabetically
    sorted_list = sorted(even_length_strings, key=lambda x: (len(x), x))

    return sorted_list
```

Explanation:

1. We start by creating a new list `even_length_strings` that contains only the strings with even lengths. We use a list comprehension to filter the original list `lst` and keep only the strings where the length is even (`len(s) % 2 == 0`).

2. Next, we sort the `even_length_strings` list using the `sorted()` function. We provide a custom key function `lambda x: (len(x), x)` to control the sorting order. This key function first sorts the list based on the length of each word, and if two words have the same length, it sorts them alphabetically.

3. Finally, we return the sorted list `sorted_list`.

This solution ensures that the resulting list is sorted in ascending order based on the length of each word, and if two words have the same length, they are sorted alphabetically.

```

Explanation:

1. The function `sorted_list_sum` takes a list of strings `lst` as input.
2. We create a new list `even_length_words` using a list comprehension. This list comprehension filters out the words with odd lengths and keeps only the words with even lengths.
3. We then sort the `even_length_words` list using the `sort()` method. The sorting is done based on two keys:
   - The length of each word (`len(x)`).
   - The alphabetical order of the word (`x`).
4. Finally, we return the sorted `even_length_words` list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because the sorting operation has a time complexity of O(n log n).
