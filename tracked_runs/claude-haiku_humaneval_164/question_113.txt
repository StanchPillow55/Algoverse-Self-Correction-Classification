Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to write a function `reverse_delete(s, c)` that takes two strings `s` and `c` as input. The task is to delete all the characters in `s` that are equal to any character in `c`, and then check if the resulting string is a palindrome.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Create a new string `result` that will store the characters from `s` that are not present in `c`.
   b. Iterate through each character in `s` and check if it is present in `c`. If not, add it to the `result` string.
   c. Check if the `result` string is a palindrome by comparing the characters from the beginning and the end of the string, moving inwards.
   d. Return a tuple containing the `result` string and a boolean value indicating whether the `result` string is a palindrome or not.

3. **Implementation**:

```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    """
    Task:

    then check if the result string is palindrome.
    A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
    You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check.
    Example:
    For s = "abcde", c = "ae", the result should be ('bcd', False)
    For s = "abcdef", c = "b"  the result should be ('acdef', False)
    For s = "abcdedcba", c = "ab", the result should be ('cdedc', True)
    """
    result = ""
    for char in s:
        if char not in c:
            result += char

    is_palindrome = result == result[::-1]
    return (result, is_palindrome)
```

Explanation:

1. We initialize an empty string `result` to store the characters from `s` that are not present in `c`.
2. We iterate through each character `char` in the string `s` using a `for` loop.
3. For each character `char`, we check if it is not present in the string `c` using the `in` operator. If the character is not present in `c`, we add it to the `result` string.
4. After the loop, we check if the `result` string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse using the slice notation `[::-1]`. We store the result of this comparison in the `is_palindrome` variable.
5. Finally, we return a tuple containing the `result` string and the `is_palindrome` boolean value.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n * m), where n is the length of the string `s` and m is the length of the string `c`. This is because we need to iterate through each character in `s` and check if it is present in `c`, which takes O(m) time for each character in `s`.

The space complexity is O(n), as we are creating a new string `result` to store the characters from `s` that are not present in `c`.

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to write a function `reverse_delete(s, c)` that takes two strings `s` and `c` as input. The function should perform the following steps:
   - Delete all the characters in `s` that are equal to any character in `c`.
   - Check if the resulting string is a palindrome.
   - Return a tuple containing the resulting string and a boolean value indicating whether the string is a palindrome or not.

2. **Analyzing the Examples**:
   - Example 1: `s = "abcde", c = "ae"` => `('bcd', False)`
   - Example 2: `s = "abcdef", c = "b"` => `('acdef', False)`
   - Example 3: `s = "abcdedcba", c = "ab"` => `('cdedc', True)`

3. **Approach**:
   - We will use a set to store the characters in `c` for efficient lookup.
   - Iterate through the characters in `s` and add them to a new string if they are not present in the set of characters from `c`.
   - After building the new string, check if it is a palindrome and return the tuple with the resulting string and the boolean value.

4. **Implementation**:

```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    """
    Deletes all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c,
    then checks if the resulting string is a palindrome.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string.
        c (str): The string of characters to be deleted from s.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the resulting string and a boolean value indicating whether the string is a palindrome or not.
    """
    # Create a set of characters from c for efficient lookup
    char_set = set(c)

    # Build the new string by adding characters from s that are not in char_set
    new_s = ''.join(char for char in s if char not in char_set)

    # Check if the new string is a palindrome
    is_palindrome = new_s == new_s[::-1]

    return (new_s, is_palindrome)
```

Explanation:

1. We create a set `char_set` from the characters in `c` to enable efficient lookup.
2. We iterate through the characters in `s` and add them to a new string `new_s` if they are not present in `char_set`.
3. We check if the `new_s` is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse `new_s[::-1]`.
4. Finally, we return a tuple containing the `new_s` and the boolean value indicating whether it is a palindrome or not.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`, as we iterate through the characters in `s` once. The space complexity is O(m), where m is the length of the string `c`, as we create a set of the characters in `c`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the length of the string `s` and m is the length of the string `c`. This is because we need to iterate through each character in `s` and check if it is present in `c`.
