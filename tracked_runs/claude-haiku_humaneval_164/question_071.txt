Question:

def strange_sort_list(lst):
    '''
    Given list of integers, return list in strange order.
    Strange sorting, is when you start with the minimum value,
    then maximum of the remaining integers, then minimum and so on.

    Examples:
    strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 2, 3]
    strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5, 5, 5, 5]
    strange_sort_list([]) == []

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to implement a function called `strange_sort_list` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list in a "strange" order. The strange order is defined as follows:
   - The first element of the output list should be the minimum value of the input list.
   - The second element should be the maximum value of the remaining elements in the input list.
   - The third element should be the minimum value of the remaining elements, and so on, alternating between the minimum and maximum values.
   - If the input list is empty, the function should return an empty list.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Check if the input list is empty. If so, return an empty list.
   - Create a new list to store the result.
   - Find the minimum value in the input list and add it to the result list.
   - Remove the minimum value from the input list.
   - While the input list is not empty, do the following:
     - Find the maximum value in the input list and add it to the result list.
     - Remove the maximum value from the input list.
     - Find the minimum value in the input list and add it to the result list.
     - Remove the minimum value from the input list.
   - Return the result list.

3. **Implementation**:

```python
def strange_sort_list(lst):
    """
    Given list of integers, return list in strange order.
    Strange sorting, is when you start with the minimum value,
    then maximum of the remaining integers, then minimum and so on.

    Examples:
    strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 2, 3]
    strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5, 5, 5, 5]
    strange_sort_list([]) == []
    """
    if not lst:
        return []

    result = []
    while lst:
        result.append(min(lst))
        lst.remove(min(lst))
        if lst:
            result.append(max(lst))
            lst.remove(max(lst))

    return result
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We first check if the input list `lst` is empty. If it is, we return an empty list.
2. We create an empty list called `result` to store the final output.
3. We enter a loop that continues as long as the input list `lst` is not empty.
4. Inside the loop, we perform the following steps:
   - We find the minimum value in the input list `lst` using the `min()` function and append it to the `result` list.
   - We then remove the minimum value from the input list `lst` using the `remove()` method.
   - If the input list `lst` is still not empty, we find the maximum value in the remaining elements using the `max()` function and append it to the `result` list.
   - We then remove the maximum value from the input list `lst` using the `remove()` method.
5. Finally, we return the `result` list, which now contains the elements in the "strange" order.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list. This is because we are iterating through the list and performing a search for the minimum and maximum values, which takes O(n) time. Additionally, we are removing elements from the list, which also takes O(n) time.

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem statement asks us to implement a function called `strange_sort_list` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list in a "strange order". The strange order is defined as starting with the minimum value, then the maximum of the remaining integers, then the minimum and so on.

2. **Identifying Edge Cases**: The problem statement provides some example inputs and outputs, which help us identify the edge cases:
   - An empty list should return an empty list.
   - A list with all equal elements should return the same list.

3. **Developing the Algorithm**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Check if the input list is empty. If so, return an empty list.
   b. Create a new list to store the result.
   c. Find the minimum value in the input list and add it to the result list.
   d. Find the maximum value in the remaining elements of the input list and add it to the result list.
   e. Repeat steps c and d until the input list is empty.

4. **Implementing the Solution**: Here's the Python function that implements the "strange sort" algorithm:

```python
def strange_sort_list(lst):
    '''
    Given list of integers, return list in strange order.
    Strange sorting, is when you start with the minimum value,
    then maximum of the remaining integers, then minimum and so on.

    Examples:
    strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 2, 3]
    strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5, 5, 5, 5]
    strange_sort_list([]) == []
    '''
    if not lst:
        return []

    result = []
    while lst:
        result.append(min(lst))
        lst.remove(min(lst))
        if lst:
            result.append(max(lst))
            lst.remove(max(lst))
    return result
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We first check if the input list `lst` is empty. If it is, we return an empty list.
2. We create an empty list `result` to store the final sorted list.
3. We enter a loop that continues until the input list `lst` is empty.
4. Inside the loop, we perform the following steps:
   - We find the minimum value in the input list `lst` using the `min()` function and append it to the `result` list.
   - We then remove the minimum value from the input list `lst` using the `remove()` method.
   - If the input list `lst` is not empty, we find the maximum value in the remaining elements using the `max()` function and append it to the `result` list.
   - We then remove the maximum value from the input list `lst` using the `remove()` method.
5. Finally, we return the `result` list, which now contains the "strange sorted" elements.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), as we are iterating through the list and removing elements from it in each iteration. The space complexity is O(n), as we are creating a new list to store the result.

        if lst:
            result.append(max(lst))
            lst.remove(max(lst))

    return result
```

Explanation:

1. We first check if the input list `lst` is empty. If it is, we return an empty list.
2. We create an empty list called `result` to store the final output.
3. We enter a loop that continues as long as the input list `lst` is not empty.
4. Inside the loop, we perform the following steps:
   - We find the minimum value in the input list `lst` using the `min()` function and append it to the `result` list.
   - We then remove the minimum value from the input list `lst` using the `remove()` method.
   - If the input list `lst` is still not empty, we find the maximum value in the remaining elements using the `max()` function and append it to the `result` list.
   - We then remove the maximum value from the input list `lst` using the `remove()` method.
5. After the loop completes, we return the `result` list.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the repeated calls to `min()`, `max()`, and `remove()` within the loop. However, for small to medium-sized lists, this solution should work fine.
