Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem statement asks us to write a function called `flip_case` that takes a string as input and returns a new string where all the lowercase characters are converted to uppercase, and all the uppercase characters are converted to lowercase.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string and check if it is an uppercase or lowercase character. If it is an uppercase character, we can convert it to lowercase, and if it is a lowercase character, we can convert it to uppercase. We can then build a new string with the flipped characters and return it.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: We should consider any potential edge cases, such as an empty string or a string containing non-alphabetic characters (e.g., numbers, punctuation, etc.). In this case, we can simply return the original string as is, as the problem statement does not specify any special handling for these cases.

4. **Implementation**: Here's the complete function definition with the reasoning behind each step:

```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    """
    For a given string, flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase.
    
    Args:
        string (str): The input string to be flipped.
    
    Returns:
        str: The new string with the case flipped.
    
    >>> flip_case('Hello')
    'hELLO'
    """
    
    # Initialize an empty string to store the flipped characters
    flipped_string = ""
    
    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in string:
        # Check if the character is an alphabetic character
        if char.isalpha():
            # If the character is uppercase, convert it to lowercase
            if char.isupper():
                flipped_string += char.lower()
            # If the character is lowercase, convert it to uppercase
            else:
                flipped_string += char.upper()
        # If the character is not an alphabetic character, keep it as is
        else:
            flipped_string += char
    
    # Return the flipped string
    return flipped_string
```

Here's the step-by-step explanation of the implementation:

1. We initialize an empty string called `flipped_string` to store the flipped characters.
2. We iterate through each character in the input string using a `for` loop.
3. For each character, we check if it is an alphabetic character using the `isalpha()` method.
4. If the character is an alphabetic character, we check if it is an uppercase character using the `isupper()` method.
   - If the character is uppercase, we convert it to lowercase using the `lower()` method and append it to the `flipped_string`.
   - If the character is lowercase, we convert it to uppercase using the `upper()` method and append it to the `flipped_string`.
5. If the character is not an alphabetic character, we simply append it to the `flipped_string` as is.
6. Finally, we return the `flipped_string` as the result.

This implementation should handle the given example case and any other cases where the input string contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters, as well as non-alphabetic characters.
