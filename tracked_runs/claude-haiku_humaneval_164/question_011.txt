Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem is to implement a function `make_palindrome(string: str) -> str` that takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the given string.

2. **Approach**: The algorithm idea is simple:
   - Find the longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome.
   - Append to the end of the string the reverse of the string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.

3. **Implementing the Solution**:
   - We can start by checking if the input string is already a palindrome using the provided `is_palindrome` function.
   - If the input string is a palindrome, we can simply return the string as is.
   - If the input string is not a palindrome, we need to find the longest palindromic suffix of the string.
   - To find the longest palindromic suffix, we can use a two-pointer approach, starting from the beginning and the end of the string, and moving inwards until we find the longest palindromic suffix.
   - Once we have the longest palindromic suffix, we can reverse the prefix of the string (the part before the palindromic suffix) and append it to the end of the string to create the shortest palindrome.

Implementation:

```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    >>> make_palindrome('')
    ''
    >>> make_palindrome('cat')
    'catac'
    >>> make_palindrome('cata')
    'catac'
    """
    if is_palindrome(string):
        return string

    n = len(string)
    left, right = 0, n - 1

    while left < right:
        if string[left] == string[right]:
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        else:
            break

    prefix = string[:right]
    suffix = string[right:]
    return suffix + prefix[::-1]
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We first check if the input string is already a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function. If it is, we simply return the input string.
2. If the input string is not a palindrome, we initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the beginning and end of the string, respectively.
3. We then use a while loop to move the `left` and `right` pointers inwards until we find the longest palindromic suffix of the string. We do this by comparing the characters at the `left` and `right` pointers. If they are the same, we move the pointers inwards. If they are different, we break out of the loop.
4. Once we have the longest palindromic suffix, we extract the prefix of the string (the part before the palindromic suffix) and reverse it.
5. Finally, we append the reversed prefix to the end of the palindromic suffix to create the shortest palindrome that begins with the input string.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as we need to iterate through the string once to find the longest palindromic suffix.

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem is to implement a function `make_palindrome(string: str) -> str` that takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the given string.

2. **Analyzing the Examples**: The provided examples give us a good understanding of the expected behavior of the function:
   - If the input string is empty, the function should return an empty string.
   - If the input string is already a palindrome, the function should return the same string.
   - If the input string is not a palindrome, the function should return the shortest palindrome that begins with the given string.

3. **Identifying the Approach**: The algorithm idea mentioned in the problem statement is a good starting point. The steps are:
   - Find the longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome.
   - Append the reverse of the string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix to the end of the original string.

4. **Implementing the Solution**: To implement this solution, we can follow these steps:
   - Define a helper function `is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool` to check if a given string is a palindrome.
   - Implement the `make_palindrome(string: str) -> str` function:
     - Start with the original string.
     - Find the longest palindromic suffix of the string using a loop and the `is_palindrome` function.
     - Append the reverse of the string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix to the end of the original string.

Implementation:

```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """Test if given string is a palindrome."""
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string."""
    if not string:
        return ""

    for i in range(len(string), -1, -1):
        prefix = string[:i]
        suffix = string[i:]
        if is_palindrome(suffix):
            return string + prefix[::-1]

    return string[::-1] + string
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. The `is_palindrome` function is a simple helper function that checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing the string with its reverse.

2. The `make_palindrome` function first checks if the input string is empty, in which case it returns an empty string.

3. The function then iterates over the input string in reverse order, starting from the end and going towards the beginning. For each index `i`, it extracts the prefix (`string[:i]`) and the suffix (`string[i:]`) of the string.

4. The function checks if the suffix is a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function. If it is, the function appends the reverse of the prefix to the end of the original string and returns the result.

5. If no palindromic suffix is found, the function returns the reverse of the original string concatenated with the original string.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string, as we need to check for palindromic suffixes for each prefix of the string.

Response:
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem is to implement a function `make_palindrome(string: str) -> str` that takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string.

2. **Approach**: The algorithm idea provided in the problem statement is a good starting point. The key steps are:
   - Find the longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome.
   - Append the reverse of the string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix to the end of the original string.

3. **Implementing the Solution**:
   - We can use the `is_palindrome` function to check if a given string is a palindrome.
   - To find the longest palindromic postfix, we can start with the entire string and gradually shorten it from the beginning until we find the longest palindromic postfix.
   - Once we have the longest palindromic postfix, we can get the prefix by slicing the original string up to the start of the palindromic postfix, and then reverse it to append it to the end of the original string.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the input string is an empty string, the function should return an empty string.
   - If the input string is already a palindrome, the function should return the original string.

5. **Implementation**:

```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """Test if given string is a palindrome."""
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string."""
    if not string:
        return ""

    # Find the longest palindromic postfix
    for i in range(len(string), -1, -1):
        if is_palindrome(string[i:]):
            prefix = string[:i]
            return string + prefix[::-1]

    # If the entire string is not a palindrome, return the reversed string
    return string[::-1] + string
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. The `is_palindrome` function is provided in the problem statement and checks if a given string is a palindrome.

2. The `make_palindrome` function first checks if the input string is empty. If so, it returns an empty string.

3. The function then iterates through the input string, starting from the end and moving towards the beginning. For each index `i`, it checks if the substring from index `i` to the end of the string is a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function.
   - If a palindromic postfix is found, the function gets the prefix by slicing the original string up to index `i`, reverses it, and appends it to the end of the original string.
   - This gives us the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string.

4. If the entire string is not a palindrome, the function simply returns the reversed string, which is the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string, as we need to check for palindromes at each index. The space complexity is O(n), as we need to store the reversed prefix.
