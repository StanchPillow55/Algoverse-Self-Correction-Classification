Question:
Passage: Nestled in the rolling foothills of the French Pyrenees, market day in the tiny farming community of Bugarach has never been busier. But shoppers aren't there to sample the fresh meat, wine and dairy for which the town is locally famed, they are there to pick up their own piece of end-of-the-world memorabilia. This is because Bugarach - population 176 - has been earmarked by doomsday cults as the only place in the world which is going to survive Armageddon, scheduled for December 21 this year by an ancient Mayan prophecy. Scroll down for video Mayan teaching: According to prophecy/internet rumour, aliens will emerge from their 'spaceship garage' hidden deep within the town's imposing Pic de Bugarach mountain and pluck anyone in the vicinity to safety
