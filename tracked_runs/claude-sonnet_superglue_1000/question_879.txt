Question:
Context: 1964 Pacific hurricane season -- On July 5, the ship California Star recorded winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1,005.8 mb (30 inHg); consequently, the storm was upgraded into Tropical Storm Natalie. After passing through the Tres Marinas Islands just offshore, Natalie attained its peak intensity of 80 mph (130 km/h) (making Natalie a Category 1 hurricane on the present-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale) and a peak pressure of 1,001 mb (29.6 inHg), though the Pacific hurricane database does not show the storm getting any stronger than 50 mph (80 km/h). The next day, July 7, the NFWC reported that Natalie made landfall near Mazatlan with winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) just before dissipating. No known impact was recorded.
