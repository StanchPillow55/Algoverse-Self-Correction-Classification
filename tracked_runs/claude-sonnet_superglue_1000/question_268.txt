Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- One million lives uprooted. One million desperate souls trying to start anew with nothing, far away from home. The number of Syrians who have fled their country since the civil war began almost two years ago reached 1 million Wednesday, the U.N. refugee agency said. An average of almost 1,400 refugees spill across the border daily. The 1 million figure represents about 5% of Syria's total population. That's akin to the entire population of Prague, Czech Republic, walking away. "With a million people in flight, millions more displaced internally, and thousands of people continuing to cross the border every day, Syria is spiraling towards full-scale disaster," U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said.
