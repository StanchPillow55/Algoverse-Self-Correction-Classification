Question:
Passage: Dapper Laughs, the controversial persona supposedly 'killed off' by disgraced comedian Daniel O'Reilly, has been resurrected with the ominous message that his work 'isn't finished' yet. In a YouTube video called 'Merry Christmas', the 'sexist' and 'offensive' character is depicted in 'heaven' before being summoned back to earth by God who said he was 'needed down there'. He then confronts his creator, O'Reilly, who appears to be a simpering mess after his appearance on BBC2 current affairs show Newsnight last month when he declared 'Dapper Laughs is gone'. O'Reilly asks: 'What are you doing here? You're supposed to be dead? I killed you off.'
