Question:
Premise: B: Well, you've got, well, any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs and they're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such, A: Uh-huh. B: And they get out their little Mac tens, they get out their little uzis and they're going to fight with them. And it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm. If they want it they'll get it. I don't care if they've got to go down into New Mexico to get it they'll get it and they'll get across the border. Now my position, although, I have absolutely no use for a fully automatic weapon, anyway. A: Uh-huh. B: Since I am a law-abiding citizen and I have never had a felony, if I wanted to buy one, I don't think there should be that big of a restriction on it.

Hypothesis: there should be that big of a restriction on it

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?
