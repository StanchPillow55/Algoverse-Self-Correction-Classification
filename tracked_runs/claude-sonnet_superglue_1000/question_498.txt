Question:
Passage: Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- The central government may step in to stop a city in Aceh province from prohibiting women from wearing pants and "straddling" motorbikes or bicycles, requiring women to instead ride two-wheel vehicles "sidesaddle." The mayor of the town of Lhokseumawe told the Jakarta Globe this week that the town planned to submit the new rule because "we've seen that people's behaviors and morals are getting far from Aceh's Islamic cultural values." Photos: Women of Indonesia "We want to save women from things that will cause them to violate Shariah law. We wish to honor women with this ban, because they are delicate creatures," the Globe quoted Mayor Suaidi Yahya as saying.
