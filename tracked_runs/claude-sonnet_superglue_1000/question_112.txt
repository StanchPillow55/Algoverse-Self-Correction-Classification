Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- One man's dream voyage is Karl Pilkington's nightmare. For the Science Channel's new reality series "An Idiot Abroad," the British radio producer (who has acquired an international cult following as funnyman Ricky Gervais' favorite target) embarked on an all-expenses-paid, seven-country, several-month vacation -- and hated every second of it. "I kept saying, 'I don't want to do this,' but [Gervais] was making me go," Pilkington said. "I don't like it. You can have your money back -- but the cameraman's been paid, the director's been paid. I couldn't get out of it." The lighthearted travel documentary, originally produced by Gervais and longtime collaborator Steve Merchant for Britain's Sky TV, follows a reluctant Pilkington to the Taj Mahal, the Great Pyramids and every "World Wonder" in between.
