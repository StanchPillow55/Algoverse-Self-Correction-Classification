Question:
Passage: Coronation Street star Beverley Callard has revealed how friends distanced themselves and 'abandoned' her after learning of her battle with depression. The actress, who plays Liz McDonald on the ITV soap, said people battling mental illness should be encouraged to share their fears with those close to them. The 57-year-old, who has fought depression and attempted suicide in the past, told BBC Radio Manchester it was easy for sufferers to feel isolated and alone. 'I had one person say to me, and we'd been friends for a long time, "I don't think we should see each for a while because you're not yourself and you're not good for me",' she said.
