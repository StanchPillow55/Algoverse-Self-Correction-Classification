Question:
Passage: Partygoers are dressing up for Halloween as fighters from the Islamic State in the latest trivialisation of the world's horrors. Social media has been flooded with pictures of people wearing ISIS-style outfits, just weeks after the jihadists beheaded four Western hostages during their reign of terror across Iraq and Syria. Some people are pictured holding fake machetes and severed heads in a twisted reference to the group's brutal executions. The group routinely beheads opponents and its members often post horrific photographs of themselves posing with the bodies. Bad taste: This image of a party-goer dressed in an ISIS-style Halloween costume was one of several posted on the Twitter account of Baghdadi Al-Rolexi with the message: 'Another victory!! So many converted ISIS recruits at Halloween parties. I tell you, best strategy girls and booze!'
