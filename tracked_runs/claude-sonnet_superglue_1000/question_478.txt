Question:
Passage: Earlier this month Formula One's governing body punished Pirelli and Mercedes for holding an unsanctioned tire test  -- at the British Grand Prix it was Pirelli meting out punishment to the elite racing series. British home hope Lewis Hamilton lost the lead when the left-rear tire of his Mercedes began to unravel on the eighth lap at the demanding Silverstone circuit. It was the first of four incidents as Ferrari's Felipe Massa, Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne and McLaren's Sergio Perez also had their races ruined by failures to the exact same tire. Hamilton -- and the 130,000 British fans who streamed into Silverstone to support the 2008 world champion -- were left counting the cost more than most.
