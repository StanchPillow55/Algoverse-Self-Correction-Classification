Question:
Passage: Rwanda has accused the BBC of 'genocide denial' and called for the corporation to be banned from the country after it aired a controversial documentary that questioned official accounts of the horrors of 1994. 'Rwanda's Untold Story', broadcast this month, highlighted growing criticism of President Paul Kagame and alleged that his Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) — then a rebel group, now the ruling political party — was behind the shooting down of a presidential plane that triggered the genocide. The Hutu community has always been held responsible for the mass slaughter of Tutsi population in 1994, when up to a million people were murdered in 100 days - a rate of slaughter that was faster than the Holocaust in the Second World War.
