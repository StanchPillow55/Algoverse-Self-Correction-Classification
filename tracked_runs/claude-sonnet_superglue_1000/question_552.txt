Question:
Passage: By Rob Cooper PUBLISHED: 10:48 EST, 16 July 2013 | UPDATED: 17:36 EST, 16 July 2013 A 16-year-old girl was lured to a hotel on the bogus promise of a cleaning job before being stabbed 58 times and sexually assaulted, a court heard. College student Sasha Marsden's body was then set on fire and dumped in an alleyway after she had been killed, a jury was told. The teenager suffered 'terrible and catastrophic' injuries as she was stabbed 58 times to the head, neck and face with a kitchen knife. She 'struggled ferociously' in a vain attempt to fend off her 'sexually motivated' murderer David Minto, 23, in Blackpool, Lancashire, the court heard.
