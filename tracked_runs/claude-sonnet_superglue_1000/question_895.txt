Question:
Passage: By Vincent Graff PUBLISHED: 14:01 EST, 10 April 2013 | UPDATED: 17:00 EST, 10 April 2013 Gwen Trickett, a  no-nonsense 77-year-old great-grandmother with a Yorkshire accent as thick as porridge, is musing on the shortcomings of society. ‘The young ones now, they’re not like our generation, are they?’ she says. ‘People have too much money. They won’t get things mended. They’d sooner throw ’em away and get a new one.’ Chucking stuff is not Gwen’s style. A real sucker: Vince tests out the 56-year-old Hoover as Gwen looks on I hope she won’t mind me saying, but I’ve not really come to her house — a semi with a neat front garden on the outskirts of Barnsley — to meet her. I’m here to look at one of Gwen’s household appliances: her 56-year-old Hoover.
@highlight
Gwen Trickett, 77, from Barnsley bought her Hoover Junior in 1957
@highlight
Five decades on it is still in full active service

Query: To get some idea of her @placeholder’s longevity, you need to transport yourself back to April 1957.
