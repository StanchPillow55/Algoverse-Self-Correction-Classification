Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama says he won't act on immigration reform until after the November congressional elections. The news angered Latino groups pushing him to make good on past promises to halt or substantially reduce deportations of immigrants living illegally in the country. It also prompted criticism from some Democrats, who have called for Obama to act unilaterally in the face of Republican obstruction of immigration legislation. Even Republicans who oppose Obama's intended reforms found a way to attack the President for not doing something they don't want. Here are five reasons why the unfolding Washington drama is all about politics and the upcoming elections:
@highlight
NEW: The White House says Obama will act on immigration this year
