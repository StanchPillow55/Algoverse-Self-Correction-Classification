Question:
Passage: Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson fired an amazing 10 birdies in succession to claim a third straight win in the 40th Ryder Cup, but it was Europe's only success as the United States fought back on Saturday. After two victories on the opening day, Rose and Stenson were sent out first in the morning fourballs by captain Paul McGinley and responded with a stunning display of golf to beat Bubba Watson and Matt Kuchar 3&2. The home pair were 12 under par for 16 holes and their American opponents nine under in defeat in a record-setting contest as the players revelled in the calmer conditions at Gleneagles.
