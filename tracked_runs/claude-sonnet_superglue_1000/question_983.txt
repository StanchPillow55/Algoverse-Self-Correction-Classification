Question:
Passage: Convicted Singaporean match-fixer Wilson Raj Perumal is categorically denying a story published by German weekly Der Spiegel alleging that the Cameroon team was involved in fixing a World Cup game in Brazil. The Cameroon federation -- known as FECAFOOT -- has pledged to investigate Der Spiegel's allegations, which focused on the national side's second Group A game against Croatia -- purportedly based on an interview with Perumal. "Contrary to the 'revelations' published by the German weekly Der Spiegel that were picked up by news outlets worldwide, I did not predict the result of the Cameroon vs. Croatia match played on June 18, 2014," said Perumal in a statement published online.
