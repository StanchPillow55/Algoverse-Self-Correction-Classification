Question:
Passage: It's been a crazy few months since I last checked in on my Road to Rio. The Commonwealth Games were incredible. I wasn't selected for 3 metre individual despite making all the pre-requisites and retaining a spot in the top two for England. I really fancied my chances at a medal here, especially after a strong performance at the Olympics back in 2012, but for some reason they decided to put in for another event. I was selected for the 1 metre, which isn't what I usually do, but blessed with the opportunity to compete I gave it my best shot.
@highlight
Chris Mears won gold in the 3m synchronised diving at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow
@highlight
He then enjoyed a five-week break where he visited Ibiza, Mexico and Los Angeles to relax and promote his music
@highlight
Mears is now back in training as he looks ahead to the 2016 Olympics

Query: My family, my girlfriend, management the team were there, and it felt great having @placeholder behind me.
