Question:
Passage: George Groves overcame his shattering defeat to Carl Froch by replaying the moment he was knocked out nine times the next morning. Groves, who was floored in the eighth round against Froch in May, is hoping to lay the demons to rest when he fights Frenchman Christopher Rebrasse on September 20. The bout will serve as a final WBC title eliminator but it has added importance for Groves, who is looking for rejuvenation after his loss to Froch in front of 80,000 fans at Wembley Stadium. Groves watched the fight back three times that same night and trainer Paddy Fitzpatrick made his pupil go through it all again the following morning.
