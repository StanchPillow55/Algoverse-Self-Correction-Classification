Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- At an immigration reform event in Riverside, California, about a year-and-a-half ago, a man approached attorney Hadley Bajramovic pleading for help. The man was a Mexican immigrant who had been living in the United States illegally for several years. He was also deaf. He abandoned Mexico to flee what he called persecution. He said he was socially ostracized, targeted by police. The abuse was too much to bear. So now he was in California, and had already been ripped off once as he tried to seek asylum in the United States. "He just stole my heart," Bajramovic said of the immigrant.
