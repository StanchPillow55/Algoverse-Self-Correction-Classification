Question:
Passage: By Lizzie Edmonds Two teenage boys have been jailed for beating a man into a coma because they 'didnâ€™t value his life'. Kane Price, 15, and Ashley Farrow, 17, used a wooden chair leg to beat their victim before leaving him for dead. Homeless Vladimirs Kazlausks, 54, was sleeping in a shopping centre underpass in Newport, South Wales, when the two boys launched their brutal attack - which left him close to death and blind in one eye. The attack mirrored a disturbing scene from cult movie A Clockwork Orange, which was banned for 27 years. Thugs: Kane Price (left) and Ashley Farrow were today sentenced for their part in a savage and premeditated attack on a sleeping homeless man, Vladimir Kazlausks
