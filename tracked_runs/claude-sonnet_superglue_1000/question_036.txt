Question:
Passage: Real Madrid have no interest in signing David de Gea because they already have a better goalkeeper, according to former club president Ramon Calderon. Manchester United's Spanish stopper De Gea has attracted considerable praise for his performances this season, leading many to suggest the 24-year-old could be set for a move back to his home country. But Calderon has dismissed such speculation, insisting that current Real captain Iker Casillas is a better player, and Keylor Navas a more than capable back-up option.
