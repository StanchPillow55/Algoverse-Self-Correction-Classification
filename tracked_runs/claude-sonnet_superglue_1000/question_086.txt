Question:
Passage: By Becky Barrow and Gerri Peev PUBLISHED: 06:47 EST, 23 October 2013 | UPDATED: 17:19 EST, 23 October 2013 Petrol prices are predicted to soar by up to 10p a litre if a huge British oil refinery closes after its petrochemical division was put into liquidation. Production at the refinery in Grangemouth in central Scotland has been suspended for over a week because of a strike threat by militant trade union Unite. In a dramatic move today, owner Ineos closed the petrochemical side of the plant – with the loss of 800 jobs – threatening the refinery’s future and a further 570 jobs.
@highlight
AA says closure reflects concerns in the refining industry

@highlight

Query: @placeholder supplies 13 per cent of the fuel used by the whole of Britain and 85 per cent of fuel in Scotland, where it is the sole refinery.
