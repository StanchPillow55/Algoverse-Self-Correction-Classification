Question:
Passage: Congress is on pace to have its least productive year in modern history, earning a "do-nothing" label and adding another unwanted statistic to a body already facing chronically low approval ratings. Cue the blame game. "To date, the House has passed nearly 150 bills this Congress that the United States Senate has failed to act on," Republican Speaker John Boehner argued Wednesday. "The Senate (and) the President continue to stand in the way of the people's priorities." Democrats are tossing responsibility right back in the GOP's lap, arguing that hardline House conservatives are blocking legislative progress. Meanwhile, America's national legislature is growing increasingly dysfunctional.
