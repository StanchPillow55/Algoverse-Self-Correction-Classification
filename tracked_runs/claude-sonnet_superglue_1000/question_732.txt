Question:
Passage: The wait has ended. It took 21 minutes of this game and 561 in the grander scheme of Premier League football but, finally, Wayne Rooney had a shot on goal. It trickled to Lukasz Fabianski and it was neither effective nor impressive, but the point is that you can’t score if you don’t shoot and it’s not always easy to shoot if you’re hidden in midfield. This was Rooney playing up front for the first time in the Premier League since Southampton away on December 8. Roy Hodgson will have been pleased. Radamel Falcao smiles as he warms up before kick off despite being dropped to the bench against Swansea
