Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Carolina Panthers defensive end Greg Hardy, who was convicted of domestic violence this summer, did not play Sunday in his team's win over the Detroit Lions. The news comes amid increased focus on the National Football League and the way it handles players accused of domestic violence. Until the team's surprising announcement just before game time, Hardy was set to play Sunday. Ray Rice, recently released by the Baltimore Ravens, and Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson won't play either. Peterson was placed on the inactive list late last week after he was indicted by a grand jury in Texas on a child abuse charge. He tweeted a photo on Sunday of a highlighted religious devotion that cautions people against passing judgment.
