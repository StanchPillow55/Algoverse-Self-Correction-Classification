Question:
Passage: By Jan Moir PUBLISHED: 20:17 EST, 31 January 2013 | UPDATED: 20:18 EST, 31 January 2013 After the affair: Actress Antonia de Sancha was pictured outside a cafe 20 years after her affair with Tory minister David Mellor made tabloid headlines There she sits, fag in hand, hair cascading over her shoulders, woolly coat wrapped around her body to keep off the chill. On a winter’s day, Antonia de Sancha is having lunch outside a tapas restaurant in London. She is ready for her next beer, if not her close-up. Yet, come on. Antonia looks pretty darn good for a 51-year-old smoker. She still has that lovely skin and the pale, Modigliani face. She still looks in great shape, which is more than you could ever say about David Mellor. Then or now.

Can it be 20 years since Antonia de Sancha famously romped with goofy David Mellor?

Escort girl Jenny Thompson should learn - the indiscreet mistress is never likely to come out well

Iain Duncan Smith believes higher benefits won’t solve child poverty. Let’s hope his findings won’t be howled down by partisan politics, but I’m not holding my breath. Some are accusing him of waging war on the poor. They can do nothing wrong; he can do nothing right. And in the meantime, we can’t move forward.

MRS Brown’s Boys has been the stealth comedy success of the century. Critics hate it, audiences love it. Over Christmas, it beat Miranda and everything else. It is filthy, foul-mouthed and features a man in a dress saying ‘feck’ an awful lot. It’s like a panto put on by a mad family who live at the end of the street. And it’s hilarious.

Query: In contrast, look at @placeholder, who exudes the sleek, satisfied air of the rich and successful international businessman he is.
