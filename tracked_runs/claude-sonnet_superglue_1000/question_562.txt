Question:
Passage: A police officer who was caught on camera telling a young woman: 'I will knock you clean f***ing out' has kept his job. PC Boulton was filmed threatening Nikki Wright, who is just five feet tall, as he patrolled Hanley town centre in Stoke-on-Trent in the early hours of the morning - but escaped with just a written warning. In the clip, as he approaches a group of revellers, the Staffordshire Police officer shouts at the petite 22-year-old: 'Do that to me again and I will knock you clean f***ing out.' The video then shows him threaten Miss Wright again after her shocked boyfriend Andrew Smith, also 22, asks him to repeat what he said.
