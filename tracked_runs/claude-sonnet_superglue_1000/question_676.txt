Question:
Passage: Last week, President Obama came to my country, Tanzania. President Kikwete and our people received him with great pride, but it is unlikely Obama heard anything about our government's plan to give a great chunk of land that has been the Maasai tribe's home for millennia, to a hunting company from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The hunters want this land to kill our lions and leopards and this deal will take away 40% of our grasslands and forested mountains that we call home. It threatens the wildlife and the Maasai's very existence. We want Obama and the international community to know our story and help stop our eviction.
@highlight
Tanzanian government threatening to evict Maasai from traditional land
@highlight
Maasai tribes in Loliondo campaigning to stay on land
@highlight
The campaign has been supported by more than 1.7 million people worldwide

Query: The government uses our faces on tourism posters and brochures for Tanzania, yet President @placeholder has said that our way of life is a thing of the past and we should live in the modern world.
