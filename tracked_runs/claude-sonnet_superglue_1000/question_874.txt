Question:
Passage: It isn't easy being the backup QB to Peyton Manning - just ask Brock Osweiler. Hilarious footage of the 23-year-old being shut out of playing by the 38-year-old NFL legend was broadcast to a sympathetic nation on Sunday. With the Broncos holding a 31-point lead over the Raiders, Osweiler excitedly grabbed his helmet in expectation of a rare start. Scroll Down for Video What?!! Osweiler turns to see Manning running out to marshal his troops - like he does every Sunday Oh man.........The realization that Manning will never yield to him, despite throwing the Broncos to a 31 point victory dawns on Osweiler
