Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The two surviving members of The Doors have put aside old tensions and are planning to reunite for a tribute concert in honor of the band's late keyboardist, Ray Manzarek. Guitarist Robby Krieger says he and drummer John Densmore have been in contact since Manzarek's sudden death last month, following a battle with bile duct cancer. The Doors' Ray Manzarek dies at 74 "We're talking about it," Krieger tells CNN, confirming tribute plans. "Not sure when or where it will be, but we'll definitely do it." The Doors were formed in 1965, after keyboardist Manzarek met a UCLA film student and poet named Jim Morrison on Southern California's Venice Beach. The pair then joined forces with Krieger and Densmore, and The Doors went on to become one of the most controversial and successful rock acts of the '60s. The band sold more than 100 million albums worldwide, and gained fame for hits like "L.A. Woman," "Hello, I Love You" and "Light My Fire."
