Question:
Passage: (CNN)The door is open, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said to Jews worldwide. "Extremist Islamic terrorism has struck Europe again, this time in Denmark," he said Sunday. "We are preparing and calling for the absorption of mass immigration from Europe. To the Jews of Europe and to the Jews of the world I say that Israel is waiting for you with open arms." Netanyahu extended the invitation after violent acts of anti-Semitism, most recently the killing of two people in Copenhagen, one at a free-speech forum and the second outside a synagogue. The Israeli Prime Minister did the same thing in January after terrorists killed 19 people over three days in Paris, including during an attack on a Kosher grocery. Another reminder of anti-Semitism came Monday when it was announced five teens were charged with vandalizing a Jewish cemetery in France.
