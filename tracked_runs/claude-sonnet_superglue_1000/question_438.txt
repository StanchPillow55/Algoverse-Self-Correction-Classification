Question:
Passage: By David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor, In Nashua, N.h. Joe Scarborough, the center-right MSNBC personality who served in Congress from 1995 to 2001, is leaving the door open for a 2016 presidential run, but Republicans in the critical primary state of New Hampshire don't seem to care. Wearing a Democrat-friendly blue tie, the 'Morning Joe' host told the Northeast Republican Leadership Conference that he would leave the door open for a return to politics, especially because 'we don't need to elect another Clinton for eight years.' Scarborough entered a Nashua, N.H. hotel to cheers. But after he moderated a panel discussion with four 2012 campaign operatives, GOP activists seemed not to take him seriously.
