Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- There is a new speaker in town. Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, will be the new Speaker of the House, replacing Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-California, as the GOP rolled in Tuesday's midterm elections, gaining a majority for the first time in four years. The Republican Party will pick up more than 60 seats in the legislature, a statistical analysis of exit polls by CNN projects. That's a comfortable margin over the 39 seats needed to wrest control from the Democrats. Unrest over the economy and government spending, as well as the surge of Tea Party politics, helped propel the GOP. Tuesday's outcome was comparable to the 1994 so-called "Republican Revolution," when the GOP took 54 seats from the Democrats.
