Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- When Nucky Thompson shot Jimmy Darmody point blank in the head in last season's finale of "Boardwalk Empire," viewers were shocked: How could a father figure kill his surrogate son? But this is the land of gangsters and bootleggers, and blood isn't the currency here -- it's alcohol. That episode, "To The Lost," nabbed an Emmy nomination for director Tim Van Patten (amongst its many other nods, including best drama and best actor for Steve Buscemi), but it also signified a tonal shift in how the characters on this Prohibition-era drama would operate in the next season, which kicks off Sunday, September 16 on HBO: no more Mr. Nice Guy.
