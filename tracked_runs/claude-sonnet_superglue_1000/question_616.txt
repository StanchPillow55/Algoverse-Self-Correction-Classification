Question:
Passage: By Ruth Styles With less than a week to go until Prince George's first birthday, bookmakers have suspended betting on a royal pregnancy announcement this month after a flurry of bets were placed overnight. The bets, which were placed with bookmakers Coral, were made online and in quick succession - enough, said a spokesman for the betting firm, to set alarm bells ringing. Prior to the unusual activity, Coral had been offering odds of 10/1 on the Duchess of Cambridge announcing a second pregnancy in July but slashed the odds to even money before pulling the plug entirely.
