Question:
Passage: Mountain View, California (CNN) -- Software developer Intuit isn't concerned about which of the two most popular applications for personal finance people choose. It owns both of them. Many families use either Quicken or Mint.com year-round to track budgets and review billing statements. Intuit, which also makes TurboTax, maintains the two personal-finance tools in tandem, and recent updates to each, such as the free Mint iPad app that launched on Wednesday or the major new version of Quicken that hit stores last month, are indicative of how different their audiences think about their money. Quicken 2012 has a revamped look and a new debt-reduction-planning feature. Quicken comes in many flavors and can cost anywhere from $30 to $150, with one advertisement for a Quicken credit card shown infrequently. It's only available for Windows, and it stores data on the user's computer, which is important for the security-minded but prevents people from accessing their accounts from multiple devices.
@highlight
Intuit makes some of the most popular financial management programs
@highlight
Mint.com and Quicken, in many ways, compete with each other
@highlight
Intuit is not concerned about pitting two apps against each other if it owns both

Query: One might assume that @placeholder users are obsessively tabulating each transaction they make rather than letting computers do the thinking, either due to a mistrust of their banks or a mistrust in storing their sensitive info in the cloud.
