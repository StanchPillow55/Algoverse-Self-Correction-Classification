Question:
Passage: Bujumbura, Burundi (CNN) -- They're lonely and hungry, condemned to a life of daily hardship with little to hope for. Deprived of food, wearing old clothes, countless homeless children are living on the dusty streets of Bujumbura, the lakeside capital of Burundi, victims of a bloody civil war that wreaked havoc on the tiny east central African country. Scared and neglected, the children's lives are fraught with great danger; some of them suffer from abuse while others resort to a life of crime to survive, earning the name "kirobezo," which means bad child. But not everyone sees them like that. One woman is responding to these young children not with anger but with love -- and a whole lot of food.

@highlight

@highlight
Ntahe was named the 2013 "Woman of Courage" award by the U.S. embassy in Burundi

Query: "I say that the young people are the @placeholder for tomorrow, but tomorrow is impossible if we don't live well today," she says.
