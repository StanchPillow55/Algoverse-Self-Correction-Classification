Question:
Passage: (CNN)It's the albatross which has hung around the neck of world football for the past five years -- so what next for Qatar and the 2022 World Cup? The question about when the tournament will be held was revealed in Doha Tuesday with a November/December timetable proposed. Having been cleared of any wrongdoing by Michael Garcia's investigation into alleged corruption into the bidding process surrounding the 2022 tournament, Qatar and world governing body FIFA must now negotiate the minefield of placating a host of parties by playing a World Cup outside of the traditional June/July schedule. When Qatar won the bid in 2010, its opponents thought they were all bidding for the same tournament -- but it turns out that's not quite true.
@highlight
The 2022 World Cup is set to be held in November/December in Qatar
@highlight
Tournament moved away from traditional June/July dates because of intense heat in Gulf state
@highlight
Europe's biggest clubs oppose plan saying it will disrupt season
@highlight
FIFA Executive Committee set to ratify proposal

Query: There are still seven years to go until the World Cup in @placeholder so domestic leagues will have time to make plans to avoid as much disruption to their season as possible, but a switch to November and December is likely to provide a major headache for top-flight leagues and clubs.
