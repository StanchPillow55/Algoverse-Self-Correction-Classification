Question:
Context: Bok choy -- Bok choy, pak choi or pok choi (Chinese: 上海青; pinyin: Shànghǎi qīng; literally: ``Shanghai Green''; Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis) is a type of Chinese cabbage. Chinensis varieties do not form heads and have smooth, dark green leaf blades instead, forming a cluster reminiscent of mustard greens or celery. Chinensis varieties are popular in southern China and Southeast Asia. Being winter-hardy, they are increasingly grown in Northern Europe. This group was originally classified as its own species under the name Brassica chinensis by Linnaeus.
