Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Add Martina McBride and 38 Special to the list of musical acts canceling SeaWorld shows because of issues raised in the documentary "Blackfish." "I've decided that given all the issues that have been aired recently, the time isn't right for me to play at Seaworld," the singer posted on her Facebook page over the weekend. "I have canceled my scheduled performance at the Bands, Blues & BBQ event in March 2014." The announcement makes her at least the seventh to drop out. The southern rock band 38 Special quickly followed with this Facebook posting: "Due to concerns raised by the CNN documentary 'Blackfish,' 38 Special will be canceling its scheduled March 9th concert at Seaworld. We appreciate the outpouring of support and especially apologize to our Orlando fans. We will try and schedule another performance in your area in the near future."
