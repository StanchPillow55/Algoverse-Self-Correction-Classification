Question:
Passage: By Steve Nolan PUBLISHED: 13:21 EST, 13 June 2013 | UPDATED: 03:32 EST, 14 June 2013 Documentary-makers in Germany have claimed that legalising prostitution has turned the country's capital Berlin into 'Europe's biggest brothel.' Sex trade laws were radically liberalised by the German government in 2002 but a documentary called Sex - Made In Germany estimates that one million men pay for sex every day. The film was based on two years of research captured using hidden cameras and explores Berlin's world of 'flat-rate' brothels where customers pay €49 (£42) for as much sex as they want. Sex for sale: Around a million men are paying for sex every day in Germany according to a new television documentary. Hamburg's Reeperbahn red light district is pictured.
