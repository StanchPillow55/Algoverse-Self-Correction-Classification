Question:
Passage: ISIS militants killed more than 300 members of a Sunni tribe in a recent series of executions, the Iraqi government said Monday. Some of the 322 people executed were women and children, Iraq's Ministry of Human Rights said. The dead belonged to the Albu Nimr tribe, known for its fighting skill. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said Washington hasn't been able to confirm those figures, but "we have no reason to doubt their authenticity." The latest incident came Saturday when 75 members of Albu Nimr were taken from their homes and killed in the desert near the town of Hit, said one of the tribe's leaders, Sheikh Nabil Al-Ga'oud.
