Question:
Passage: Los Angeles (CNN) -- A high-frequency radar in California detected the March 11 tsunami that devastated Japan, raising hopes for the development of a new early warning system, a University of California at Davis oceanographer said. It was the first time a tsunami has been observed on radar, said Professor John Largier, an oceanographer at the University of California at Davis and an author of a new paper describing the work. "We have the hardware set up. We have the system operational. It's a software challenge that we show we can achieve" for the West Coast, Largier told CNN Tuesday. His paper appears this month in the journal Remote Sensing.
@highlight
A tsunami has been observed for the first time on radar, an oceanographer says
@highlight
That was the March 11 tsunami that devastated Japan
@highlight
The West Coast already has a high-frequency radar system for the ocean
@highlight
Southeast Asia, parts of the U.S. East Coast would have to build radar systems from scratch

Query: Such a detection system could provide a 15-minute warning for a tsunami approaching northern California and an early warning of an hour for southern @placeholder, where the shallow continental shelf along the coast is bigger, Largier said.
