Question:
Passage: Editor's note: Andrey Kurkov is a Ukrainian novelist born in St. Petersburg in 1961. Having graduated from the Kiev Foreign Languages Institute, he worked as a journalist, did his military service as a prison warden in Odessa, then became a cameraman, writer of screenplays and author. His books are published in English by Harvill Secker in the UK and Meville House in the U.S. The views expressed in this commentary are solely his. For two nights between the 4th and 6th of March, I barely slept. I was checking the Internet every hour to see if Russia had started war with Ukraine.
@highlight
Talk of war with Russia is on everyone's mind in Ukraine, says novelist Andrey Kurkov

Crimea may become a burden on Russia and isolated from the rest of the world
@highlight
Perhaps its best future lies in becoming a Soviet-era theme park, he jokes
@highlight
Fears that Russia will destabilize southern and eastern Ukraine before elections on May 25

Query: It became clear that since independence in 1991 neither @placeholder presidents nor the government had taken care of the military.
