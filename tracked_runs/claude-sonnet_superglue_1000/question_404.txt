Question:
Passage: By Daily Mail Reporter and Associated  Press Reporter Hazed: Brett Griffin, 18, a student at University of Delaware, was pledging to a fraternity in 2008 when he died from alcohol poisoning A jury on Friday cleared two former members of a University of Delaware fraternity of wrongdoing in the 2008 death of an 18-year-old student who died from alcohol poisoning during a pledge ritual. Ruling in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the parents of Brett Griffin, jurors said former chapter president of Sigma Alpha Mu, Jason Aaron, and former pledge master, Matthew Siracusa, were not responsible. The fraternity and other members previously reached settlements in the case, but attorneys for Aaron, 25, and Siracusa, 26, argued that they were not liable because they did not participate in any hazing of Griffin, and that no one had forced him to drink.
