Question:
Passage: Oxford, Mississippi (CNN) -- From a dust mask that tested positive for ricin, to an enigmatic dump of a coffee grinder, to talk of making and mailing "poison," an affidavit unsealed Tuesday shed light on the case against a Mississippi man accused of sending potentially deadly letters to President Barack Obama and others. Just more than a week ago, James Everett Dutschke described the man then jailed in the case -- an Elvis, Buddy Holly and Randy Travis impersonator named Paul Kevin Curtis -- as a "little nutty." Now Curtis is free, and the 41-year-old Dutschke is behind bars. The document unsealed Tuesday explains what led authorities to arrest Dutschke -- but not why he allegedly concocted the poison and sent it to elected officials.
