Question:
Passage: Southampton managed to avoid their worst run in 57 years with a resounding victory against Everton. An own goal from Romelu Lukaku in the first half set Saints on their way and strikes from Graziano Pelle and Maya Yoshida then secured victory and halted their dramatic slide. Had they been beaten by the Merseyside club then they would have crashed to their sixth consecutive defeat, matching an unwanted run set in 1957. It was certainly a motivating factor for Ronald Koeman’s men.
