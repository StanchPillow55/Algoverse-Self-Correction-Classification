Question:
Passage: Tower Hamlets's Muslim mayor Lutfur Rahman sparked a storm of protest tonight after raising the Palestinian flag over the town hall ‘in solidarity with Gaza’. Barely 24 hours after it emerged Mr Rahman is to face trial over claims he committed widespread voting fraud, he ordered the flag to fly ‘in support of a ceasefire and peace’. Jewish leaders condemned the move as 'destructive' for community relations as local residents said the council should concentrate on 'potholes and bins' and not international conflicts. Scroll down for video Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman tweeted this photo of the Palestinian flag flying outside the town hall
