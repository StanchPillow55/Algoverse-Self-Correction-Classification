Question:
Context: Air gun laws -- Air pistols generating more than 6 ft lbf (8.1 J) and air rifles generating more than 12 ft lbf (16.2 J) of muzzle energy are legally termed ``specifically dangerous firearms''. As a result, ownership of these air rifles requires the possession of a Firearm Certificate (FAC); however, ownership of such air pistols is prohibited as they are defined as ``Prohibited Weapons'' under Section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968. (Section 5 Authority is usually only granted to members of the Gun Trade.)
