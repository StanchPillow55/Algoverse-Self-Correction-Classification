Question:
Passage: A midfield showdown with Sonny Bill Williams and Conrad Smith is international rugby’s equivalent of tackling the Da Vinci Code, but Wales centre Jonathan Davies believes he is ready to take on the All Blacks duo after a month on the side-lines. Having not played since October because of a lat-muscle injury, Davies was drafted straight back into the starting XV at Tuesday’s team announcement in the Vale of Glamorgan. The 26-year-old missed out on the previous Tests against Australia and Fiji but will start at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday, when Wales will attempt to end their 25-match losing streak against the southern hemisphere giants.
