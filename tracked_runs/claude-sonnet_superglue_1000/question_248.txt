Question:
Passage: New York (CNN) -- Donald Trump is seeking $400,000 in damages from a Brooklyn man over four websites that use the real estate mogul's name and brand. Attorneys representing Trump filed a countersuit against J. Taikwok Yung, 33, at the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn on Thursday, seeking damages for "federal cybersquatting." That's defined by the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act as "the registration as domain names of well-known trademarks by nontrademark holders who then try to sell the names back to the trademark owners." Trump "has spent his career establishing his famous name and brand and is not going to sit by idly and allow a pathetic squatter like Mr. Yung to infringe on his well-established rights." Alexis Robinson, intellectual property counsel for the Trump Organization, wrote in an e-mail to CNN.
