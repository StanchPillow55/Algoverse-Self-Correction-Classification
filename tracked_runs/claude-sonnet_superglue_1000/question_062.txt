Passage: (CNN) -- A Venezuelan journalist who has been held for two years without a trial reported that he has gone on a hunger strike, saying he wants the judge in his case to recuse himself. Leocenis Garcia made the announcement June 30 on Twitter. "I am starting an indefinite hunger strike until the Judge Jesus Jimenez of Court 20 stops working on my case," Garcia said. It was not immediately known why Garcia wants the judge removed. The journalist was arrested in May 2008 and charged with five offenses, including illegal possession of a firearm, resistance to authority and property damage.
