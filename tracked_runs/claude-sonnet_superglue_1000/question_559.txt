Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- "My hands are tied." Those are words that Howard Dean Bailey never wants to hear again. The last time he heard them: an immigration judge was ordering him out of the country. In June 2012, just days shy of his 41st birthday, the Navy veteran was deported to Jamaica, a country he hadn't lived in since he was 17. "It's kind of stressful," Bailey said in a phone interview, but then corrected himself. "Not kind of -- very stressful." Bailey is one of more than 23,000 permanent legal residents who were deported in 2012. The number of veterans is unknown because the Department of Homeland Security says it doesn't keep those records and neither do other government agencies.
