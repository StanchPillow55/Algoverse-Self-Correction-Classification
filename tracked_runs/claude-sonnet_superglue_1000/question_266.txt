Question:
Passage: Boston (CNN) -- With words as ammunition, a defense lawyer fired a machine gun burst of questions at the government's star witness Tuesday in the federal murder trial of reputed Boston mob boss James "Whitey" Bulger. "You killed friends?" Bulger attorney Hank Brennan shot. "Yes," replied prosecution witness John Martorano. "Families?" "Yes." "Strangers?" "Yes." "Innocent people?" "Yes," said Martorano, who has admitted to 20 murders and who earlier served 12 years in prison on a government deal for his cooperation in the case against Bulger. Martorano acknowledged he didn't like the term "hitman" since he "wouldn't accept money" for the killings he committed. And he countered the prosecution's descriptions of him as a "mass murderer" and a "serial killer."
