Question:
Passage: Los Angeles (CNN) -- A lost interview of Martin Luther King Jr. recorded more than five decades ago, but recently found in a Tennessee attic, will soon be heard in the last room where the civil rights leader slept. Illusionist David Copperfield purchased the reel-to-reel tape Wednesday and will donate it to the National Civil Rights Museum, which is housed in the Lorraine Motel. King was shot to death standing on a balcony of the Memphis, Tennessee, motel on April 4, 1968. "It gave me chills," Copperfield told CNN Wednesday in a phone interview, explaining why he bought the tape for an undisclosed amount.
