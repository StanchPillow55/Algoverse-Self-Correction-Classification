Question:
Passage: Arsenal legend Gilberto Silva could be the latest member of the Invincibles to head back to the Emirates Stadium to take up a coaching role. Arsene Wenger hinted last month that the club's record goalscorer Thierry Henry would be welcome back as a coach, and now it seems Gilberto has had a similar offer. In an interview with Brazilian news outlet Globo Esporte, Gilberto confirmed that he has had an invitation from the club to return, and that he would one day like to go into management.
