Question:
Passage: It has been a longstanding mystery for scientists - how water arrived on Earth. Now, researchers say they may have an answer - it was here all along. A new theory claims that giant underwater 'oceans' of water is stored in porous rock. Researchers at Ohio State University believe the same amount of water that currently fills the Pacific Ocean could be buried deep inside the planet right now - and that underground 'oceans' or rock were created at the same time the earth was. Central to the study is the idea that rocks that appear dry to the human eye can actually contain waterâ€”in the form of hydrogen atoms trapped inside natural voids and crystal defects.

Researchers say discover could have a 'profound' effect on our understanding on Earth

Query: 'That particular zone in the @placeholder, the transition zone, might have as much water as all the world's oceans put together.'
