Question:
Passage: Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- President Barack Obama arrived in South Korea on Sunday for a three-day trip centered on an international nuclear security summit in Seoul. He flew into Seoul, where he is expected to hold a bilateral meeting with his South Korean counterpart Lee Myung-bak. Top officials from 54 countries, including China and Russia, will attend the summit meeting on Monday and Tuesday. But its message of international cooperation has been overshadowed by North Korea's announcement last week that it is planning to carry out a rocket-powered satellite launch in April. South Korea has said it considers the satellite launch an attempt to develop a nuclear-armed missile, while the United States has warned the move would jeopardize a food-aid agreement reached with Pyongyang in early March.
