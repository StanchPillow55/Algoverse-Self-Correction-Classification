Question:
Passage: As millions of Taiwanese headed for the polling stations across the nation last weekend, there was a general sense that change was at hand. As the results of the vote started trickling in during the evening, it soon became clear that the political scene in Taiwan was about to become a much different place. It was a rout. When it was all over and done, the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) had merely won six of the 22 constituencies in the mayoral and commissioner elections, while the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won 13, and did so with sizable leads. Moreover, the KMT had lost control of Taipei, the capital city it had run for 16 consecutive years, to an independent with no political experience, and also saw safe cities in the northern half of the island, such as Hsinchu and Taoyuan, slip through its fingers.
@highlight
Taiwan's ruling party routed in local elections in "black Saturday."
@highlight
They lost control of Taipei for first time in 16 years
@highlight
Lazy campaigns and the "China factor" caused their defeat, says Cole
@highlight
"Sunflower generation" wary of closer ties with China

Query: In many constituencies, including @placeholder, the KMT ran lazy campaigns and spent more time attacking its opponents than trying to convince voters of the virtues of its own candidates.
