Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- More than one and a half years have passed since a boyish-looking 22-year-old Army private was arrested, suspected to be behind the biggest intelligence leak in U.S. history. Much has been written about him. Politicians, pundits, celebrities and protesters have had something to say. But the single voice that could tell the real story has never been heard. Bradley Manning, are you finally going to speak? Will you say anything when a military arraignment begins on Friday at an Army base in Maryland, the first step in the government's case that intends to figure out how hundreds of thousands of its classified Afghan, Iraq and diplomatic documents came to be published on WikiLeaks.org?
@highlight
Bradley Manning is believed to have leaked classified intelligence
@highlight
The 23-year-old soldier from Oklahoma faces 22 charges of violating military law
@highlight
The most serious charge is aiding the enemy, which would likely result in a life sentence

Query: Others who support Manning's actions contend that, at worst, war crimes and an effort by the @placeholder and its allies to cover up atrocities were revealed by the leaks.
