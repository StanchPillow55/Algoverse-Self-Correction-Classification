Passage: By Mail Foreign Service Last updated at 12:58 AM on 6th February 2012 Venezuela's left-wing president has raised the stakes over the Falkland Islands by pledging his armed forces would fight alongside Argentina in any conflict with Britain. The inflammatory promise from Hugo Chavez came in the run-up to the 30th anniversary of the April 1982 invasion of the islands by Argentina. At the same time, Foreign Secretary William Hague insisted the deployment of a British warship and Prince William to the Falklands was ‘entirely routine’. Fighting talk: Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez (left) said he would back Argentina while William Hague (right) said the deployment was 'entirely routine'
