Question:
Passage: By Paul Newman and Lawrence Booth PUBLISHED: 02:06 EST, 12 June 2013 | UPDATED: 16:56 EST, 12 June 2013 The gloves came off ahead of the Ashes when it emerged Australia's volatile batsman David Warner had thrown a punch at England's Joe Root in an ugly late-night incident in a bar. Australia, already without injured captain Michael Clarke after being thrashed by England in the Champions Trophy on Saturday, were in disarray yesterday as they considered whether to send serial offender Warner home. The Australian opening batsman was facing a disciplinary hearing last night and could be sent home even before the Ashes begin next month.
