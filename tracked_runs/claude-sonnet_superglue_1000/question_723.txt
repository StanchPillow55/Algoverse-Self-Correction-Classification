Question:
Passage: England and Leicester received mixed news on Tuesday as Tom Croft insisted it is ‘business as usual’ following a shoulder scare — only for club captain Ed Slater to be ruled out for the season. Croft pulled out of Saturday’s Aviva Premiership opener against Newcastle after experiencing pain as a result of a stinger he suffered in pre-season. Given Croft’s injury history — he sustained a career threatening neck injury two seasons ago and last year needed extensive surgery on torn knee ligaments — there were fears the England and Lions flanker could be facing another extended spell on the side-lines. But, speaking exclusively to Sportsmail, the 28-year-old revealed he is fit and ready to face Exeter at Sandy Park on Saturday.
