Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- It'll be a brand-new "View" in less than two weeks, with three new co-hosts in a new studio and with a new boss behind the scenes. The long-running ABC talk show finalized its cast Wednesday, confirming that actress Rosie Perez and political analyst Nicolle Wallace will join Whoopi Goldberg and Rosie O'Donnell. The four will start working together when new episodes of the show resume on September 15. Goldberg is the only cast member from last season left standing -- well, mostly sitting -- at "The View." Barbara Walters' retirement from the show in May was the first in a series of changes, both on- and off-camera. In July, Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy stepped down from their co-host spots. And Walters' producing partner, Bill Geddie, was replaced by Bill Wolff, most recently an executive producer at MSNBC.
