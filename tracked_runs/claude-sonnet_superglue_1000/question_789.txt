Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Samsung plans to challenge a U.S. court ruling that recommends more than $1 billion in damages to Apple over a patent dispute. A federal jury recommended Friday that Apple be awarded the damages after finding Samsung guilty of "willful" violations of a number of Apple's patents in the creation of its own mobile products. In a statement, Samsung said it will "move immediately to file post-verdict motions to overturn this decision in this court, and if we are not successful, we will appeal this decision to the court of appeals." The jury did not recommend awarding Samsung any money in its counterclaims that Apple had violated some of its patents.
