Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Juventus were left searching for answers after their unbeaten run was shattered by Fiorentina. The home side staged a renaissance in Florence that the city's medieval residents would have been proud of as they turned a 2-0 half time deficit into a 4-2 triumph. It was the first loss of the season for Italy's Serie A champions, Juventus. "We lost a game that we dominated for 70 minutes," Juve manager Antonio Conte said on the club's website. "We were home and dry and had more than one opportunity to score the third goal. "Suddenly something strange happened, if I could explain why it would be simple."
