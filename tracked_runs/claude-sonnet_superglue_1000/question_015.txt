Question:
Passage: Astronomers believe the Cassini spacecraft has spotted Saturn’s rings giving birth to a new moon. Named ‘Peggy’, the baby moon sits on the very edge of Saturn's A ring - the outermost of the planet's large, bright rings. It was first discovered exactly one year ago by Professor Carl Murray of Queen Mary University and was named after his mother-in-law. The thin, outermost ring shown in this picture from the Cassini probe is Saturn's F ring, and the bright dot near it is the moon Prometheus. The thicker white band is the A ring. The smudge in the red circle near what looks like the tip of that ring was created by Peggy
@highlight

@highlight
Discovered by Professor Carl Murray and named after his mother-in-law
@highlight
Scientists estimate Peggy is around half a mile (0.8 km) in diameter
@highlight
It could help explain how Saturn's moons may have formed in rings
@highlight
It also provides insight into how Earth and other planets in our solar system may have formed and migrated away from the sun

Query: Cassini is the fourth space probe to visit @placeholder and the first to enter orbit, and its mission is on going as of 2013.
