Question:
Paragraph: Jake was walking to the park to play baseball with his friends. He loved being outside on sunny days, and now that school was over for the year, he was playing baseball every day. The more he played, the better he got. Only Frank was better than he was. He liked playing third base, but he often played in the field. He was carrying his favorite mitt that his Grandfather had bought him. His Grandfather had taught him to catch. He loved spending time with him when he was younger, but he had moved last year. Now he only saw his Grandfather in the summer. Jake was really excited to show him his skills when he came to their next game. He could throw really fast now. He was sure his Grandfather would want to sit in the front to watch him. He knew he would jump up and down. Jake happily ran the rest of the way to the park thinking about how much fun he was going to have playing baseball this year. 

Question: Was Jake only able to see his grandfather in the summer since he moved last year?
