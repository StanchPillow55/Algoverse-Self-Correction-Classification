Question:
Passage: Andy Murray got an early season reminder that even players ranked below 300 can be a handful, and that playing Grand Slams is different to playing unofficial exhibition events. Faced with the pressure of the year's first Major and an underrated opponent in Yuki Bhambri, the world No 6 had life made awkward for him by the unfacied Indian before coming through 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 in two hours and 13 minutes at the Australian Open. The 27 year-old Scot now faces Australia's Marinko Matosevic, who won his first match in five attempts at Melbourne Park by overcoming Russian Alexander Kurdyatsev in five sets.
