Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Less than a decade after Radiohead offered up "In Rainbows" with a pay-what-you-want model, the group's frontman, Thom Yorke, is now selling a surprise new album via BitTorrent. The record, "Tomorrow's Modern Boxes," is available now at the pay-gated cost of $6. A video for the album's first track "A Brain in a Bottle," which expands on the haunting vocals and glitchy electronic music of Yorke's 2006 debut album "The Eraser," is available for free. A link to buy the record on vinyl is also included. A step-by-step guide explains how to get the record. Thom Yorke Talks Radiohead, Atoms for Peace With Daniel Craig
