Question:
Context: Ain't -- The strong prescription against ain't in standard English has led to many misconceptions, often expressed jocularly (or ironically), as ``ain't ain't a word'' or ``ain't ain't in the dictionary.'' Ain't is listed in most dictionaries, including the Oxford Dictionary of English and Merriam-Webster. However, Oxford states ``it does not form part of standard English and should never be used in formal or written contexts'', and Merriam-Webster states it is ``widely disapproved as non-standard and more common in the habitual speech of the less educated''.
