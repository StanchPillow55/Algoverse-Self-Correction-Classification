Question:
Passage: Ukip's general election campaign descended into chaos this morning after internal party rows over policy spilled out into the open. The party's health spokesman Louise Bours publicly slapped down party leader Nigel Farage after he suggested the NHS may need to be privatised to cope with the growing pressure on the health budget caused by a rapidly-ageing population. It came after the Ukip MEP in charge of writing the party's 2015 manifesto was replaced – after not coming up with any policies. Scroll down for video Tim Aker has been replaced as the Ukip policy chief after failing to complete the party's manifesto in time for May's crunch general election
