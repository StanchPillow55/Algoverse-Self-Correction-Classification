Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- They say a week is a long time in politics. In today's febrile world of finance, it's a lifetime. Europe's leaders may soon learn that lesson the hard way if they continue to dodge the question on everyone's lips: What to do if Greece is pushed out of the eurozone? No stranger to unfortunate soubriquets herself, Angela Merkel has repeatedly refused to address the matter of a Greek exit -- or "Grexit," as it has been dubbed. This week, she cited "political correctness" as her logic for skirting the issue. Either way, the bosses of some of the eurozone's biggest companies have decided they can't afford the luxury of being caught short.
