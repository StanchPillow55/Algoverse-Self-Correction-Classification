Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- Ian Murphy, the online news website editor who duped Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker into taking a prank call by posing as a billionaire conservative activist, told CNN Thursday that Walker is a "delusional" politician seeking to help wealthy GOP backers. Murphy, editor of the news website "Buffalo Beast," posed as business tycoon David Koch while placing a call to Walker's office. He was able to secure a candid 20-minute conversation with the governor. In a transcript of the conversation on the website, Walker discusses the idea of bringing 14 Democratic state senators -- who left the state to prevent a quorum for discussing the budget bill -- back to the assembly to "talk, not negotiate," allow them to recess, and then have the 19 Republican senators declare a quorum.
