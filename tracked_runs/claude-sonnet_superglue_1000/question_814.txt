Question:
Passage: Serbia captain Branislav Ivanovic has blamed his team's 3-1 home defeat by Denmark in their Euro 2016 Group I qualifier on a lack of commitment among the players and their habit of underestimating the opposition. 'We see ourselves as big stars and always think we are better than others and that's a very bad attitude,' the Chelsea defender told reporters after Serbia were blown away by the Danes in an empty stadium on Friday. 'The players are obviously unaware what it means to put on a Serbia shirt and play for the national team. This has been going on for years and we can't carry on like that.'
