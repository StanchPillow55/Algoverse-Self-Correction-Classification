Question:
Passage: Commanding an area larger than Britain with a population of more than four million brutally oppressed citizens, Islamic State terrorists use a strict hierarchical system to manage operations. Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has appointed a rigid chain of command beneath him, divided into separate councils responsible for everything from the sale of oil, to internal communications and decisions on which prisoners to execute and how. The highly detailed information on exactly how the terror group operates, as well as the names of Baghdadi's deputies and department heads, stems from the discovery of a USB stick inside the  home of Abu Abdul Rahman al-Bilawi - the now deceased former-head of ISIS' military operations in Iraq.
