Question:
Passage: By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 08:25 EST, 10 October 2012 | UPDATED: 15:31 EST, 12 October 2012 Enraged: Robert Zimmerman Jr., pictured on Piers Morgan Tonight, launched a threatening Twitter tirade at the the Trayvon Martin family's attorneys The older brother of George Zimmerman has launched a Twitter tirade on an attorney for Trayvon Martin's family, vowing to make it his life's work to disbar her. Robert Zimmerman Jr.'s rant followed a week of television interviews in which he protested the innocence of his brother, who stands accused of killing the unarmed teenager in February. The Zimmermans have been on a national media crusade over the past week - chatting with Piers Morgan and Spanish-speaking channels - to 'reintroduce' the family, who believe they have been misrepresented throughout the high-profile, divisive case.
