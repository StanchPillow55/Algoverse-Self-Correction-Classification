Question:
Context: The Chorus (2004 film) -- The Chorus (French: Les Choristes) is a 2004 European drama film directed by Christophe Barratier. Co-written by Barratier and Philippe Lopes-Curval (fr), it is an adaptation of the 1945 film A Cage of Nightingales (La Cage aux rossignols), which in turn was adapted by Noël-Noël and René Wheeler from a story by Wheeler and Georges Chaperot. The story is based on the origins of the boy choir The Little Singers of Paris who were the main interpret in A Cage of Nightingales. The original French title translates as ``The Choristers'' or ``The Choirboys'', not ``The Chorus''.
