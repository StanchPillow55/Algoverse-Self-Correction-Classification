Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Renee Zellweger looks different than she did 10 years ago. Big deal—who doesn't? Maybe she had plastic surgery. Maybe a little lipo, too. Or maybe her new look, at 45, is truly courtesy of her living a healthier, happier life away from the constant media glare, as she reportedly told People Magazine. Considering how mean-spirited some of the response has been since Zellweger showed up at the Elle Women in Hollywood Awards much slimmer than we remembered, who could question the effect time away from the vitriol can have on a person? Kelly Wallace: Why so quick to pick apart Zellweger's looks?

Query: I think it's safe to assume not all—if any—were done on @placeholder.
