Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- His name means "bright light" in Japanese, and at the tender age of 18 he's already shining on the global rugby stage. Less than one year out of high school, Akira Ioane made an impressive debut at the HSBC Wellington Sevens last month as his native New Zealand romped to tournament victory. The Auckland teenager's pace, power and try-scoring exploits have even drawn comparisons to All Blacks rugby legend Jonah Lomu, the rampaging winger who first appeared at the 1994 Hong Kong Sevens before going on to star at the World Cup in South Africa one year later.
