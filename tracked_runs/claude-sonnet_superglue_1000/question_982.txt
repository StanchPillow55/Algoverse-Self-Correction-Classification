And for Beijing-based wine consultant and educator Fongyee Walker, it was that first bottle of grapey Black Tower. "You look at the American market, and the English market -- they were originally beer and spirits markets just like China. What shifted America? White Zin. What shifted England? Black Tower," she tells me.
