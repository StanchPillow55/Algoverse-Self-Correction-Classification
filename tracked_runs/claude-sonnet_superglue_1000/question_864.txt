Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- There are few sports that are so dominated by a single person like the way the women's pole vault is ruled by 26-year Russian Yelena Isinbayeva. Eyes on the prize: Yelena Isinbayeva has often complained about a lack of real competition in her event. Every time the world and Olympic champion competes it is expected that she will spring to new heights and push women's pole-vaulting to new levels. She has broken the world record 16 times, almost equaling the feat of the great Sergey Bubka, who broke the men's outdoor pole vault record 17 times between 1984 and 1994.
@highlight
World and Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva dominates her sport
@highlight
Has broken the world record 15 times since 2003; first woman to clear 5m
@highlight
Media-friendly looks and talent have made her very bankable sports start

Query: While emulating Bubka, Isinbayeva has said before that closing the gap between the heights the men and women can jump is another of her personal challenges, and with her own talent and the help of @placeholder's former coach she may go a long way towards achieving that.
