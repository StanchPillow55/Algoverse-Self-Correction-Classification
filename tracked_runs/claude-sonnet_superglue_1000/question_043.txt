Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- A former campaign aide who has accused Republican congressional candidate Carl DeMaio of sexual harassment released the results of an independent lie detector test on Friday in an effort to refute DeMaio's suggestion that he is a suspected criminal. In an exclusive CNN interview aired last week, Todd Bosnich accused DeMaio of sexually harassing him, saying the San Diego Republican even masturbated in front of him. DeMaio denied the allegations, saying they're the cover story of a plagiarist and suspected criminal. Both men are openly gay. DeMaio said Bosnich was fired from his job as campaign policy director for plagiarizing a report. Days later, DeMaio said, Bosnich broke into his campaign office and smashed computers and cut phone lines. Bosnich denied both allegations.
