Question:
Passage: Atlanta (CNN) -- The widow of a man gunned down outside his son's suburban Atlanta day-care center plotted his death with her cash-strapped lover for nearly $3 million in insurance and other assets, prosecutors alleged Thursday. A grand jury indicted Andrea Sneiderman on murder, racketeering, perjury and other charges Thursday morning, DeKalb County, Georgia, District Attorney Robert James announced. According to the indictment, she and her then-boss, Hemy Neuman, had been having an affair for about seven months before husband Rusty Sneiderman was killed in November 2010. The Sneidermans were having marriage problems at the time, while Neuman and his wife were in similar straits and facing bankruptcy, according to the charges.
