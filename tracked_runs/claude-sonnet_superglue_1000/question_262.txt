Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Analysts say the slaying of one of Latin America's best-known folk singers over the weekend shines a spotlight on problems with deep roots in Guatemala: violence, impunity and the pervasive presence of organized crime "It shows how far these groups have infiltrated. ... It's a very large blow first of all to the country's image, and secondly to its government," said Miguel Castillo, a professor of political science at the University of Francisco Marroquin in Guatemala City. Gunmen ambushed Argentinian folk singer Facundo Cabral when he was on his way to the airport in the nation's capital Saturday, authorities said. As investigators continued searching for suspects Monday, the high-profile shooting drew increasing attention throughout Latin America, where Cabral gained fame as a protest singer who pushed for peace.
