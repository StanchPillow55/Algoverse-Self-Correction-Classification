Question:
Paragraph: The dermis is the inner layer of skin. The dermis has blood vessels and nerve endings. The nerve endings explain why your skin is sensitive. You can sense pain, pressure, and temperature. You cut your finger and it starts to bleed. What has happened? If your skin bleeds, it means you have cut the dermis layer and damaged blood vessels. The cut really hurts. It hurts because of the nerve endings in this skin layer. The dermis also contains hair follicles and two types of glands. Hair follicles are structures where hairs originate. Each hair grows out of a follicle. Hair passes up through the epidermis. It then extends above the skin surface. Oil glands produce an oily substance. The oil is secreted into hair follicles.
