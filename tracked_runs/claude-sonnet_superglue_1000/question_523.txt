Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Dani Pedrosa repeated his 2012 success at a sweltering Sepang Sunday but his Honda teammate Marc Marquez took another big step towards the MotoGP world title by finishing a fine second. The 20-year-old Marquez won a thrilling battle with defending champion Jorge Lorenzo for Yamaha to increase his lead over his fellow Spaniard in the championship standings to 43 points. Marquez can wrap up the title next week at Philip Island in Australia, the first rookie to win the MotoGP premier crown in 35 years. He admitted that getting the better of Lorenzo, moving ahead for the final time halfway through the 20 lap race was satisfying.
