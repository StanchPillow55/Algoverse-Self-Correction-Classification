Question:
Paragraph: In actual practice, however, we act too often as if we only cared for economic values.  If we are to live up to our educational profession, we must look our aim in the face and honestly practise what we believe.  While training of character and conduct is the accepted aim for education in general, to make this useful and practical each teacher must fix her attention on how this ultimate aim affects her own special part of the whole work.  By watching the free child she will discover how best she can help him: he knows his own business, and when unfettered by advice or command shows plainly that he is chiefly concerned with _gaining experience_.  He finds himself in what is to him a new and complex world of people and things; actual experience is the foundation for a complete living, and the stronger the foundation the better the result of later building.  _The first vital principle then is that the teacher of young children must provide life in miniature; that is, she must provide abundant raw material and opportunities for experience_. 

Question: If the teacher of young children is to live up to our educational profession, what must she teach?
