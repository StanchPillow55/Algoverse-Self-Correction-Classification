Question:
Passage: The mother and brother of the man nickname the 'Maimi Cannibal' said he would 'never' be capable of attacking another person and chewing his face off. Ruth Charles does not believe police accounts that her son Rudy Eugene assaulted Ronald Poppo and tore 70 percent of his face off with his teeth -- despite watching the horrifying surveillance video of the attack. Poppo, a homeless 65-year-old, survived the attack with little left of his face 'but a goatee.' Plastic surgery experts warn doctors will have to remove even more tissue before they can begin the lengthy, arduous process of rebuilding his face.
