Question:
Passage: Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's elderly mother will soon tell jurors about her most famous son, as the wrongful death trial of his last concert promoter reaches a midpoint. Jurors heard one of Jackson's former doctors testify last week that the top producer of Jackson's comeback concerts knew about the singer's drug dependency on a previous tour. Katherine Jackson, 83, has sat on the front row of the Los Angeles courtroom almost every one of the 46 days of testimony. She's shed tears, sometimes laughed, and at one point last week shouted out the name of one of her son's movies when a witness couldn't remember it.
