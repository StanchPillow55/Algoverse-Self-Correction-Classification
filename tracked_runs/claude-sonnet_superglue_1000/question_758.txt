Question:
Passage: Petro Poroshenko is already the "Chocolate King" of Ukraine, but he has his sights set higher: He wants to be president. He's a billionaire thanks to the candy company he started nearly 20 years ago, but, asked recently if it's an advantage to be an oligarch when running for president, Poroshenko sidestepped the question with a hint of a smile on his lips and a hint of steel in his eyes. "I don't know," he said in English. "You should ask an oligarch about that." Poroshenko, 48, isn't Ukraine's wealthiest man; his $1.3 billion fortune makes him seventh, according to Forbes magazine's list of the world's billionaires.
