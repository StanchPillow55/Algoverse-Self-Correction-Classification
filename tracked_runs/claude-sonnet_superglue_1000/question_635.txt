Question:
Passage: By Ian Sparks French film star Gerard Depardieu has sparked fresh outrage in France by defending Vladimir Putin's clampdown on his opponents and declaring: 'The masses are stupid.' The actor - who recently became a French tax exile and was given a Russian passport - also defended sending the three members of Pussy Riot to a Russian labour camp. And in an extraordinary comparison, he said the trio - who staged an anti-Putin protest in a Moscow church - would have been 'executed' if they had done the same thing in a mosque.
