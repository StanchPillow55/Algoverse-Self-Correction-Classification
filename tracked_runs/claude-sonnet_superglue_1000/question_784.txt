Question:
Passage: West Ham have wasted no time in revealing their new home kit for next season after Sam Allardyce's squad returned to training at Chadwell Heath. Hammers stars including Ravel Morrison, Carlton Cole and Winston Reid posed in their latest strip as they arrived at the club's training ground to begin their preparations for the new Barclays Premier League campaign. The adidas designed kit evokes memories of the east London side's classic striped shirt of 1985-86, which was worn by Frank McAvennie and Co as they helped the club finish third - their highest ever league position.
