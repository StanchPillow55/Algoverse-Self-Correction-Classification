Passage: By Richard Hartley-parkinson PUBLISHED: 03:57 EST, 17 April 2012 | UPDATED: 04:31 EST, 18 April 2012 Millions of commuters face fresh misery next week as London Underground workers plan a 72-hour walkout. The strikes, which come a week ahead of the mayoral election, stretch over four days and will involve the people who maintain and upgrade the tracks who are unhappy with negotiations over pensions and benefits. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union, which represents around 1,000 staff on the Tube Lines contracts, said its members will walk out at 4pm on Tuesday until the same time on Friday.
