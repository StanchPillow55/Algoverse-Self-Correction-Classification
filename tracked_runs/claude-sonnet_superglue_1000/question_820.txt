Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and rival Mitt Romney have targeted Ohio with incessant campaigning, a slew of television ads and nonstop political phone calls. The importance of the Buckeye State cannot be overstated: Ohio has not voted for the loser in the presidential election since 1960. In other words, as goes Ohio, so goes the nation. "They're just going to badger voters over and over again until they cast a ballot," said Paul A. Beck, a political science professor at the Ohio State University. "It doesn't really matter where they pick up the votes, so the campaigns are everywhere. They're visiting all over the state and running ads everywhere."
