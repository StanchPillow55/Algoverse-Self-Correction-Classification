Question:
Passage: New York (CNN) -- The massacre in Newtown brought back an old memory -- a day in the 1970s when as a 12-year-old French school boy I had held my first gun. On a Wednesday, a short school day in France, one of my classmates had brought a whole group of kids to his house. The parents were away at the office so we tasted a few drops of his dad's Scotch, checked out his older brother's collection of Playboy magazine, then, as if we needed to complete our transgressions, our young host led us upstairs, opened a drawer in the master bedroom, and pulled out this mass of black metal.

Coste: There are many illegal guns, but fear and taboo are more efficient gun control

Query: They are still rarely used, and to most @placeholder people, they belong in a parallel world.
