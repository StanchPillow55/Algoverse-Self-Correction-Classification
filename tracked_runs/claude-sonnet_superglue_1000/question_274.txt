Question:
Context: Superfecundation -- Superfecundation is the fertilization of two or more ova from the same cycle by sperm from separate acts of sexual intercourse, which can lead to twin babies from two separate biological fathers. The term superfecundation is derived from fecund, meaning the ability to produce offspring. Heteropaternal superfecundation refers to the fertilization of two separate ova by two different fathers. Homopaternal superfecundation refers to the fertilization of two separate ova from the same father, leading to fraternal twins. While heteropaternal superfecundation is referred to as a form of atypical twinning, genetically, the twins are half siblings. Superfecundation, while rare, can occur through either separate occurrences of sexual intercourse or through artificial insemination.
