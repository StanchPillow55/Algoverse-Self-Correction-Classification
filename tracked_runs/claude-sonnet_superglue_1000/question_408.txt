Passage: (CNN) -- Did we miss something? If you know of additional ways to help those affected by the severe weather please tweet us @CNNImpact, and/or please comment below. A recent spate of storms ripped across the central and southeastern US causing widespread destruction and multiple deaths. Entire neighborhoods were leveled in the Arkansas towns of Mayflower and Vilonia, with more damage reported in the towns of Louisville and Tupelo, Mississippi and Athens, Alabama - as well as Quapaw, Oklahoma and Baxter Springs, Kansas. The storm system also brought torrential rain to southeastern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. More than a foot of rain has caused severe flooding which has washed out bridges and poured into homes, with many residents requiring rescue.
