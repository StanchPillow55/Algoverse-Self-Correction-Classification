Question:
Passage: By Ray Massey PUBLISHED: 14:29 EST, 14 June 2013 | UPDATED: 14:35 EST, 14 June 2013 There was a time when the prospect of Germans crossing the English Channel at speed might have been a source of some alarm. But today rail passengers on both sides of the water will be celebrating Germany’s Deutsche Bahn receiving permission to run its 200mph trains at ‘blitz’ or lightning speed through the Channel Tunnel. It will get travellers from Berlin to London in four and a half hours – and vice versa. A German ICE high speed train coming out of the Channel Tunnel on its test run in 2010
@highlight

@highlight

@highlight
