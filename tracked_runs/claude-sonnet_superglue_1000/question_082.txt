Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The 1992 Barcelona Olympics mark the first games in which Team USA included NBA athletes. It was called the "Dream Team." The Dream Team comprised a coterie of NBA legends, including Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, John Stockton, and of course, "His Airness" Michael Jordan. Its claim to the title of best basketball team ever has remained virtually unchallenged for two decades. That is, until last week, when Lakers guard Kobe Bryant suggested this year's Olympic team, featuring himself along with NBA superstars LeBron James and Kevin Durant, could beat the heralded Dream Team. Suffice it to say, Bryant's assertion shook up the sports world.

@highlight
Lee: Past record-setting athletes would be hard-pressed to recreate accomplishments today

Query: Similarly, Charles Barkley chided Bryant, arguing that @placeholder, LeBron and Kobe are the only Team USA players good enough to have made the 1992 Dream Team roster.
