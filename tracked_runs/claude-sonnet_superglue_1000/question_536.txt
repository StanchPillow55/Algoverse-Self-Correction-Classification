Question:
Passage: By David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor Two members of Congress got into a shouting match Thursday over whether the error-plagued Obamacare Americans give up their privacy rights when they apply for health insurance through the federal government. Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey unleashed a round of verbal Kung-Fu during a House hearing after Reps. Joe Barton of Texas and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee accused software contractors of violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPPA, by collecting Americans' personal information from Healthcare.gov. And one company official testified to the House Energy and Commerce Committee that 2,000 employees have access to the information Americans give the Obamacare website when they apply for insurance.
