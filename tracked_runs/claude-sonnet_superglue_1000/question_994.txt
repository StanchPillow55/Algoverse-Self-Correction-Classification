Question:
Passage: While Attorney General Eric Holder had made clear that he wanted to leave the post before the end of Obama's second term, the announcement of his departure just before midterm elections took many by surprise and the timing could complicate the effort to replace him. Choosing a new attorney general and getting approval in a Senate confirmation hearing will be difficult for the White House. While the list of strong candidates who could assume the role is long, congressional politics will make it difficult to get Senate approval for just about anyone. Plus, while he has endured his share of controversies, Holder is also President Barack Obama's very close friend and confidant, someone for whom the President consistently communicated his full support.
