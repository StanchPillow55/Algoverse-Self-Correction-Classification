Question:
Passage: Prime Minister Tony Abbott is being haunted by his own, damning words, in a video that has resurfaced today. The embattled Liberal leader this afternoon tried to shrug off the fact nearly 40 per cent of his own colleagues voted for a leadership spill, insisting 'this matter is now behind us'. But he wasn't nearly so forgiving when 31 of former prime minister Julia Gillard's colleagues voted against her leadership in February 2012. The video from parliamentary Question Time shows Mr Abbott questioning how Ms Gillard could continue as leader, considering her lack of party support. Scroll down for video
