Passage: By Tamara Cohen PUBLISHED: 19:38 EST, 30 October 2013 | UPDATED: 19:46 EST, 30 October 2013 Ed Miliband was accused of playing ‘political games’ over HS2 by Nick Clegg yesterday. His intervention stepped up pressure on the Labour leader as his party appeared to change its stance to back the £50billion rail project. The Deputy Prime Minister added that he would not compromise on HS2 in any future talks with Labour about forming a government. Under fire: Nick Clegg accused Labour leader Ed Miliband of 'playing political games' with the HS2 project Mr Clegg said the idea was inherited from Labour and it was ‘pathetic... that when it becomes politically convenient to play games with it, they start playing games with it’.
