Question:
Passage: (EW.com) -- What's the appropriate soundtrack for kids killing kids? That's one of many tough questions that Grammy-winning producer T Bone Burnett had to answer while overseeing this set of songs inspired by the movie adaptation of Suzanne Collins' best-selling novel about tweens and teens forced to fight to the death. Fans of the book might imagine its bow-hunting heroine, Katniss Everdeen, slinging arrows to the strains of something decidedly punk-rock. Personally, I'd like to think of her blasting Bikini Kill's ''Rebel Girl'' while she takes out Cato, Clove, Glimmer, and anyone else who underestimates her talent for ripping out tender teenage hearts and entrails.
@highlight
Taylor Swift's ''Safe & Sound,'' is backed by breakout Nashville duo the Civil Wars
@highlight
Miranda Lambert and Pistol Annies' ''Run Daddy Run'' is deeply ominous
@highlight
The Punch Brothers' pretty ''Dark Days'' carry on the mournful fingerpicking

Query: Far more engaging are the artists who imagine they've seen @placeholder' future, and all they can say is ''Go back.''
