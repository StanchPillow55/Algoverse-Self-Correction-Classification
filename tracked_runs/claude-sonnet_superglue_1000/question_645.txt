Question:
Passage: Lynne Hansen, 58, did not sleep well last night. She was disturbed by the deadly crash that yesterday claimed the life of Aneri Patel, 16, at the exact same spot where her daughter, Emma, 20, was killed by a car seven years ago. The similarities were 'eerie'. Both young women were hit by inexperienced drivers near the bus stop on the corner of Railway Parade in Kogarah, in Sydney's south, around the same time of the morning. Mrs Hansen's first reaction to Monday's horrible news was to feel sorrow for Ms Patel's mother and father. '(I was thinking about) the poor parents, really, because we're the ones that live with it,' Mrs Hansen told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday.
