Question:
Passage: United Nations (CNN) -- Arab and Western diplomats spoke in support Tuesday of a U.N. Security Council draft resolution that calls for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, while representatives from Russia and China slammed it as meddlesome. More effective than the resolution, Russia and China said, would be the fostering of dialogue within the country. "The council cannot impose the parameters for an internal political settlement," said Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations. "We are convinced that at a time of intense internal political crisis, the role of the international community should not be one of exacerbating conflict, nor meddling by use of economic sanctions or military force."
