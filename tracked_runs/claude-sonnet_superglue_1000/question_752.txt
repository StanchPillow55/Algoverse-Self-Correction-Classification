Question:
Passage: By Rob Waugh Updated: 13:31 EST, 13 January 2012 The EcoATM: After analysing your mobile or MP3, it gives a quote on the spot, based on what a network of hundreds of electronics-recycling companies are willing to pay for it. If you accept, it spits out cash The EcoATM machine is a fully automated phone recycler that lets users drop off old mobiles - then pays for them in cash. It's a cupboard-sized machine with a big touch screen and metal tray where you can place your old phone or MP3 player. EcoATM already has some machines in California, but is rolling out across the U.S. shortly.
