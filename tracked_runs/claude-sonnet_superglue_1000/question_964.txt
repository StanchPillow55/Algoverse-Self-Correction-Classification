Question:
Passage: (EW.com) -- 2012 continued its box office winning streak this weekend, as Kate Beckinsale replaced herself at the top of the chart. Her new movie, "Underworld Awakening," a 3D fourth installment of the popular vampires vs. werewolves franchise, debuted in first place with $25.4 million, good for a $8,252 per theater average. "Awakening" improved upon the opening weekend of its predecessor, 2009â€²s "Underworld: Rise of the Lycans," which started with $20.8 million (and did not feature Beckinsale), but fell short of 2006â€²s "Underworld: Evolution," which kicked off its run with $26.9 million. Sony/Screen Gems paid $70 million to make the 3D action film, but if past "Underworld" performances are any indication, "Awakening," which earned an "A-" CinemaScore grade, will have trouble recouping its costs.
