Question:
Passage: Host commentator It's all over and it ends 4-1 after an impressive home performance from Everton. An own goal from Rodriguez gave the Toffees an early lead before Coleman and Baines scored either side of the break to put Martinez's side into a commanding lead. Mirallas added the icing on the cake with a fourth before a stunning consolation free-kick from Rodriguez. And he has been beaten! There was nothing Howard could do about a stunning free-kick from Rodriguez which grazes the post before flying in. Howard looks a bit annoyed, but the final whistle goes and it ends 4-1!
