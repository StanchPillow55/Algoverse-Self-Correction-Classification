Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Health officials in Glasgow, Scotland, have confirmed a case of Ebola. "The patient is a health care worker who was helping to combat the disease in West Africa" and returned from Sierra Leone late Sunday night, the Scottish health agency NHS Scotland said. The patient flew via Casablanca, Morocco, and London Heathrow Airport, arriving at Glasgow Airport on a British Airways flight around 11:30 p.m., the statement said. "The patient was admitted to hospital early in the morning after feeling unwell and was placed into isolation at 7.50 a.m. All possible contacts with the patient are now being investigated and anyone deemed to be at risk will be contacted and closely monitored. However, having been diagnosed in the very early stages of the illness, the risk to others is considered extremely low."
