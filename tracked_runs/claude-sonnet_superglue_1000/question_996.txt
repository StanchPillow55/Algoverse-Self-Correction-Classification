Question:
Passage: Los Angeles (CNN) -- Two California men were sentenced to prison Thursday for their roles in the severe beating of a San Francisco Giants fan after a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2011. Marvin Norwood, 33, and Louie Sanchez, 31, were sentenced to four years and eight years, respectively. Members of victim Bryan Stow's family appeared in court and made statements to the defendants and the judge during the sentencing. Now brain-damaged as a result of the beating, Stow is disabled and unable to care for himself, said his father, David. "The time you serve will be insignificant to what Bryan must endure. However, the years you spend in prison is what you two cretins deserve," David Stow said to the two men.
