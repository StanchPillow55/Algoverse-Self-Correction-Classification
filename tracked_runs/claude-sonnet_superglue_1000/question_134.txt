Passage: By Martin Robinson PUBLISHED: 10:47 EST, 29 October 2013 | UPDATED: 11:52 EST, 29 October 2013 A £600,000 payout to the social services chief who failed to save Baby P 'leaves a bad taste in the mouth' Ed Balls said today, as he stood by the decison to sack her while he was Children's Secretary. Sharon Shoesmith, the former head of children’s services at Haringey Council, was fired from her £130,000-a year job in 2008 in the wake of a public outcry over the death of 17-month-old Peter Connelly. She launched an appeal claiming unfair dismissal, eventually won and last night BBC’s Newsnight reported Haringey has agreed a huge compensation deal with her.
