A photo, published in the official North Korean daily newspaper Rodong Sinmun, shows for the first time the luxury Russian IL-62 jetliner that carries Kim and his wife Ri Sol-ju on official engagements around the secretive country. At first glance, the aircraft bears some similarity to the US President's personal jet, bearing as it does North Korea's official name and flag and a star symbolising Kim on its tail, South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported today, quoting the North's paper.
