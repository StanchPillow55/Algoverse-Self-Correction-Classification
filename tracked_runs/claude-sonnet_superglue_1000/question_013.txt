Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Paris Saint-Germain's list of honors are modest compared to the achievements of Europe's top football clubs, but what the French side lacks in history is made up for in ambition. Since being taken over by Qatar Sports Investments in May 2011, significant steps have been taken, on and off the pitch, to make sure PSG can challenge for major titles -- and new manager Carlo Ancelotti is under no illusions about what is expected of him. "This club does not have a big history like Milan, like other clubs like Manchester United, like Real Madrid, like Barcelona," the 52-year-old, who replaced Antoine Kombouare in December, told CNN. "The aim is to reach that kind of level."
