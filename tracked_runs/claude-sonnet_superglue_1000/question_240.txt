Question:
Passage: Scotland risks unprecedented austerity and the pound could ‘plunge into the abyss’ if the referendum results in a Yes vote, economic experts have warned. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research expressed dismay at Alex Salmond’s ‘Plan B’ if an independent Scotland is barred from using the pound. The think-tank said the SNP leader’s back-up plan – adopting the pound informally and reneging on Scotland’s share of Britain’s borrowings – was ‘opportunistic’ and would saddle every taxpayer in the rest of the UK with an extra £5,900 of debt. Scroll down for video Chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander said a 'Yes' vote on Thursday would see Scotland's bonds downgraded to 'junk' status in the event of the country walking away from its share of the national debt
