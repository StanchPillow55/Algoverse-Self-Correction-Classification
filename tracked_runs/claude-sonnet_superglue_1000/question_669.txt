Question:
Passage: A British quantum physicist who was tipped to win a Nobel prize was killed just an hour after arriving in Australia by a joyrider high on cannabis, an inquest has heard. Cancer survivor and charity volunteer Dr Sean Barrett, 36, was killed when a stolen 4x4 driven by Antony Fogarty jumped at least two red lights at speeds of up to 100mph and ploughed into his taxi. The vehicle hit the scientist's cab with such force it was sent skidding 45 metres down the road, the inquest in Manchester was told. The lecturer and researcher, who worked at Imperial College London, was killed instantly along with 28-year-old taxi driver and expectant father Kuldeep Singh on their journey from Perth Airport to the city.
