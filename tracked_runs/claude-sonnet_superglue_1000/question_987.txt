Question:
Passage: Dean Shiels relieved some of the pressure on under-fire boss Ally McCoist as his second-half winner handed Rangers a narrow 1-0 win over Cowdenbeath at Ibrox. The vultures have been circling McCoist ever since his side slumped to a shock 3-2 defeat to part-time Alloa on Wednesday. But while his side again looked anything but assertive, Shiels' 58th-minute strike did hand the manager some much-needed breathing space. Rangers midfielder Dean Shiels celebrates after scoring the winner against Cowdenbeath McCoist can still feel the sting of the Wasps' Petrofac Training Cup semi-final but he has already insisted he will not walk away from the job until he leads the Glasgow giants back to the Scottish Premiership.
