Question:
Passage: San Diego, California (CNN) -- Since his recent U.S. homecoming, the long-lost son has been baptized, a good Samaritan gave him an airline ticket and now he's counting down the hours until Saturday morning -- when he will see his mother for the first time in 35 years. David Amaya Barrick, 37, made national headlines when he tried to cross the U.S. border illegally from Mexico three weeks ago -- only to remember upon arrest by the U.S. Border Patrol that he was actually a U.S. citizen born in Chicago and maybe, just maybe, his birth certificate and his mother could be found to prove it.
