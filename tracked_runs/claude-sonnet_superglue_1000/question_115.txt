Question:
Passage: A bride who pretended to have terminal cancer so she could scam money for a lavish wedding reception and honeymoon will face felony charges over the deception. Jessica Vega, 25, from New York, even fooled her husband to-be that she was dying from leukaemia, telling him she had less than a year to live. Vega was taken into custody last week and pleaded not guilty to five counts of grand larceny and one count of scheme to defraud. She was currently being held in Orange County Jail, New York on $10,000 bail.
