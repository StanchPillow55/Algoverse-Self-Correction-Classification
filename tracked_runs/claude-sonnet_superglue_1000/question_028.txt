Question:
Passage: (Tribune Media Services) -- Like a German child's fantasy, Nurnberg's fairy-godmother-like teenage angel stretched out her arms and said, "If you're very, very gentle, you can touch my wings." I stayed seated while little Bavarian preschoolers mobbed the stage to touch their Christkind. In southern Germany, a lovely angel named the Christkind charms wonderstruck children. Bavaria and Tirol -- two traditional regions of Germany and Austria -- are great for Christmas traditions. While most travelers visit for the Christmas markets, that's just the start of the holiday charm. Germany's grandest Christmas market, in Nurnberg, comes complete with an angelic Christkind dressed in gold, played by a real-life teenage girl.
