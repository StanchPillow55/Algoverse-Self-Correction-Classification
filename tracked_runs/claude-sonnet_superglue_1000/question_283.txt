Question:
Passage: By Kerry Mcdermott PUBLISHED: 11:44 EST, 29 August 2012 | UPDATED: 11:45 EST, 29 August 2012 A Spanish town played host to some very saucy behaviour as tens of thousands of people gathered to pelt one another with 120 tons of tomatoes at the annual Tomatina festival. Around 40,000 men and woman armed themselves with copious amounts of edible ammunition to take part in La Tomatina - described as the world's biggest food fight - in Bunol, Valencia, on Wednesday, with many donning swimming goggles to protect their eyes from flying tomato juice. The streets of Bunol were soon awash with the pulp of thousands upon thousands of squashed tomatoes as the festival - believed to date back to 1945 - got underway.
