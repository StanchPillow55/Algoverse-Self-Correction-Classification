Question:
Passage: Chief executive James Sutherland has announced Cricket Australia will 'immediately' conduct an investigation into player safety in the wake of Phillip Hughes' death on Thursday. The cricketing world has been in mourning for the last 24 hours following confirmation that Hughes died from injuries suffered during a Sheffield Shield game on Tuesday, when the South Australia batsman was struck on the head by a bouncer bowled by New South Wales paceman Sean Abbott. After being too early on a pull stroke, the 25-year-old was hit by a ball on the back, lower left side of his head, just below his helmet. He never regained consciousness.
