Question:
Passage: The Premier League's three remaining sides in Europe's top club competition found out who they will face in the Champions League last 16 on Monday. Arsene Wenger will go toe to toe with former club Monaco, after expressing his wish to see Arsenal line up against the French side. Meanwhile Chelsea and Manchester City face harder opposition in Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona respectively. Real Madrid will defend their crown against Roberto Di Matteo's Schalke. Host commentator And we finish with Basel vs Porto. Yawn. That's a decent morning for the English sides I'd suggest. Arsenal have a dream draw, while Chelsea say they wanted PSG.
