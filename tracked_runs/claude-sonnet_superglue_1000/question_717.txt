Question:
Passage: By Graham Smith PUBLISHED: 05:44 EST, 9 July 2012 | UPDATED: 05:47 EST, 9 July 2012 A U.S. Navy petty officer was left 'in complete shock' when she returned home from seven months at sea to discover her beloved dog had been put down. Emily Valenzuela, 29, had arranged for her cousin Christa Valenzuela, 32, to live rent free at her home in San Diego, California, on the condition that she look after her pet Bert. But Christa was unable to cope with the puggle because in December last year, just weeks after Emily had left on her deployment, she took him to the local Department of Animal Services.
