Question:
Passage: One spring day about 42,000 years ago, a herd of woolly mammoths was grazing near what would one day be called the Yuribey river in northwestern Siberia. Back then, during the Late Pleistocene age, this was no frozen wasteland but fertile steppe, with plenty of succulent grasses and plants for the huge mammals to feast on. Munching with the herd was a mother accompanied by her newborn calf.
