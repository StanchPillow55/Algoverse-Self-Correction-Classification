Question:
Passage: Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Syrian opposition is blaming pro-government militia members for the slaying of a prominent Palestinian militant in his house outside Damascus. He was Hamas member Kamal Hosni Ghanaja, a former deputy of Mahmoud Mabhouh, who was slain in Dubai in 2010, a death many observers blame on the Israeli spy agency Mossad. Mabhouh was one of the founders of Hamas' military wing. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, which opposes the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, said the pro-government Shabiha militia tortured Ghanaja to death and "set his house on fire to destroy the evidence of their heinous crime." The killing comes amid tensions between Syria and Hamas and sectarian strife inside Syria.
