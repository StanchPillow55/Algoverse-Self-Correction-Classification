Question:
Passage: By Neil Sears UPDATED: 17:50 EST, 18 October 2011 Old money: Lady Jacqueline Killearn's bid to sell her stately home has been blocked after opposition from her son When her husband was Britain’s wartime ambassador to Cairo, she rose to the pinnacle of society, entertaining Winston Churchill, Charles de Gaulle, and King Farouk of Egypt. And at the age of 102, despite dwindling funds, Lord Killearn’s widow Jacqueline still wishes to be maintained in the style to which she long ago became accustomed. But when the centenarian baroness tried to quickly raise £1.65million by selling her Jacobean mansion – ‘significantly’ below its market value – she started a row with her son and grandson which had to be resolved in the High Court.
@highlight
