Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The likely failure of Friday's Geneva 2 conference to produce a credible political process to end Syria's civil war points up the painfully obvious: Syria -- a conflict seemingly without end -- is a moral, humanitarian and strategic tragedy. But it is neither an American tragedy nor the Obama administration's fault nor responsibility. This does not mean the United States is free to ignore the Syrian conflict; nor that its continuation doesn't negatively affect American interests. What it does mean is that the President's risk-averse policy -- containment, humanitarian assistance, helping to organize and supply certain rebel groups, and keeping open the possibility of a political track -- is absolutely right. The administration should continue to ignore its critics' call for a more assertive policy, particularly if after a failed Geneva conference, there are calls for military action. Here's why:
@highlight
Aaron Miller: Even if Geneva talks fail, U.S. shouldn't intervene in Syria conflict
@highlight
Syria is a tragedy but Obama has followed the right course, Miller says
@highlight
He says president has rightly concluded that U.S. can't resolve the conflict
@highlight
Miller: Preventing a war over Iran's nuclear program is a higher priority for U.S.

Query: There's no evidence to support this, but I have a strong suspicion that the decision not to respond to Syria's use of chemical weapons with military force was partly shaped by this calculation, particularly the possibility that U.S. military action might have killed Iranian forces in Syria, or to be sure increased not ameliorated tensions at a time the administration was already involved in secret talks with the mullahs who control @placeholder.
