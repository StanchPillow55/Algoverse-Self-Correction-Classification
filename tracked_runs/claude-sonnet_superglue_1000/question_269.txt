Question:
Passage: At least half a dozen Conservative Cabinet ministers would opt for Britain to leave the EU on the current terms of membership, senior party sources claim. The mood at the top of the party has hardened ahead of David Cameron’s proposed negotiation of looser ties with Brussels, followed by an in/out referendum by 2017 if he remains in power after the next election. Three ministers – Philip Hammond, Michael Gove and Oliver Letwin – have suggested publicly that they would back an exit unless significant changes can be secured. At least three others are understood to be of a similar view.
