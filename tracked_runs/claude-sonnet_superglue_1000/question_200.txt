Question:
Passage: One million worshippers from all over the world have gathered in Rome ahead of the ‘unprecedented’ double canonisation of two former popes. Over the last 24 hours, crowds have arrived and camped out in Vatican City ahead of the canonisation of Popes John Paul II and John XXIII at St Peter’s Square. The ceremony, to be held later today, will be an unprecedented event in Catholic history, as two living Popes will be in attendance – the current Pope Francis I and Benedict XVI, who stood down last year and now holds the title Pope Emeritus.
