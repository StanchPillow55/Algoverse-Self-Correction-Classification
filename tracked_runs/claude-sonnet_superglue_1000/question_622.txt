Question:
Passage: Crews have found the bodies of the Turkish pilots killed in last month's downing of their jet by Syria, an incident that prompted an outbreak of hostile rhetoric between the two nations that continued Wednesday. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, in an interview published in the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriyet Wednesday, lambasted Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan for interfering in Syrian internal politics. And Turkey's foreign minister disputed some of al-Assad's assertions Tuesday about the downing of the jet. Syria shot down the F-4 Turkish Phantom jet on June 22, intensifying the animosity between the countries, whose once-close relationship has eroded since the al-Assad regime begain cracking down on opposition forces 16 months ago.
