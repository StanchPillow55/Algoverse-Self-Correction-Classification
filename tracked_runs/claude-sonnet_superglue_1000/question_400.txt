Question:
Passage: JOHNSTOWN, Pennsylvania (CNN)  -- Located outside a small Pennsylvania city, John Murtha airport may not see many passengers. But it's seen plenty of arrivals of tax dollars from Washington, most recently economic stimulus funds. Democratic Rep. John Murtha says it's his job to direct federal funds to his district in Pennsylvania. The airport offers three commercial flights. In between the arrivals and departures, airport officials admit there are few faces around the facility. "When the flights are coming in, there are people. Other than that, it's empty," said Scott Voelker, manager of the John Murtha Johnstown-Cambria County Airport. But one face is everywhere. Rep. John Murtha, the airport's namesake, is hard to miss.
