Passage: Washington (CNN) -- The State Department condemned Iran's persecution of religious minorities on Friday following the Iranian authorities' detention of Baha'is and Christians in recent months.

Iranians have also recently detained more than a dozen Christians, according to the State Department. "The United States is increasingly concerned about the Iran's ongoing persecution of Baha'is and other religious minority communities," said Philip J.
