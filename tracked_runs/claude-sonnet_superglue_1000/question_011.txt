Passage: By Rachel Reilly PUBLISHED: 03:39 EST, 26 August 2013 | UPDATED: 08:45 EST, 26 August 2013 A photographer has captured candid and incredibly moving photographs of teenage triplets, all of whom suffer from autism. Over the course of two years, José Antonio de Lamadrid, 50, from Seville, has followed three 18-year-old brothers who were all born with the same complex neurological disorder. Mr Lamadrid wanted to follow Alejandro, Álvaro and Jaime Morillo  Aguilar because he was fascinated and touched by their interaction.
