Question:
Passage: One of the men suspected of beheading American journalist Daniel Pearl more than a decade ago has been released from a Pakistani jail. Qari Hashim Ali, who had been detained since August 2005, walked free from the Hyderabad central jail on Friday after an anti-terrorist court said there was not enough evidence to hold him. 'It is a great victory for truth and my client,' defense counsel, Sher Muhammad Leghari said, the Indian Express reported. 'We had filed an acquittal plea... arguing that there was no evidence.' Pearl, the South Asia bureau chief at the Wall Street Journal, vanished in Karachi in January 2002. A month later authorities received video footage of him being beheaded.
