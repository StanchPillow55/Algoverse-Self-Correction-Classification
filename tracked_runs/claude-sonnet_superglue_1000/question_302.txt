Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- On the afternoon of August 3, a graying, slightly paunchy, well-dressed man in a mask and carrying a baseball bat strolled into the bedroom of an 18-year-old Australian woman studying for a school exam. He strapped something that seemed to be a bomb to her neck and told her not to move. Then he left. With that, a man police now identify as Paul Douglas Peters, 50, touched off a baffling international investigation that eventually reached 9,317 miles across the ocean to Buckner, Kentucky, where an FBI team arrested Peters on Monday. Authorities say Peters attempted to extort money from Madeleine Pulver's family in suburban Sydney by fastening a black box around her neck that he said in a note contained "powerful new technology plastic explosives" that would go off if she did not follow his instructions, according to a complaint for provisional arrest filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Louisville.
