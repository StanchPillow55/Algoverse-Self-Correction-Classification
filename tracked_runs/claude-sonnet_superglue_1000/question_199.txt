Passage: By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 12:44 EST, 26 October 2012 | UPDATED: 12:46 EST, 26 October 2012 A New York programmer who sued Facebook claiming 50 per cent of its ownership has been arrested in what's now being called a multibillion-dollar scheme. Paul Ceglia, 39, was arrested on Friday at his Wellsville, New York home after federal prosecutors say he fabricated and destroyed evidence to falsely support his case against Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said Ceglia was seeking a 'quick payday based on a blatant forgery.'
