Question:
Passage: Finally: A settlement has been reached over the $300 million estate of late heiress, Huguette Clark The vicious battle over the $300 million estate of late copper heiress Huguette Clark has been settled out of court at the eleventh hour - leaving her faithful nurse with nothing. The 40-page settlement was signed moments before jury selection was to begin on Tuesday and the judge in Surrogate's Court in Lower Manhattan accepted the deal, ruling out a trial. Clark, who was the daughter of former U.S. Senator William Clark, died aged 104 in May 2011 and 19 of her distant relatives have been battling over the fortune ever since. Clark had written two wills in 2005 and the relatives claimed she was not lucid when she wrote the second, which cut them out.
