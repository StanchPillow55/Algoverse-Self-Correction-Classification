Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- A U.S. citizen injured in a 1997 suicide bombing in Jerusalem is claiming money from the Warwick New York Hotel, which will host Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for the upcoming annual U.N. assembly, the man's lawyer says. Stuart Hersh was in a mall when the Hamas terrorist organization carried out the attack. In 2003, a U.S. District Court awarded Hersh $12 million from the Iranian government, ruling it was responsible for supplying and training the suicide bombers. Hersh says he never received money from Iran. "We want to be entitled to the money of Ahmadinejad and his delegations," Hersh's lawyer, Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, told CNN. "We believe it belongs to us as a judgment holder."
