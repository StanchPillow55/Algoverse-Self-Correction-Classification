Question:
Passage: New York (CNN) -- The American "sport" of competitive eating capped off its signature battle royale in New York on Wednesday with the apparent triumph of two defending champions. Joey "Jaws" Chestnut and Sonya "The Black Widow" Thomas each fended off would-be challengers during Nathan's annual hot dog-eating competition in Brooklyn. In an event likely to repulse most vegetarians, Chestnut tied his record by scarfing down 68 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes. It marks the California native's sixth win at the competition, tying his former rival, Japanese eating icon Takeru Kobayashi, who did not compete due to a contract dispute.
