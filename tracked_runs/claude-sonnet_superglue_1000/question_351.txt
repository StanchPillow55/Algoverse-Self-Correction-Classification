Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The Olympic journey of Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings ended where it all began: In the sand. Minutes after winning their third consecutive Olympic gold medal in women's beach volleyball on Wednesday, the American duo announced an end to what is considered one of the winningest partnerships of the Games. May-Treanor, 35, and Walsh Jennings, 33, made history by putting away fellow Americans April Ross and Jennifer Kessy in two sets, 21-16, 21-16, to extend their undefeated streak in three successive Games to 21-0. They lost only one of 43 sets. "Beach volleyball is not going to be my career anymore," May-Traenor told reporters shortly after the match. "It's time for me to be a wife. I want to be a mom. I want to share this time with my family.
