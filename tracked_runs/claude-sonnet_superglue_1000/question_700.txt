Question:
Passage: By Pete Jenson Follow @@petejenson Cristiano Ronaldo scored goal number 255 in his 250th game for Real Madrid but there were some whistles of discontent at Carlo Ancelotti’s side as they struggled to beat newly promoted Cordoba – a team who finished seventh in the second division last season. Ronaldo’s late spectacular second for the European Champions after Karim Benzema’s first half strike put a gloss on what was a far from convincing first home performance of the season. Discontent over the sale of Angel Di Maria, defeat in the Spanish Super Cup against Atletico Madrid, and the failure to sign Radamel Falcao increased the pressure on the European Champions to put on a show but they toiled for large parts against plucky minnows Cordoba. They might even have been pegged back at 1-1 had former Newcastle striker Xisco’s second half goal not been rubbed out for offside.
