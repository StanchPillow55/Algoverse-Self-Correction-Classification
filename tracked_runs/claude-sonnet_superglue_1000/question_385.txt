Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Jorge Lorenzo extended his MotoGP series lead to 20 points after winning the Catalunya Grand Prix for the second time in his top-level motorcycling career. The Yamaha rider started Sunday's race from second on the grid, but outshone Honda's polesitter Casey Stoner as the reigning world champion lost more ground in the overall standings after finishing fourth. It was Lorenzo's third victory in five races this season, and second in a row after winning at Le Mans last month. He was runner-up in his two other MotoGP starts at Montmelo, and also won there with Aprilia in the 250cc class.
