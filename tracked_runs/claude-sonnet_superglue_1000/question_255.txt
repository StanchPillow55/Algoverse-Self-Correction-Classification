Question:
Passage: Ryder Cup winner Lee Westwood has criticised the United States team for airing 'dirty laundry in public' after their defeat at Gleneagles last month. In the immediate wake of Europe's 16 1/2 to 11 1/2 victory, American veteran Phil Mickelson openly criticised the captaincy of Tom Watson, sat a few feet away from him, at the post-tournament press conference. That has led to a fortnight of apologies, inquests and soul-searching about what can be done to end the European dominance of the event. The USA team were convincingly beaten by Europe in the 2014 Ryder Cup 'I think it's a little bit disappointing to see the dirty laundry being out in public,' said Westwood, back on American soil playing in the PGA Tour's Frys.com Open in California this week.
