Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- Bill Clinton has never had a problem getting into the muck of politics. Since leaving the White House in 2001 and stepping into the role of the Democrats' elder statesman, the former President has continually shown why he rose from humble roots in rural Arkansas to president of the United States in the first place: his political chops and willingness to use them. So when Karl Rove, the uber-Republican strategist, floated questions about Hillary Clinton's health, it was no surprise that Bill Clinton was the one to respond from "Clintonland," not Hillary. "I've got to give him credit," Clinton said of Rove on Wednesday at an event in Washington. "That embodies that old saying that consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. First they said she faked her concussion. And now they say she's auditioning for a part on 'The Walking Dead.'"
