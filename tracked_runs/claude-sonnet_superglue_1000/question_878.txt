Question:
Passage: There will come a time, in a 100 years from now, when England supporters will cast their eyes over Wayne Rooney’s records and wonder what all the fuss was about. Injury-permitting the England forward is on course to break Peter Shilton’s record of 125 caps some time in 2017 (at the very latest).
