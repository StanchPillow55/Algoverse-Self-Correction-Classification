Question:
Passage: Canton, Georgia (CNN) -- New details emerged Thursday in the brutal slaying of a 7-year-old Georgia girl, hours after an attorney for the suspect said his client would plead not guilty. Seven-year-old Jorelys Rivera's mouth was duct-taped, and her hands and feet were bound with plastic ties, a source close to the investigation said. Authorities have charged 20-year-old maintenance worker Ryan Brunn with killing Jorelys, who was last seen alive Friday near a playground at the apartment complex where he worked in Canton, Georgia. They found her mangled body in a trash compactor there three days later, the source said.
