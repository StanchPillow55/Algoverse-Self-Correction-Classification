Question:
Passage: Since The Bridge disappeared from our screens in February in a flurry of betrayal, dead bodies and elaborate plot twists, it's been a frustrating time for fans of Scandi Noir. What was in the files that Danish detective Martin Rohde saw that related to the childhood of his blunt-speaking Swedish colleague Saga Noren? Is Martin himself guilty of murder? Scandinavian suspense: Sofia Helin stars as Saga Noren in the brilliant cross-border drama The Bridge And does the temperature ever rise above freezing in this corner of Scandinavia? The good news is that we won't have to wait too much longer to find out. Filming for a third series of the BBC4 hit is under way, so there was only one thing to do - head to the scene of the crime.
