Question:
Passage: Baghdad (CNN) -- About 400 members of an exiled Iranian opposition group who are the first to leave a long-term camp in Iraq under a U.N. plan criticized their treatment and the conditions at the new temporary site Saturday. The group left Camp Ashraf at midnight following 12 hours of inspections and checks, Shahin Gobadi of the National Council of Resistance of Iran said in a statement. When they arrived seven hours later at the new site, a former U.S. military base near Baghdad International Airport called Camp Liberty, the group discovered a heavy presence of police. Another inspection was then demanded, prompting the residents to protest what they consider "degrading, humiliating and inhumane treatment" and the obstructive behavior of the Iraqi forces by refusing to leave the transit buses, Gobadi said.
