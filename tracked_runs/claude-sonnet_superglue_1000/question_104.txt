Passage: By Daily Mail Reporter Last updated at 5:04 PM on 21st June 2011 New details have emerged of how seriously the British government was bracing itself for a full scale nuclear crisis in the wake of Japan's Fukushima disaster. Documents show how advisers rushed to work out how bad the crisis might get, and the plans drawn up for 'the worst case scenario' to protect British citizens - including the British Embassy in Tokyo issuing iodine pills to expats and visitors in the capital and Sendai, 70 miles from Fukushima. The government's emergency committee Cobra were also on standby to screen passengers landing at Heathrow from Japan for radioactive contamination, it has been revealed.
