Question:
Passage: By Associated Press Reporter Scientists have developed a new battery-powered defibrillator that can be implanted under the skin to shock failing hearts back to life. S-CID, or the subcutaneous internal cardioverter-defibrillator, is implanted in the chest and analyses the heart's rhythm via a sensor without having to pierce any area of the organ at all. The device can then deliver 80 joules to the chest wall, 'much like you see on a television shows where a doctor will say, "Stat," and shock a patient with paddles,' said Dr. Manoj Panday, director of cardiac electrophysiology at the University of Texas Health Science Center.
