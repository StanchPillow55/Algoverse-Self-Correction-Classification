Question:
Passage: A British millionaire businessman who has spent 28 years in prison – including 15 years on Death Row – for a double murder because of an ‘epic miscarriage of justice’ spoke of his despair yesterday after a Florida judge crushed his hope of freedom. Kris Maharaj, 75, who is in poor health, believed he was on the verge of release because of sensational new evidence showing that the men he was convicted of killing at a Miami hotel in 1986 – father and son Derrick and Duane Moo Young – were actually executed by a Colombian drug cartel. But despite statements from key members of the cartel, including cocaine king Pablo Escobar’s former hitman, Maharaj’s appeal was rejected last week. His earliest possible release date remains 2040.
