Question:
Passage: (The Frisky) -- As a reality TV fiend, I assumed that "Top Chef: Just Desserts" was going to be totally vanilla. Oh, how wrong I was. Throughout the season, pastry chef Seth Caro has had some serious drama with assorted meltdowns and crocodile tears brought on by such tragedies as the fact that there were no more grapefruits in the kitchen. But this week's episode was beyond. Seth got so worked up after being told he couldn't make ice cream from scratch during a "Quickfire" challenge that he had a full-blown panic attack, saying he was leaving and screaming at the producers.
@highlight
Seth Caro and Malika Ameen left "Top Chef: Just Desserts" this week
@highlight
Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt left "I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here" three times
@highlight
Cassandra Whitehead left "America's Next Top Model" instead of getting a haircut

Query: They returned once again but when @placeholder got a stomach illness, they finally left for good.
