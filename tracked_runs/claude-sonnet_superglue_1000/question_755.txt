Question:
Passage: San Diego, California (CNN) -- In Washington, a lot of the meetings that take place between lawmakers amount to nothing. But recently, there was a get-together that was really something. The participants: Reps. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, and Charles Gonzales, D-Texas, along with Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, and Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey. The problem: What this country should do with so-called DREAM'ers, undocumented young people who were brought here by their parents as children and who face the threat of deportation. One proposed solution that didn't go anywhere was the DREAM Act, a bill that politicians passed around like a hot potato for more than a decade. It would offer legal status and a pathway to citizenship to anyone who goes to college or joins the military.
@highlight
Latino legislators met recently to seek progress on status of "DREAM'ers"
@highlight
Ruben Navarrette says it's encouraging that they're talking about a compromise
@highlight
He asks: Will political parties let that happen, or kill it to preserve a campaign issue?
@highlight
Navarrette: Marco Rubio's proposal isn't perfect but it does show progress

Query: Rubio might have enough leverage within his party to persuade some Republicans who voted against the old DREAM Act to support @placeholder 2.0.
