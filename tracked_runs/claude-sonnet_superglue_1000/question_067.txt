Question:
Passage: Forget everything you know about cake cutting; this new method could turn the seemingly straight-forward practice on its head. Although, using the word ‘new’ isn’t accurate, because the method is actually a 100-year-old trick unearthed by London-based author and mathematician Alex Bellos. In his latest YouTube video, Bellos describes how taking wedges out of cakes leaves them susceptible to drying - and we should instead be cutting them in lines so the whole cake can be sealed and stored. In a video for YouTube channel Numberphile, British mathematician Alex Bellos explained the best way to scientifically and mathematically cut a cake (shown). By cutting it in parallel lines, rather than in wedges the cake can more easily be stored without going dry, Bellos said

London mathematician Alex Bellos describes the trick in a YouTube video
@highlight
The method involves cutting parallel lines rather than wedges
@highlight
This allows the cake to be sealed with icing around it, keeping it fresh
@highlight
Francis Galton first described the innovative method in Nature in 1906
@highlight
And Bellos said the 'nice uniform slice is a lot better' than wedge-cutting

Query: Titled ‘Cutting a round cake on scientific principles’, @placeholder’s letter explained how the ‘ordinary method of cutting out a wedge is very faulty’.
