Question:
Passage: By Mike Dickson for MailOnline A stunned Heather Watson was at a loss to explain her crushing first round US Open defeat after a summer which had promised a decent run at the year's final Grand Slam. As it was the 22-year-old Channel Islander lasted just 54 minutes of the morning session before going down 6-1 6-1 to world number 81 Sorana Cirstea of Romania, who she had beaten three times before.
