Question:
Passage: Chelsea have resumed talks to bring Atletico Madrid left-back Filipe Luis to Stamford Bridge. The 28-year-old emerged as a target for the Blues, who are looking to replace Ashley Cole, and the Brazilian's performances this season have brought him to the attention of the London club. Atletico's defence conceded just 26 goals in 38 La Liga games as they won the title for the first time since 1996 and Luis was an integral part of that feat. Impressive: Filipe Luis (right) has been part of the Atletico side that have done so well this season Focused: Luis said that he is thinking only of Atletico and Brazil at the moment
@highlight

Query: @placeholder has a buy-out clause of Â£19.4million and  though Chelsea are negotiating, they have other options.
