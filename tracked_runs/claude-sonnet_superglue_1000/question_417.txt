Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- Latino support for Democratic candidates remains strong, with 65 percent of registered Hispanic voters saying they plan to vote for the Democrat in their congressional district in next month's midterm elections, the Pew Hispanic Center said in a report Tuesday. But Latino voters appear less motivated than other voters. About one-third of Latino voters say they have given this election "a lot of thought," while half of U.S. registered voters say they have, Pew said. In a further challenge to Democrats, the nationwide Pew poll found that Republican Latino registered voters may be more likely to vote than Democrats. About 44 percent of Latino Republicans say they have given the election quite a lot of thought compared with 28 percent of Latino Democrats, the Pew report said.
