Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- If your passport is gathering dust and your suitcase desperately needs a workout, don't throw away thoughts of a thrilling vacation just because your wallet doesn't match your wanderlust. Supply and demand dictate pricing in nearly every industry, and travel is no exception. When things are less than perfect, they cost less. So Europe is cheaper in the fall, when the weather can be sketchy and the landscape isn't quite as alluring. When school's in session, it's a challenge to take the kids out of class, but your Disney vacation will be a lot less expensive. In addition to costing less, these trips have other perks: A theme park with fewer crowds means that your kids are more likely to get some face time with Mickey and Cinderella. And if you opt for Europe right after Thanksgiving, you'll be there during prime time for the Christmas markets.

You'll find savings, maybe even winnings, in Sin City in the summer

Query: One of the cheapest times to pack your bags is just around the corner: It starts about the same time the final leftovers from Thanksgiving are gobbled up and lasts until just before the airports fill up with @placeholder travelers.
