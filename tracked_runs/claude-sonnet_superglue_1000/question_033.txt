Question:
Passage: By Pete Jenson Follow @@petejenson It’s being called ‘the Champions against the Champions’ as European Cup holders Real Madrid and La Liga conquerors Atletico Madrid get ready to face each other in the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday. Cristiano Ronaldo is back from two weeks rest, Gareth Bale is fresh from scoring twice for Wales, and despite the fact that Sergio Ramos and Iker Casillas were sharing jokes with Atletico rivals Koke and Juanfran on Wednesday night as they watched Spain crash out of the Basketball World Cup together, the rivals are ready to rumble again on Saturday just three weeks after they clashed in a heated Spanish Super Cup double header.
