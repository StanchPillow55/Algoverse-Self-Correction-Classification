Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- General Motor's own investigation may be over, but Congress has just begun. CNN has learned from Republican and Democratic sources that the House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to hold hearings this month on how the automaker allowed fatally flawed ignition switches to remain inside vehicles for years. The Senate won't be far behind. Sen. Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri whose subcommittee is handling the issue, announced Thursday that she, too, would hold a hearing this summer. The push for hearings is one of many signs that even as GM put its internal investigation to rest Thursday, lawmakers have not made up their minds about how the company handled the problem, whether there could be criminal wrongdoing, and what are the company's responsibilities to victims from its mistake.
