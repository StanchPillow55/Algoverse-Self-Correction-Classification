Question:
Passage: Sarah Wagner's interest in American manufacturing began with a family road trip. She and her husband loaded up their motor home in summer 2011 and visited small towns across the country whose fate seemed to be tied to the presence of industry. Where plants and factories had closed down, they found empty main streets with boarded-up storefronts. In other places, such as Forest City, Iowa, home to the Winnebago factory, they found vibrant communities where they could tour manufacturing facilities and witness the pride employees took in their work. When the trip was over, she started a Twitter account to share resources for all things made stateside. As USA Love List has evolved into a website, Wagner has learned that even though she can find plenty of goods made in the United States, it's impossible to live off them.
