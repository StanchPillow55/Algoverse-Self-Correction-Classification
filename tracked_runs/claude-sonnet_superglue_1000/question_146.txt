Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The opening stage of the Tour de France in Corsica Saturday descended into chaos after a team bus became trapped under the finishing gantry in Bastia. As organizers desperately tried to free the bus, the 213km leg from Porto-Vecchio was initially shortened to finish at the three kilometers to go mark. With teams trying to bring their star sprinters to the front of the peloton earlier than expected, a big crash saw Britain's Mark Cavendish and Slovakian Peter Sagan and some of the race favorites held up. At the same time, the bus, belonging to Australian team Orica GreenEdge was finally removed and the original finish line was reinstated.
