Question:
Passage: Donald Sterling, the National Basketball Association team owner who was hit last week by charges of racism, used his charitable foundation to steer at least $135,000 to charities that focus on African-American issues â€“ including the Museum of Tolerance. A voice purported to be that of Sterling, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers franchise, was recorded in a racist rant chastising his reported mistress for associating publicly with black people. But through the Donald T. Sterling Foundation, which he set up in 2007, he donated $30,000 to the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles, and $50,000 each to the United Negro College Fund and the Black Business Association of Los Angeles.
@highlight
The Donald T. Sterling Charitable Foundation made the donations between 2009 and 2012
@highlight
$30,000 to the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles, $50,000 each to the city's Black Business Association and the United Negro College Fund
@highlight
None of those groups has publicly criticized Sterling since a recording of a racist rant, allegedly in his voice, surfaced Friday
@highlight
The United Negro College Fund says it won't give back the money
@highlight
The tape's release may be revenge by Sterling's alleged mistress, who is being sued for more than $1.8 million by his wife

Query: 'All funds raised by @placeholder are used to provide scholarships to help get minority students to and through school and we would never ask the student to return the money.'
