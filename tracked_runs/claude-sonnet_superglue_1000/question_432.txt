Question:
Passage: A possible split between old and new FIFA executive committee members has emerged ahead of the vote on Friday on whether the Garcia report into World Cup bidding should be published. It follows a suggestion by FIFA president Sepp Blatter at the previous ExCo meeting that only those members who were on the committee for the 2010 vote should have a say on the report's publication. That would rule out more than half the current members and if Blatter tries to resurrect the move at the meeting in Marrakesh on Friday he is likely to face sustained opposition. FIFA's executive committee members are due to vote on the publication of Michael Garcia's corruption report
