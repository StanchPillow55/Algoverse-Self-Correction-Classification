Question:
Passage: By Chris Wheeler Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak has shrugged off the limitations of a £49million transfer cap by revealing that the new Premier League champions are well on the way to landing their summer transfer targets. City want to sign defender Bacary Sagna on a free transfer from Arsenal and retain a strong interest in £35m-rated FC Porto defender Eliaquim Mangala and his teammate Fernando despite an UEFA punishment for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations. As well as having their net spending capped, City's wage bill has also been frozen although £200,000-a-week will be freed up after Khaldoon confirmed that Gareth Barry and Joleon Lescott are not being offered new contracts.
