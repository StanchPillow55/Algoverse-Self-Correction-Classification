Question:
Passage: Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius is a heartbroken man who has to live with the fact that he killed the love of his life, his uncle has told CNN in an exclusive interview. For the past three months, the double amputee sprinter has been living at his Uncle Arnold's house in Pretoria. He has grown a beard because he doesn't want to be recognized, and has surrounded himself with photos of Reeva Steenkamp, his uncle says. Pistorius is charged with murdering the 29-year-old model and law school graduate early on February 14, and faces a court hearing next Tuesday.
