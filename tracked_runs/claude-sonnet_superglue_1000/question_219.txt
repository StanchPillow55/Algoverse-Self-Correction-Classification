Question:
Passage: Singing competition shows like "American Idol" and "The Voice" don't only make stars, they rehabilitate them. Just ask Jennifer Lopez, whose seat at the "American Idol" judges' table paved the way for the success of her 2011 album and her recently announced summer tour. Or Maroon 5, who benefited greatly from frontman Adam Levine's spot on "The Voice." Even his fellow "Voice" judge, Christina Aguilera, cashed in on the group's best-selling single "Moves Like Jagger." But for a megawatt star like Britney Spears, who already experienced a comeback of sorts in 2008 with the release of "Circus" not long after her fall from grace, a judging and mentoring gig on "The X Factor" isn't needed to sell albums.
@highlight
Spears joins the Fox singing competition still riding the success of her seventh studio album
@highlight
Source: Being a mainstay on the show could bring a level of fame she hasn't had in years
@highlight
Spears hasn't been accessible to her fans since she was placed in a conservatorship

Query: You have to feel like that's @placeholder saying what Britney wants to say.
