Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- ABC is beginning its reconstruction of "The View" by bringing back Rosie O'Donnell, one of the most famous co-hosts from the talk show's history. O'Donnell will rejoin the talk show in the fall, according to a Twitter message from the show's main account. The announcement confirmed a TMZ report this week. ABC previously announced that of all the current co-hosts, Whoopi Goldberg would be the only one back for the coming season. Barbara Walters signed off in May, and two others, Jenny McCarthy and Sherri Shepherd, are going to depart this summer. O'Donnell didn't immediately comment on the announcement. On Twitter, she posted a photo of her family vacationing in Florida.
