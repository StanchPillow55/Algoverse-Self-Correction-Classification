Question:
Passage: New York (CNN) -- A Bronx Supreme Court Judge dismissed on Wednesday the manslaughter indictment against New York Police Officer Richard Haste, who fatally shot an unarmed teenager in 2012. Judge Steven Barrett threw out the case based on instructions given by the prosecution to the grand jury regarding communications among officers before the shooting, attorneys on both sides of the case confirmed. "The whole defense against Officer Haste is, what his state of mind was prior to discharging his weapon one time," said Stuart London, Haste's attorney. The original indictment alleges that Haste acted "recklessly" and ultimately killed 18-year-old Ramarley Graham while "acting with intent to cause serious physical injury ... by shooting him."
