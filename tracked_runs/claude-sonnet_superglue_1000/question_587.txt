Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- What started out as Chelsea's worst season since owner Roman Abramovich arrived in 2003 is now on the verge of becoming one of the English club's best. Saturday's FA Cup final success, the London side's fourth in six years in the world's oldest football competition, is the latest step in a revival that could end in the realization of the Russian billionaire's longheld dream. The nailbiting 2-1 victory at Wembley is but a tasty precursor to a Champions League final in Munich on May 19 that offers the chance for Abramovich to finally win Europe's top club prize.
@highlight
Chelsea win English FA Cup for the seventh time, beating Liverpool 2-1 in Saturday's final
@highlight
Ramires and Didier Drogba score in each half before Andy Carroll reduces the deficit
@highlight
Substitute Carroll goes close to equalizer as his header is cleared from under the bar
@highlight
Victory boosts Chelsea ahead of UEFA Champions League final in Munich on May 19

Query: Each team will get a reported $66 million for making the final, when television money is added to the prize total on offer, representing a major budgetary boost for a club like Chelsea -- which under the new regulations can no longer rely on @placeholder's deep pockets.
