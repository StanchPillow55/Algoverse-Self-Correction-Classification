Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Do you believe in second chances? It would appear that those wearing the green and white of Celtic do. Having been handed a brutal beating by Polish side Legia Warsaw in the third qualifying round of the Champions League, Celtic's European adventure appeared to be over before it had started. A 4-1 defeat in the Polish capital was followed by a 2-0 home defeat -- a result which should have sent Legia through to the playoff stage. Except it didn't. Instead, UEFA, the game's European governing body, was called in to rule over claims Legia had fielded an ineligible player during the tie.
