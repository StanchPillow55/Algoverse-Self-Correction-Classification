Question:
Passage: West Brom boss Alan Irvine insists there is no point in Saido Berahino 'sulking' about his recent England snub. The in-form youngster was selected in Roy Hodgson's squad for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia and friendly against Scotland. However, he ended up kicking his heels on the bench for both games rather than getting his senior debut, with tried-and-tested veteran Rickie Lambert even preferred as a late substitute at Celtic Park. Saido Berahino and Ross Barkley watch England take on Slovenia from the substitutes bench at Wembley Irvine believes Berahino will still benefit from the experience and hopes the forward reacts positively to the disappointment.
