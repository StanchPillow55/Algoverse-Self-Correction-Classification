Question:
Passage: By Jeff Powell Follow @@jeffpowell_Mail George Groves is likening himself to a naughty boy in the back seat of a car annoying to distraction the driver, who in this metaphorical case is Carl Froch. This is a cute analogy for their roles in the build up to the slugfest to be played out at Wembley Stadium on Saturday night to the guttural sound-track of an expectant 80,000, the largest boxing crowd in post-war Britain. It is also another amusing sample of the witty, intelligent mind games which Groves has been bringing to the ring’s biggest Battles of Britain since Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank went at it in the early Nineties.
