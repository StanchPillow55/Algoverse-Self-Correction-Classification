Question:
Passage: (CNN)One night in early October 2014 I woke up at 2 a.m. and began watching Vital Signs on CNN International. The show was about the future of cancer treatment through immunotherapy -- a topic close to my heart. In 2012, I was diagnosed with stage 3c ovarian cancer, at age 52. As I watched Dr. Sanjay Gupta interview doctors, researchers and two patients at Yale New Haven Medical Center/Smilow Cancer Center, I decided, then and there, that I wanted to be in a research trial. Some days in our lives are memorable. We all prefer the good days, marriages, births, and graduations. June 8, 2012 was not one of those days for me. That was the day I was diagnosed. I went immediately from being a lawyer, mother, and wife -- taking care of everyone -- to being a professional patient.
