Question:
Passage: San Diego, California (CNN) -- Billionaire Warren Buffett has been thinking about the inequities in the U.S. tax system at least since June 2007. I know this because, during PBS' Democratic presidential debate in which I served on a panel of journalists, I asked the eight Democrats, including Barack Obama, what they thought of comments Buffett had made about the unfairness of a tax system where his secretary paid a higher percentage of her income in taxes than he did. I asked Obama if he agreed with Buffett that the rich weren't paying their fair share, and what he would do about it.

Ruben Navarrette: Gallup Poll finds majority favor raising taxes on corporations and the rich
@highlight
"Buffett Rule" would set minimum tax rate for people earning more than $1 million a year
@highlight
Navarrette says this is an election gimmick because Obama knows it won't pass
@highlight
Navarrette: In a fair system, everyone would pay the same percentage of income in taxes

Query: It's no wonder that public opinion polls consistently show that @placeholder want the rich to pay more.
