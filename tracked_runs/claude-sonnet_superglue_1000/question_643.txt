Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- The shocking murder last weekend of 16 Afghan civilians -- 9 of them children -- by a U.S. soldier is raising many questions about the war. Coming right after the accidental burning of several Qurans at a U.S. base last month, which sparked mass protests across the country, it seems reasonable to ask: what is coming next? The sad answer is that there probably won't be a huge public reaction to the killings. The burning of the Qurans -- which the U.S. claims was accidental -- was a fresh outrage to many Afghans. While the Taliban often claims the U.S. disrespects Islam and wants to destroy it, few Afghans had any real reason to believe that in their daily lives. The Quran burning shocked the Afghan public enough for some political opportunists to whip up protests in response.
