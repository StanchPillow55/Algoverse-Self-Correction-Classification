Question:
Passage: (CNN)  -- Petra Kvitova stunned Maria Sharapova in straight sets 6-3 6-4 to claim the  Wimbledon women's singles title Saturday. The 21-year-old had gone into the final as the underdog against three-time grand slam champion Sharapova, but belied that status with a high-class display on Centre Court. She is the third Czech woman, after Martina Navratilova and Jana Novotna, to claim the Wimbledon singles crown. Both were in the Royal Box to witness her triumph and Kvitova paid them both a compliment as she savored her victory. "It's hard to find some words, to see the great players in the Royal Box," said Kvitova, the first left-hander since Navratilova in 1990 to win the title.
