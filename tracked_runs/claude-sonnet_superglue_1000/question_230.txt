Question:
Passage: By Chris Greenwood, Crime Reporter PUBLISHED: 16:49 EST, 31 March 2013 | UPDATED: 18:21 EST, 31 March 2013 Police officers are pocketing more than £20million a year in personal injury claims. They are instructing ‘ambulance-chasing’ lawyers to sue over mishaps on duty such as slips, trips and animal attacks. Officers are being encouraged to make the claims by a hotline run by the Police Federation. Much of the £42million paid out over the past two years is taxpayer-funded. WPC Kelly Jones, left, is suing burglary victim Steve Jones, right, after she tripped on a 6in kerb at his garage, pictured, while investigating a break-in
