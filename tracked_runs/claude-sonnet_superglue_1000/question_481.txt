Question:
Passage: By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 20:20 EST, 11 May 2012 | UPDATED: 21:28 EST, 11 May 2012 FBI agents discovered only two guns while raiding the house of a reputed Connecticut mobster suspected of having information about the 1990 robbery of a Boston museum that remains the largest art heist in history. The mystery deepens after yesterday's search by more than 20 agents in haz-mat suits turned up nothing connected to the art heist. They examined a car in the driveway, searched a wooded area and removed boxes of evidence from the ranch-style suburban home of 75-year-old Robert Gentile, who has been detained since February on federal drug and weapons charges.
