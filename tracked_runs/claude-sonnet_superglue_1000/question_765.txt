Question:
Passage: The summer transfer window in England may be closed until the new year but there are still plenty of stars who are free to a good home. These unattached players can be picked up at any time and plenty of Premier League clubs will have their eyes on a bargain. Arsenal, for instance, still have room for two non-homegrown players to be added to their 25-man squad so Arsene Wenger may yet look to add to it, with experienced defender Mario Yepes potentially worth a punt. There are more than that, of course, and here are Sportsmail's best picks of the free agents...
@highlight
Victor Valdes, Ronaldinho and Mario Yepes are the top free agents on the market following the deadline day drama
@highlight
Despite the transfer window closing on Monday night clubs are still able to add unattached players to their 25-man squad list if they have room to do so
@highlight
Arsenal could still be on the lookout for a defender with experienced Colombian Yepes potentially filling the bill
@highlight
Hugo Almeida is another name who could end up in the Premier League

Query: Silky: @placeholder, two-time world player of the year, still has plenty of skills in his locker
