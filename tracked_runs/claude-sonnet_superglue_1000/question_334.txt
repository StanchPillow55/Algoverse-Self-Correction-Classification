Question:
Passage: By Adam Shergold Follow @@adamjshergold Italy coach Cesare Prandelli's glamorous girlfriend Novella Benini kept a close eye on the progress of the team as they trained on Thursday ahead of their 'Rumble in the Jungle' clash with England. Wearing shades and a baseball cap to keep out the strong Brazilian sun in Mangaratiba, Miss Benini watched on from the sidelines as her partner Prandelli took the session. With two days left, the coach must make a decision over whether to play the in-form striker Ciro Immobile against England in their opening Group D clash at the Arena da Amazonia in Manaus.
