Question:
Passage: Irbil, Iraq (CNN) -- A day after Britain's military launched its first airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq, the question is: Who will be next to join the U.S.-led coalition in its air campaign against the extremists who have seized a swath of Iraq and Syria? As Turkish soldiers and tanks took up position along the border with Syria on Tuesday, Turkey's government put a motion before its Parliament asking for authorization to take military action against ISIS -- the terror group that refers to itself as the Islamic State. Lawmakers are expected to debate the measure in a special session Thursday before voting, according to Anadolu, Turkey's semiofficial news agency.
