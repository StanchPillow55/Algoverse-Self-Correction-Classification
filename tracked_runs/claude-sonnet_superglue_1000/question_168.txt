Question:
Passage: Australian airline passengers who are considering buying a controversial gadget that stops the seat in front of them from reclining will be wasting their money. Australia's largest airline companies, Qantas, Virgin and Jetstar, have confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that the Knee Defender gadget is banned on their flights. The airlines say the American legroom gizmo breaches the same rules that stop people taking drugs and smoking on planes. There has been a surge in global sales for the Knee Defender after a fight between two passengers broke out on a United Airlines jet on August 24. Scroll down for video
@highlight
Surge in sales comes after an incident occurred Sunday on United Airlines Flight 1462 from Newark to Denver in America
@highlight
A male passenger allegedly fastened a Knee Defender to his tray table to work on his laptop
@highlight
The woman in the seat in front complained when she could not recline, tipping water on the man when he refused to remove the gadget
@highlight
The plane made an emergency landing in Chicago and both passengers were kicked off

Query: But @placeholder said it prohibits use of the device, like all major U.S. airlines.
