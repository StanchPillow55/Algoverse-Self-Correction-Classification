Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama indicated a willingness Wednesday to agree to a short-term deal to raise the federal borrowing limit, if Republicans will accept it, a Democratic lawmaker told CNN. The president signaled more "give" to the idea of a six-week deal to hike the debt ceiling during a private White House meeting with House Democrats, said the lawmaker, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The revelation comes amid a stalemate that has Republicans trying to use spending and debt limit deadlines as leverage to wring concessions from Obama and Democrats. The result of the political standoff has been a partial government shutdown that is in its second week and fears of a possible U.S. default on its debt that economists warn could cause another recession.
