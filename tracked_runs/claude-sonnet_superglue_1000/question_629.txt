Question:
Passage: For the first time, prosecutors in the Boston Marathon bombing case confirmed that deceased suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev was accused of participating in a gruesome 2011 triple homicide outside Boston. A federal law enforcement official told CNN back in May that Tsarnaev's involvement in the killings was revealed in an interview between police and Ibragim Todashev, a Chechen known to him. But the detail was not confirmed until this week, when prosecutors in the case against Tamerlan Tsarnaev's brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, made reference to it in a court document filed Monday. In the document, prosecutors argue against a defense request for all documents related to Tamerlan Tsarnaev's participation in the triple slaying.
