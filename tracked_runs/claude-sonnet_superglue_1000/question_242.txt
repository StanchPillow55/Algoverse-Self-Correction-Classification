Question:
Passage: (CNN)He's an unemployed former English Premier League footballer who is desperate to resume his playing career. But while several clubs have signaled their interest in offering convicted rapist Ched Evans a second chance, public opinion in Britain is proving an almost insurmountable stumbling block for the 26-year-old. Since his release from prison after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl, debate has raged as to whether Evans should be allowed to resurrect a high-profile career within the sport. Even the leader of the British Labour Party -- the UK's main opposition political group -- has weighed into the debate, asking whether a sporting role model should be offered a contract by a club.
