Question:
Passage: Liverpool have been dealt a blow in their bid to bring Divock Origi back from Lille after the striker confirmed he will remain in France for the remainder of the season. Brendan Rodgers had given the green light to pay an increase on the £10million fee they agreed with Lille to accelerate Origi’s release in January. The Belgium forward, whom Rodgers believes will be a ‘world-class striker’, joined Liverpool in August but was immediately loaned back to Lille to continue his development before heading to Anfield next summer. Divock Origi (No 17) is congratulated by his Belgium team-mates after scoring against Iceland on Wednesday
