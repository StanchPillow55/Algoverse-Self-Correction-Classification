Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Justine Henin continued her winning return to tennis with a straight sets win over Kazakhstan's Sesil Karatantcheva at the WTA tournament in Brisbane on Wednesday. Henin, who put out second seed Nadia Petrova of Russia in her first round match, secured a 6-4 6-3 victory in one hour 17 minutes to reach the quarterfinals. The former world number one is returning to competitive tennis after an 18-month retirement and targeting the opening grand slam of 2010 at the Australian Open. She made a shaky start as she dropped her opening service game, but broke back and took total control with a second break against the determined qualifier in the eighth game.
