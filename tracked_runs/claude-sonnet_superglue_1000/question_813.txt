Question:
Passage: Pauline Cafferkey (pictured) faces disciplinary action over claims she concealed being unwell when she returned from Africa The nurse who became the first Briton to be diagnosed with ebola in the UK faces disciplinary action over claims she concealed being unwell when she returned from Africa. Pauline Cafferkey, who spent almost a month in an isolation unit in London earlier this year while her life hung in the balance, is one of five medics being investigated. Their ‘fitness to practise’ is being assessed by regulators. According to one unsubstantiated report, a temperature test showed that Ms Cafferkey was over the limit – and others present were aware of it – but the result was not reported.
