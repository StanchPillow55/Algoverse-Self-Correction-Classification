Question:
Passage: Forget coffee, bananas and bio-diversity, for millions of English football fans it was Paulo Wanchope who put Costa Rica on the map. He collected the ball inside his own half, galloped towards the Stretford End with Phil Neville trailing in pursuit, ate up 60 yards and casually rolled the ball past Peter Schmeichel to put Derby two up at Manchester United. It was Wanchopeâ€™s debut in April 1997 and Derby won the game 3-2. Old Trafford was stunned and a nation reached for its atlases. Within a few months, he was shooting the breeze with the Queen as he began a decade of global adventure featuring London, Manchester and Spain, Qatar, Argentina, Japan and the United States.
