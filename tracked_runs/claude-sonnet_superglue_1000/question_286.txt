Question:
Passage: By Deborah Arthurs PUBLISHED: 08:09 EST, 13 August 2012 | UPDATED: 10:03 EST, 13 August 2012 Even the most casual of viewers of the Olympics over the past two weeks could not have failed to spot the luminous yellow trainers that seemed to be worn by almost every athlete at the Games. The unmissable neon footwear dominated at the Olympic track and field events - with the most high profile outing of all being the moment Mo Farah sped to success in the 5,000 and 10,000 metres wearing the yellow spikes - amid a sea of fellow runners wearing identical pairs.
@highlight
Olympic 5,000m and 10,000m champion Farah wore Nike Volt spikes
@highlight
Over 400 more athletes wore footwear from the high-tech Volt collection
@highlight
Marathon shoes are knitted from ultra-lightweight single thread

Query: So not only are the @placeholder's bright yellow - they're green too.
