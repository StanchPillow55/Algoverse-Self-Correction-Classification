Question:
Passage: By Liz Hull PUBLISHED: 16:33 EST, 19 August 2012 | UPDATED: 01:55 EST, 20 August 2012 Like most new mothers, Katie Brown readily admits she is besotted with her baby son. But the 29-year-old has more reason than most to feel blessed by Ethan’s safe arrival – because he is the child she was afraid it would be impossible for her to have. Miss Brown and her partner Adam Holtby, 28, were planning to get married and start a family when their world was turned upside down two years ago.
