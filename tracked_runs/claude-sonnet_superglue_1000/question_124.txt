Question:
Passage: Editor's Note: Matthew Continetti is the associate editor of The Weekly Standard. His book "The Persecution of Sarah Palin" is slated for publication by Penguin Sentinel in the spring of 2010. Sarah Palin's charisma is such that she doesn't need to hold an office to wield influence, Matthew Continetti says. (CNN) -- "Everything changed on August 29 in politics in Alaska," Sarah Palin told NBC's Andrea Mitchell this week. The reference was to the day last year when John McCain announced that Palin, a 44-year-old mother of five who became Alaska's governor only in December 2006, would be his presidential running mate.
