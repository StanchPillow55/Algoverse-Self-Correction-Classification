Question:
Passage: A council has come under fire after sending tenants an 'insulting' newsletter telling them to set aside money for court fine, cigarettes, Sky TV and lottery tickets. Crawley Borough Council sent the advice in a leaflet to thousands of council housing tenants - who reacted with fury at being treated like 'beer-swilling chavs' like TV's Frank Gallagher. The newsletter, which includes a reminder to residents that they have to pay their rent and council tax, was slammed by locals in the Sussex town as 'an insult' offering patronising advice.
