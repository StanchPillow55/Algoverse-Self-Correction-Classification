Question:
Passage: Former Lehman Brothers CFO Erin Callan now says she regrets letting her Wall Street career consume all her time, keeping her from having a personal life The former finance boss of Lehman Brothers has revealed she deeply regrets the sacrifices she made for her job and told working women: 'It's not worth it'. Erin Callan, who was Chief Financial Officer at the bank and one of the most powerful women in finance,  says the price she paid to rise to the top of the male-dominated Wall Street world was too high - and that she regrets not having children. Callan, 47, revealed that the lack of balance in her life led to her divorce from her first husband, because she would never do anything on the weekends except sleep to 'recharge' or get an early start on Monday's meetings.
