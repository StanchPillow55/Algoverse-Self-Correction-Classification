Question:
Passage: (CNN)NASA is sending astronaut Scott Kelly to live on the International Space Station for a year. That's the longest any U.S. astronaut has spent in space and twice as long as crew members usually stay on the space station. A year is a long time to stay anyplace. But staying a year in space has some special challenges. There's what to pack: How many changes of clothes do you bring? Kelly says NASA supplies most of what he needs but he's taking his own tool pouch, some sweatshirts and special shoes to use when he's lifting weights. "I bought a special kind of shoes I thought would be better for that," Kelly said at a NASA briefing on Thursday.
