Question:
Passage: By Dan Bloom and David Williams A judge in Egypt has dismissed 'irrelevant' evidence against three journalists accused of terrorist links after it included footage of donkeys at an animal hospital. The Al Jazeera journalists, including former BBC correspondent Peter Greste, have been paraded in cages charged with altering footage to support the Muslim Brotherhood in a trial which Amnesty International condemned today as a 'vindictive farce'. Today the court watched the first tranche of video evidence found on the journalists' flash drives and computers - which included clips about an animal hospital with donkeys and horses, and footage about Christian life in Egypt.
