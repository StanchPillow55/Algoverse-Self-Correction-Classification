Question:
Passage: By Phil Casey Luke Donald planned to treat himself to a curry after moving into contention for a third BMW PGA Championship title in four years on Friday. Donald carded a superb 67 at Wentworth to finish six under par, four shots behind joint leaders Thomas Bjorn and Shane Lowry and one ahead of the likes of Henrik Stenson and Rory McIlroy. The former world No 1 carded six birdies and an eagle after the weather improved in late afternoon, with a run of five threes in succession from the eighth culminating in an eagle on the 12th. 'When we were warming up the rain was coming down pretty heavy and the wind was blowing hard,' said 2011 and 2012 champion Donald, who would join the likes of Colin Montgomerie, Bernhard Langer and Nick Faldo as three-time champions of the European Tourâ€™s flagship event.
