Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Monday's arrest of five men accused of aiming to bomb an Ohio bridge raises disturbing questions about the attraction to violence of some contemporary anarchists. But it also offers critical lessons to Americans about the nature of the domestic terrorist threat they faceâ€”a threat more diverse in its ideological origins than commonly appreciated. Since 9/11 the country has been concerned primarily with terrorist threats from militants inspired by a violent jihadist ideology, like that associated with al Qaeda. In recent years fears have focused on Muslim "homegrown" terrorism, which typically involves plots in the United States initiated by American residents and citizens who are inspired by jihadi ideology, but lack formal connections to al Qaeda or foreign militant organizations.
@highlight
Risa Brooks says foiled Ohio bombing plot reminder of diversity of U.S. terror
@highlight
She says nowadays Americans mistakenly associate homegrown terror just with jihad
@highlight
She says a 1999-2009 study found most plots white supremacist, anti-government
@highlight
Brooks: It's crucial to focus efforts on extremists of all kinds, not just Islamist

Query: It risks leaving us vulnerable to attacks from other sorts of violent idealogues and promotes a hurtfulâ€”and pointlessâ€”tension between @placeholder-Americans and other Americans.
