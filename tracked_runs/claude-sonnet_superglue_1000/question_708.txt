Question:
Passage: Once upon a time in Manchester, the United left back Patrice Evra made his debut in a derby game across town at City. Hauled off at half-time, the combative little Frenchman reflected colourfully that his first taste of English football had been akin to spending the afternoon ‘in a washing machine’. Years later and not much has changed and another Frenchman has arrived in town to bear witness to the rough and tumble. Eliaquim Mangala is 6ft 2in and looks like he could carry a washing machine on his back. Nevertheless the Manchester City central defender admitted this week that he is only just finding his feet in the Barclays Premier League following an introduction to life in England that has led to some pretty miserable days.
