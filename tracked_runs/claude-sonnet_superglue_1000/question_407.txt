Question:
Passage: Newly published top-secret documents show that the United States government has reimbursed tech companies like Google, Yahoo, Facebook and Microsoft millions of dollars each year for their participation in the National Security Agency's clandestine Prism surveillance program that was made public earlier this year by NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden. Further, the documents - obtained by the Guardian newspaper from Snowden - show that the reimbursements were made even after a court ruled in 2011 that the agency's activities were unconstitutional. The companies that were reimbursed were getting paid taxpayer money as reimbursement for costs incurred when they were forced to meet new certification demands after the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (Fisa) court ruled that the NSA's actions were unconstitutional.
