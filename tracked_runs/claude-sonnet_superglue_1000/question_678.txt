Question:
Passage: By Associated Press PUBLISHED: 15:01 EST, 27 September 2013 | UPDATED: 18:04 EST, 27 September 2013 The Obama administration has found over $100 million in grant money to help bankrupt Detroit hire more police and firefighters, and clear out blighted neighborhoods. But considering the Motor City is at least $18 billion in debt, it will take a far larger infusion of cash or historic deals with bond holders, insurance companies and other creditors to correct the problem. Four high-ranking White House officials will discuss federal efforts and other opportunities today during a closed-door meeting at Wayne State University with Gov. Rick Snyder, state-appointed emergency manager Kevyn Orr, Mayor Dave Bing and community and business leaders.
@highlight
$65 million will go to Community Development Block Grants for blight eradication
@highlight
$25 million for a public-private collaboration for commercial building demolition
@highlight
$11 million in funds to ensure working families can live in safe neighborhoods

Query: @placeholder has had a poor record in making sure grant money is used properly and even spent at all.
