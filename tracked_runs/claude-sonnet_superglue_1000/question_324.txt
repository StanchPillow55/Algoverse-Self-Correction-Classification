Question:
Premise: THE Government wants Nigerian mother-of-two Pamela Izevbekhai's case to stay in this country struck out after revelations that documents used in her action were forged. Ms Izevbekhai has been to the High Court 22 times to prevent her family's deportation on the grounds that her two daughters Naomi (7) and Jemima (6) will be subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM). However, she admitted last weekend that some documents given to the courts were forged. She has stood over her claim that she had a baby daughter, Elizabeth, who died from blood loss as a result of FGM. If her case is struck out, she and her daughters face deportation back to Nigeria.

Hypothesis: Pamela Izevbekhai comes from Nigeria.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?
