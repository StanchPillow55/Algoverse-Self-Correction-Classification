Paragraph: One evening , Felix serves as a conductor to four singing cats . Meanwhile at a house only a few yards away , a hefty man is napping on a chair but gets awakened by their act . To silence them , the man grabs and rolls out bowling ball , knocking Felix and the other cats off their feet . Felix , however , still insist to go on performing as he plays a flute and his friends dance . Awakened once more , the man takes out an ether sprayer and showers its contents onto the cats . While his friends fall into a snooze , Felix decides to have his sleep at home . Felix enters his apartment , and lies on the sofa . But before he can rest long enough , his dwarf master calls him over . Felix comes in and hears about the dwarf's complaint about an insomnia problem . To assist his master , the cat offers a glass of warm milk but to no effect . The dwarf is still unable to sleep , and therefore craves for some entertainment instead . Felix then plays a clarinet , and the toy soldiers start dancing to his music . After moving around for a few moments , one of the little soldiers fires a small cannon , piercing a picture on a wall with its projectile . The dwarf was amazed by the presentation , and asks Felix to handover the cannon . When Felix gives it and suddenly turns around , the hostile dwarf aims the small weapon at him and fires . Felix was struck at the back and frightenedly flees the apartment . Out in the streets , Felix looks for suitable resting places . He then climbs up a telephone pole , and lies down on a set of pants hanging on one of the lines .
