Passage: By David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor PUBLISHED: 13:17 EST, 30 September 2013 | UPDATED: 19:29 EST, 30 September 2013 As Monday turns to Tuesday the U.S. government will lose its authority to spend money on non-essential services, unless House Republicans, Senate Democrats and the Democrat occupying 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue strike a budget deal that hinges on the future of President Obama's controversial health insurance overhaul. House GOP leaders offered and passed last week a budget resolution that would fund the government, but without providing money for Obamacare. But now Republicans are working on a compromise measure that would delay the health care law's implementation for a year instead.A competing plan would chip away at Obamacare more modestly by eliminating a widely reviled new 2.3 per cent tax on medical devices.
@highlight
The Senate killed the House spending proposal Monday afternoon, on a straight party-line 56-44 vote
@highlight
The next GOP counter may be a one-year delay of only the individual health care mandate, and a measure forcing members of Congress and their staffs to obey the Obamacare law
@highlight
'We're not going to be the ones kneeling on the football when the clock hits zero,' predicts one Republican House insider
@highlight
'The tea party nuts are spinning everyone's wheels, including [Speaker] Boehner's,' counters a Democratic political operative
@highlight
The White House maintains that it will not negotiate with Republicans or bend on the implementation of Obamacare
@highlight
Non-essential federal government services face a pause at midnight unless the White House negotiates or the House GOP blinks

Query: The Senate moved quickly as expected Monday afternoon, voting 56-44 strictly along party lines to strip the House Republicans' @placeholder-related language out of the budget resolution and send it back.
