Question:
Passage: Colonia Juarez, Mexico (CNN) -- In the rolling hills of northern Mexico, about 180 miles south of the U.S. border, lies a community that stands out for its religious roots. The houses in this community surrounded by peach and apple orchards look more like homes you would find in the American Southwest than in Mexico. On top of a hill stands a gleaming white Mormon temple, a rarity in this largely Catholic country. Miles Anthony Romney is a resident in this community called Colonia Juarez and a practicing Mormon. The 50-year-old owner of orchards and a fruit packing plant says his family descends from Mormons who settled in this area more than 125 years ago.
