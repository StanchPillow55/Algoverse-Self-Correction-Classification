Question:
Passage: (CNN)  -- When the Democratic National Committee meets Saturday on the thorny issue of seating the Florida and Michigan delegations at its August convention, party officials will have to fashion a solution that satisfies supporters of Sen. Hillary Clinton and presidential nominee front-runner Sen. Barack Obama. Sen. Barack Obama showed he was willing to use bare-knuckle tactics during his first race in Chicago. It may take a Solomon-like decision to appease both candidates. Clinton has argued that the primary results of two of the nation's largest states should count because, otherwise, millions of voters are being disenfranchised. Obama has said he is willing to work out some compromise.
