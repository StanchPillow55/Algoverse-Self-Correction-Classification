Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar was again denied the chance to secure a record 100th international century on Friday as Australia won the second Test in Sydney by an innings and 68 runs to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the four-match series. Tendulkar is international cricket's record run scorer in both the five-day and limited overs formats but has been stranded on 99 centuries since March last year. The 38-year-old batsman made 73 in the first innings of India's 122-run defeat in Melbourne, and this time the "Little Master" fell for 80 after being caught by Michael Hussey off the part-time bowling of Australia captain Michael Clarke.
