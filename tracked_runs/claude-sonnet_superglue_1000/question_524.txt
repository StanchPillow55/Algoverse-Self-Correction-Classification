Question:
Passage: By Emily Allen PUBLISHED: 12:10 EST, 30 October 2012 | UPDATED: 19:13 EST, 30 October 2012 A senior columnist at the New York Times has openly questioned whether former BBC boss Mark Thompson is fit for his new post running America’s most prestigious newspaper in the wake of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal. Mr Thompson has denied knowledge of a BBC cover-up and vowed to take up his role in New York as planned next month. But in a column, Joe Nocera questioned his explanation of his role in the affair: ‘Thompson winds up appearing wilfully ignorant, and it makes you wonder what kind of an organisation the BBC was when he was running it. It also makes you wonder what kind of chief executive he’d be at the Times.’
