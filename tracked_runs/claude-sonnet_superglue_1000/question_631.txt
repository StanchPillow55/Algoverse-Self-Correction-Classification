Question:
Passage: Vietnam's booming Internet scene is littered with failed start-ups that tried to take on Google and other entrenched U.S web companies. But that's not deterring a newly launched Russian-Vietnamese outfit which believes it can unseat the American search engine in this fast-growing Asian market and also contend with a jittery, authoritarian government seeking to clamp down on freedom of expression online. Like Google rivals elsewhere, Coc Coc, or 'Knock Knock' in English, believes the ubiquitous search engine doesn't get the nuances of the local language. It says its algorithms make for a better, quicker search in Vietnamese, while its local knowledge means the information served will be more relevant - and hence more valuable.
