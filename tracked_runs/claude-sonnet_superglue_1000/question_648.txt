Question:
Passage: By Victoria Woollaston For three weeks, Samsung has been fending off claims from Apple that it has ripped off various patents - but it’s now hitting back. During the ongoing, high-profile court battle between the two tech giants, the Korean firm claimed Apple's FaceTime feature infringes one of its own patents. The Galaxy smartphone maker is demanding $6 million (£3.6 million) as a result of the alleged infringement and is mounting its own case for damages to counter Apple’s numerous accusations. Samsung claims Apple's FaceTime, pictured, which lets users make video calls over an web connection, infringes a Samsung patent regarding the compression of video before transmission over a mobile network, awarded in 1994. Apple's lawyers claim the technology described in the patent is now obsolete
