Question:
Paragraph: What if two children push a swing at the same time? Would the swing go higher? Yes, together their force would be more. It is common for forces to be combined. Most objects on Earth have at least two forces acting on them. Do you know what one of them is? Of course, that force is gravity. How many forces do you have on you right now? Gravity pulls you down toward the center of Earth. Your legs exert a downward force. They hold you up against the pull of gravity. Consider the example in Figure 1.3. A book is resting on a table. Gravity pulls the book downward. It has a force of 20 newtons. At the same time, the table pushes the book upward. Its force is also 20 newtons. The table opposes the pull of gravity. 

Question: Why would a swing go higher when two children push it at the same time?

Answer: There is more gravity on the swing
