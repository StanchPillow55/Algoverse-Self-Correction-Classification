Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Getting a song to hit in the summer can change a career -- just ask Katy Perry or Robin Thicke. Before the reign of "I Kissed a Girl" in the summer of 2008, Perry had been tirelessly striving to create a name for herself in the music industry and was starting to find some long-sought success with her debut single, "Ur So Gay." But right around Independence Day 2008 -- which reminds us to make the most of what's left of the season -- Perry's loud and bold "I Kissed a Girl" pushed through to the No. 1 spot on Billboard's Hot 100 and refused to let go for seven weeks. That single gave Perry an entree as pop's newest princess.
@highlight
Iggy Azalea's "Fancy" is a front-runner for 2014's top summer song
@highlight
Other hits such as "Rude" and "Ain't It Fun" are bringing competition
@highlight
Last year, the song of the summer was Robin Thicke's "Blurred Lines"

Query: But after that song was played at every pool party, barbecue, nightclub and wedding reception -- topping the @placeholder 100 in late June and staying there until September -- Thicke became a global pop star.
