Question:
Passage: By Steph Cockroft and Mark Duell Southern Britain is set to be battered by flash flooding this Friday two days before the remnants of Hurricane Bertha make landfall across the Atlantic. A yellow ‘be aware’ rain warning is in place for the South East on Friday due to an unconnected weather front moving in from the English Channel. It comes after residents in the North East had to battle with heavy downpours and flooding today in the first glimpse of a wave of wet weather. Commuters in Newcastle were seen driving through deep flooding as up to 1in (25mm) of rain fell in just three hours, causing flash flooding in some parts.
