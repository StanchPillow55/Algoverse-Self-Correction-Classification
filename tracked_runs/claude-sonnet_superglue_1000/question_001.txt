Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Bowe Bergdahl, the only American POW in Afghanistan, has doubtless been at the forefront of his parents' minds, if not atop the national conscience. It's not that the American people don't care; it's more that updates about the 27-year-old soldier have been sparse, as his family has remained reticent for fear of jeopardizing his safety. With news that the U.S. will engage in peace talks with the Taliban and encouraging signs that Bergdahl will be included in a prisoner swap, we'll likely be hearing more about the man whom friends and family describe as an adventurer and a gentleman.
@highlight
State Department says it expects Taliban to discuss prisoner swap "in coming days"
@highlight
Bowe Bergdahl was 23 when captured in June 2009 in southeastern Paktika province
@highlight
Bergdahl's family says via spokesman latest developments are "encouraging news"
@highlight
Friends, family describe him as gregarious gentleman, prone to wanderlust, kindness

Query: The statement added that the @placeholder was being careful with Bergdahl and that there appears to be disagreement within the Taliban about what to do with its lone American captive.
