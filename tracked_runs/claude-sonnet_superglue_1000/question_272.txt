Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Forces loyal to Ivory Coast's former leader, Laurent Gbagbo, used a lull in fighting this week as a "trick" to reinforce their positions around the main city of Abidjan, the head of U.N. peacekeeping operations said Friday. Though Gbagbo's men said Tuesday they wanted a peaceful solution to the months-long fighting in Ivory Coast, they soon restarted shelling both the U.N. headquarters and the civilian population, Alain Le Roy told reporters at the United Nations. Forces loyal to Gbagbo have since regained control of two central areas of Abidjan and fighting is continuing, Le Roy said, after briefing the U.N. Security Council on developments in the cocoa-producing nation.
