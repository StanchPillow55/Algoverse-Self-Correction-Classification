Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- A week after dropping its invite-only requirement and letting the masses sign up for accounts, social-bookmarking service Pinterest has made another expansion, this time to Android devices and the iPad. Pinterest is a visual bookmarking tool for collecting and organizing content you find online by theme, such as women's hats, cake recipes, cat photos or motorcycles. Users mark, or "pin," sites they like and make carefully crafted collections that other people can view and share. Since it launched last year, Pinterest has only been available on the Web and through its popular iPhone app. As the company rolled out new features and expanded into additional languages, it has heard one request back from users: Make an Android app.
