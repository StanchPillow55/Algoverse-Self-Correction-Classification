Question:
Passage: By Matt Blake PUBLISHED: 12:35 EST, 3 December 2012 | UPDATED: 12:54 EST, 3 December 2012 Casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson secretly pumped $150million into the Republican Party's presidential campaign in a futile bid to oust Barack Obama, it has been revealed. The 79-year-old tycoon, whose vast casino empire is facing two federal criminal investigations, funded several Republican candidates and affiliated groups during the race for the White House. The vast sum is three times more than the $54 million previously disclosed, and 50 percent more than the $100 million Adelson once said he was prepared to spend. His apparent aim was to unseat Obama and help Republican lawmakers take back control of Congress after the November 6 elections, but his spending failed with Obama defeating Mitt Romney and the Democrats retaining the Senate.
