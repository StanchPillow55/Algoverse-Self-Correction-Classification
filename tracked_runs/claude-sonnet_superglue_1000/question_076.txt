Question:
Passage: Over in Hollywood, where it is practically a crime to grow old, Diane Keaton is in constant danger of being arrested by the youth police. ‘Just yesterday,’ she writes in the introduction to her endearingly dotty memoir about the ups and downs of ageing, ‘Dexter, my 18-year-old daughter, found a story online called “Top 10 Female Celebrities Who Are Ugly No Matter What Hollywood Says”.’ Number 1 on the roll-call of shame was Angelina Jolie (‘She looks like Skeletor  from He-Man’). At number 4, Reese Witherspoon (‘What can I say about this genetic mistake?’) Pretty fabulous: Diane is still a big name in Hollywood, despite the lack of roles for women her age
