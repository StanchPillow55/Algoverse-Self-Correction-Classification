Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- A purse used to smack a gunman at a Florida school board meeting has sold on eBay for $13,100, the auction site said Wednesday. Proceeds from the sale will go to Salvage Santa, a charity started by Mike Jones that restores old bicycles and toys and gives them to children in the Florida Panhandle around the holidays. Jones is the security officer who police said shot and wounded 56-year-old Clay Duke after he took over a Bay District School Board meeting earlier in December, upset that the district had fired his wife. Duke later shot and killed himself.
