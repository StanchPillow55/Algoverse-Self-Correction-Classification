Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Jay Leno and Cpl. Ethan Laberge don't have much in common. One is best known as a comedian and the former host of "The Tonight Show," while the other is recovering from serious injuries he sustained while serving in Afghanistan. But there is one thing these two share, and that's a love of cars. So to say thank you to Cpl. Laberge for his service, Leno decided to gift the soldier with something that he knew he would enjoy: a brand new Dodge Hellcat. Leno and Laberge met through Leno's USO comedy tour with the "Today" show's Al Roker.
