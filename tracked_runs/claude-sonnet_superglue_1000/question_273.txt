Question:
Passage: Click here for all the big match stats from our brilliant Match Zone service It is as if footballâ€™s fates are conspiring to torment Steven Gerrard in his remaining years. They show him the prize, let him glimpse the glory and then snatch it away. That title slip, a wretched World Cup as England captain, and now this, possibly his last appearance in the Champions League, able to do so much, but not enough. No single player worked harder to drag Liverpool into the last 16 than Gerrard. It was not to be. Maybe it never will be again.
