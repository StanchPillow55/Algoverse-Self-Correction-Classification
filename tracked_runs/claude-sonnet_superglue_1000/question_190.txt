Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Remember that messiness when Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien were battling it out on air? Or when Leno and David Letterman used to trade jabs during their monologues? Neither do we. These days the late-night focus is on the Jimmys: Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel. Fallon has managed to keep fans riveted with expectations over what musical guest might pop up next in a way that hasn't happened since Arsenio Hall left the air (admit it, you sang along when Mariah Carey did "All I Want For Christmas") and capitalized on the boyish charm that made him star of "Weekend Update" on "Saturday Night Live."
