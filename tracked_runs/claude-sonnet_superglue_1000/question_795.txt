Passage: (Mashable)  -- More than 150,000 people have signed an online petition calling for Apple to remove an app from the iTunes store that was created by a Christian organization they say is anti-gay. Exodus International, which according to its website has ministries that "provide support for individuals who want to recover from homosexuality," released the app on February 15. [UPDATE 11 a.m. ET Wednesday: Apple has pulled the app from its online store.] The app had a 4+ approval rating from the Apple app store, and the organization is quick to point out that this rating is reserved for those apps that "contain no objectionable material."
