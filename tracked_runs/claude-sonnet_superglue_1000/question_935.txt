Question:
Passage: Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Explosions and heavy automatic gunfire were heard hours after five well-armed suicide bombers attacked the British Council in the Afghan capital Friday, leaving at least eight people dead, officials said. White smoke billowed from a building in the compound while heavily armed British and Afghan forces cordoned off the area in the center of the capital, establishing a security perimeter around the buildings. The attacks occurred inside a well-guarded Kabul neighborhood, leaving at least 16 people wounded, the Afghan Interior Ministry said. Among the dead was one New Zealand Special Forces service member, officials said.
