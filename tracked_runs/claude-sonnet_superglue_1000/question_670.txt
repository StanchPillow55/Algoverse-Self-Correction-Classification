Passage: By Daily Mail Reporter Last updated at 12:07 PM on 15th July 2011 Angry: Leonard Padilla, also known as 'the world famous bounty hunter', is suing Casey Anthony for $200,000 compensation The most controversial U.S. legal battle since O.J. Simpson's trial has taken yet another twist after acquitted murder suspect Casey Anthony was served with a $200,000 writ. The 25-year-old has been accused of duping famous bounty hunter Leonard Padilla into a futile search for her dead daughter Caylee because he claims she knew the little girl was not alive. Mr Padilla says he is filing the lawsuit against Anthony and her attorney Jose Baez to recoup money spent searching for Caylee and the cash needed for travel, private detectives, and security guards.
