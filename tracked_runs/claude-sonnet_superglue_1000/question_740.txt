Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Thomas Corless has been to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, 101 times. "The Disney Parks are unlike anything else on the planet," he said. Corless, who runs the Disney fan site WDWNT.com, will be in Orlando this weekend to celebrate the theme park resort's 40th birthday. Since its opening on October 1, 1971, Walt Disney World -- or WDW, as it's often referred to online -- has become the world's most visited recreational resort. It's also more than twice the size of New York's Manhattan island. People get married there, they go there on their honeymoons (more than anywhere else in the continental United States), and of course it's a major destination for families.
