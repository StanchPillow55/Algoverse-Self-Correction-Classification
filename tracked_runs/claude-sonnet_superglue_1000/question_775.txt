Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The past few weeks have seen North Korea become increasingly belligerent toward the United States and South Korea, with Pyongyang threatening to "mercilessly strike" its enemies. But does the reclusive nation, led by Kim Jong Un, have the capability to back up its threats? Realistically, who's at risk of attack and where? Most observers say North Korea is years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead. However, it still has plenty of conventional firepower, including medium-range missiles. North Korea: Our global fear and fascination Here's a look at some of North Korea's possible targets and whether they might be in range:
@highlight
North Korea has threatened pre-emptive strikes against U.S., but how realistic are these threats?
@highlight
South Korea and Japan, both with U.S. military bases, are well within striking distance
@highlight
Experts doubt Guam could be hit, and the U.S. mainland appears to be well out of range

Query: With North Korea allegedly transferring missile components to its east coast, @placeholder faces the threat of a missile hitting its shores or flying over its air.
