Question:
Passage: It's a cold and windy Tuesday in February  and I'm on my way to Cheshire, looking - in my head - pretty glamorous. And by glamorous, I mean that I have woken up half an hour earlier than I normally would, blow-dried, brushed AND straightened my hair and I have a full face of make-up on. All before 9am. Or at least I thought it was a full face of make up-until I arrived at Opium in Hale Barns, the salon owned by Ampika Pickston from the hit reality TV series, The Real Housewives of Cheshire.
