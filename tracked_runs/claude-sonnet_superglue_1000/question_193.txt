Passage: These days we have Instagram filters and Facebook check-ins to induce  envy in our friends. But before social media came along, the postcard was the ultimate holiday brag.

The collection contains more than 54,000 monochrome and colour photographs from 140 countries, including New Zealand, Japan, Uganda, and from cities and towns around Switzerland. Friends and family  contributed to the collection, which Feller left to his daughter Elizabeth after his death in 1931.
