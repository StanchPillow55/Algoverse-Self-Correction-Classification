Question:
Passage: Geismar, Louisiana (CNN) -- A second man has died as a result of Thursday's explosion at a Louisiana chemical plant, the Louisiana State Police said Friday. Scott Thrower, 47, of St. Amant, died at a Baton Rouge hospital after suffering burns in the blast at the Williams plant in Geismar, state police trooper Jared Sandifer said. The Thursday morning explosion killed one other worker and injured more than 100 others in what company CEO Alan Armstrong characterized Friday as "a terrible and unprecedented tragedy and an extremely difficult time for all of us." Before Thrower's death was announced, the company said six people -- two employees and four contractors -- still were hospitalized Friday. Their conditions weren't available.
