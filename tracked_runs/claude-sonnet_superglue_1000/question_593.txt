Question:
Passage: By Anthony Bond PUBLISHED: 05:38 EST, 25 April 2013 | UPDATED: 05:50 EST, 25 April 2013 This is the spectacular moment a photographer struck gold by capturing a bolt of lightning cracking through a rainbow during a freak weather display. The extraordinary one-of-a-kind sighting was captured by keen photographer Nolan Nitschke, 27, while on a trip to Yosemite National Park in California, U.S. Mr  Nitschke knew a storm was approaching the area and that the incredible rocky peaks throughout the park act as lightning rods. However, he had no idea he would capture such a breathtaking moment. Magical: This is the dramatic moment a photographer captured a bolt of lightning cracking through a rainbow in a freak weather display
