Question:
Passage: Even the greatest stage needs a memorable performance to bring it alive and Noble Mission delivered an award-winning one on Saturday to produce the most thrilling and emotional victory of the 2014 Flat season on Champions Day at Ascot. Two years after the great Frankel had ended his career with victory in the Qipco Champion Stakes for the late Sir Henry Cecil, his little brother, trained by Cecil’s widow Jane, lifted the same Group One prize. For a few strides well inside the furlong, it looked as if jockey James Doyle’s efforts to make all the running would be in vain as Noble Mission was headed by Al Kazeem but the 7-1 shot refused to buckle as he bravely thrust his head back in front.
