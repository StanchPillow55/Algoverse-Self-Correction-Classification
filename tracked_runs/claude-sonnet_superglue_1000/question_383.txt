Question:
Passage: West Ham will have the word ‘London’ inserted on their new club crest when they move into the Olympic Stadium in 2016, if fans approve. As the Hammers enter their penultimate season at Upton Park, the Barclays Premier League club have proposed plans to evolve their emblem with supporters invited to cast a deciding vote on the design. Sportsmail understands the inclusion of ‘London’ in the sleek design is a nod to West Ham’s historic standing in the capital, while helping the ambitious Hammers make strides in a competitive global football market when they move into their new Stratford home in less than two years.
