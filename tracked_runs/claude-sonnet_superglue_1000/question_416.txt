Question:
Passage: (CNN)Chelsea relinquished sole leadership of the English Premier League after suffering a surprise 5-3 defeat at the hands of a Harry Kane inspired Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane Thursday. It was a result few had foreseen, particularly when Diego Costa put Jose Mourinho's men ahead midway through the first half. But Kane, pushing for an England call up, leveled with an exquisite individual goal and Danny Rose put Spurs 2-1 ahead after he reacted quickly when Nacer Chadli's shot hit the post and rebounded back into play. Kane was then fouled by Gary Cahill with Andros Townsend scoring from the penalty spot to give the home side a 3-1 lead at the break.
