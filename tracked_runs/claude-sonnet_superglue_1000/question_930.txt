Question:
Passage: Mark Cavendish is out of the Tour de France after crashing during the sprint for the line at the end of the opening stage in Harrogate yesterday. The British rider boarded the team bus to the start of stage two in York this morning but his team, Omega Pharma-Quickstep, have now confirmed the worst fears of cycling fans hoping to see him sprint to glory on The Mall tomorrow after failure to do so at the London Olympics in 2012. Cavendish suffered 'ligament ruptures with an AC-joint dislocation' between his collarbone and his shoulder after trying 'to find a gap that wasn't there' on Harrogate's Parliament Street.
