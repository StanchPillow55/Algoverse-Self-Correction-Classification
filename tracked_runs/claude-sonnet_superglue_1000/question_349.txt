Question:
Premise: It seemed impossible that anyone could endure such pain for so long, but at last the doors of the Renault slammed and there was comparative silence. The engine was started up, revving violently as the car was turned round on the narrow road. John could tell that it was being driven back up the hill towards Putna.

Hypothesis: the car was being driven back up the hill towards Putna

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?
