Question:
Passage: Knowing that he wouldn't be there for her wedding, a terminally ill father walked his 11-year-old down the 'aisle' years early with the pastor sweetly pronouncing them 'daddy and daughter'. Jim Zetz, 62, from Murrieta, California, who has stage 4 pancreatic cancer, proudly held his daughter, Josie's hand during their backyard ceremony on March 14 and placed a sparkling ring on her index finger. The tear-jerking event was staged by photographer Lindsey Villatoro, who heard about the Zetz's heartbreaking story and decided to do something out of the ordinary for their final days together.
