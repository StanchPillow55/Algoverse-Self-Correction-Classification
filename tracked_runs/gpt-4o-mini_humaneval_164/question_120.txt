Question:

def match_parens(lst):
    '''
    You are given a list of two strings, both strings consist of open
    parentheses '(' or close parentheses ')' only.
    Your job is to check if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in
    some order, that the resulting string will be good.
    A string S is considered to be good if and only if all parentheses in S
    are balanced. For example: the string '(())()' is good, while the string
    '())' is not.
    Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.

    Examples:
    match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'
    match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No'

Response:
To solve the problem of checking if two strings of parentheses can be concatenated in such a way that the resulting string is balanced, we need to understand what makes a string of parentheses "good" or balanced.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Balanced Parentheses**:
   - A string of parentheses is balanced if every opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing parenthesis ')'.
   - This means that at no point in the string should the number of closing parentheses exceed the number of opening parentheses.

2. **Concatenation Order**:
   - We can concatenate the two strings in two possible orders:
     - First string followed by the second string: `s1 + s2`
     - Second string followed by the first string: `s2 + s1`
   - We need to check both concatenation orders to see if either results in a balanced string.

3. **Counting Parentheses**:
   - For each string, we can count the number of opening and closing parentheses:
     - Let `open1` and `close1` be the counts for the first string.
     - Let `open2` and `close2` be the counts for the second string.
   - For a concatenated string to be balanced:
     - In the first order (`s1 + s2`), we need:
       - The total number of opening parentheses must be greater than or equal to the total number of closing parentheses at every point in the concatenated string.
     - In the second order (`s2 + s1`), we need the same condition.

4. **Checking Conditions**:
   - For `s1 + s2` to be good:
     - The total opening parentheses from `s1` must be at least as many as the closing parentheses from `s2` at the start of `s2`.
   - For `s2 + s1` to be good:
     - The total opening parentheses from `s2` must be at least as many as the closing parentheses from `s1` at the start of `s1`.

5. **Implementation**:
   - We will implement a function that counts the parentheses in each string and checks the conditions for both concatenation orders.

### Implementation:

Here is the complete function definition based on the reasoning above:

```python
def match_parens(lst):
    s1, s2 = lst[0], lst[1]
    
    # Count the number of opening and closing parentheses in both strings
    open1 = s1.count('(')
    close1 = s1.count(')')
    open2 = s2.count('(')
    close2 = s2.count(')')
    
    # Check the conditions for both concatenation orders
    # For s1 + s2 to be good
    if open1 >= close2 and (open1 - close2 + open2) >= 0:
        return 'Yes'
    
    # For s2 + s1 to be good
    if open2 >= close1 and (open2 - close1 + open1) >= 0:
        return 'Yes'
    
    return 'No'

# Example test cases
print(match_parens(['()(', ')']))  # Expected output: 'Yes'
print(match_parens([')', ')']))     # Expected output: 'No'
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first extract the two strings from the input list.
- We count the number of opening and closing parentheses in each string.
- We then check the two conditions for both concatenation orders.
- If either condition is satisfied, we return 'Yes'; otherwise, we return 'No'. 

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine if a balanced string can be formed by concatenating the two input strings in either order.

    s1, s2 = lst[0], lst[1]
    
    # Count the number of opening and closing parentheses in both strings
    open1 = s1.count('(')
    close1 = s1.count(')')
    open2 = s2.count('(')
    close2 = s2.count(')')
    
    # Check the conditions for both concatenation orders
    # For s1 + s2 to be good
    if open1 >= close2 and (open1 - close2 + open2) >= 0:
        return 'Yes'
    
    # For s2 + s1 to be good
    if open2 >= close1 and (open2 - close1 + open1) >= 0:
        return 'Yes'
    
    return 'No'

# Example test cases
print(match_parens(['()(', ')']))  # Expected output: 'Yes'
print(match_parens([')', ')']))     # Expected output: 'No'

Response:
To solve the problem of determining whether two strings of parentheses can be concatenated in such a way that the resulting string is balanced, we need to understand the properties of balanced parentheses.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Balanced Parentheses**:
   - A string of parentheses is considered balanced if:
     - For every opening parenthesis '(', there is a corresponding closing parenthesis ')'.
     - At no point in the string should the number of closing parentheses ')' exceed the number of opening parentheses '(' when reading from left to right.

2. **Concatenation of Strings**:
   - We have two strings, `s1` and `s2`. We can concatenate them in two possible orders:
     - `s1 + s2`
     - `s2 + s1`
   - We need to check if either of these concatenated strings is balanced.

3. **Count of Parentheses**:
   - For a string to be potentially balanced, the total count of opening parentheses must equal the total count of closing parentheses.
   - Additionally, we need to ensure that at no point in the concatenated string do we have more closing parentheses than opening ones.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Count the number of opening and closing parentheses in both strings.
   - Check both concatenation orders:
     - For `s1 + s2`, ensure that the cumulative count of opening parentheses never goes below zero when traversing the string.
     - For `s2 + s1`, do the same check.
   - If either order results in a balanced string, return 'Yes'; otherwise, return 'No'.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function `match_parens` based on the reasoning above.

```python
def match_parens(lst):
    s1, s2 = lst[0], lst[1]
    
    # Function to check if a concatenated string is balanced
    def is_balanced(s1, s2):
        balance = 0
        # Check s1 + s2
        for char in s1:
            balance += 1 if char == '(' else -1
            if balance < 0:  # More ')' than '(' at any point
                return False
        for char in s2:
            balance += 1 if char == '(' else -1
            if balance < 0:  # More ')' than '(' at any point
                return False
        return balance == 0  # Must end with balance 0
    
    # Check both concatenation orders
    if is_balanced(s1, s2) or is_balanced(s2, s1):
        return 'Yes'
    else:
        return 'No'

# Example test cases
print(match_parens(['()(', ')']))  # Should return 'Yes'
print(match_parens([')', ')']))     # Should return 'No'
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a helper function `is_balanced` that checks if the concatenation of two strings results in a balanced string.
- We iterate through each character of the strings, adjusting a `balance` counter based on whether we encounter an opening or closing parenthesis.
- If at any point the `balance` goes negative, it indicates an imbalance, and we return `False`.
- Finally, we check both concatenation orders and return 'Yes' if either is balanced, otherwise 'No'. 

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the possibility of forming a balanced string from the two input strings.
