Response:
To solve the problem of finding the largest divisor of a given integer \( n \) that is smaller than \( n \), we can break down the problem into a series of logical steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Divisors**: A divisor of a number \( n \) is any integer \( d \) such that \( n \mod d = 0 \). This means that when \( n \) is divided by \( d \), there is no remainder.

2. **Constraints**: The problem specifies that we need to find the largest divisor that is smaller than \( n \). Therefore, we need to check potential divisors starting from \( n-1 \) down to 1.

3. **Iterative Approach**: We can use a loop to iterate from \( n-1 \) down to 1. For each number \( d \) in this range, we check if it divides \( n \) evenly.

4. **Early Exit**: As soon as we find a divisor, we can return it immediately since we are looking for the largest one and we are checking in descending order.

5. **Edge Cases**: We should consider what happens when \( n \) is less than or equal to 1. In such cases, there are no positive divisors smaller than \( n \).

### Implementation:

Now that we have a clear understanding of the problem and the approach, we can implement the function `largest_divisor`.

```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n.
    
    >>> largest_divisor(15)
    5
    >>> largest_divisor(10)
    5
    >>> largest_divisor(1)
    0
    >>> largest_divisor(2)
    1
    """
    # Edge case: if n is less than or equal to 1, return 0
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    
    # Iterate from n-1 down to 1
    for d in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        if n % d == 0:  # Check if d is a divisor of n
            return d  # Return the first (largest) divisor found

    return 0  # This line is technically unreachable due to the edge case check
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We start by checking if \( n \) is less than or equal to 1. If it is, we return 0 since there are no positive divisors.
- We then use a `for` loop to iterate from \( n-1 \) down to 1. For each number \( d \), we check if it divides \( n \) evenly using the modulus operator.
- As soon as we find a divisor, we return it immediately, ensuring that it is the largest one due to our descending iteration.
- The function also includes a docstring with examples to illustrate its usage.

This implementation is efficient for reasonably sized integers and handles edge cases appropriately.
