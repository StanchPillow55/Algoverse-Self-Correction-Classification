Response:
To solve the problem of extracting the decimal part from a given positive floating point number, we can break down the task into a few clear steps:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input is a positive floating point number (e.g., `3.5`).
   - The output should be the decimal part of that number (e.g., for `3.5`, the output should be `0.5`).

2. **Decomposing the Number**:
   - A floating point number can be represented as the sum of its integer part and its decimal part. For example, `3.5` can be decomposed into `3` (integer part) and `0.5` (decimal part).
   - The integer part can be obtained using the `int()` function, which truncates the decimal part and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the number.

3. **Calculating the Decimal Part**:
   - Once we have the integer part, we can find the decimal part by subtracting the integer part from the original number:
     \[
     \text{decimal part} = \text{number} - \text{integer part}
     \]

4. **Implementation**:
   - We will define a function `truncate_number` that takes a float as input and returns the decimal part.
   - We will ensure that the function handles the input correctly and returns the expected output.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    an integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    0.5
    """
    # Step 1: Get the integer part of the number
    integer_part = int(number)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the decimal part
    decimal_part = number - integer_part
    
    # Step 3: Return the decimal part
    return decimal_part
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define the function `truncate_number` which takes a single argument `number` of type `float`.
- Inside the function, we calculate the integer part using `int(number)`.
- We then compute the decimal part by subtracting the integer part from the original number.
- Finally, we return the decimal part.

### Testing the Function:
To ensure that our function works as expected, we can run the provided example and additional test cases:

```python
print(truncate_number(3.5))  # Expected output: 0.5
print(truncate_number(5.75))  # Expected output: 0.75
print(truncate_number(10.0))  # Expected output: 0.0
print(truncate_number(0.99))   # Expected output: 0.99
```

This implementation is straightforward and effectively extracts the decimal part of a positive floating point number.
