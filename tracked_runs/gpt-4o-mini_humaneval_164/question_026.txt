Response:
To solve the problem of factorizing an integer into its prime factors, we need to follow a systematic approach. Hereâ€™s how we can break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understanding Prime Factorization
Prime factorization involves breaking down a composite number into a product of prime numbers. For example:
- The prime factorization of 8 is \(2 \times 2 \times 2\), which gives us the list \([2, 2, 2]\).
- The prime factorization of 25 is \(5 \times 5\), resulting in \([5, 5]\).
- The prime factorization of 70 is \(2 \times 5 \times 7\), leading to \([2, 5, 7]\).

### Step 2: Approach to Factorization
1. **Initialize an empty list** to store the prime factors.
2. **Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2**, and check if it divides the number \(n\). If it does, we keep dividing \(n\) by 2 until it no longer can be divided by 2, adding 2 to our list each time.
3. **Move to the next odd numbers** (3, 5, 7, ...) and repeat the process. We only need to check up to the square root of \(n\) because if \(n\) has a factor larger than its square root, the corresponding co-factor must be smaller than the square root.
4. If after checking all possible factors up to the square root, \(n\) is still greater than 1, then \(n\) itself is a prime number and should be added to the list.
5. Finally, return the list of prime factors.

### Step 3: Implementation
Now, let's implement the `factorize` function based on the outlined approach.

```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    """
    factors = []
    
    # Check for number of 2s that divide n
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    
    # n must be odd at this point, so we can skip even numbers
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    
    # This condition is to check if n is a prime number greater than 2
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)
    
    return factors
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We start by initializing an empty list `factors` to store the prime factors.
- We first handle the factor 2 separately to allow us to skip even numbers later.
- We then use a loop to check for odd factors starting from 3 up to the square root of \(n\).
- For each factor, we check if it divides \(n\) and keep dividing \(n\) by that factor until it no longer can.
- Finally, if \(n\) is still greater than 2, it means \(n\) itself is a prime factor and we add it to the list.
- The function returns the list of prime factors in ascending order.

### Testing the Function
We can test the function using the provided examples:

```python
print(factorize(8))   # Output: [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25))  # Output: [5, 5]
print(factorize(70))  # Output: [2, 5, 7]
```

This implementation is efficient and correctly handles the factorization of integers into their prime components.
