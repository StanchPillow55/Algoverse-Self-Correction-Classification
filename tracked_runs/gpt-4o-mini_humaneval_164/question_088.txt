Question:

def get_row(lst, x):
    """
    You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists,
    which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices,
    each row may contain a different number of columns.
    Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list,
    and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that
    each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0.
    Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order.
    Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.
    
    Examples:
    get_row([
      [1,2,3,4,5,6],
      [1,2,3,4,1,6],
      [1,2,3,4,5,1]

Response:
To solve the problem of finding the coordinates of a specific integer `x` in a 2D list (or nested list), we need to follow a systematic approach. Here's how we can break down the problem:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - We have a 2D list `lst` where each row can have a different number of columns.
   - We need to find all occurrences of the integer `x` in this list.
   - For each occurrence, we will return its coordinates as a tuple `(row_index, column_index)`.
   - The output should be sorted first by the row index in ascending order and then by the column index in descending order.

2. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - We will loop through each row of the list using an index to keep track of the row number.
   - For each row, we will loop through its elements to check if they match `x`.
   - If a match is found, we will store the coordinates in a list.

3. **Sorting the Coordinates**:
   - After collecting all the coordinates, we will sort them.
   - The primary sort will be by the row index (ascending), and the secondary sort will be by the column index (descending).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the input list is empty, we should return an empty list.
   - If `x` is not found in the list, we should also return an empty list.

### Implementation

Now that we have a clear understanding of the steps involved, we can implement the function `get_row`.

```python
def get_row(lst, x):
    """
    Given a 2D list (nested lists) and an integer x, find all occurrences of x
    and return a list of tuples representing their coordinates (row, column).
    The output should be sorted by rows in ascending order and by columns in descending order.
    """
    coordinates = []
    
    # Iterate through each row with its index
    for row_index, row in enumerate(lst):
        # Iterate through each element in the row with its index
        for col_index, value in enumerate(row):
            # Check if the current value matches x
            if value == x:
                # Append the coordinate (row_index, col_index) to the list
                coordinates.append((row_index, col_index))
    
    # Sort the coordinates: first by row (ascending), then by column (descending)
    coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
    
    return coordinates

# Example usage:
print(get_row([
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6],
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
], 1))  # Output: [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]

print(get_row([], 1))  # Output: []
print(get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3))  # Output: [(2, 2)]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define the function `get_row` that takes a 2D list `lst` and an integer `x`.
- We initialize an empty list `coordinates` to store the found coordinates.
- We use `enumerate` to loop through each row and its index, and then through each element in the row.
- If an element matches `x`, we append its coordinates to `coordinates`.
- Finally, we sort the list of coordinates using a lambda function that sorts by the first element (row index) in ascending order and by the second element (column index) in descending order.
- The sorted list is returned as the output. 

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem requirements.
