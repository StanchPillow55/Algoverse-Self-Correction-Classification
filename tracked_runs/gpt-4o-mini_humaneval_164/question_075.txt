Question:

def total_match(lst1, lst2):
    '''
    Write a function that accepts two lists of strings and returns the list that has 
    total number of chars in the all strings of the list less than the other list.

    if the two lists have the same number of chars, return the first list.

    Examples
    total_match([], []) ➞ []
    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi']) ➞ ['hI', 'Hi']
    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project']) ➞ ['hi', 'admin']
    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']) ➞ ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']
    total_match(['4'], ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']) ➞ ['4']

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to create a function `total_match(lst1, lst2)` that compares the total number of characters in two lists of strings and returns the list with fewer characters. If both lists have the same total number of characters, we will return the first list.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Input and Output**:
   - The function takes two lists of strings as input.
   - The output is one of the input lists based on the total character count.

2. **Calculating Total Characters**:
   - We need to calculate the total number of characters in each list. This can be done by iterating through each string in the list, summing their lengths.

3. **Comparison Logic**:
   - After calculating the total character counts for both lists:
     - If the total for `lst1` is less than that of `lst2`, return `lst1`.
     - If the total for `lst2` is less than that of `lst1`, return `lst2`.
     - If both totals are equal, return `lst1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If both lists are empty, the function should return an empty list.
   - We should also consider cases where one list is empty and the other is not.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def total_match(lst1, lst2):
    '''
    Write a function that accepts two lists of strings and returns the list that has 
    total number of chars in the all strings of the list less than the other list.

    if the two lists have the same number of chars, return the first list.
    '''
    
    # Calculate total characters in lst1
    total_chars_lst1 = sum(len(s) for s in lst1)
    
    # Calculate total characters in lst2
    total_chars_lst2 = sum(len(s) for s in lst2)
    
    # Compare the total characters and return the appropriate list
    if total_chars_lst1 < total_chars_lst2:
        return lst1
    elif total_chars_lst1 > total_chars_lst2:
        return lst2
    else:
        return lst1  # If they are equal, return lst1

# Testing the function with provided examples
print(total_match([], []))  # ➞ []
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi']))  # ➞ ['hI', 'Hi']
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project']))  # ➞ ['hi', 'admin']
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']))  # ➞ ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']
print(total_match(['4'], ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']))  # ➞ ['4']
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We use a generator expression inside the `sum()` function to calculate the total number of characters for each list.
- We then compare the totals and return the appropriate list based on the conditions outlined.
- The function is tested with the provided examples to ensure correctness.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem requirements.

Response:
To solve the problem of determining which of two lists of strings has a smaller total character count, we can break down the solution into a series of logical steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - We have two lists of strings, `lst1` and `lst2`.
   - We need to calculate the total number of characters in each list.
   - The output should be the list with the smaller total character count. If both lists have the same total character count, we return the first list (`lst1`).

2. **Calculating Total Characters**:
   - To find the total number of characters in a list of strings, we can use a combination of the `sum()` function and a generator expression that iterates through each string in the list and calculates its length using the `len()` function.

3. **Comparison Logic**:
   - After calculating the total character counts for both lists, we will compare these two values.
   - If `total_chars_lst1 < total_chars_lst2`, we return `lst1`.
   - If `total_chars_lst1 > total_chars_lst2`, we return `lst2`.
   - If they are equal, we return `lst1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - We need to consider edge cases such as both lists being empty. In this case, the function should return an empty list.

### Implementation:

Now that we have a clear understanding of the problem and the steps needed to solve it, we can implement the function.

```python
def total_match(lst1, lst2):
    '''
    Write a function that accepts two lists of strings and returns the list that has 
    total number of chars in the all strings of the list less than the other list.

    if the two lists have the same number of chars, return the first list.
    '''
    # Calculate total characters in lst1
    total_chars_lst1 = sum(len(s) for s in lst1)
    
    # Calculate total characters in lst2
    total_chars_lst2 = sum(len(s) for s in lst2)
    
    # Compare the total character counts and return the appropriate list
    if total_chars_lst1 < total_chars_lst2:
        return lst1
    elif total_chars_lst1 > total_chars_lst2:
        return lst2
    else:
        return lst1  # If they are equal, return lst1

# Example test cases
print(total_match([], []))  # ➞ []
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi']))  # ➞ ['hI', 'Hi']
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project']))  # ➞ ['hi', 'admin']
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']))  # ➞ ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']
print(total_match(['4'], ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']))  # ➞ ['4']
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define the function `total_match` that takes two lists as input.
- We calculate the total number of characters in each list using a generator expression inside the `sum()` function.
- We then compare the total character counts and return the appropriate list based on the conditions outlined.
- The function also handles the case of empty lists correctly by returning an empty list when both inputs are empty. 

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the requirements specified in the problem statement.
