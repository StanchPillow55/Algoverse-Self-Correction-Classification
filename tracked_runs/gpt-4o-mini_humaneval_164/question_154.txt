Question:

def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    """You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions.
    The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The
    strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase
    letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters 
    in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. 
    You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this 
    format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.
    If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should
    choose the one that comes first in the list.
    For example, if you are given "Slices" as the class and a list of the
    extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should
    return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension 
    (its strength is -1).
    Example:
    for Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']) == 'my_class.AA'
    """

Response:
To solve the problem of finding the strongest extension for a given class name, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps involved in the solution:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Strength Calculation**:
   - For each extension, we need to calculate its strength using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{strength} = \text{CAP} - \text{SM}
     \]
     where:
     - CAP is the count of uppercase letters in the extension.
     - SM is the count of lowercase letters in the extension.

2. **Iterating Through Extensions**:
   - We will iterate through the list of extensions and calculate the strength for each one.
   - We need to keep track of the maximum strength found and the corresponding extension.

3. **Handling Ties**:
   - If two extensions have the same strength, we will choose the one that appears first in the list. This can be easily managed by updating our best extension only when we find a stronger one.

4. **Formatting the Output**:
   - Once we identify the strongest extension, we will format the output as `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName`.

5. **Implementation**:
   - We will implement the above logic in the function `Strongest_Extension`.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above:

```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    """Finds the strongest extension for a given class name based on the strength calculation."""
    
    max_strength = float('-inf')  # Start with the lowest possible strength
    strongest_extension = None  # To store the strongest extension found
    
    for extension in extensions:
        # Calculate CAP and SM
        CAP = sum(1 for char in extension if char.isupper())
        SM = sum(1 for char in extension if char.islower())
        
        # Calculate strength
        strength = CAP - SM
        
        # Check if this is the strongest extension found so far
        if strength > max_strength:
            max_strength = strength
            strongest_extension = extension
            
    # Return the formatted result
    return f"{class_name}.{strongest_extension}"

# Example usage
print(Strongest_Extension('Slices', ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed']))  # Output: 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes'
print(Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']))  # Output: 'my_class.AA'
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We initialize `max_strength` to negative infinity to ensure any calculated strength will be greater initially.
- We loop through each extension, calculating the number of uppercase and lowercase letters using list comprehensions.
- We compute the strength and check if it's greater than the current maximum strength. If it is, we update our `max_strength` and store the current extension as the strongest.
- Finally, we return the result in the required format.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem requirements.
