Question:

def select_words(s, n):
    """Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement 
    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly 
    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
    Examples:
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
    select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
    select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
    select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]
    """

Response:
To solve the problem of selecting words from a string that contain exactly `n` consonants, we can break down the task into several steps:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of a string `s` and a natural number `n`.
   - The output should be a list of words from the string `s` that contain exactly `n` consonants.

2. **Identifying Consonants**:
   - Consonants are all letters that are not vowels. In English, the vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (both uppercase and lowercase).
   - We can define a set of vowels and derive consonants from the alphabet.

3. **Splitting the String into Words**:
   - We can use the `split()` method on the string `s` to break it into individual words based on spaces.

4. **Counting Consonants in Each Word**:
   - For each word, we will count the number of consonants. This can be done by iterating through each character in the word and checking if it is a consonant.

5. **Collecting Words with Exactly `n` Consonants**:
   - We will maintain a list to collect words that meet the criterion of having exactly `n` consonants.

6. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the input string `s` is empty, we should return an empty list.

Now, let's implement the function `select_words` based on this reasoning:

```python
def select_words(s, n):
    """Given a string s and a natural number n, return a list of all words from string s 
    that contain exactly n consonants, in the order they appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty, return an empty list."""
    
    # Define the set of vowels
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    
    # Initialize an empty list to hold the resulting words
    result = []
    
    # Split the string into words
    words = s.split()
    
    # Function to count consonants in a word
    def count_consonants(word):
        count = 0
        for char in word:
            if char.isalpha() and char not in vowels:  # Check if it's a consonant
                count += 1
        return count
    
    # Iterate through each word and count consonants
    for word in words:
        if count_consonants(word) == n:
            result.append(word)
    
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:
- We start by defining a set of vowels to easily check if a character is a consonant.
- We initialize an empty list `result` to store the words that meet the criteria.
- We split the input string `s` into words using `split()`.
- We define a helper function `count_consonants` that counts the consonants in a given word.
- We iterate through each word, count its consonants using the helper function, and if the count matches `n`, we append the word to the `result` list.
- Finally, we return the `result` list.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the requirements of the problem statement.
