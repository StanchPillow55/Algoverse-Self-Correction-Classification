Response:
To solve the problem of counting the n-digit positive integers that start or end with the digit '1', we need to break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Range of n-digit Numbers
An n-digit positive integer has the following characteristics:
- The first digit cannot be zero (it must be between 1 and 9).
- The total number of n-digit integers is from \(10^{(n-1)}\) to \(10^n - 1\).

### Step 2: Count Numbers Starting with 1
To count the n-digit integers that start with '1':
- The first digit is fixed as '1'.
- The remaining \(n-1\) digits can be any digit from 0 to 9.
- Therefore, there are \(10^{(n-1)}\) combinations for the remaining digits.

### Step 3: Count Numbers Ending with 1
To count the n-digit integers that end with '1':
- The last digit is fixed as '1'.
- The first digit can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be zero).
- The remaining \(n-2\) digits (if \(n > 1\)) can be any digit from 0 to 9.
- Therefore, if \(n = 1\), there is only one number (which is '1').
- If \(n > 1\), there are \(9 \times 10^{(n-2)}\) combinations (9 choices for the first digit and \(10^{(n-2)}\) for the remaining digits).

### Step 4: Handle Overlap
When counting numbers that start with '1' and end with '1', we need to ensure we don't double count:
- The numbers that both start and end with '1' have '1' as the first digit and '1' as the last digit.
- The middle \(n-2\) digits can be anything from 0 to 9.
- Therefore, there are \(10^{(n-2)}\) such numbers if \(n > 1\). If \(n = 1\), the only number is '1'.

### Step 5: Combine Counts
The final count of n-digit integers that start or end with '1' can be calculated using the inclusion-exclusion principle:
- Count of numbers starting with '1' + Count of numbers ending with '1' - Count of numbers starting and ending with '1'.

### Implementation
Now, let's implement this logic in the function `starts_one_ends(n)`.

```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """
    if n < 1:
        return 0  # Since n must be a positive integer

    # Count of n-digit numbers starting with '1'
    count_starting_with_1 = 10 ** (n - 1)

    # Count of n-digit numbers ending with '1'
    if n == 1:
        count_ending_with_1 = 1  # Only the number '1'
    else:
        count_ending_with_1 = 9 * (10 ** (n - 2))

    # Count of n-digit numbers starting and ending with '1'
    if n == 1:
        count_both = 1  # Only the number '1'
    else:
        count_both = 10 ** (n - 2)

    # Total count using inclusion-exclusion principle
    total_count = (count_starting_with_1 + count_ending_with_1 - count_both)

    return total_count

# Example usage:
print(starts_one_ends(1))  # Output: 1
print(starts_one_ends(2))  # Output: 18
print(starts_one_ends(3))  # Output: 271
```

### Explanation of the Code
- We first check if \(n\) is less than 1, returning 0 if so.
- We calculate the counts for numbers starting with '1', ending with '1', and both starting and ending with '1'.
- Finally, we apply the inclusion-exclusion principle to get the total count and return it.

This implementation is efficient and handles all edge cases based on the value of \(n\).

Response:
To solve the problem of counting n-digit positive integers that start or end with the digit '1', we need to break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding n-digit Numbers
An n-digit positive integer is defined as a number that has exactly n digits. For example:
- For n = 1, the valid numbers are: 1, 2, 3, ..., 9 (total of 9 numbers).
- For n = 2, the valid numbers are: 10, 11, 12, ..., 99 (total of 90 numbers).
- For n = 3, the valid numbers are: 100, 101, ..., 999 (total of 900 numbers).

### Step 2: Counting Numbers Starting with '1'
To count the n-digit numbers that start with '1':
- The first digit is fixed as '1'.
- The remaining (n-1) digits can be any digit from 0 to 9.
- Therefore, the number of choices for the remaining (n-1) digits is \(10^{(n-1)}\).

### Step 3: Counting Numbers Ending with '1'
To count the n-digit numbers that end with '1':
- The last digit is fixed as '1'.
- The first digit can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be '0' for an n-digit number).
- The remaining (n-2) digits can be any digit from 0 to 9.
- Therefore, the number of choices for the first digit is 9 (1-9), and for the remaining (n-2) digits is \(10^{(n-2)}\).
- Thus, the total count for numbers ending with '1' is \(9 \times 10^{(n-2)}\).

### Step 4: Avoiding Double Counting
Some numbers may be counted in both categories (those that start and end with '1'). Specifically, these are the numbers of the form '1...1' (where there are (n-2) digits in between):
- For n = 1, the only number is '1'.
- For n = 2, there are no such numbers.
- For n >= 3, the first digit is '1', the last digit is '1', and the (n-2) digits in between can be anything from 0 to 9, giving us \(10^{(n-2)}\) such numbers.

### Step 5: Final Calculation
The total count of n-digit numbers that start or end with '1' can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Total} = (\text{Count of numbers starting with '1'}) + (\text{Count of numbers ending with '1'}) - (\text{Count of numbers starting and ending with '1'})
\]
This translates to:
\[
\text{Total} = 10^{(n-1)} + 9 \times 10^{(n-2)} - 10^{(n-2)}
\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[
\text{Total} = 10^{(n-1)} + 8 \times 10^{(n-2)}
\]

### Step 6: Implementation
Now, we can implement this logic in Python:

```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """
    if n < 1:
        return 0  # Since n must be a positive integer
    
    # Count of numbers starting with '1'
    count_starting_with_1 = 10 ** (n - 1)
    
    # Count of numbers ending with '1'
    if n == 1:
        count_ending_with_1 = 1  # Only the number '1'
    else:
        count_ending_with_1 = 9 * (10 ** (n - 2))
    
    # Count of numbers starting and ending with '1'
    if n >= 3:
        count_both = 10 ** (n - 2)
    else:
        count_both = 0  # For n = 1 or n = 2, there are no such numbers
    
    # Total count
    total_count = count_starting_with_1 + count_ending_with_1 - count_both
    
    return total_count
```

### Conclusion
This function calculates the total count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with '1' based on the derived formula. The implementation is efficient and handles the edge cases for n = 1 and n = 2 appropriately.

Response:
To solve the problem of counting n-digit positive integers that start or end with the digit '1', we need to break down the problem into manageable parts. Hereâ€™s how we can approach it step by step:

### Step 1: Understanding n-digit Numbers
An n-digit positive integer has the following characteristics:
- The first digit cannot be zero (it must be between 1 and 9).
- The remaining (n-1) digits can be any digit from 0 to 9.

### Step 2: Counting n-digit Numbers
1. **Total n-digit numbers**: The total number of n-digit numbers can be calculated as:
   - The first digit has 9 options (1-9).
   - Each of the remaining (n-1) digits has 10 options (0-9).
   - Therefore, the total number of n-digit integers is:
     \[
     \text{Total n-digit numbers} = 9 \times 10^{(n-1)}
     \]

### Step 3: Counting Numbers Starting with '1'
2. **Numbers starting with '1'**: If the first digit is fixed as '1', then:
   - The first digit is '1' (1 option).
   - The remaining (n-1) digits can be anything from 0 to 9.
   - Thus, the count of n-digit numbers starting with '1' is:
     \[
     \text{Count starting with '1'} = 10^{(n-1)}
     \]

### Step 4: Counting Numbers Ending with '1'
3. **Numbers ending with '1'**: If the last digit is fixed as '1', then:
   - The last digit is '1' (1 option).
   - The first digit can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
   - The remaining (n-2) digits can be anything from 0 to 9.
   - Thus, the count of n-digit numbers ending with '1' is:
     \[
     \text{Count ending with '1'} = 9 \times 10^{(n-2)}
     \]

### Step 5: Avoiding Double Counting
4. **Numbers starting and ending with '1'**: Some numbers will be counted in both the previous counts (those that both start and end with '1'). For these numbers:
   - The first digit is '1' (1 option).
   - The last digit is '1' (1 option).
   - The remaining (n-2) digits can be anything from 0 to 9.
   - Thus, the count of n-digit numbers starting and ending with '1' is:
     \[
     \text{Count starting and ending with '1'} = 10^{(n-2)}
     \]

### Step 6: Applying the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
5. **Final Count**: To get the total count of n-digit numbers that either start or end with '1', we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle:
   \[
   \text{Total count} = \text{Count starting with '1'} + \text{Count ending with '1'} - \text{Count starting and ending with '1'}
   \]

### Step 7: Implementing the Solution
Now that we have a clear understanding of how to compute the counts, we can implement this logic in Python.

```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """
    if n < 1:
        return 0  # Since n must be a positive integer
    
    # Count of n-digit numbers starting with '1'
    count_starting_with_1 = 10 ** (n - 1)
    
    # Count of n-digit numbers ending with '1'
    if n == 1:
        count_ending_with_1 = 1  # Only the number '1'
    else:
        count_ending_with_1 = 9 * 10 ** (n - 2)
    
    # Count of n-digit numbers starting and ending with '1'
    if n == 1:
        count_starting_and_ending_with_1 = 1  # Only the number '1'
    else:
        count_starting_and_ending_with_1 = 10 ** (n - 2)
    
    # Total count using inclusion-exclusion principle
    total_count = (count_starting_with_1 + count_ending_with_1 - 
                   count_starting_and_ending_with_1)
    
    return total_count
```

### Explanation of the Code
- We first check if `n` is less than 1, returning 0 in that case.
- We compute the counts for numbers starting with '1', ending with '1', and both starting and ending with '1'.
- Finally, we apply the inclusion-exclusion principle to get the total count and return it.

This implementation efficiently calculates the desired count based on the mathematical reasoning we derived.
