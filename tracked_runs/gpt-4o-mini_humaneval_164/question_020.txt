Response:
To solve the problem of sorting a space-delimited string of numerals represented as words (from "zero" to "nine"), we can break down the solution into several clear steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input is a string containing words that represent numbers from zero to nine, separated by spaces.
   - The output should be a string of these words sorted in ascending order based on their numerical values.

2. **Mapping Words to Numbers**:
   - We need a way to convert the words into their corresponding numerical values for sorting. This can be achieved using a dictionary that maps each word to its respective integer value.

3. **Splitting the Input String**:
   - We will split the input string into a list of words using the `split()` method. This will give us a list of the number words that we need to sort.

4. **Sorting the List**:
   - We can sort the list of words using the `sorted()` function. To ensure that the sorting is based on the numerical values, we will use the dictionary we created to get the corresponding integer for each word.

5. **Joining the Sorted List**:
   - After sorting, we will join the sorted list back into a single string with spaces separating the words.

6. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, we will return the sorted string.

### Implementation

Now that we have a clear plan, let's implement the function:

```python
from typing import List

def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    """ Input is a space-delimited string of numberals from 'zero' to 'nine'.
    Valid choices are 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight' and 'nine'.
    Return the string with numbers sorted from smallest to largest
    >>> sort_numbers('three one five')
    'one three five'
    """
    
    # Step 1: Create a mapping from words to their corresponding integer values
    word_to_number = {
        'zero': 0,
        'one': 1,
        'two': 2,
        'three': 3,
        'four': 4,
        'five': 5,
        'six': 6,
        'seven': 7,
        'eight': 8,
        'nine': 9
    }
    
    # Step 2: Split the input string into a list of words
    number_words = numbers.split()
    
    # Step 3: Sort the list of words based on their numerical values
    sorted_words = sorted(number_words, key=lambda word: word_to_number[word])
    
    # Step 4: Join the sorted list back into a single string
    sorted_string = ' '.join(sorted_words)
    
    # Step 5: Return the result
    return sorted_string

# Example usage
print(sort_numbers('three one five'))  # Output: 'one three five'
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We start by defining a dictionary `word_to_number` that maps each numeral word to its corresponding integer value.
- We then split the input string into a list of words using `split()`.
- The `sorted()` function is used to sort the list of words. The `key` argument is a lambda function that retrieves the numerical value of each word from the dictionary for sorting purposes.
- Finally, we join the sorted list back into a string using `' '.join()` and return the result.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the requirements of the problem.
