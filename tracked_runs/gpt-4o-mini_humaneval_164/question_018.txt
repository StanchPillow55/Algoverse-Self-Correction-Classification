Response:
To solve the problem of parsing a string representing musical notes in a special ASCII format, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps required to implement the `parse_music` function.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Input Format**: 
   - The input is a string where musical notes are represented by specific characters:
     - `'o'` represents a whole note, which lasts 4 beats.
     - `'o|'` represents a half note, which lasts 2 beats.
     - `'.|'` represents a quarter note, which lasts 1 beat.
   - Notes are separated by spaces in the input string.

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - We need to return a list of integers where each integer corresponds to the number of beats for each note parsed from the input string.

3. **Parsing the Input**:
   - We can split the input string by spaces to get individual note representations.
   - For each note, we will determine its corresponding beat value based on the defined legend.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Split the input string into a list of notes.
   - Initialize an empty list to store the beat values.
   - Iterate through the list of notes:
     - Check each note and append the corresponding beat value to the list based on the defined rules.
   - Finally, return the list of beat values.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """ Input to this function is a string representing musical notes in a special ASCII format.
    Your task is to parse this string and return list of integers corresponding to how many beats does each
    note last.

    Here is a legend:
    'o' - whole note, lasts four beats
    'o|' - half note, lasts two beats
    '.|' - quarter note, lasts one beat

    >>> parse_music('o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o')
    [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]
    """
    
    # Split the input string into individual notes
    notes = music_string.split()
    
    # Initialize an empty list to hold the beat values
    beats = []
    
    # Define a mapping of note representations to their beat values
    note_to_beats = {
        'o': 4,   # whole note
        'o|': 2,  # half note
        '.|': 1   # quarter note
    }
    
    # Iterate through each note and determine its beat value
    for note in notes:
        if note in note_to_beats:
            beats.append(note_to_beats[note])
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown note representation: {note}")
    
    return beats
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We start by importing the `List` type from the `typing` module for type hinting.
- The function `parse_music` takes a string `music_string` as input.
- We split the input string into a list of notes using the `split()` method.
- We initialize an empty list `beats` to store the beat values.
- We define a dictionary `note_to_beats` that maps each note representation to its corresponding beat value.
- We iterate through each note in the `notes` list, checking if it exists in the `note_to_beats` dictionary. If it does, we append the corresponding beat value to the `beats` list.
- If an unknown note representation is encountered, we raise a `ValueError` to handle unexpected input gracefully.
- Finally, we return the list of beat values.

This implementation effectively parses the musical notes and returns the desired output as specified in the problem statement.
