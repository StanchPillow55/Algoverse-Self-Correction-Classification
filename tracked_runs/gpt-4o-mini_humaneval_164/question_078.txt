Response:
To determine whether a given integer \( a \) is a perfect cube, we need to check if there exists an integer \( n \) such that \( n^3 = a \). 

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Perfect Cubes**:
   - A perfect cube is an integer that can be expressed as the cube of another integer. For example, \( 1^3 = 1 \), \( 2^3 = 8 \), \( (-1)^3 = -1 \), and \( 4^3 = 64 \).
   - Negative numbers can also be perfect cubes, as shown by \( (-1)^3 = -1 \).

2. **Mathematical Approach**:
   - To find if \( a \) is a perfect cube, we can compute the cube root of \( a \) and check if rounding this value to the nearest integer and cubing it gives us back \( a \).
   - We can use the `round()` function to get the nearest integer to the cube root of \( a \). This is because the cube root of a number can be a non-integer, and rounding will help us find the closest integer.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Calculate the cube root of \( a \) using the expression \( a^{1/3} \).
   - Round this value to the nearest integer.
   - Cube the rounded integer and check if it equals \( a \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - We need to consider both positive and negative integers, as well as zero.
   - The function should handle all integers since the problem states that the input is always valid.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above.

```python
def iscube(a):
    # Calculate the cube root of a
    cube_root = round(a ** (1/3))
    
    # Check if the cube of the rounded cube root equals a
    return cube_root ** 3 == a

# Test cases
print(iscube(1))    # True
print(iscube(2))    # False
print(iscube(-1))   # True
print(iscube(64))   # True
print(iscube(0))    # True
print(iscube(180))  # False
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define the function `iscube` that takes an integer \( a \).
- We compute the cube root of \( a \) using `a ** (1/3)` and round it to the nearest integer.
- We then check if cubing this rounded integer gives us back \( a \). If it does, we return `True`, indicating that \( a \) is a perfect cube; otherwise, we return `False`.

### Testing:
The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including positive cubes, negative cubes, and non-cubes. The function should correctly identify whether each input is a perfect cube or not.

Response:
To determine whether a given integer \( a \) is a perfect cube, we need to check if there exists an integer \( n \) such that \( n^3 = a \). 

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Perfect Cubes**:
   - A perfect cube is a number that can be expressed as the cube of an integer. For example:
     - \( 1 = 1^3 \)
     - \( -1 = (-1)^3 \)
     - \( 64 = 4^3 \)
     - \( 0 = 0^3 \)
   - Negative numbers can also be perfect cubes, as shown with \(-1\).

2. **Mathematical Approach**:
   - To check if \( a \) is a perfect cube, we can take the cube root of \( a \) and round it to the nearest integer. 
   - We then cube this integer and check if it equals \( a \).
   - This approach works for both positive and negative integers.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Use the `round()` function to find the nearest integer to the cube root of \( a \).
   - Use the `**` operator to compute the cube of this integer.
   - Compare the result with \( a \) to determine if \( a \) is a perfect cube.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - We need to consider \( a = 0 \) and negative values, but our approach will handle these naturally since the cube root of \( 0 \) is \( 0 \) and the cube root of negative numbers will yield negative integers.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above.

```python
def iscube(a):
    # Calculate the cube root of a and round it to the nearest integer
    n = round(a ** (1/3))
    
    # Check if n cubed equals a
    return n ** 3 == a
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We calculate the cube root of \( a \) using `a ** (1/3)`.
- We round this value to the nearest integer using `round()`.
- Finally, we check if cubing this integer gives us back \( a \). If it does, we return `True`, indicating that \( a \) is a perfect cube; otherwise, we return `False`.

### Testing the Function:
We can test the function with the provided examples to ensure it works correctly.

```python
print(iscube(1))    # True
print(iscube(2))    # False
print(iscube(-1))   # True
print(iscube(64))   # True
print(iscube(0))    # True
print(iscube(180))  # False
```

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for handling floating-point arithmetic and integer operations.

Response:
To solve the problem of determining whether a given integer \( a \) is a perfect cube, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps involved in our reasoning and then implement the solution.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding Perfect Cubes**: A perfect cube is an integer that can be expressed as \( n^3 \) where \( n \) is an integer. For example:
   - \( 1 = 1^3 \)
   - \( -1 = (-1)^3 \)
   - \( 64 = 4^3 \)
   - \( 0 = 0^3 \)

2. **Identifying the Range of \( n \)**: Since \( a \) can be negative, we need to consider both positive and negative integers. The cube root of a number can be calculated, and we can check if the cube of the integer part of that root equals \( a \).

3. **Using Integer Properties**: We can use the `round` function to find the closest integer to the cube root of \( a \). If \( n \) is the integer closest to the cube root of \( a \), we can check if \( n^3 \) equals \( a \).

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Calculate the cube root of \( a \).
   - Round the cube root to the nearest integer.
   - Check if the cube of that integer equals \( a \).

5. **Edge Cases**: We should also consider edge cases such as \( a = 0 \) and negative numbers.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above:

```python
def iscube(a):
    '''
    Write a function that takes an integer a and returns True 
    if this integer is a cube of some integer number.
    '''
    # Calculate the cube root of a
    cube_root = round(a ** (1/3))
    
    # Check if the cube of the rounded cube root equals a
    return cube_root ** 3 == a

# Testing the function with provided examples
print(iscube(1))    # True
print(iscube(2))    # False
print(iscube(-1))   # True
print(iscube(64))   # True
print(iscube(0))    # True
print(iscube(180))  # False
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We define the function `iscube` that takes an integer \( a \).
- We compute the cube root of \( a \) using the expression `a ** (1/3)`, which gives us a floating-point number.
- We round this value to the nearest integer using `round()`.
- Finally, we check if the cube of this rounded integer equals \( a \) and return the result.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, leveraging mathematical properties to determine if \( a \) is a perfect cube. The function should work correctly for all valid integer inputs.
