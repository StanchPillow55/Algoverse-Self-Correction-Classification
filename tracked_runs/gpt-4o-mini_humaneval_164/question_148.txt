Question:

def get_max_triples(n):
    """
    You are given a positive integer n. You have to create an integer array a of length n.
        For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), the value of a[i] = i * i - i + 1.
        Return the number of triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) of a where i < j < k, 
    and a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is a multiple of 3.

    Example :
        Input: n = 5
        Output: 1
        Explanation: 
        a = [1, 3, 7, 13, 21]
        The only valid triple is (1, 7, 13).

Response:
To solve the problem of counting the number of valid triples \((a[i], a[j], a[k])\) such that \(i < j < k\) and the sum \(a[i] + a[j] + a[k]\) is a multiple of 3, we can break down the problem into several steps.

### Step 1: Understanding the Array Definition
The array \(a\) is defined as:
\[ a[i] = i^2 - i + 1 \]
for \(i\) ranging from 1 to \(n\). We can compute the values of \(a[i]\) for all \(i\) in this range.

### Step 2: Modulo 3 Classification
Since we are interested in whether the sum of three elements is a multiple of 3, we can classify each element of the array \(a\) based on its value modulo 3. This means we will categorize each element into one of three groups:
- Group 0: \(a[i] \mod 3 = 0\)
- Group 1: \(a[i] \mod 3 = 1\)
- Group 2: \(a[i] \mod 3 = 2\)

### Step 3: Counting Elements in Each Group
We will count how many elements fall into each of these three groups. Let's denote:
- \(count_0\): the number of elements where \(a[i] \mod 3 = 0\)
- \(count_1\): the number of elements where \(a[i] \mod 3 = 1\)
- \(count_2\): the number of elements where \(a[i] \mod 3 = 2\)

### Step 4: Finding Valid Triples
To find valid triples \((a[i], a[j], a[k])\) such that their sum is a multiple of 3, we can consider the following combinations:
1. All three from Group 0: \(\binom{count_0}{3}\)
2. All three from Group 1: \(\binom{count_1}{3}\)
3. All three from Group 2: \(\binom{count_2}{3}\)
4. One from each group: \(count_0 \times count_1 \times count_2\)

### Step 5: Implementing the Solution
Now that we have a clear plan, we can implement the solution in Python.

```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    # Step 1: Create the array a
    a = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    
    # Step 2: Count occurrences of each group based on modulo 3
    count_0 = count_1 = count_2 = 0
    
    for value in a:
        if value % 3 == 0:
            count_0 += 1
        elif value % 3 == 1:
            count_1 += 1
        else:
            count_2 += 1
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the number of valid triples
    def combinations_of_3(count):
        if count < 3:
            return 0
        return count * (count - 1) * (count - 2) // 6
    
    total_triples = (
        combinations_of_3(count_0) +
        combinations_of_3(count_1) +
        combinations_of_3(count_2) +
        (count_0 * count_1 * count_2)
    )
    
    return total_triples

# Example usage
print(get_max_triples(5))  # Output: 1
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. We create the array \(a\) using a list comprehension.
2. We count how many numbers fall into each of the three groups based on their modulo 3 value.
3. We define a helper function `combinations_of_3` to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 items from a group.
4. Finally, we sum the valid combinations from each group and return the total count.

This approach is efficient and straightforward, ensuring that we correctly count the valid triples based on the specified conditions.
