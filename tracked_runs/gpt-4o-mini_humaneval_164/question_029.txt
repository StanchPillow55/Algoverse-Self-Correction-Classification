Response:
To solve the problem of concatenating a list of strings into a single string, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**: 
   - The input is a list of strings (`List[str]`).
   - The output is a single string that is the result of concatenating all the strings in the list.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the input list is empty (`[]`), the output should be an empty string (`''`).
   - If the list contains strings, we need to ensure that they are concatenated without any additional characters in between.

3. **Choosing a Method for Concatenation**:
   - Python provides several ways to concatenate strings. The most efficient way to concatenate a list of strings is to use the `str.join()` method. This method is preferred because it is optimized for joining multiple strings and is more efficient than using a loop to concatenate strings one by one.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - We will define the function `concatenate` that takes a list of strings as input.
   - We will use the `join()` method on an empty string (`''`) to concatenate the strings in the list.
   - Finally, we will return the concatenated string.

5. **Testing the Function**:
   - We will include the provided test cases in the function's docstring to ensure that our implementation works as expected.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:
- We import `List` from the `typing` module to specify the type of the input parameter.
- The function `concatenate` is defined to take a single parameter `strings`, which is expected to be a list of strings.
- Inside the function, we use `''.join(strings)` to concatenate all the strings in the list. The `join()` method takes an iterable (in this case, the list of strings) and concatenates them into a single string, using the string on which it is called (an empty string `''`) as the separator.
- The function returns the resulting concatenated string.

### Testing the Function:
You can test the function using the provided examples in the docstring. In a Python environment, you can run the following:

```python
import doctest
doctest.testmod()
```

This will automatically run the tests and verify that the function behaves as expected.
