Question:

def simplify(x, n):
    """Your task is to implement a function that will simplify the expression
    x * n. The function returns True if x * n evaluates to a whole number and False
    otherwise. Both x and n, are string representation of a fraction, and have the following format,
    <numerator>/<denominator> where both numerator and denominator are positive whole numbers.

    You can assume that x, and n are valid fractions, and do not have zero as denominator.

    simplify("1/5", "5/1") = True
    simplify("1/6", "2/1") = False
    simplify("7/10", "10/2") = False

Response:
To solve the problem of determining whether the product of two fractions, represented as strings, results in a whole number, we can break down the task into several clear steps:

1. **Understanding the Input Format**: Each input is a string representing a fraction in the form of "numerator/denominator". We need to extract the numerator and denominator from these strings.

2. **Converting Strings to Integers**: Once we have the numerator and denominator, we will convert them from strings to integers for mathematical operations.

3. **Calculating the Product**: The product of two fractions \( x \) and \( n \) can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{product} = \frac{\text{numerator}_x}{\text{denominator}_x} \times \frac{\text{numerator}_n}{\text{denominator}_n} = \frac{\text{numerator}_x \times \text{numerator}_n}{\text{denominator}_x \times \text{denominator}_n}
   \]
   This means we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.

4. **Checking for Whole Number**: A fraction is a whole number if the numerator is divisible by the denominator without leaving a remainder. Thus, we need to check if:
   \[
   \text{numerator}_x \times \text{numerator}_n \mod (\text{denominator}_x \times \text{denominator}_n) == 0
   \]

5. **Returning the Result**: Based on the divisibility check, we will return `True` if the product is a whole number and `False` otherwise.

Now, let's implement this logic in the `simplify` function.

```python
def simplify(x, n):
    """Check if the product of two fractions x and n is a whole number."""
    
    # Split the fractions into numerator and denominator
    num_x, denom_x = map(int, x.split('/'))
    num_n, denom_n = map(int, n.split('/'))
    
    # Calculate the product's numerator and denominator
    product_numerator = num_x * num_n
    product_denominator = denom_x * denom_n
    
    # Check if the product is a whole number
    return product_numerator % product_denominator == 0

# Test cases
print(simplify("1/5", "5/1"))  # True
print(simplify("1/6", "2/1"))  # False
print(simplify("7/10", "10/2"))  # False
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:
- We use `split('/')` to separate the numerator and denominator for both fractions.
- We convert these string values to integers using `map(int, ...)`.
- We calculate the product of the numerators and the product of the denominators.
- Finally, we check if the product of the numerators is divisible by the product of the denominators using the modulus operator `%`. If it is divisible (i.e., the remainder is zero), we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.

This implementation efficiently checks if the product of the two fractions results in a whole number.

    """Check if the product of two fractions x and n is a whole number."""
    
    # Split the fractions into numerator and denominator
    num_x, denom_x = map(int, x.split('/'))
    num_n, denom_n = map(int, n.split('/'))
    
    # Calculate the product's numerator and denominator
    product_numerator = num_x * num_n
    product_denominator = denom_x * denom_n
    
    # Check if the product is a whole number
    return product_numerator % product_denominator == 0
