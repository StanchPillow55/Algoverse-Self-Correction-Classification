Response:
To solve the problem of converting a number `x` from base 10 to a different base (less than 10), we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps involved in this conversion process.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Base Conversion**:
   - Base conversion involves repeatedly dividing the number by the new base and keeping track of the remainders. The remainders represent the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit (rightmost).
   - For example, to convert the decimal number 8 to base 3:
     - 8 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 2 (the least significant digit).
     - 2 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 2 (the next digit).
     - Reading the remainders from bottom to top gives us '22'.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If `x` is 0, the representation in any base is simply '0'.
   - We need to ensure that the base is valid (less than 10) as per the problem statement.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Initialize an empty list to store the digits (remainders).
   - Use a loop to divide `x` by `base` until `x` becomes 0.
   - In each iteration, append the remainder to the list.
   - After the loop, reverse the list to get the correct order of digits.
   - Join the list into a string and return it.

### Implementation:

Now that we have a clear understanding of the steps involved, let's implement the function `change_base`.

```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str:
    """Change numerical base of input number x to base.
    return string representation after the conversion.
    base numbers are less than 10.
    >>> change_base(8, 3)
    '22'
    >>> change_base(8, 2)
    '1000'
    >>> change_base(7, 2)
    '111'
    """
    if base < 2 or base >= 10:
        raise ValueError("Base must be between 2 and 9 inclusive.")
    
    if x == 0:
        return '0'
    
    digits = []
    
    while x > 0:
        remainder = x % base
        digits.append(str(remainder))  # Store the remainder as a string
        x //= base  # Update x to the quotient
    
    # The digits are in reverse order, so we need to reverse them
    digits.reverse()
    
    return ''.join(digits)  # Join the list into a string and return

# Example usage:
print(change_base(8, 3))  # Output: '22'
print(change_base(8, 2))  # Output: '1000'
print(change_base(7, 2))  # Output: '111'
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function starts by checking if the base is valid. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.
- It handles the special case where `x` is 0 by returning '0'.
- The main loop continues until `x` is reduced to 0, collecting remainders in a list.
- After collecting all digits, the list is reversed to get the correct order, and then it is joined into a single string for the final output.

This implementation efficiently converts a number from base 10 to any base less than 10, following the outlined reasoning and steps.
