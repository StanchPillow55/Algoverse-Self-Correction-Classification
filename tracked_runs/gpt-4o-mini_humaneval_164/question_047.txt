Response:
To solve the problem of computing the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence, we need to understand the sequence's definition and how to implement it efficiently without recursion.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Sequence**:
   - The Fib4 sequence is defined as:
     - fib4(0) = 0
     - fib4(1) = 0
     - fib4(2) = 2
     - fib4(3) = 0
     - For n >= 4: fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)
   - This means that each term after the first four is the sum of the previous four terms.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - We have four base cases that we need to handle explicitly:
     - fib4(0) = 0
     - fib4(1) = 0
     - fib4(2) = 2
     - fib4(3) = 0

3. **Iterative Approach**:
   - Since we are instructed not to use recursion, we will use an iterative approach to compute the sequence.
   - We can maintain a list or an array to store the computed values of the sequence up to n.
   - For each n from 4 to the desired n, we will compute fib4(n) using the previously computed values.

4. **Space Optimization**:
   - Instead of storing all computed values, we can optimize space by only keeping the last four computed values, as they are the only ones needed to compute the next value.

5. **Implementation**:
   - We will define the function `fib4(n)` that implements the above logic.

### Implementation

Here is the complete function definition based on the reasoning above:

```python
def fib4(n: int) -> int:
    """The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence.  Do not use recursion.
    >>> fib4(5)
    4
    >>> fib4(6)
    8
    >>> fib4(7)
    14
    """
    
    # Base cases
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize the first four values
    fib_values = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    
    # Compute values from 4 to n
    for i in range(4, n + 1):
        next_value = fib_values[0] + fib_values[1] + fib_values[2] + fib_values[3]
        # Update the list to keep only the last four values
        fib_values[0] = fib_values[1]
        fib_values[1] = fib_values[2]
        fib_values[2] = fib_values[3]
        fib_values[3] = next_value
    
    return fib_values[3]

# Example usage
print(fib4(5))  # Output: 4
print(fib4(6))  # Output: 8
print(fib4(7))  # Output: 14
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function starts by checking for the base cases and returning the corresponding values.
- For values of n greater than 3, it initializes a list `fib_values` to store the last four computed values of the sequence.
- It then iteratively computes the next value in the sequence by summing the last four values and updates the list accordingly.
- Finally, it returns the last computed value, which corresponds to fib4(n). 

This approach is efficient in both time and space, as it runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) space.
