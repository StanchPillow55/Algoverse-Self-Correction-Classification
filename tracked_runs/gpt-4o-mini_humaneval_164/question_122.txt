Response:
To solve the problem of summing all odd elements that are located in even positions of a given list, we can break down the task into a series of clear steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding Positions**: In programming, list indices typically start at 0. Therefore, the "even positions" in a list correspond to indices 0, 2, 4, etc. 

2. **Identifying Odd Numbers**: An integer is considered odd if it is not divisible by 2. This can be checked using the modulus operator (`%`). Specifically, a number `n` is odd if `n % 2 != 0`.

3. **Iterating Through the List**: We need to iterate through the list and check each element at the even indices to see if it is odd. If it is, we will add it to a cumulative sum.

4. **Implementation**: We will use a loop to go through the list, checking the index of each element. If the index is even and the element is odd, we will add that element to our sum.

5. **Returning the Result**: Finally, we will return the computed sum.

### Implementation

Now that we have a clear understanding of the steps involved, we can implement the solution in Python.

```python
def solution(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions."""
    total_sum = 0  # Initialize the sum to zero
    
    # Iterate through the list using index
    for index in range(len(lst)):
        # Check if the index is even
        if index % 2 == 0:
            # Check if the element at this index is odd
            if lst[index] % 2 != 0:
                total_sum += lst[index]  # Add to the sum if it's odd
    
    return total_sum  # Return the final sum
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We initialize `total_sum` to zero to keep track of the sum of odd numbers found at even indices.
- We use a `for` loop to iterate over the indices of the list using `range(len(lst))`.
- Inside the loop, we first check if the current index is even using `index % 2 == 0`.
- If the index is even, we then check if the corresponding element in the list is odd using `lst[index] % 2 != 0`.
- If both conditions are satisfied, we add the element to `total_sum`.
- Finally, we return `total_sum`, which contains the sum of all odd elements at even positions.

### Testing the Function

We can test the function with the provided examples to ensure it works correctly:

```python
print(solution([5, 8, 7, 1]))  # Expected output: 12
print(solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]))  # Expected output: 9
print(solution([30, 13, 24, 321]))  # Expected output: 0
```

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem requirements.
