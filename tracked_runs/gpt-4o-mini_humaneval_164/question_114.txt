Response:
To solve the problem, we need to create a function `odd_count(lst)` that processes a list of strings, where each string consists of digits. The goal is to count the number of odd digits in each string and then format a specific output string based on that count.

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input is a list of strings, each containing only digits.
   - The output is a list of strings, where each string follows the format:
     ```
     "the number of odd elements Xn the strXng X of the Xnput."
     ```
     Here, `X` is the count of odd digits in the corresponding input string.

2. **Identifying Odd Digits**:
   - Odd digits are `1, 3, 5, 7, 9`. We can check if a digit is odd by converting it to an integer and checking if it is not divisible by 2.

3. **Counting Odd Digits**:
   - For each string in the input list, we will iterate through each character, check if it is an odd digit, and maintain a count of such digits.

4. **Formatting the Output**:
   - Once we have the count of odd digits, we will format the output string according to the specified format, replacing all instances of `X` with the count.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, we will return a list of formatted strings.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def odd_count(lst):
    """Given a list of strings, where each string consists of only digits, return a list.
    Each element i of the output should be "the number of odd elements in the
    string i of the input." where all the i's should be replaced by the number
    of odd digits in the i'th string of the input.
    """
    result = []
    
    for string in lst:
        # Count odd digits
        odd_count = sum(1 for char in string if int(char) % 2 != 0)
        
        # Format the output string
        formatted_string = f"the number of odd elements {odd_count}n the str{odd_count}ng {odd_count} of the {odd_count}nput."
        
        # Append to the result list
        result.append(formatted_string)
    
    return result

# Example usage
print(odd_count(['1234567']))  # ["the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput."]
print(odd_count(['3', "11111111"]))  # ["the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.", "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput."]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define the function `odd_count(lst)` that takes a list of strings as input.
- We initialize an empty list `result` to store the formatted output strings.
- We loop through each string in the input list:
  - We use a generator expression to count the odd digits by checking if each character (converted to an integer) is odd.
  - We then format the output string using an f-string, replacing `X` with the count of odd digits.
- Finally, we return the list of formatted strings.

This implementation should work correctly for the given problem and produce the expected output.
