Question:

def sort_array(arr):
    """
    In this Kata, you have to sort an array of non-negative integers according to
    number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order.

    It must be implemented like this:
    >>> sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    >>> sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]) == [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]

Response:
To solve the problem of sorting an array of non-negative integers based on the number of ones in their binary representation, we can break down the task into several clear steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding Binary Representation**:
   - Each integer can be represented in binary format, and the number of '1's in this representation is what we will use as the primary sorting criterion.

2. **Sorting Criteria**:
   - We need to sort the integers first by the count of '1's in their binary representation (in ascending order).
   - If two integers have the same number of '1's, we will sort them by their decimal value (also in ascending order).

3. **Using Python's Built-in Functions**:
   - Python provides a built-in function `bin()` that converts an integer to its binary representation as a string. We can use this to count the number of '1's using the `count('1')` method.
   - We can use the `sorted()` function to sort the list, which allows us to specify a custom sorting key.

4. **Defining the Sorting Key**:
   - The sorting key will be a tuple where the first element is the count of '1's in the binary representation and the second element is the integer itself. This way, Python will sort primarily by the first element and secondarily by the second element.

5. **Implementation**:
   - We will define the function `sort_array(arr)` that takes a list of non-negative integers and returns the sorted list based on the criteria mentioned.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above:

```python
def sort_array(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array of non-negative integers according to the number of ones in their binary representation
    in ascending order. For similar number of ones, sorts based on decimal value.
    
    :param arr: List of non-negative integers
    :return: Sorted list of integers
    """
    # Sort using a custom key: (number of 1's in binary representation, the integer itself)
    return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x))

# Example usage:
print(sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sort_array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
print(sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]))  # Output: [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `sort_array` takes a list `arr` as input.
- We use the `sorted()` function with a lambda function as the key.
- The lambda function computes a tuple for each element:
  - `bin(x).count('1')` gives the number of '1's in the binary representation of `x`.
  - `x` is the integer itself.
- The `sorted()` function sorts the list based on the tuples generated by the lambda function, ensuring the desired order.

### Testing the Function:
We can test the function with various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected. The provided examples in the problem statement can be used for this purpose.
