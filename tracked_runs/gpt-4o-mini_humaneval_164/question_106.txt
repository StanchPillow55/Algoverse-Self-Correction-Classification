Question:

def by_length(arr):
    """
    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,
    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from
    "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine".

    For example:
      arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]   
            -> sort arr -> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8] 
            -> reverse arr -> [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]
      return ["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One"]
    
      If the array is empty, return an empty array:
      arr = []
      return []
    
      If the array has any strange number ignore it:
      arr = [1, -1 , 55] 
            -> sort arr -> [-1, 1, 55]
            -> reverse arr -> [55, 1, -1]
      return = ['One']

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to follow a series of steps to transform the input array of integers according to the specified requirements. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Filter the Input Array
We need to filter the input array to only include integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive). This means we will iterate through the array and select only those integers that meet this criterion.

### Step 2: Sort the Filtered Array
Once we have the filtered array, we will sort it in ascending order. This will allow us to prepare it for the next step, which is reversing the order.

### Step 3: Reverse the Sorted Array
After sorting, we will reverse the sorted array. This will give us the integers in descending order.

### Step 4: Map Integers to Their Corresponding Names
Next, we will replace each integer in the reversed array with its corresponding name. We can use a predefined list or dictionary to map integers from 1 to 9 to their respective names ("One", "Two", ..., "Nine").

### Step 5: Return the Result
Finally, we will return the list of names. If the input array is empty or contains no valid integers (1-9), we should return an empty list.

### Implementation
Now that we have a clear plan, let's implement the function `by_length`:

```python
def by_length(arr):
    """
    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,
    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from
    "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine".
    """
    # Step 1: Filter the array to include only integers between 1 and 9
    filtered = [num for num in arr if 1 <= num <= 9]
    
    # Step 2: Sort the filtered array
    filtered.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Reverse the sorted array
    filtered.reverse()
    
    # Step 4: Map integers to their corresponding names
    number_to_name = {
        1: "One",
        2: "Two",
        3: "Three",
        4: "Four",
        5: "Five",
        6: "Six",
        7: "Seven",
        8: "Eight",
        9: "Nine"
    }
    
    # Replace each number with its corresponding name
    result = [number_to_name[num] for num in filtered]
    
    # Step 5: Return the result
    return result

# Example usage:
print(by_length([2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]))  # Output: ["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One"]
print(by_length([]))  # Output: []
print(by_length([1, -1, 55]))  # Output: ["One"]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Filtering**: We use a list comprehension to create a new list `filtered` that contains only the integers between 1 and 9.
2. **Sorting**: We call the `sort()` method on the `filtered` list to sort it in ascending order.
3. **Reversing**: We use the `reverse()` method to reverse the sorted list.
4. **Mapping**: We create a dictionary `number_to_name` that maps integers to their corresponding names. We then use another list comprehension to create the `result` list by replacing each integer in `filtered` with its name.
5. **Returning the Result**: Finally, we return the `result` list.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem requirements.
