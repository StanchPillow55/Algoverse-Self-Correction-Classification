Response:
To solve the problem of creating the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps involved in the solution.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding Palindromes**: A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, "racecar" and "level" are palindromes.

2. **Identifying the Problem**: We need to find the shortest palindrome that starts with a given string. This means we need to identify how much of the string can remain unchanged while still allowing us to create a palindrome.

3. **Finding the Longest Palindromic Suffix**: The key to solving this problem is to find the longest suffix of the input string that is a palindrome. Once we identify this suffix, we can determine what part of the string needs to be mirrored and appended to the end to form a palindrome.

4. **Constructing the Palindrome**:
   - If the entire string is a palindrome, we can simply return it.
   - If not, we will take the non-palindromic prefix (the part of the string before the palindromic suffix) and append its reverse to the end of the original string.

5. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Create a helper function to check if a substring is a palindrome.
   - Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning to find the longest palindromic suffix.
   - Construct the palindrome by appending the reverse of the non-palindromic prefix to the original string.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the `make_palindrome` function based on the reasoning above.

```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    """
    # Edge case for empty string
    if not string:
        return ''
    
    # Find the longest palindromic suffix
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if is_palindrome(string[i:]):
            # If string[i:] is a palindrome, then string[:i] is the prefix we need to reverse
            prefix = string[:i]
            return string + prefix[::-1]
    
    # If no palindromic suffix is found, the entire string is non-palindromic
    # This case should not happen since at least the last character is a palindrome
    return string + string[:-1][::-1]  # Fallback case

# Testing the function with provided examples
print(make_palindrome(''))      # Output: ''
print(make_palindrome('cat'))    # Output: 'catac'
print(make_palindrome('cata'))   # Output: 'catac'
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The `is_palindrome` function checks if a given string is a palindrome.
- The `make_palindrome` function starts by checking for an empty string. If the string is empty, it returns an empty string.
- It then iterates through the string to find the longest palindromic suffix. For each index `i`, it checks if the substring from `i` to the end is a palindrome.
- Once it finds the longest palindromic suffix, it takes the prefix (the part before the suffix), reverses it, and appends it to the original string to form the palindrome.
- Finally, it returns the constructed palindrome.

This solution is efficient and straightforward, ensuring that we find the shortest palindrome that starts with the given string.
