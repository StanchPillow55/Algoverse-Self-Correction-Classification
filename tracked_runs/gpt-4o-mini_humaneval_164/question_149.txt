Question:

def bf(planet1, planet2):
    '''
    There are eight planets in our solar system: the closerst to the Sun 
    is Mercury, the next one is Venus, then Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, 
    Uranus, Neptune.
    Write a function that takes two planet names as strings planet1 and planet2. 
    The function should return a tuple containing all planets whose orbits are 
    located between the orbit of planet1 and the orbit of planet2, sorted by 
    the proximity to the sun. 
    The function should return an empty tuple if planet1 or planet2
    are not correct planet names. 
    Examples
    bf("Jupiter", "Neptune") ==> ("Saturn", "Uranus")
    bf("Earth", "Mercury") ==> ("Venus")
    bf("Mercury", "Uranus") ==> ("Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn")

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to create a function that identifies the planets located between two given planets in the solar system. The steps to approach this problem are as follows:

1. **Define the Order of Planets**: We need to establish the order of the planets from the Sun. This can be done using a list where the index represents the proximity to the Sun.

2. **Input Validation**: We need to check if the provided planet names are valid. If either of the planet names is not in our list of planets, we should return an empty tuple.

3. **Determine Indices**: Once we have validated the input, we will find the indices of the two planets in our list. This will help us determine the range of planets that lie between them.

4. **Extract Planets in Between**: Using the indices, we can slice the list of planets to get the ones that are located between the two specified planets.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the result as a tuple.

Now, let's implement this step-by-step in the function `bf`.

```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    # Step 1: Define the order of planets
    planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]
    
    # Step 2: Validate the input planets
    if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:
        return ()
    
    # Step 3: Get the indices of the planets
    index1 = planets.index(planet1)
    index2 = planets.index(planet2)
    
    # Step 4: Determine the range of indices
    start_index = min(index1, index2) + 1  # Start from the next planet
    end_index = max(index1, index2)  # End at the previous planet
    
    # Step 5: Extract the planets in between
    in_between_planets = planets[start_index:end_index]
    
    # Step 6: Return the result as a tuple
    return tuple(in_between_planets)

# Example usage
print(bf("Jupiter", "Neptune"))  # Output: ("Saturn", "Uranus")
print(bf("Earth", "Mercury"))    # Output: ("Venus",)
print(bf("Mercury", "Uranus"))   # Output: ("Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn")
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first define the list of planets in the order of their proximity to the Sun.
- We check if both `planet1` and `planet2` are valid by checking their presence in the `planets` list. If either is invalid, we return an empty tuple.
- We find the indices of the two planets using the `index()` method.
- We determine the range of indices to slice the list of planets. We add 1 to the smaller index to start from the next planet and use the larger index to slice up to (but not including) that planet.
- Finally, we convert the resulting list of planets into a tuple and return it.

This implementation effectively meets the requirements of the problem statement.
