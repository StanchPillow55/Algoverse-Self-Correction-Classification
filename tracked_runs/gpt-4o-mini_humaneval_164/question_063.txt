Response:
To solve the problem of finding the derivative of a polynomial represented by its coefficients, we need to understand how polynomial differentiation works.

### Understanding the Problem

A polynomial can be expressed in the form:
\[ P(x) = a_0 + a_1 \cdot x + a_2 \cdot x^2 + \ldots + a_n \cdot x^n \]
where \( a_i \) are the coefficients and \( n \) is the degree of the polynomial.

The derivative of a polynomial is calculated using the power rule:
- The derivative of \( a_i \cdot x^i \) is \( i \cdot a_i \cdot x^{i-1} \).

### Steps to Derive the Polynomial

1. **Identify the Coefficients**: The input is a list of coefficients where the index represents the power of \( x \).
2. **Apply the Power Rule**: For each coefficient \( a_i \) at index \( i \):
   - If \( i = 0 \) (the constant term), its derivative is 0 and should not be included in the result.
   - For \( i > 0 \), the derivative term will be \( i \cdot a_i \) and will be placed at index \( i-1 \) in the result list.
3. **Construct the Result**: Collect all the derivative coefficients into a new list.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def derivative(xs: list):
    """ 
    xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
    xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
    Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.
    
    >>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
    [1, 4, 12, 20]
    >>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 6]
    """
    # Initialize an empty list to hold the derivative coefficients
    derivative_coeffs = []
    
    # Iterate over the coefficients with their indices
    for i in range(1, len(xs)):  # Start from 1 to skip the constant term
        # Calculate the derivative coefficient
        derivative_coeff = i * xs[i]
        # Append the derivative coefficient to the result list
        derivative_coeffs.append(derivative_coeff)
    
    return derivative_coeffs
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Function Definition**: We define the function `derivative` that takes a list of coefficients `xs`.
2. **Result List**: We initialize an empty list `derivative_coeffs` to store the coefficients of the derivative.
3. **Loop Through Coefficients**: We loop through the indices starting from 1 (to skip the constant term):
   - For each index `i`, we calculate the derivative coefficient as `i * xs[i]`.
   - We append this coefficient to the `derivative_coeffs` list.
4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the list of derivative coefficients.

### Testing

We can test the function using the provided examples to ensure it works correctly. The expected outputs match the calculations we performed based on the polynomial differentiation rules. 

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the principles of polynomial differentiation.
