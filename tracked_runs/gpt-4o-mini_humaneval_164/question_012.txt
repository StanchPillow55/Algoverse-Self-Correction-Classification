Response:
To solve the problem of performing a binary XOR operation on two strings consisting of '0's and '1's, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:

### Step 1: Understand the XOR Operation
The XOR (exclusive OR) operation works as follows for binary digits:
- 0 XOR 0 = 0
- 0 XOR 1 = 1
- 1 XOR 0 = 1
- 1 XOR 1 = 0

This means that the result of XOR is '1' if the bits are different and '0' if they are the same.

### Step 2: Input Validation
Before performing the XOR operation, we should ensure that both input strings are of the same length. If they are not, we need to handle this case. For simplicity, we can assume that the inputs are valid as per the problem statement.

### Step 3: Implement the XOR Logic
We will iterate through the characters of both strings simultaneously, apply the XOR logic for each pair of characters, and build the result string.

### Step 4: Return the Result
Finally, we will return the resulting string after performing the XOR operation on all corresponding bits.

### Implementation
Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above.

```python
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Input are two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    Perform binary XOR on these inputs and return result also as a string.
    >>> string_xor('010', '110')
    '100'
    """
    # Ensure both strings are of the same length
    if len(a) != len(b):
        raise ValueError("Input strings must be of the same length.")
    
    # Initialize an empty result string
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through both strings
    for char_a, char_b in zip(a, b):
        # Perform XOR operation
        if char_a == char_b:
            result.append('0')
        else:
            result.append('1')
    
    # Join the list into a string and return
    return ''.join(result)

# Example usage
print(string_xor('010', '110'))  # Output: '100'
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Input Validation**: We check if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If not, we raise a `ValueError`.
2. **Result Initialization**: We create an empty list `result` to store the XOR results.
3. **Iteration**: We use `zip` to iterate over both strings simultaneously. For each pair of characters:
   - If they are the same, we append '0' to the result.
   - If they are different, we append '1' to the result.
4. **Return the Result**: We join the list of characters into a single string and return it.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the requirements of the problem statement.
