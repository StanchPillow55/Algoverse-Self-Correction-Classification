Response:
To solve the problem of sorting a list of integers based on the sum of their digits, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps required to implement the `order_by_points` function.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input is a list of integers, which can include positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero.
   - The output should be a new list sorted in ascending order based on the sum of the digits of each integer.

2. **Calculating the Sum of Digits**:
   - For each integer, we need to calculate the sum of its digits. This involves:
     - Converting the integer to its absolute value (to ignore the sign).
     - Converting the absolute value to a string to iterate over each character.
     - Converting each character back to an integer and summing them up.

3. **Sorting Criteria**:
   - We need to sort the integers primarily by the sum of their digits.
   - If two integers have the same sum of digits, we should maintain their original order (this is a stable sort).

4. **Implementation**:
   - We can use Python's built-in `sorted()` function, which is stable and allows us to specify a custom sorting key.
   - The key for sorting will be a tuple consisting of the sum of digits and the original index of the integer in the list.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - We should handle the case where the input list is empty, which should simply return an empty list.

### Implementation

Now that we have a clear understanding of the requirements and the approach, we can implement the function.

```python
def order_by_points(nums):
    """
    Sorts the given list of integers in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.
    If there are several items with similar sum of their digits, they are ordered based on their index in the original list.
    
    :param nums: List of integers
    :return: List of integers sorted by the sum of their digits
    """
    
    def digit_sum(n):
        # Calculate the sum of the digits of the absolute value of n
        return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(n)))
    
    # Use sorted with a key that sorts by digit sum and original index
    return sorted(nums, key=lambda x: (digit_sum(x), nums.index(x)))

# Example usage
print(order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]))  # Output: [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
print(order_by_points([]))                       # Output: []
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The `digit_sum` function computes the sum of the digits of a given integer `n`.
- The `sorted()` function is called with a lambda function as the key. This lambda function returns a tuple:
  - The first element is the sum of the digits of the integer.
  - The second element is the index of the integer in the original list, ensuring that the sort is stable for integers with the same digit sum.
- Finally, the sorted list is returned.

This implementation efficiently sorts the list according to the specified criteria and handles edge cases appropriately.

Response:
To solve the problem of sorting a list of integers based on the sum of their digits, we need to break down the requirements and implement a solution step by step.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - We are given a list of integers (`nums`).
   - We need to sort this list based on the sum of the digits of each integer.
   - If two integers have the same digit sum, they should maintain their original order (this is known as "stable sorting").

2. **Calculating the Sum of Digits**:
   - For each integer, we need to compute the sum of its digits. This involves:
     - Converting the integer to its absolute value (to handle negative numbers).
     - Converting the absolute value to a string to iterate over each character (digit).
     - Converting each character back to an integer and summing them up.

3. **Sorting the List**:
   - We can use Python's built-in `sorted()` function, which allows us to specify a custom sorting key.
   - The key for sorting will be a tuple consisting of:
     - The sum of the digits of the integer.
     - The original index of the integer in the list (to maintain stability).

4. **Implementation**:
   - We will define a helper function to calculate the sum of digits.
   - We will then use this helper function in the sorting key.

### Implementation

Here is the complete function definition based on the reasoning above:

```python
def order_by_points(nums):
    """
    Sorts the given list of integers in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.
    If there are several items with similar sum of their digits, order them based on their index in the original list.
    
    Args:
    nums (list of int): The list of integers to sort.
    
    Returns:
    list of int: The sorted list of integers.
    """
    
    def sum_of_digits(n):
        """Helper function to calculate the sum of digits of an integer."""
        return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(n)))  # Use abs to ignore negative sign

    # Create a sorted list using the sum of digits as the key
    sorted_nums = sorted(nums, key=lambda x: (sum_of_digits(x), nums.index(x)))
    
    return sorted_nums

# Example usage:
print(order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]))  # Output: [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
print(order_by_points([]))  # Output: []
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The `sum_of_digits` function computes the sum of the digits of a number by converting it to a string, iterating over each character, converting it back to an integer, and summing them up.
- The `sorted()` function sorts `nums` using a lambda function as the key. The key is a tuple where:
  - The first element is the sum of digits of the number.
  - The second element is the index of the number in the original list, ensuring that the sort is stable.
- Finally, the sorted list is returned.

This implementation meets the requirements of the problem and handles edge cases such as empty lists.

Response:
To solve the problem of sorting a list of integers based on the sum of their digits, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the requirements and the steps needed to implement the solution.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input is a list of integers (`nums`).
   - The output should be a new list sorted in ascending order based on the sum of the digits of each integer.
   - If two integers have the same digit sum, they should maintain their original order from the input list.

2. **Calculating the Sum of Digits**:
   - We need a helper function that calculates the sum of the digits of a given integer. This function should handle both positive and negative integers correctly.
   - For negative integers, we can ignore the sign when calculating the sum of digits.

3. **Sorting the List**:
   - We can use Python's built-in sorting capabilities. The `sorted()` function allows us to specify a custom sorting key.
   - The key will be a tuple consisting of the sum of the digits and the original index of the integer in the list. This ensures that if two integers have the same digit sum, they will be sorted by their original order.

4. **Implementation**:
   - We will define the main function `order_by_points(nums)` and the helper function `digit_sum(n)`.
   - We will use a list comprehension to create a list of tuples containing each number, its digit sum, and its index.
   - Finally, we will sort this list of tuples and extract the sorted numbers.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the solution based on the above reasoning.

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    """Helper function to calculate the sum of digits of an integer."""
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(n)))

def order_by_points(nums):
    """
    Sorts the given list of integers in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.
    If there are several items with similar sum of their digits, they are ordered based on their index in the original list.
    
    Args:
    nums (list of int): The list of integers to sort.
    
    Returns:
    list of int: The sorted list of integers.
    """
    # Create a list of tuples (digit_sum, index, number)
    indexed_nums = [(digit_sum(num), index, num) for index, num in enumerate(nums)]
    
    # Sort by (digit_sum, index)
    sorted_nums = sorted(indexed_nums, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
    
    # Extract the sorted numbers
    return [num for _, _, num in sorted_nums]

# Example usage
print(order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]))  # Output: [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
print(order_by_points([]))                       # Output: []
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The `digit_sum` function computes the sum of the digits of a number by converting it to a string, taking the absolute value, and summing the integer values of each character.
- The `order_by_points` function constructs a list of tuples where each tuple contains the digit sum, the original index, and the number itself.
- We then sort this list of tuples using a lambda function that sorts primarily by the digit sum and secondarily by the original index.
- Finally, we extract and return the sorted numbers from the tuples.

This implementation meets the requirements of the problem and handles edge cases such as empty lists and negative numbers effectively.
