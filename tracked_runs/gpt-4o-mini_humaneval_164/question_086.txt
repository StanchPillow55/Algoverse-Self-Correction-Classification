Response:
To solve the problem of adding even elements that are located at odd indices in a given list of integers, we can break down the task into a series of logical steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - We are given a list of integers (`lst`).
   - We need to identify elements that are even and are located at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...).
   - We will sum these identified elements and return the result.

2. **Identifying Odd Indices**:
   - In Python, list indices start from 0. Therefore, the odd indices are 1, 3, 5, etc.
   - We can use the `range` function to generate these indices.

3. **Checking for Even Numbers**:
   - An integer is even if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., `number % 2 == 0`).

4. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - We will loop through the list using a for loop, checking each element at the odd indices to see if it is even.

5. **Summing the Even Elements**:
   - We will maintain a running total (initialized to 0) and add to it whenever we find an even number at an odd index.

6. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, we will return the accumulated sum.

### Implementation:

Now that we have a clear understanding of the steps involved, we can implement the function:

```python
def add(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers lst, add the even elements that are at odd indices."""
    total = 0  # Initialize the sum to zero
    
    # Iterate over the list using the range function to get indices
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):  # Start at index 1 and step by 2 to get odd indices
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:  # Check if the element at index i is even
            total += lst[i]  # Add the even element to the total
            
    return total  # Return the final sum
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We define the function `add` which takes a list `lst` as input.
- We initialize a variable `total` to keep track of the sum of the even elements at odd indices.
- We use a `for` loop with `range(1, len(lst), 2)` to iterate over the odd indices of the list.
- Inside the loop, we check if the element at the current index is even. If it is, we add it to `total`.
- Finally, we return the computed `total`.

### Example Walkthrough:

For the input `[4, 2, 6, 7]`:
- The odd indices are 1 and 3.
- At index 1, the value is `2` (even), so we add it to `total`.
- At index 3, the value is `7` (odd), so we do not add it.
- The final sum is `2`, which matches the expected output.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem requirements.

        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:  # Check if the element at index i is even
            total += lst[i]  # Add the even element to the total
            
    return total  # Return the final sum
