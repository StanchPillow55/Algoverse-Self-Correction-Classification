Question:

def move_one_ball(arr):
    """We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
    the following operation on the given array:
        You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.
    
    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
    position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

    If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
    then return True else return False.
    If the given array is empty then return True.

    Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

    For Example:
    
    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
    Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
                 be achieved for the given array.
    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
    Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given
                array by performing any number of right shift operations.

Response:
To solve the problem of determining whether we can sort an array in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations, we need to analyze the properties of the array and the effect of the right shift operation.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Right Shift Operation**:
   - A right shift operation moves the last element of the array to the front and shifts all other elements one position to the right. For example, if we have an array `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`, performing one right shift results in `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`.

2. **Identifying Sorted Order**:
   - The goal is to determine if we can rearrange the array into a sorted order (non-decreasing) through these shifts. 

3. **Key Observations**:
   - If we can sort the array by right shifts, it implies that there exists a "pivot" point in the array where the sorted order can be achieved by wrapping around.
   - Specifically, if we can find a point in the array where the sequence of numbers transitions from a higher number to a lower number (i.e., a drop), this drop should occur only once for the array to be sortable by shifts.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Count how many times the array transitions from a higher number to a lower number. This can be done by iterating through the array and checking adjacent elements.
   - If there are more than one such transitions, it is impossible to sort the array through right shifts.
   - If there are zero transitions, the array is already sorted.
   - If there is exactly one transition, it indicates that the array can be sorted by right shifts.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - An empty array should return `True` since it is trivially sorted.

### Implementation:

Now that we have a clear understanding of the problem, we can implement the solution in Python.

```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    """Determine if the array can be sorted by right shifts."""
    if not arr:  # If the array is empty, return True
        return True
    
    n = len(arr)
    count_drop = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        # Check if the current element is greater than the next element
        if arr[i] > arr[(i + 1) % n]:  # Use modulo to wrap around
            count_drop += 1
            
    # We can have at most one drop to be able to sort the array by shifts
    return count_drop <= 1

# Example test cases
print(move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2]))  # True
print(move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2]))  # False
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first check if the array is empty and return `True` if it is.
- We initialize a counter `count_drop` to count the number of times we find a drop in the array.
- We loop through the array and check each element against the next one, using modulo to wrap around to the start of the array.
- Finally, we check if the count of drops is less than or equal to one, which indicates that the array can be sorted through right shifts. If so, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.
