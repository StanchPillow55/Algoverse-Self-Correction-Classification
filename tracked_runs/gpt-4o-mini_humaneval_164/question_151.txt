Question:

def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    """A simple program which should return the value of x if n is 
    a prime number and should return the value of y otherwise.

    Examples:

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to create a function `x_or_y(n, x, y)` that checks if the integer `n` is a prime number. If `n` is prime, the function should return the value of `x`. If `n` is not prime, it should return the value of `y`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Prime Numbers**:
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The smallest prime number is 2, and all even numbers greater than 2 are not prime.
   - To check if a number `n` is prime, we can:
     - Return `False` for numbers less than 2.
     - Return `True` for 2.
     - For numbers greater than 2, check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.

2. **Function Structure**:
   - The function will take three parameters: `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - We will implement a helper function to check if `n` is prime.
   - Based on the result of the prime check, we will return either `x` or `y`.

3. **Implementation**:
   - We will define the function `is_prime(n)` to encapsulate the logic for checking if `n` is prime.
   - The main function `x_or_y(n, x, y)` will utilize this helper function to determine which value to return.

### Implementation:

Here is the complete function definition:

```python
def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    """A simple program which should return the value of x if n is 
    a prime number and should return the value of y otherwise.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The number to check for primality.
    x (any): The value to return if n is prime.
    y (any): The value to return if n is not prime.
    
    Returns:
    any: x if n is prime, y otherwise.
    """
    
    def is_prime(num):
        """Helper function to determine if num is a prime number."""
        if num <= 1:
            return False
        if num == 2:
            return True
        if num % 2 == 0:
            return False
        for i in range(3, int(num**0.5) + 1, 2):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    # Check if n is prime and return the appropriate value
    if is_prime(n):
        return x
    else:
        return y

# Example usage:
print(x_or_y(7, 34, 12))  # Output: 34
print(x_or_y(15, 8, 5))   # Output: 5
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime:
  - It first handles edge cases for numbers less than or equal to 1 and the number 2.
  - It then checks for even numbers greater than 2.
  - Finally, it checks for factors from 3 up to the square root of `num`, skipping even numbers.
  
- The `x_or_y` function calls `is_prime(n)` and returns `x` if `n` is prime and `y` otherwise.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the requirements of the problem statement.
