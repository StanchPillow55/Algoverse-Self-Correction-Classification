Response:
To solve the problem of flipping the case of characters in a given string, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps involved in this task:

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
The goal is to create a function `flip_case` that takes a string as input and returns a new string where:
- All lowercase letters are converted to uppercase.
- All uppercase letters are converted to lowercase.
- Non-alphabetic characters (like numbers, punctuation, etc.) should remain unchanged.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Requirements
- We need to iterate through each character in the input string.
- For each character, we need to check if it is lowercase or uppercase.
- We can use Python's built-in string methods:
  - `str.islower()` to check if a character is lowercase.
  - `str.isupper()` to check if a character is uppercase.
  - `str.upper()` to convert a character to uppercase.
  - `str.lower()` to convert a character to lowercase.

### Step 3: Plan the Implementation
1. Initialize an empty list to store the transformed characters.
2. Loop through each character in the input string:
   - If the character is lowercase, convert it to uppercase and append it to the list.
   - If the character is uppercase, convert it to lowercase and append it to the list.
   - If the character is neither, append it unchanged.
3. Join the list of characters into a single string.
4. Return the resulting string.

### Step 4: Implement the Function
Now, let's implement the function based on the plan.

```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    """ For a given string, flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase.
    >>> flip_case('Hello')
    'hELLO'
    """
    # Initialize an empty list to hold the flipped characters
    flipped_chars = []
    
    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in string:
        if char.islower():
            # If the character is lowercase, convert to uppercase
            flipped_chars.append(char.upper())
        elif char.isupper():
            # If the character is uppercase, convert to lowercase
            flipped_chars.append(char.lower())
        else:
            # If it's neither, keep the character unchanged
            flipped_chars.append(char)
    
    # Join the list of characters into a single string and return it
    return ''.join(flipped_chars)

# Example usage
print(flip_case('Hello'))  # Output: 'hELLO'
```

### Explanation of the Code
- We define the function `flip_case` that takes a single argument `string`.
- We create an empty list `flipped_chars` to store the modified characters.
- We loop through each character in the input string:
  - We check if the character is lowercase or uppercase and append the appropriate case-flipped version to the list.
  - If the character is not an alphabetic character, we append it unchanged.
- Finally, we use `''.join(flipped_chars)` to concatenate the list into a single string and return it.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's string methods to handle case conversion. The function is also flexible enough to handle any string input, including those with special characters.
