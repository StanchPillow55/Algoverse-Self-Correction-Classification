Response:
To solve the problem of calculating the area of a triangle given the length of a side (base) and the height, we can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Formula**: The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]
   In this case, the base is represented by \( a \) and the height is represented by \( h \).

2. **Function Definition**: We need to define a function named `triangle_area` that takes two parameters: `a` (the length of the base) and `h` (the height).

3. **Implementing the Formula**: Inside the function, we will implement the formula to compute the area. This involves multiplying the base by the height and then dividing the result by 2.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, the function should return the computed area.

5. **Testing the Function**: The problem statement includes a sample test case. We will ensure that our implementation passes this test case.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above:

```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Given length of a side and height return area for a triangle.
    
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """
    # Calculate the area using the formula
    area = 0.5 * a * h
    return area
```

### Explanation of the Code

- The function `triangle_area` takes two parameters: `a` (the base) and `h` (the height).
- We calculate the area using the formula \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h \).
- The result is stored in the variable `area`, which is then returned.

### Testing the Function

To verify that our function works correctly, we can run the provided test case:

```python
print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Expected output: 7.5
```

This should output `7.5`, confirming that our implementation is correct. 

### Conclusion

The function `triangle_area` is now complete and correctly calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height. The implementation is straightforward and adheres to the mathematical formula for the area of a triangle.
