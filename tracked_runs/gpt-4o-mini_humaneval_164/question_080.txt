Question:

def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert it to
    binary format. The function should return a string, with each character representing a binary
    number. Each character in the string will be '0' or '1'.

    There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.
    The extra characters are there to help with the format.

    Examples:
    decimal_to_binary(15)   # returns "db1111db"
    decimal_to_binary(32)   # returns "db100000db"
    """

Response:
To solve the problem of converting a decimal number to its binary representation and formatting it according to the specified requirements, we can break down the task into a series of logical steps.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding Decimal to Binary Conversion**:
   - The binary number system is base-2, which means it uses only two digits: 0 and 1.
   - To convert a decimal number to binary, we can repeatedly divide the number by 2 and keep track of the remainders. The binary representation is formed by reading the remainders in reverse order.

2. **Formatting the Output**:
   - The problem specifies that the output string should start and end with the characters 'db'. This means that after we obtain the binary representation, we need to concatenate 'db' to both the beginning and the end of the string.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - First, we will handle the case where the input decimal number is 0, as its binary representation is simply "0".
   - For other positive integers, we will use a loop to divide the number by 2, collecting remainders until the number becomes 0.
   - Finally, we will reverse the collected remainders to form the correct binary string and add 'db' at both ends.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """Convert a decimal number to binary format with 'db' prefix and suffix."""
    if decimal == 0:
        return "db0db"  # Special case for zero
    
    binary_digits = []
    
    # Convert decimal to binary
    while decimal > 0:
        remainder = decimal % 2  # Get the remainder (0 or 1)
        binary_digits.append(str(remainder))  # Store as string
        decimal //= 2  # Divide the number by 2
    
    # The binary digits are in reverse order, so we reverse them
    binary_digits.reverse()
    
    # Join the list into a string
    binary_string = ''.join(binary_digits)
    
    # Add 'db' at the beginning and end
    formatted_binary_string = f"db{binary_string}db"
    
    return formatted_binary_string

# Example usages
print(decimal_to_binary(15))  # Output: "db1111db"
print(decimal_to_binary(32))  # Output: "db100000db"
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We start by checking if the input `decimal` is 0. If it is, we return "db0db" directly.
- We initialize an empty list `binary_digits` to store the binary digits as we compute them.
- We use a `while` loop to repeatedly divide the decimal number by 2, collecting the remainders.
- After the loop, we reverse the list of binary digits since the first remainder corresponds to the least significant bit.
- We then join the list into a single string and format it by adding 'db' at both ends before returning the final result.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem's requirements.
