Response:
To solve the problem of finding the maximum element in a list, we can follow a systematic approach. Hereâ€™s how I would think through the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Requirements
The function `max_element` should take a list of numbers (which can include positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero) and return the maximum value from that list. The function should also handle edge cases, such as an empty list.

### Step 2: Analyze the Examples
The provided examples give us a clear idea of what the function should return:
- For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the output should be `3`.
- For the input `[5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]`, the output should be `123`.

### Step 3: Consider Edge Cases
We need to consider what happens if the list is empty. In Python, calling the built-in `max()` function on an empty list raises a `ValueError`. Therefore, we should handle this case gracefully, perhaps by returning `None` or raising a custom error message.

### Step 4: Plan the Implementation
1. Check if the list is empty. If it is, return `None`.
2. Use Python's built-in `max()` function to find and return the maximum element in the list.

### Step 5: Implement the Function
Now that we have a clear plan, we can implement the function.

```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    
    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    >>> max_element([])
    None
    """
    if not l:  # Check if the list is empty
        return None
    return max(l)  # Use the built-in max function to find the maximum element
```

### Step 6: Testing the Function
After implementing the function, we should test it with various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected:
- Normal cases (as shown in the examples).
- An empty list to check if it returns `None`.
- A list with negative numbers to ensure it can handle them correctly.

### Conclusion
The function is now complete and should work correctly for the specified cases. The use of the built-in `max()` function simplifies the implementation and ensures efficiency. The handling of an empty list is also addressed to prevent runtime errors.
