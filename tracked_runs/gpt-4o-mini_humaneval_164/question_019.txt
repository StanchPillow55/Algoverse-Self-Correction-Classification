Response:
To solve the problem of counting how many times a given substring can be found in a string, including overlapping occurrences, we need to carefully consider how to traverse the original string and check for matches with the substring.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to count occurrences of a substring within a string.
   - Overlapping occurrences should be counted. For example, in the string "aaa", the substring "a" appears three times (at indices 0, 1, and 2).

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The function will take two parameters: `string` (the main string) and `substring` (the substring to search for).
   - The output will be an integer representing the count of occurrences.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the main string is empty (`''`), the count should be `0` regardless of the substring.
   - If the substring is empty, we should also return `0` because an empty substring does not count as a valid occurrence.
   - If the substring is longer than the main string, it cannot possibly occur, so we should return `0`.

4. **Approach**:
   - We can use a loop to iterate through the main string.
   - For each position in the main string, we will check if the substring matches starting from that position.
   - If a match is found, we increment our count and continue checking from the next position (to allow for overlaps).
   - We will stop checking when the remaining part of the string is shorter than the substring.

5. **Implementation**:
   - We will implement the function `how_many_times` based on the above logic.

### Implementation:

Here is the complete function definition:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """ Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string. Count overlapping cases.
    >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
    0
    >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
    3
    >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
    3
    """
    if not substring or not string:
        return 0
    
    count = 0
    substring_length = len(substring)
    string_length = len(string)
    
    for i in range(string_length - substring_length + 1):
        if string[i:i + substring_length] == substring:
            count += 1
            
    return count
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first check if either the `string` or `substring` is empty. If so, we return `0`.
- We initialize a `count` variable to keep track of the number of occurrences.
- We calculate the lengths of the `substring` and `string` for use in our loop.
- We loop through the `string`, checking each substring of the same length as `substring`.
- If a match is found, we increment the `count`.
- Finally, we return the total count.

### Testing:
The provided docstring includes examples that can be used to test the function. You can run these tests to verify that the function behaves as expected.
