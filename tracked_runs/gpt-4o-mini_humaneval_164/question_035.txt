Response:
To solve the problem of returning sorted unique elements from a list, we can break down the task into a series of logical steps:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input is a list of elements, which can include duplicates.
   - The output should be a new list that contains only unique elements from the input list, sorted in ascending order.

2. **Identifying the Steps**:
   - **Remove Duplicates**: We need to extract unique elements from the list. In Python, a straightforward way to achieve this is by converting the list to a set, as sets inherently do not allow duplicate values.
   - **Sort the Unique Elements**: Once we have the unique elements, we need to sort them. Python provides a built-in `sorted()` function that can sort any iterable.

3. **Combining the Steps**:
   - We will first convert the input list to a set to remove duplicates.
   - Then, we will sort the resulting set and convert it back to a list to match the expected output type.

4. **Implementation**:
   - We will define the function `unique` that takes a list as an argument.
   - Inside the function, we will perform the steps outlined above and return the sorted list of unique elements.

5. **Testing**:
   - We will include a test case in the docstring to verify that our implementation works as expected.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list
    >>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
    """
    # Step 1: Remove duplicates by converting the list to a set
    unique_elements = set(l)
    
    # Step 2: Sort the unique elements and convert back to a list
    sorted_unique_elements = sorted(unique_elements)
    
    # Step 3: Return the sorted list of unique elements
    return sorted_unique_elements
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define the function `unique` that takes a single argument `l`, which is expected to be a list.
- We convert the list `l` to a set to eliminate any duplicate values.
- We then sort the unique elements using the `sorted()` function, which returns a new list containing the sorted elements.
- Finally, we return this sorted list.

### Testing the Function:
To ensure that the function works correctly, we can run the provided test case:

```python
print(unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]))  # Output should be [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
```

This implementation is efficient and leverages Python's built-in data structures and functions to achieve the desired result in a clear and concise manner.

    sorted_unique_elements = sorted(unique_elements)
    
    # Step 3: Return the sorted list of unique elements
    return sorted_unique_elements
