Response:
To solve the problem of interspersing a delimiter between every two consecutive elements of a list of integers, we can break down the task into a series of logical steps. Let's go through the reasoning process step by step:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - We are given a list of integers called `numbers` and an integer called `delimeter`.
   - The output should be a new list where the `delimeter` is inserted between every two consecutive elements of `numbers`.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the input list `numbers` is empty, the output should also be an empty list. This is already illustrated in the provided example.
   - If the input list has only one element, the output should simply be that element, as there are no consecutive elements to intersperse with the `delimeter`.

3. **Constructing the Output**:
   - We can iterate through the list of numbers and for each element, we will add it to the result list.
   - After adding each element (except the last one), we will add the `delimeter`.
   - Finally, we need to ensure that we do not add the `delimeter` after the last element.

4. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - We can use a loop to go through the indices of the `numbers` list.
   - We will check if we are at the last element to avoid adding the `delimeter` after it.
   - We can use a list to collect the results and return it at the end.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers' """
    if not numbers:  # Check for empty list
        return []
    
    result = []  # Initialize an empty list to hold the result
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        result.append(numbers[i])  # Add the current number
        if i < len(numbers) - 1:  # Check if this is not the last element
            result.append(delimeter)  # Add the delimeter after the current number
    
    return result  # Return the final result list
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We start by checking if the `numbers` list is empty. If it is, we return an empty list immediately.
- We initialize an empty list called `result` to store our final output.
- We loop through the indices of the `numbers` list using `range(len(numbers))`.
- Inside the loop, we append the current number to the `result`.
- We check if the current index `i` is less than the last index (`len(numbers) - 1`). If it is, we append the `delimeter` to the `result`.
- Finally, we return the `result` list.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, handling both the normal cases and edge cases as required.

    result = []  # Initialize an empty list to hold the result
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        result.append(numbers[i])  # Add the current number
        if i < len(numbers) - 1:  # Check if this is not the last element
            result.append(delimeter)  # Add the delimeter after the current number
    
    return result  # Return the final result list
