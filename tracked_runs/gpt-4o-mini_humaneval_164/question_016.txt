Response:
To solve the problem of generating a space-delimited string of numbers from 0 to \( n \) inclusive, we can break down the task into a series of logical steps:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The function takes a single integer \( n \) as input.
   - The output should be a string that contains all integers from 0 to \( n \), separated by spaces.

2. **Generating the Sequence**:
   - We need to create a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to \( n \). This can be achieved using the `range` function in Python, which generates a sequence of numbers.
   - The `range` function can be called as `range(n + 1)` to include \( n \) in the sequence.

3. **Converting Numbers to Strings**:
   - The numbers generated by `range` are in integer format. To create a space-delimited string, we need to convert each integer to a string. This can be done using the `str` function.

4. **Joining the Strings**:
   - Once we have a list of string representations of the numbers, we can use the `join` method of strings to concatenate them with a space as the delimiter.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - We should consider the case when \( n \) is 0, which should return the string "0".
   - The function should also handle negative values of \( n \) gracefully, although the problem does not specify behavior for negative inputs. We can assume that the function should return an empty string in such cases.

Now that we have a clear understanding of the requirements and the steps to implement the solution, we can write the function.

Hereâ€™s the complete implementation:

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to n inclusive.
    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    """
    if n < 0:
        return ""  # Handle negative input by returning an empty string
    
    # Generate the sequence of numbers from 0 to n
    numbers = range(n + 1)
    
    # Convert each number to a string and join them with a space
    return ' '.join(str(num) for num in numbers)

# Example usage
print(string_sequence(5))  # Output: '0 1 2 3 4 5'
print(string_sequence(0))  # Output: '0'
print(string_sequence(-1)) # Output: ''
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first check if \( n \) is negative. If it is, we return an empty string.
- We use `range(n + 1)` to generate numbers from 0 to \( n \).
- We use a generator expression `str(num) for num in numbers` to convert each number to a string.
- Finally, we join these strings with a space using `' '.join(...)` and return the result.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem requirements.
