Response:
To solve the problem of determining whether a list of numbers is sorted in ascending order while also ensuring that no number appears more than once, we can break down the solution into a series of logical steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Requirements**:
   - We need to check if the list is sorted in ascending order.
   - We also need to ensure that no number appears more than once in the list. If a number appears more than once, we should return `False`.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the list is empty or contains only one element, it is considered sorted by default.
   - We need to handle lists with duplicates carefully, as having more than one occurrence of any number should immediately return `False`.

3. **Approach**:
   - We can iterate through the list and check two conditions:
     - If the current number is greater than or equal to the next number (to check for sorting).
     - If the current number is equal to the next number (to check for duplicates).
   - We can also maintain a set to track the numbers we have seen so far. If we encounter a number that is already in the set, we return `False`.

4. **Implementation**:
   - We will define a function `is_sorted(lst)` that implements the above logic.
   - We will use a loop to check the conditions and a set to track duplicates.

### Implementation:

Here is the complete function definition based on the reasoning above:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    '''
    Given a list of numbers, return whether or not they are sorted
    in ascending order. If list has more than 1 duplicate of the same
    number, return False. Assume no negative numbers and only integers.
    '''
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True  # An empty list or a single element list is sorted by default

    seen = set()  # To track seen numbers
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        # Check for duplicates
        if lst[i] in seen:
            return False
        seen.add(lst[i])
        
        # Check for sorting
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False

    # Check the last element for duplicates
    if lst[-1] in seen:
        return False

    return True  # If all checks passed, the list is sorted and has no duplicates
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first check if the list has one or zero elements, returning `True` in that case.
- We initialize an empty set called `seen` to keep track of the numbers we have encountered.
- We loop through the list up to the second-to-last element:
  - If the current number is already in `seen`, we return `False` (indicating a duplicate).
  - We add the current number to `seen`.
  - We check if the current number is greater than the next number; if it is, we return `False` (indicating the list is not sorted).
- Finally, we check the last element for duplicates before returning `True` if all checks pass.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, ensuring that we meet the problem's requirements effectively.

Response:
To solve the problem of determining whether a list of numbers is sorted in ascending order and adheres to the specified conditions regarding duplicates, we can break down the solution into a series of logical steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Requirements**:
   - We need to check if the list is sorted in ascending order.
   - If there are more than one duplicate of the same number, we should return `False`.
   - The list can contain only non-negative integers.

2. **Checking for Sorted Order**:
   - A list is sorted in ascending order if each element is less than or equal to the next element. This can be checked using a loop or a built-in function.

3. **Checking for Duplicates**:
   - We need to ensure that no number appears more than once in the list. This can be done by using a set to track occurrences of each number.

4. **Combining the Checks**:
   - We will iterate through the list, checking both conditions simultaneously:
     - If the current number is greater than the next number, the list is not sorted.
     - If a number has already been seen (exists in the set), we have a duplicate.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - A list with a single element is always sorted.
   - An empty list can be considered sorted as well.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    '''
    Given a list of numbers, return whether or not they are sorted
    in ascending order. If list has more than 1 duplicate of the same
    number, return False. Assume no negative numbers and only integers.
    '''
    seen = set()  # To track seen numbers
    n = len(lst)
    
    for i in range(n):
        # Check for duplicates
        if lst[i] in seen:
            return False
        seen.add(lst[i])
        
        # Check if the list is sorted
        if i > 0 and lst[i] < lst[i - 1]:
            return False
            
    return True  # If we pass all checks, the list is sorted and has no duplicates

# Test cases
print(is_sorted([5]))  # ➞ True
print(is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # ➞ True
print(is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5]))  # ➞ False
print(is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))  # ➞ True
print(is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]))  # ➞ True
print(is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]))  # ➞ False
print(is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]))  # ➞ True
print(is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]))  # ➞ False
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We initialize a set called `seen` to keep track of the numbers we encounter.
- We loop through each number in the list:
  - If the number is already in `seen`, we return `False` due to duplicates.
  - If the current number is less than the previous number, we return `False` because the list is not sorted.
- If we finish the loop without returning `False`, we return `True`, indicating the list is sorted and has no duplicates.

This implementation efficiently checks both conditions in a single pass through the list, making it O(n) in time complexity, where n is the length of the list.

   - We need to check if the list is sorted in ascending order.
   - If there are more than one duplicate of any number, we should return `False`.
   - The list can contain only non-negative integers.

2. **Identifying Edge Cases**:
   - An empty list or a list with a single element should return `True` since they are trivially sorted.
   - A list with duplicates should be handled carefully to ensure that we only allow one occurrence of each number.

3. **Approach**:
   - We will iterate through the list and check two conditions:
     - If the current number is greater than the next number (to check for sorting).
     - If the current number is the same as the next number (to check for duplicates).
   - We can also maintain a set to track the numbers we have seen so far. If we encounter a number that is already in the set, we will check how many times it appears.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Initialize an empty set to keep track of seen numbers.
   - Loop through the list and for each number:
     - Check if it is greater than the next number.
     - Check if it is already in the set (to handle duplicates).
   - If any of the conditions for unsorted or duplicates are met, return `False`.
   - If we finish the loop without issues, return `True`.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

        # Check if the current number is greater than the next number
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        # Check for duplicates
        if lst[i] in seen:
            return False
        seen.add(lst[i])
    
    # Check the last element for duplicates
    if lst[-1] in seen:
        return False
    
    return True

# Test cases
print(is_sorted([5]))  # True
print(is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # True
print(is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5]))  # False
print(is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))  # True
print(is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]))  # True
print(is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]))  # False
print(is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]))  # True
print(is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]))  # False
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We start by checking if the list has 0 or 1 element, returning `True` if so.
- We use a loop to compare each element with the next one to ensure they are in ascending order.
- We also maintain a set to track previously seen numbers to check for duplicates.
- Finally, we return `True` if all checks pass, indicating the list is sorted and has no excessive duplicates.
