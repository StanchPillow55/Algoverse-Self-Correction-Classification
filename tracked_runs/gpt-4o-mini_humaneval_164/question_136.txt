def can_arrange(arr):
    """Create a function which returns the largest index of an element which

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to find the largest index in the array where the element at that index is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such index exists, we should return -1.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We are given an array of integers that do not contain duplicates.
   - We need to iterate through the array and compare each element with the one before it.
   - We are looking for the largest index `i` such that `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`.

2. **Iterating Through the Array**:
   - We can start from the second element (index 1) and go through the array until the last element.
   - For each element, we will check if it is less than the element before it.

3. **Tracking the Largest Index**:
   - We will maintain a variable to store the largest index found that satisfies the condition.
   - If we find such an index, we will update this variable.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - If we find at least one index that satisfies the condition, we return that index.
   - If no such index is found by the end of our iteration, we return -1.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the solution based on the above reasoning.

```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    """Create a function which returns the largest index of an element which
    is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If
    no such element exists then return -1. The given array will not contain
    duplicate values.
    """
    largest_index = -1  # Initialize the largest index to -1 (default if no index found)
    
    # Iterate through the array starting from the second element
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        # Check if the current element is less than the previous element
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            largest_index = i  # Update the largest index found
    
    return largest_index  # Return the largest index found, or -1 if none found

# Example usage:
print(can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5]))  # Output: 3
print(can_arrange([1, 2, 3]))         # Output: -1
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We start by initializing `largest_index` to -1, which will be our default return value if no valid index is found.
- We loop through the array starting from index 1 (the second element) to the end of the array.
- For each element, we check if it is less than the element before it. If it is, we update `largest_index` to the current index.
- Finally, we return `largest_index`, which will either be the largest index found or -1 if no such index exists.

This approach ensures that we only traverse the array once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array.
