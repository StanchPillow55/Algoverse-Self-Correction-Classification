Question:

def file_name_check(file_name):
    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

Response:
To solve the problem of validating a file name based on specific criteria, we will break down the requirements step by step and implement a function that checks each condition.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Check for the Dot**: The file name must contain exactly one dot (`.`). We can use the `str.count()` method to count the occurrences of the dot.

2. **Split the File Name**: If there is exactly one dot, we can split the file name into two parts: the substring before the dot (the name) and the substring after the dot (the extension). We can use the `str.split()` method with a maximum split of 1 to achieve this.

3. **Validate the Name**:
   - The name (substring before the dot) should not be empty.
   - It should start with a letter from the Latin alphabet. We can check this using the `str.isalpha()` method on the first character.

4. **Count Digits**: We need to count the number of digits in the entire file name. We can iterate through the characters and use the `str.isdigit()` method to count how many digits are present.

5. **Validate the Extension**: The extension (substring after the dot) should be one of the allowed types: `['txt', 'exe', 'dll']`. We can check if the extension is in this list.

6. **Return Result**: If all conditions are met, return 'Yes'; otherwise, return 'No'.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def file_name_check(file_name):
    """Check if the file name is valid based on specific criteria."""
    
    # Check for exactly one dot
    if file_name.count('.') != 1:
        return 'No'
    
    # Split the file name into name and extension
    name, extension = file_name.split('.', 1)
    
    # Check if the name is not empty and starts with a letter
    if not name or not name[0].isalpha():
        return 'No'
    
    # Count the number of digits in the file name
    digit_count = sum(1 for char in file_name if char.isdigit())
    
    # Check if there are more than three digits
    if digit_count > 3:
        return 'No'
    
    # Check if the extension is valid
    valid_extensions = ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    if extension not in valid_extensions:
        return 'No'
    
    # If all checks pass, the file name is valid
    return 'Yes'

# Example test cases
print(file_name_check("example.txt"))  # Expected output: 'Yes'
print(file_name_check("1example.dll"))  # Expected output: 'No'
print(file_name_check("example123.txt"))  # Expected output: 'Yes'
print(file_name_check("example..txt"))  # Expected output: 'No'
print(file_name_check("example.txt.exe"))  # Expected output: 'No'
print(file_name_check("example.txt123"))  # Expected output: 'Yes'
print(file_name_check("example.dll"))  # Expected output: 'Yes'
print(file_name_check("ex123ample.dll"))  # Expected output: 'Yes'
print(file_name_check("ex123ample.txt"))  # Expected output: 'Yes'
print(file_name_check("ex123ample.exe"))  # Expected output: 'Yes'
print(file_name_check("ex123ample.txt123"))  # Expected output: 'No'
```

### Explanation of the Code
- We first check if there is exactly one dot in the file name.
- We split the file name into the name and extension.
- We validate the name to ensure it is not empty and starts with a letter.
- We count the digits in the file name and check if it exceeds three.
- Finally, we check if the extension is valid by comparing it against a predefined list of valid extensions.

This implementation covers all the requirements and edge cases specified in the problem statement.
