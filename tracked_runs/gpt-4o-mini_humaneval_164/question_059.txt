Response:
To solve the problem of finding the sorted unique common elements between two lists, we can break down the task into several clear steps:

1. **Identify Common Elements**: We need to find the elements that are present in both lists. This can be efficiently done using set operations, as sets inherently handle uniqueness and provide a straightforward way to find intersections.

2. **Sort the Common Elements**: Once we have the common elements, we need to sort them in ascending order.

3. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the sorted list of common elements.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Convert Lists to Sets**: By converting both lists to sets, we can utilize the set intersection operation to find common elements. This also automatically handles duplicates, as sets only store unique values.

2. **Find Intersection**: Use the `&` operator or the `.intersection()` method to find the common elements between the two sets.

3. **Sort the Result**: Convert the resulting set of common elements back to a list and sort it.

4. **Return the Sorted List**: Finally, return the sorted list of common elements.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above:

```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.
    >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
    [1, 5, 653]
    >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
    [2, 3]
    """
    # Step 1: Convert lists to sets
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)
    
    # Step 2: Find common elements using intersection
    common_elements = set1 & set2  # or set1.intersection(set2)
    
    # Step 3: Sort the common elements and convert to a list
    sorted_common = sorted(common_elements)
    
    # Step 4: Return the sorted list of common elements
    return sorted_common
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Set Conversion**: `set(l1)` and `set(l2)` convert the input lists into sets, which allows us to work with unique elements.
- **Intersection**: `set1 & set2` computes the intersection of the two sets, yielding only the elements that are present in both.
- **Sorting**: `sorted(common_elements)` sorts the resulting set of common elements and returns a sorted list.
- **Return Statement**: Finally, we return the sorted list.

### Testing the Function

We can test the function using the provided examples in the docstring to ensure it behaves as expected:

```python
print(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]))  # Output: [1, 5, 653]
print(common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2]))  # Output: [2, 3]
```

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's built-in data structures and functions to achieve the desired result.
