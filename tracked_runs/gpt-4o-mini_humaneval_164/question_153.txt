Question ID: HumanEval/152

Question:

def compare(game,guess):
    """I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
    event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
    definitely worth noting down and comparing.
    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.
    
    
    example:

    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]
    """

Response:
To solve the problem of comparing the actual scores of matches with the guesses made by a person, we need to follow a systematic approach. Hereâ€™s how I would think through the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: 
  - Two lists: `game` (actual scores) and `guess` (predicted scores).
  - Both lists are of equal length.
  
- **Outputs**: 
  - A list of integers where each integer represents the absolute difference between the corresponding elements in `game` and `guess`. If the guess is correct (i.e., the same as the actual score), the difference should be `0`.

### Step 2: Define the Logic
1. Initialize an empty list to store the results.
2. Iterate through the indices of the lists using a loop.
3. For each index, calculate the absolute difference between the actual score (`game[i]`) and the guessed score (`guess[i]`).
4. Append the calculated difference to the results list.
5. After processing all matches, return the results list.

### Step 3: Implementation
Now that we have a clear understanding of the problem and the steps needed to solve it, we can implement the function.

```python
def compare(game, guess):
    """Compares the actual scores of matches with the guessed scores and returns the absolute differences."""
    # Initialize an empty list to hold the results
    results = []
    
    # Iterate through both lists simultaneously using the range of their length
    for i in range(len(game)):
        # Calculate the absolute difference
        difference = abs(game[i] - guess[i])
        # Append the difference to the results list
        results.append(difference)
    
    # Return the final results list
    return results
```

### Step 4: Testing the Function
To ensure that our function works correctly, we can test it with the provided examples as well as some additional test cases.

```python
# Test cases
print(compare([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2]))  # Expected: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]
print(compare([0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4], [4, 1, 1, 0, 0, -2]))  # Expected: [4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 6]
print(compare([10, 20, 30], [10, 20, 30]))                # Expected: [0, 0, 0]
print(compare([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1]))                      # Expected: [2, 0, 2]
print(compare([5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]))                      # Expected: [0, 0, 0]
```

### Conclusion
The function `compare` effectively calculates the absolute differences between the actual scores and the guessed scores, returning the expected results. The implementation is straightforward and efficient, iterating through the lists only once.
