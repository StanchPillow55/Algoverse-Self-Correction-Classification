Response:
To solve the problem of determining whether the length of a given string is a prime number, we can break down the task into a few clear steps:

1. **Understanding Prime Numbers**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. The smallest prime number is 2, and the first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.

2. **Determine the Length of the String**: We will use Python's built-in `len()` function to get the length of the input string.

3. **Check if the Length is Prime**: We need to implement a function that checks if a given number (in this case, the length of the string) is prime. The steps to check if a number \( n \) is prime are:
   - If \( n \) is less than 2, it is not prime.
   - If \( n \) is 2, it is prime (the only even prime number).
   - For any number greater than 2, check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of \( n \). If \( n \) is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, based on whether the length is prime or not, we will return `True` or `False`.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def prime_length(string):
    """Check if the length of the string is a prime number."""
    length = len(string)
    return is_prime(length)

# Testing the function with provided examples
print(prime_length('Hello'))    # True
print(prime_length('abcdcba'))  # True
print(prime_length('kittens'))   # True
print(prime_length('orange'))    # False
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **is_prime(n)**: This helper function checks if a number \( n \) is prime. It handles edge cases for numbers less than 2 and checks for even numbers. For odd numbers, it checks divisibility from 3 up to the square root of \( n \).
  
- **prime_length(string)**: This function calculates the length of the input string and uses the `is_prime` function to determine if that length is prime. It returns `True` if the length is prime and `False` otherwise.

### Testing:
The function is tested with the provided examples to ensure it behaves as expected. Each test case checks the length of the string and verifies if the output matches the expected result.

Response:
To solve the problem of determining whether the length of a given string is a prime number, we can break down the solution into several steps:

### Step 1: Understanding Prime Numbers
A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This means:
- The smallest prime number is 2.
- The number 1 is not prime.
- Even numbers greater than 2 are not prime because they can be divided by 2.

### Step 2: Determine the Length of the String
The first step in our function will be to calculate the length of the input string using Python's built-in `len()` function.

### Step 3: Check if the Length is Prime
Next, we need to implement a function that checks if a number is prime. The algorithm for checking if a number \( n \) is prime can be summarized as follows:
1. If \( n \) is less than 2, return False (since 0 and 1 are not prime).
2. Check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of \( n \). If \( n \) is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.
3. If no divisors are found, then \( n \) is prime.

### Step 4: Combine the Steps
We will combine the steps into a single function `prime_length` that:
1. Computes the length of the input string.
2. Checks if that length is a prime number using the helper function.

### Implementation
Now, let's implement the solution in Python:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def prime_length(string):
    """Returns True if the length of the string is a prime number, False otherwise."""
    length = len(string)
    return is_prime(length)

# Example test cases
print(prime_length('Hello'))    # True (length 5)
print(prime_length('abcdcba'))  # True (length 7)
print(prime_length('kittens'))   # True (length 7)
print(prime_length('orange'))    # False (length 6)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **is_prime(n)**: This helper function checks if \( n \) is prime. It returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and checks divisibility for numbers from 2 to the square root of \( n \).
2. **prime_length(string)**: This function calculates the length of the input string and calls `is_prime` to determine if that length is prime. It returns `True` or `False` based on the result.

### Conclusion
The implementation is efficient and straightforward, leveraging a helper function to encapsulate the prime-checking logic. The function is now ready to be tested with various strings to confirm its correctness.

Response:
To solve the problem of determining whether the length of a given string is a prime number, we need to break down the task into manageable steps. Here's how we can approach it:

### Step 1: Understand Prime Numbers
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. In other words, a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. The smallest prime number is 2.

### Step 2: Determine the Length of the String
The first step in our function will be to calculate the length of the input string. This can be done using Python's built-in `len()` function.

### Step 3: Check if the Length is Prime
Next, we need to check if the calculated length is a prime number. We can do this by:
1. Checking if the number is less than 2 (in which case it is not prime).
2. Checking for factors of the number from 2 up to the square root of the number. If we find any factors, the number is not prime.

### Step 4: Return the Result
Finally, we will return `True` if the length is prime and `False` otherwise.

### Implementation
Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def prime_length(string):
    """Returns True if the length of the string is a prime number, False otherwise."""
    length = len(string)
    return is_prime(length)

# Testing the function with provided examples
print(prime_length('Hello'))     # True (length 5)
print(prime_length('abcdcba'))   # True (length 7)
print(prime_length('kittens'))    # True (length 7)
print(prime_length('orange'))     # False (length 6)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **is_prime function**: This helper function checks if a number `n` is prime. It returns `False` for numbers less than 2. For numbers 2 and above, it checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If any divisor is found, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.
  
2. **prime_length function**: This function calculates the length of the input string and uses the `is_prime` function to determine if that length is prime. It returns the result of the prime check.

### Testing
The provided test cases are included at the end of the implementation to verify that the function behaves as expected. Each call to `prime_length` will output whether the length of the string is prime or not. 

This structured approach ensures that we have a clear understanding of both the problem and the solution, leading to an effective implementation.
