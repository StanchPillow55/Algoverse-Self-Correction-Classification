Response:
To solve the problem of finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers, we can use the well-known Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm is efficient and works based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. 

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding GCD**: The GCD of two integers is the largest integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. For example, the GCD of 25 and 15 is 5, as 5 is the largest number that divides both.

2. **Euclidean Algorithm**: The algorithm works as follows:
   - If `b` is 0, then the GCD is `a`. This is because any number is divisible by itself.
   - Otherwise, we replace `a` with `b` and `b` with `a % b` (the remainder of `a` divided by `b`), and repeat the process until `b` becomes 0.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Create a function `greatest_common_divisor` that takes two integers `a` and `b`.
   - Use a loop or recursion to apply the Euclidean algorithm until `b` becomes 0.
   - Return `a` as the GCD once `b` is 0.

4. **Edge Cases**: We should consider:
   - When one of the numbers is 0. The GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself.
   - Negative numbers. The GCD should be defined as a non-negative integer, so we can take the absolute values of `a` and `b`.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """ Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
    1
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
    5
    """
    # Use absolute values to handle negative inputs
    a, b = abs(a), abs(b)
    
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b  # Update a and b according to the Euclidean algorithm
    
    return a  # When b is 0, a is the GCD

# Example usage:
print(greatest_common_divisor(3, 5))  # Output: 1
print(greatest_common_divisor(25, 15))  # Output: 5
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first take the absolute values of `a` and `b` to ensure that we are working with non-negative integers.
- We then enter a loop that continues until `b` becomes 0. Inside the loop, we update `a` to be `b` and `b` to be the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.
- Once `b` is 0, we return `a`, which at that point holds the GCD of the original two numbers.

This implementation is efficient and follows the principles of the Euclidean algorithm, ensuring that we can find the GCD in logarithmic time relative to the smaller of the two numbers.
