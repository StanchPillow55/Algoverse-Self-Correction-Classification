Response:
To solve the problem of summing numbers from 1 to \( n \), we can approach it in a few different ways. Let's break down the thought process step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
The function `sum_to_n(n: int)` needs to compute the sum of all integers from 1 to \( n \). The function should return this sum as an integer. The examples provided in the docstring give us a clear idea of what the expected output should be for various inputs.

### Step 2: Mathematical Insight
We can use a mathematical formula to compute the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers efficiently. The formula is:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}
\]

This formula allows us to compute the sum in constant time \( O(1) \) rather than iterating through all numbers from 1 to \( n \), which would take linear time \( O(n) \).

### Step 3: Implementation Plan
1. Define the function `sum_to_n` that takes an integer \( n \) as input.
2. Use the formula to calculate the sum.
3. Return the computed sum.

### Step 4: Edge Cases
- If \( n \) is 0 or negative, we should decide how to handle it. For this problem, we can assume \( n \) will always be a positive integer based on the context of summing natural numbers.

### Step 5: Implementing the Function
Now, let's implement the function based on our reasoning.

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int) -> int:
    """sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
    >>> sum_to_n(30)
    465
    >>> sum_to_n(100)
    5050
    >>> sum_to_n(5)
    15
    >>> sum_to_n(10)
    55
    >>> sum_to_n(1)
    1
    """
    # Using the formula to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers
    return n * (n + 1) // 2  # Using integer division to ensure the result is an integer

# Testing the function with provided examples
print(sum_to_n(30))  # Expected output: 465
print(sum_to_n(100)) # Expected output: 5050
print(sum_to_n(5))   # Expected output: 15
print(sum_to_n(10))  # Expected output: 55
print(sum_to_n(1))   # Expected output: 1
```

### Explanation of the Code
- The function `sum_to_n` takes an integer \( n \) as input.
- It calculates the sum using the formula \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \). The `//` operator is used for integer division to ensure that the result is an integer.
- The function is followed by some test cases that demonstrate its correctness.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, leveraging mathematical insight to achieve the desired result quickly.
