Response:
To solve the problem, we need to create a function `sort_third` that modifies a list based on specific criteria related to the indices of the elements in the list. Let's break down the requirements step by step.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The function takes a list `l` as input.
   - The output should be a new list `l'` where:
     - Elements at indices that are not divisible by 3 remain unchanged.
     - Elements at indices that are divisible by 3 are replaced with the sorted values of the original elements at those indices.

2. **Identifying Indices**:
   - We need to check each index of the list. An index `i` is divisible by 3 if `i % 3 == 0`.

3. **Collecting Values**:
   - We will first collect the values from the original list `l` that are at indices divisible by 3. This will allow us to sort them later.

4. **Sorting the Values**:
   - Once we have the values from the indices divisible by 3, we will sort this collection.

5. **Constructing the New List**:
   - We will create a new list where we iterate through the original list `l`:
     - If the index is divisible by 3, we will take the next sorted value from our sorted list.
     - If the index is not divisible by 3, we will keep the original value.

6. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, we will return the newly constructed list.

### Implementation

Now that we have a clear plan, let's implement the function:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """
    
    # Step 1: Collect values at indices divisible by 3
    values_to_sort = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0]
    
    # Step 2: Sort the collected values
    sorted_values = sorted(values_to_sort)
    
    # Step 3: Create a new list based on the original list
    result = []
    sorted_index = 0  # To keep track of which sorted value to use
    
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            # Use the next sorted value
            result.append(sorted_values[sorted_index])
            sorted_index += 1
        else:
            # Keep the original value
            result.append(l[i])
    
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We first create a list `values_to_sort` that contains the elements from `l` at indices divisible by 3.
- We then sort this list to get `sorted_values`.
- We initialize an empty list `result` to build our final output.
- We iterate through the indices of the original list `l`. For each index:
  - If the index is divisible by 3, we append the next value from `sorted_values` to `result`.
  - If not, we append the original value from `l`.
- Finally, we return the `result` list.

This implementation meets the requirements of the problem and should work correctly for the provided examples as well as other cases.
