def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    You are given a string representing a sentence,

Response:
To solve the problem of filtering words from a sentence based on their lengths being prime numbers, we can break down the solution into several clear steps:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understanding Prime Numbers**: 
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. The smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.
   - We need a function to determine if a number is prime.

2. **Splitting the Sentence**:
   - We need to split the input sentence into individual words. In Python, this can be done using the `split()` method, which will handle spaces appropriately.

3. **Filtering Words**:
   - For each word, we will check the length of the word. If the length is a prime number, we will keep that word.

4. **Constructing the Output**:
   - Finally, we will join the filtered words back into a single string with spaces separating them.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - We should consider sentences with no words of prime length, which should return an empty string.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the solution based on the above reasoning.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    Returns a string containing words from the original sentence
    whose lengths are prime numbers.
    """
    # Split the sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()
    
    # Filter words based on prime length
    prime_length_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    
    # Join the filtered words into a single string
    return ' '.join(prime_length_words)

# Example usage:
print(words_in_sentence("This is a test"))  # Output: "is"
print(words_in_sentence("lets go for swimming"))  # Output: "go for"
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **`is_prime(n)` Function**:
   - This function checks if `n` is a prime number. It returns `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1. For other numbers, it checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`.

2. **`words_in_sentence(sentence)` Function**:
   - The input sentence is split into words using `split()`.
   - A list comprehension is used to filter words whose lengths are prime by calling the `is_prime` function.
   - Finally, the filtered words are joined into a single string with spaces and returned.

### Testing the Implementation:
We can test the function with various sentences to ensure it behaves as expected. The examples provided in the problem statement have been included in the comments for clarity. 

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the constraints provided in the problem statement.

Response:
To solve the problem of filtering words from a sentence based on their lengths being prime numbers, we can break down the solution into several clear steps:

1. **Understanding Prime Numbers**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.

2. **Input and Output**: The function will take a single string input (the sentence) and will return a string of words whose lengths are prime numbers, maintaining the original order of words.

3. **Splitting the Sentence**: We can split the sentence into individual words using the `split()` method, which will give us a list of words.

4. **Checking for Prime Lengths**: We need a helper function to determine if a number is prime. This function will check if the number is less than 2 (not prime), and for numbers 2 and above, it will check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.

5. **Filtering Words**: We will iterate through the list of words, check the length of each word using our prime-checking function, and collect those words whose lengths are prime.

6. **Joining the Result**: Finally, we will join the filtered words back into a single string with spaces in between.

Now, let's implement this step-by-step in the function `words_in_sentence`.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    Given a sentence, return a string containing words whose lengths are prime numbers.
    """
    # Split the sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()
    
    # Filter words based on prime length
    prime_length_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    
    # Join the filtered words into a single string
    return ' '.join(prime_length_words)

# Example usage:
print(words_in_sentence("This is a test"))  # Output: "is"
print(words_in_sentence("lets go for swimming"))  # Output: "go for"
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **`is_prime(n)`**: This function checks if `n` is a prime number. It returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and checks divisibility for numbers greater than or equal to 2.
- **`words_in_sentence(sentence)`**: This function processes the input sentence:
  - It splits the sentence into words.
  - It uses a list comprehension to filter words based on whether their lengths are prime (using the `is_prime` function).
  - Finally, it joins the filtered words into a single string and returns it.

### Complexity:
- The time complexity for checking if a number is prime is approximately O(âˆšn), and since we check the length of each word, the overall complexity will depend on the number of words and their lengths. Given the constraints, this approach will perform efficiently.

Response:
To solve the problem of filtering words from a sentence based on their lengths being prime numbers, we can break down the solution into several clear steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Requirements
We need to:
- Split the input sentence into individual words.
- Determine the length of each word.
- Check if the length of each word is a prime number.
- Collect the words whose lengths are prime and return them as a single string, preserving their original order.

### Step 2: Define Prime Number Check
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. We need a function to check if a number is prime:
1. If the number is less than 2, it's not prime.
2. Check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.

### Step 3: Split the Sentence
We can use Python's built-in string method `.split()` to break the sentence into words.

### Step 4: Filter Words
For each word, we will:
- Calculate its length.
- Use the prime-checking function to determine if the length is prime.
- If it is, we will add the word to our result list.

### Step 5: Join the Result
Finally, we will join the filtered words into a single string with spaces in between.

### Implementation
Now, let's implement the solution based on the above reasoning.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    Given a sentence, return a string of words whose lengths are prime numbers.
    """
    # Split the sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()
    
    # Filter words based on the length being prime
    prime_length_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    
    # Join the filtered words into a single string
    return ' '.join(prime_length_words)

# Example usage:
print(words_in_sentence("This is a test"))  # Output: "is"
print(words_in_sentence("lets go for swimming"))  # Output: "go for"
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **is_prime function**: This function checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number. If any number divides evenly, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True.
2. **words_in_sentence function**:
   - We split the input sentence into words.
   - We use a list comprehension to filter words based on whether their lengths are prime.
   - Finally, we join the filtered words into a single string and return it.

### Testing the Implementation
We can test the function with various sentences to ensure it behaves as expected. The provided examples already demonstrate the expected functionality. Additional tests can be added to cover edge cases, such as sentences with no prime-length words or sentences with only one word.
