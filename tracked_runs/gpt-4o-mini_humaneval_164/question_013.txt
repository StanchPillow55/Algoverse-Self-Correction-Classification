Response:
To solve the problem of finding the longest string from a list of strings, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the requirements and the steps we need to take:

### Requirements:
1. **Input**: A list of strings (`strings`).
2. **Output**: 
   - The longest string in the list. 
   - If there are multiple strings of the same maximum length, return the first one encountered.
   - If the list is empty, return `None`.

### Steps to Approach:
1. **Check for Empty List**: The first step is to check if the input list is empty. If it is, we should return `None`.
2. **Initialize Variables**: We will need a variable to keep track of the longest string found so far. We can initialize this to the first string in the list.
3. **Iterate Through the List**: We will loop through each string in the list:
   - For each string, we will compare its length to the length of the current longest string.
   - If the current string is longer, we will update our longest string variable.
4. **Return the Result**: After iterating through the list, we will return the longest string found.

### Implementation:
Now, let's implement the above logic in the function `longest`.

```python
from typing import List, Optional

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    """ Out of list of strings, return the longest one. Return the first one in case of multiple
    strings of the same length. Return None in case the input list is empty.
    >>> longest([])
    None
    >>> longest(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'a'
    >>> longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc'])
    'ccc'
    """
    # Step 1: Check if the list is empty
    if not strings:
        return None
    
    # Step 2: Initialize the longest string with the first string
    longest_string = strings[0]
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through the list
    for string in strings:
        # Compare lengths
        if len(string) > len(longest_string):
            longest_string = string
    
    # Step 4: Return the longest string found
    return longest_string
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We start by checking if the `strings` list is empty. If it is, we return `None`.
- We initialize `longest_string` with the first string in the list.
- We then loop through each string in the list, checking if its length is greater than the length of `longest_string`. If it is, we update `longest_string`.
- Finally, we return the longest string found.

### Testing:
The provided docstring includes examples that can be used to test the function. We can run these tests to ensure our implementation works as expected. 

This approach is efficient and straightforward, ensuring that we only traverse the list once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of strings in the list.
