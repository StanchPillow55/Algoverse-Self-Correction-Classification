Question:

def unique_digits(x):
    """Given a list of positive integers x. return a sorted list of all 
    elements that hasn't any even digit.

    Note: Returned list should be sorted in increasing order.
    
    For example:
    >>> unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1])
    [1, 15, 33]
    >>> unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10])
    []

Response:
To solve the problem of filtering a list of positive integers to return only those that contain no even digits, we can break down the solution into several clear steps:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input is a list of positive integers.
   - The output should be a sorted list of integers that do not contain any even digits (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).

2. **Identifying Even Digits**:
   - We need to define what constitutes an even digit. The even digits are: 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.

3. **Filtering the List**:
   - For each integer in the input list, we need to check each digit to see if it is even.
   - If an integer contains any even digit, it should be excluded from the result.

4. **Sorting the Result**:
   - After filtering the integers, we need to sort the remaining integers in increasing order before returning them.

5. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Loop through each number in the input list.
   - Convert each number to a string to easily access each digit.
   - Check if any digit is even.
   - If no even digits are found, add the number to a result list.
   - Finally, sort the result list and return it.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
def unique_digits(x):
    """Given a list of positive integers x, return a sorted list of all 
    elements that haven't any even digit.
    
    Note: Returned list should be sorted in increasing order.
    
    For example:
    >>> unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1])
    [1, 15, 33]
    >>> unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10])
    []
    """
    # Define a set of even digits for quick lookup
    even_digits = {'0', '2', '4', '6', '8'}
    
    # Initialize an empty list to hold the valid numbers
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for number in x:
        # Convert the number to string to check each digit
        str_number = str(number)
        
        # Check if any digit in the number is even
        if all(digit not in even_digits for digit in str_number):
            # If no even digits are found, add the number to the result list
            result.append(number)
    
    # Sort the result list before returning
    return sorted(result)

# Example usage
print(unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1]))  # Output: [1, 15, 33]
print(unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10]))  # Output: []
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a set `even_digits` containing the characters representing even digits for efficient membership checking.
- We initialize an empty list `result` to store numbers that pass the filtering criteria.
- We loop through each number in the input list, convert it to a string, and use a generator expression to check if all digits are not in the `even_digits` set.
- If a number passes the check, it is appended to the `result` list.
- Finally, we sort the `result` list and return it.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, ensuring that we meet the problem requirements effectively.
