Response:
To solve the problem of determining whether a string of brackets is correctly balanced, we need to ensure that every opening bracket `(` has a corresponding closing bracket `)` and that they are properly nested. 

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to check if the string contains balanced parentheses. This means:
     - For every `(`, there should be a corresponding `)` that comes after it.
     - At no point in the string should the number of `)` exceed the number of `(`.

2. **Approach**:
   - We can use a counter to keep track of the balance between opening and closing brackets.
   - We will iterate through each character in the string:
     - If we encounter an `(`, we increment the counter.
     - If we encounter a `)`, we decrement the counter.
     - If at any point the counter becomes negative, it means we have a closing bracket without a matching opening bracket, and we can immediately return `False`.
   - After processing all characters, if the counter is zero, it means all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets, and we return `True`. If the counter is not zero, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, and we return `False`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - An empty string should return `True` since there are no unmatched brackets.
   - Strings that start with `)` or end with `(` should return `False`.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above.

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """ 
    brackets is a string of "(" and ")".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
    
    >>> correct_bracketing("(")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("()")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("(()())")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing(")(()")
    False
    """
    balance = 0  # This will keep track of the balance of brackets
    
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1  # Increment for an opening bracket
        elif char == ')':
            balance -= 1  # Decrement for a closing bracket
            
        # If balance goes negative, we have more closing than opening brackets
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    
    # If balance is zero, all brackets are matched; otherwise, they are not
    return balance == 0
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We initialize a `balance` variable to zero.
- We loop through each character in the input string `brackets`.
- Depending on whether the character is `(` or `)`, we adjust the `balance`.
- If at any point `balance` becomes negative, we return `False` immediately.
- After the loop, we check if `balance` is zero to determine if the brackets are correctly balanced.

### Testing:
The provided docstring includes test cases that can be used to verify the correctness of the implementation. You can run these tests to ensure the function behaves as expected.
