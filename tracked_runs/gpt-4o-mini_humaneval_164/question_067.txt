Response:
To solve the problem of calculating the sum of the ASCII values of uppercase characters in a given string, we can break down the task into a series of logical steps:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The function `digitSum(s)` takes a string `s` as input.
   - The output should be an integer representing the sum of the ASCII values of all uppercase letters (A-Z) in the string.

2. **Identifying Uppercase Characters**:
   - In Python, we can check if a character is uppercase using the `isupper()` method. This method returns `True` for uppercase letters and `False` otherwise.

3. **Calculating ASCII Values**:
   - The ASCII value of a character can be obtained using the built-in `ord()` function. For example, `ord('A')` returns 65.

4. **Iterating Through the String**:
   - We will need to iterate through each character in the string `s`, check if it is uppercase, and if it is, add its ASCII value to a running total.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the input string is empty, the function should return 0, which is already covered by our logic since the sum will simply be 0.

6. **Implementation**:
   - We will initialize a variable to keep track of the sum.
   - We will loop through each character in the string, check if it is uppercase, and if so, add its ASCII value to our sum.
   - Finally, we will return the computed sum.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
def digitSum(s):
    """Task
    Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the sum of the upper characters only'
    ASCII codes.
    """
    total_sum = 0  # Initialize the sum to 0
    
    for char in s:  # Iterate through each character in the string
        if char.isupper():  # Check if the character is uppercase
            total_sum += ord(char)  # Add the ASCII value of the uppercase character to the sum
    
    return total_sum  # Return the final sum

# Test cases
print(digitSum(""))          # Expected output: 0
print(digitSum("abAB"))     # Expected output: 131 (65 + 66)
print(digitSum("abcCd"))    # Expected output: 67 (67)
print(digitSum("helloE"))   # Expected output: 69 (69)
print(digitSum("woArBld"))  # Expected output: 131 (65 + 66)
print(digitSum("aAaaaXa"))  # Expected output: 153 (65 + 88)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define the function `digitSum(s)` which takes a string `s`.
- We initialize `total_sum` to 0 to keep track of the sum of ASCII values.
- We loop through each character in the string `s` using a `for` loop.
- Inside the loop, we check if the character is uppercase using `char.isupper()`.
- If it is uppercase, we add its ASCII value (obtained using `ord(char)`) to `total_sum`.
- Finally, we return `total_sum`, which contains the sum of the ASCII values of all uppercase characters in the input string.

This approach is efficient and straightforward, ensuring that we correctly compute the desired sum while handling various edge cases.
