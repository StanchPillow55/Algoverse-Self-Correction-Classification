Response:
To solve the problem of incrementing each element in a list by 1, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here's how I would think through the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**: 
   - The input is a list of integers.
   - The output should be a new list where each integer from the input list is incremented by 1.

2. **Identifying the Requirements**:
   - We need to ensure that the function can handle any list of integers, including negative numbers and zero.
   - The function should return a new list rather than modifying the original list.

3. **Choosing an Approach**:
   - We can use a loop to iterate through each element in the list and increment it.
   - Alternatively, we can use a list comprehension, which is a more Pythonic way to create a new list based on an existing one.

4. **Implementing the Function**:
   - I will choose to use a list comprehension for its conciseness and readability.
   - The list comprehension will iterate over each element in the input list, increment it by 1, and collect the results into a new list.

5. **Testing the Function**:
   - We will include the provided examples in the docstring as tests to ensure our implementation works as expected.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1.
    
    >>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 3, 4]
    >>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
    """
    return [x + 1 for x in l]
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:
- The function `incr_list` takes a single argument `l`, which is expected to be a list of integers.
- Inside the function, we use a list comprehension: `[x + 1 for x in l]`. This expression iterates over each element `x` in the list `l`, adds 1 to it, and constructs a new list with these incremented values.
- The function then returns this new list.

### Testing the Function:
To verify that the function works correctly, we can run the provided examples in a Python environment or use a testing framework. The expected outputs match the requirements, confirming that our implementation is correct.
