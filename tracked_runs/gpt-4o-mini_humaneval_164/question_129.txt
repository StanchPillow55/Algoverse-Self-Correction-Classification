Question:

def prod_signs(arr):
    """
    You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return
    sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs
    of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.
    Note: return None for empty arr.

    Example:
    >>> prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9
    >>> prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0
    >>> prod_signs([]) == None

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to follow a structured approach. Let's break down the requirements and the steps we need to take to implement the `prod_signs` function.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - We are given an array of integers (`arr`).
   - We need to return the sum of the magnitudes of the integers multiplied by the product of their signs.
   - The signs of the integers can be represented as:
     - Positive integers contribute a sign of `1`.
     - Negative integers contribute a sign of `-1`.
     - Zero contributes a sign of `0`.
   - If the array is empty, we should return `None`.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the input array is empty, we will immediately return `None`.
   - If there is at least one zero in the array, the product of the signs will be `0`, which means the final result will also be `0`.

3. **Calculating the Product of Signs**:
   - We will initialize a variable to keep track of the product of signs.
   - We will iterate through each number in the array:
     - If the number is positive, we multiply the product by `1`.
     - If the number is negative, we multiply the product by `-1`.
     - If the number is zero, we can break out of the loop early since the product will be `0`.

4. **Calculating the Sum of Magnitudes**:
   - We will also maintain a variable to accumulate the sum of the absolute values (magnitudes) of the integers in the array.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final result will be the sum of magnitudes multiplied by the product of signs.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above.

```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    """
    You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return
    sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs
    of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.
    Note: return None for empty arr.
    """
    if not arr:  # Check for empty array
        return None
    
    product_of_signs = 1  # Start with a neutral product
    sum_of_magnitudes = 0  # Initialize sum of magnitudes
    
    for num in arr:
        if num > 0:
            sum_of_magnitudes += num  # Add magnitude
        elif num < 0:
            sum_of_magnitudes += -num  # Add magnitude
            product_of_signs *= -1  # Flip the sign
        else:  # num == 0
            return 0  # If there's a zero, product of signs is 0
    
    return sum_of_magnitudes * product_of_signs  # Final result

# Example usage:
print(prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]))  # Output: -9
print(prod_signs([0, 1]))          # Output: 0
print(prod_signs([]))              # Output: None
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first check if the input array is empty and return `None` if it is.
- We initialize `product_of_signs` to `1` and `sum_of_magnitudes` to `0`.
- We loop through each number in the array:
  - For positive numbers, we add their value to `sum_of_magnitudes`.
  - For negative numbers, we add their absolute value to `sum_of_magnitudes` and flip the sign of `product_of_signs`.
  - If we encounter a zero, we immediately return `0`.
- Finally, we return the product of `sum_of_magnitudes` and `product_of_signs`.

This implementation efficiently computes the desired result while handling edge cases appropriately.
