Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- After five years of trying, an international group of authors have achieved their aim of taking their Palestine Festival of Literature to Gaza for the first time. The annual traveling festival, known as PalFest, was set up in 2008 to bring book readings and cultural events to Palestinians who otherwise had little access to the outside world. Each year the literary festival has visited several cities in the West Bank, but has been unable to gain permission from Israel to visit Gaza. Israel imposed an economic blockade of Gaza when Hamas took over in 2007, which it says is needed to stop the transit of weaponry to be used by militants in attacks on Israel
@highlight
PalFest is a traveling festival that visits Palestinian communities
@highlight
The group entered Gaza for the first time after four years visiting Jerusalem and the West Bank
@highlight
The 37 writers and artists received permission from Egypt to enter Gaza through the Rafah crossing

Query: "It was vital to come here because of the fact that it's so divided and considered a separate entity, but at the same time totally connected to the @placeholder."
