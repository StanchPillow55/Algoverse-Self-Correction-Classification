Question:
Passage: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan has urged India to scale back troop deployments along the countries' shared border in order to ease regional tensions following last month's massacre in the Indian city of Mumbai. An Indian border guard stands on duty at the India-Pakistan Wagah Border Post crossing. Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said in a statement made to state television Tuesday that India should withdraw its security forces to peacetime positions and deactivate air bases near the border. In return, Pakistan would pull back its troops as well, Qureshi added. But India's External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee took issue, saying New Delhi hadn't done anything to escalate the situation between the nuclear-armed neighbors.
