Question:
Passage: Once a sleepy tropical paradise with little more than handful of ramshackle beach huts, the island of Boracay, in the Philippines' Malay Province, has emerged from the backpacker trail to become one of Asia's hottest holiday destinations. In 2012, Travel + Leisure honoured it with the title "World's Best Island." Although Boracay now hosts a wide range of resorts with even more under development, it's the combination of seemingly endless stretches of white sandy beach and clear azure water that keeps visitors coming back. The island packs more than a dozen beaches into a surface area of just over 10 square kilometers (3.9 square miles).
@highlight
White Beach, the most developed on Boracay, is the shoreline that put the island on the tourist map
@highlight
Being constantly raked and cared by resort staff, Station Three boasts the best sand on White Beach
@highlight
Yapak Beach has coarser sands but might be the most beautiful beach in Boracay

Query: The beach is lined with kite boarding schools, small bars catering to the kitesurfing and windsurfing crowd along with accommodation for kite boarding students and budget conscious travelers who want to avoid the crowds of @placeholder.
