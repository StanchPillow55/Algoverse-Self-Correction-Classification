Passage: Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- A former government official was among 10 people killed in a bombing Saturday in Somalia's capital, with Al-Shabaab -- the Islamist militant group that's long been tied to violence in the region -- claiming responsibility for the attack. The slain official, Abdikafi Holowle Osman, was a former Benadir regional administrative secretary and an active campaigner against Al-Shabaab. He died when a bomb went off as he was driving in KM4, a busy junction in Mogadishu, police said. Police Col. Kamal Farah said the explosive device was attached to Osman's when it went off shortly after noon (5 a.m. ET).
