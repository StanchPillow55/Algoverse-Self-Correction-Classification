Question:
Passage: Santi Cazorla looked dead on his feet. The first Arsenal substitution had been made and more than a few were surprised it had not been his number called. Not that he was playing badly. He had been quite, quite brilliant, but had run himself into the ground keeping the champions quiet. All of Arsenal’s midfield were relentless in their commitment to this cause. Still, there was a free-kick to be taken and Cazorla is Arsenal’s free-kick taker. He chipped a curling ball into the Manchester City area, where Olivier Giroud outran, outthought and outmuscled Fernando to apply a delightfully weighted glancing header. Joe Hart was nowhere. Two goals clear, the game was won.
