Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Adrien Niyonshuti is unlikely to win an Olympic medal, and he will do well to even finish his event, but his story is surely one of the most inspirational in the history of the Games. In April 1994, when he was just seven, Niyonshuti's family became victims of the brutal genocide in Rwanda which left nearly 800,000 people slaughtered. He fled the Hutu killers who came to his village, but six of his brothers were murdered and up to 60 of his wider family perished. He miraculously escaped with his mother and father, living off scraps in the countryside, almost starving to death before aid came in the form of the rebel Tutsi army from neighboring Uganda.
