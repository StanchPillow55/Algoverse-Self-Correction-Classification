Question:
Passage: Shaker Aamer has been detained at the US detention facility without trial or charge since 2002 Amnesty International today launches a major petition demanding the release of Shaker Aamer. The global human rights organisation said the ‘terrible farce’ of his continued detention had ‘gone on too long’. The petition launch coincides with the 13th anniversary of the opening of the infamous US detention facility in Cuba on Sunday. In almost all that time, Mr Aamer, who has resident status in Britain and whose British wife and children live in South London, has been held in Guantanamo without charge. The new petition calls for Mr Aamer to be released and returned to the UK ‘without delay’, and for an immediate investigation into his allegations of torture and other ill-treatment.
