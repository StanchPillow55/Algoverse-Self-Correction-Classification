Question:
Passage: When President Obama flew to Chicago to cast his vote early in Chicago on Thursday, he became one of over eight million Americans to have already made their decision for the November election. And now with the election just ten days away, early results from registered voters in those polls are giving both the president and Mitt Romney cause for encouragement - despite neither campaign having established a distinct advantage. President Obama appears to be matching his 2008 presidential victory totals across the country, but Romney is exceeding Senator John McCain's efforts and appears to be already ahead in key state Florida.
