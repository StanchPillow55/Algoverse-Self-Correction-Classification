Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Most of us haven't lived enough to fill one memoir, let alone two, but then again most of us have not lived the life of Anjelica Huston, the Academy Award-winning actress and daughter of late legendary director John Huston. Huston set out to write a book about her life, but it started to become a "tome" at 900-plus pages in length, she said with a laugh during a recent interview, so she was advised by her agent to do two books. Her second and newest memoir, aptly titled "Watch Me," begins with her start in Hollywood, and just seven pages in, she gets to the "juicy" stuff, she admits, the start of her 17-year-relationship with one of the biggest stars at the time, Jack Nicholson.
@highlight
"Watch Me" is Anjelica Huston's second memoir
@highlight
The Academy Award winner dated Jack Nicholson for 17 years
@highlight
Huston claims Ryan O'Neal assaulted her when they dated

The actress makes her Broadway debut in "Love Letters" in January

Query: And I think it's great to look back on old @placeholder footage ... and some of the dresses people came up with.
