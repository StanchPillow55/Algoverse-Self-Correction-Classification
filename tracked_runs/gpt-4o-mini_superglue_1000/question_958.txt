Question:
Context: Will Horton -- Will was written out of the show a month before its 50th anniversary, with the character being graphically murdered in the episode of October 9, 2015. This generated ``major'' fan backlash, and criticism in the soap press, as well as accusations that Days of Our Lives was pandering to anti-gay sentiment in its audience base. Sweeney, who had left the show, but returned to shoot the funeral, said ``it was a huge mistake to kill Will, especially for the show's 50th anniversary''. After Days changed headwriters, on May 8, 2017, Entertainment Weekly reported that Massey was returning to Days of Our Lives to play Will. The same day, new headwriter Ron Carlivati indicated Will may not have died after all. Massey's first new episode was broadcast on September 15, 2017, when a drunken grieving Lucas hallucinates seeing his son. The character is expected to return alive in an upcoming episode.
