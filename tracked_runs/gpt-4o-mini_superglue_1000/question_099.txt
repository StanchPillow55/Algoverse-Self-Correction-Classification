Question:
Passage: Jerusalem (CNN) -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's party got the most votes in Israel's national election Tuesday, but a respectable showing by centrists could slow or halt a rightward swing in the government. Netanyahu's Likud Beitenu won between 31 and 33 Knesset seats in the Israel election, TV exit polls reported, winning the most, as expected. Jewish Home, an extreme right party with a charismatic leader named Naftali Bennett, got between 11 and 12 seats. But the Yesh Atid party, a new centrist movement devoted to helping the middle class and halting military draft exemptions for ultra-Orthodox civilians, came in a surprising second place with at least 18 seats, according to the exit polls.
