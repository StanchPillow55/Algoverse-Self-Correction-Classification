Question:
Passage: South Korea and Japan on Friday postponed the signing of a landmark military intelligence pact after the prospect stirred discontent among Koreans. Japan occupied Korea for 35 years during the first half of the 20th century, and anti-Japanese sentiment still lingers. The two countries had originally been scheduled to sign the accord in Tokyo on Friday. But the ceremony has been put on hold pending consultations on the matter with the South Korean National Assembly, an official at the South Korean Foreign Ministry said. The planned pact is intended to "provide a legal framework on sharing classified military information," including the threat from nuclear-armed North Korea, Cho Byung-jae, a spokesman for the South Korean Foreign Ministry, had said Thursday.
