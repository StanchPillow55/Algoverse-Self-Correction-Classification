Question:
Passage: By Ashley Collman A former Buffalo Bills cheerleader says squad members were auctioned off at a charity golf tournament, and made to sit on the winner's laps in just one of many demeaning tasks revealed in a new lawsuit against the football team. A 23-year-old identifying herself as 'Alyssa U' is one of five former cheerleaders suing the team claiming she was underpaid and mistreated, and detailed the dark side of the job in an essay for the New York Post published Sunday. A native of West Falls, New York, Alyssa was a life-long fan of the Bills and considered it a 'huge accomplishment' when she made the team for the 2012-2013 season.
