Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Arizona authorities on Monday arrested the mother of a 5-year-old girl last seen more than a month ago, a police sergeant said. Jerice Hunter was "placed under arrest for child abuse directly related to her daughter, Jhessye Shockley," Glendale Police Sgt. Brent Coombs told reporters. "Our investigators are still working diligently to locate Jhessye," he said. "This is a step down that path." None of the leads about the girl's whereabouts has panned out, Coombs said. But he did say that information about her mother, Hunter, proved to "have substance to the investigation (and) have proven to be accurate, as far as we can tell."
