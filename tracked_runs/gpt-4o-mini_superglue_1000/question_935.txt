Question:
Passage: The pomp and ceremony surrounding the presentation of Wayne Rooney's golden cap was typically English, but looking at the Wembley pitch you may have thought the game was taking place across the Atlantic. The NFL's Dallas Cowboys and Jacksonville Jaguars played at Wembley less than a week before England's Euro 2016 qualifying clash with Slovenia, and evidence of their presence was clearly visible as Rooney led his side out on Saturday. The surface was quick to tear up after minimal contact, and the markings from the gridiron were still apparent throughout the pitch.
