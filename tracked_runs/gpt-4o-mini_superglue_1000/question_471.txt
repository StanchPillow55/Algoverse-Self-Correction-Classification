Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- Investigators searching a Washington, D.C., park for a missing 8-year-old girl found the body of a man matching her suspected kidnapper's description, police said Monday. Relisha Rudd has been missing since March 1, when she was last seen with Kahlil Tatum, a 51-year-old janitor at the homeless shelter where Relisha lived. Although the body has not been positively identified, "everything we have is consistent with what (investigators) know about (Tatum's) appearance," D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier told reporters Monday, adding that the death was "most likely a suicide." The search for Relisha intensified last week when authorities began combing Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens. The search was prompted by evidence that Tatum had spent time there after Relisha's disappearance.
