Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The recent email in my in-box was simply titled "Trabajo," which in Spanish means "work" or "a job." It was from Valentin Garcia - a jobless man we met in 2012 telling us, rather excitedly, that he'd gotten a job, at last. No small feat in Spain's economic crisis. He'd been out of work for more than three years before getting hired as a tree trimmer on a city work crew. We met Garcia, who's done all sorts of manual jobs, in June 2012 at a Red Cross food bank where he came to get a handout. He'd lost his job as a waiter two years earlier.
@highlight
CNN met Valentin Garcia in 2012, when he was unemployed, now he has a job
@highlight
But the job is short term and at 50, he's only earning the minimum wage
@highlight
This represents many jobs that are being created in Spain -- short-term and badly paid
@highlight
Questions are being raised over how much these can help the country's long-term recovery

Query: But for the first time, the money was being used to ease suffering at home, in @placeholder.
