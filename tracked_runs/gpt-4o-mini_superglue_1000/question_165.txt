Question:
Passage: 'More than a Club.' That's the long-standing motto and image that Barcelona football club has wished upon the world for many years. It is an image the club has carefully cultivated over decades, but could the deal that brought Brazilian star Neymar to the club in June 2013 result in the Spanish giants being known for more than just their football - and not in a good way? For the mood drifting out of Camp Nou, a stadium that has long been revered as a temple of the global game, is one of disarray. Barca, as if anyone needs reminding, is one of world football's most successful clubs on the pitch.
@highlight

@highlight

@highlight
