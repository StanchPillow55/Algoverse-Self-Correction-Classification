Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Wednesday he was unaware of any disclosure of classified information from the scandal engulfing former CIA Director David Petraeus and Gen. John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, that could damage national security. "I have no evidence at this point from what I've seen that classified information was disclosed that in any way would have had a negative impact on our national security," Obama said in his first post-election news conference. Obama, addressing the ongoing controversy for the first time publicly, said Petraeus tendered his resignation because his actions "did not meet the standards he felt were necessary as the director of the CIA."
