Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- After a string of real celebrity deaths last week, the Internet and online social networks killed a few more stars. Pop star Britney Spears was among those falsely claimed to be dead recently.

The situation is calling attention to the changing state of the news media: As information online moves faster and comes from more sources, it's more difficult to verify what's true and what may be shockingly false.
