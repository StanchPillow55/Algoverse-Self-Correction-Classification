Question:
Passage: An Oklahoma City councillor donated a kidney to someone he barely knew on Monday and credited his strong faith for inspiring him. Owasso City Councillor Chris Kelley, 34, and Paul Kropp, 46, had met only a couple of times before but the pair just got a whole lot closer after Kelley gave Kropp his kidney in a life-saving rare organ donation surgery. 'Words can’t describe what he’s done for me,' said Kropp, to Tulsa World. Blessed: Paul Kropp, 46, was given a life-saving kidney donation from Owasso City Councillor Chris Kelley, 34, whom he'd only met a few times before

Owasso City Councillor Chris Kelley, 34, and Paul Kropp, 46, only met a couple of times but Kelley gave Kropp his kidney and saved his life
@highlight
'Words can’t describe what he’s done for me...He’s given me life,' said Kropp as he held back tears
@highlight
'I just felt moved to do something,’ said Kelley of his urge to do a kind deed and described himself as a spiritual man

Query: All of that changed in February of this year when a friend of Kropp died at age 50 without warning and @placeholder decided it would be a good idea to see a doctor to evaluate his own well-being a few months later.
