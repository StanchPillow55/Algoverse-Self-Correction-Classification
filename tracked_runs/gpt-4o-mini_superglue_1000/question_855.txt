Question:
Passage: While the world was watching horrified as the baby Gammy scandal unfolded, two men in Australia were terrified the news would mean they may never get to see the faces of their unborn triplets. Shannon Sanderson, 38, and Peter Trigg, 44, were just three months away from meeting their beautiful triplet girls, via a Thai surrogate mother,  when a Perth couple reportedly abandoned their disabled son Gammy in Thailand. As the news broke around the world, Thai surrogate agencies went into lockdown, disconnecting their phones and shutting off email connections. The couple, from Kinglake West in Victoria, were worried sick that this could mean the end of their dream of having a family.
