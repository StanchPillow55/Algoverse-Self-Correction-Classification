Question:
Passage: By Ian Drury PUBLISHED: 19:50 EST, 29 August 2013 | UPDATED: 19:50 EST, 29 August 2013 In an all-too familiar echo of Tony Blair’s ‘dodgy dossiers’, the Government had yesterday published an intelligence report to support David Cameron’s case for strikes against the Syrian regime. It concluded it was ‘highly likely’ that President Assad was responsible for launching chemical attacks against his own people. But like the ‘dodgy dossiers’, which claimed in 2002 that Saddam Hussein had stockpiled weapons of mass destruction, Mr Cameron’s report contained the assessment of the Joint Intelligence Committee.
