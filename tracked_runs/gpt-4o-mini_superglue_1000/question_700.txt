Question:
Passage: A 23-year-old Norwegian man of Somali origin is being investigated over the bloody attack on Kenya's Westgate shopping centre last month. Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, 23, is believed to be one of four men pictured in CCTV footage from the mall which has been released by Kenyan authorities. Dhuhulow is believed to have links to Mohamed Abdikadir Mohamed, known as Ikrima, who is regarded as one of the most dangerous commanders in the Somali terror group. He is believed to have left his home in Larvik, 75 miles south of Oslo, for Somalia in 2009 and taken part in the attack by the militant group, al-Shabab.
