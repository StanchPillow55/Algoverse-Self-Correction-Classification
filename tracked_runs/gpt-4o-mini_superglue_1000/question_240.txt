Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The last time Earl Woods Jr. saw his half brother Tiger was four years ago, when the family buried their father. Earl Woods Jr. and his two siblings Kevin Woods and Royce Woods, also Tiger's half siblings, joined Tiger on his private jet to take their father's remains to Kansas. The three are the offspring of Tiger's father Earl Woods Sr. and his first wife Barbara Hart Woods. The couple divorced in 1968. "He was gracious enough to allow us to join him on the jet to take my dad to Kansas," says Earl Woods Jr. "I remember we came off the jet, walked down the runway, hugged, (we said) 'Hey, how you doin'?' And he went that way with the entourage, and we went this way. And that was the last I ever saw him."
