Question:
Passage: Why weather the bone-chilling rocky surface of Mars when you could call the clouds of Venus' earth-like upper atmosphere home? That's the question posed by a NASA project that envisions a future where humans might live in solar-powered airships 31 miles above Earth's nearest neighbor. Dubbed the High Altitude Venus Operational Concept (HAVOC) the project would first send a robotic scout to gauge the lay of the land (or clouds) followed by a 30-day manned mission in a zeppelin-style helium ship. Scroll down for video... A furture in the clouds? A Venus exploration mission envisioned by NASA sees a future in which a permanent human habitat could float in the clouds above Earth's fiery neighbor
@highlight
The High Altitude Venus Operational Concept program would eventually send a manned mission to the atmosphere of Venus
@highlight
Around 30 miles above the surface, Venus has temperatures and atmospheric pressure reminiscent of Earth's
@highlight
A robot would first be sent to the Venus' atmosphere to test the waters -- a two-manned vehicle would follow
@highlight
The project could one day pave the way toward a floating city above Venus

Query: Nearest neighbor: A manned mission could place two astronauts above he @placeholder surface for 30-days after a 110-day trip to Earth's nearest neighbor
