Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Eleven Somalis convicted of piracy-related crimes are heading to prison in the island nation of Seychelles, the archipelago's department of legal affairs said in a press release. The Seychelles' Supreme Court Monday convicted and sentenced eight of the Somalis for committing an act of piracy and the other three for aiding and abetting an act of piracy. Each of the 11 was sentenced to 10 years in prison, said the statement. The presiding judge of the Supreme Court acquitted the suspects on five other charges related to "acts of terrorism." On December 5 and 6, the pirates -- who were in two small boats -- attacked the Seychelles coast guard vessel Topaz with automatic weapons. "The aiders and abettors were found in a mother skiff not very far from the attack," said the statement. "Evidence has revealed that the mother skiff had provided ammunitions and firearms to the two attack skiffs before they effected the attack."
