Question:
Passage: The Honda Odyssey was the only minivan to earn the highest safety rating in new crash tests by the insurance industry. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said Thursday that the Nissan Quest, Chrysler Town & Country, and Dodge Caravan all garnered the lowest rating on the small overlap front crash test, which replicates what happens when a vehicle's front corner collides with another object at 40 miles per hour. In each of those cases, the minivans' structure collapsed from the force of the crash. CHRYSLER TOWN & COUNTRY Tried and tested: The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said Thursday that the Chrysler Town & Country was one of the lowest rating minivans on a small overlap front crash test
