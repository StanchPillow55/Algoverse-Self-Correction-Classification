Question:
Passage: There's no arguing that Apple set the standard for modern mobile devices with the iPhone and the iPad. It didn't take long after those two products launched for competitors to rush out their own copycat devices. Even then, it took another few years before Android was good enough to go toe to toe with iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. But it's no longer about being just as good as Apple. You have to be better. Competitors have built upon the foundation Apple laid in mobile and are now leapfrogging it with bunch of useful features you can't find on iPhones and iPads.
@highlight
Mobile-gadget rivals are leapfrogging Apple with useful features not on iPhones, iPads
@highlight
This success is most apparent with Apple's biggest mobile rival, Samsung
@highlight
Samsung is more nimble than Apple at improving its devices through software updates
@highlight
With Galaxy Note, Samsung has a category of phone people didn't know they wanted

Query: @placeholder usually makes users wait a year or more for a new version of iOS, and even then some older devices can't access all the latest and greatest features.
