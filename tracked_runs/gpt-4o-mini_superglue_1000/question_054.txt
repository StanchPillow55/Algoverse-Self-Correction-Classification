Question ID: record_35741

Question:
Passage: With a long-held ethos of non-interference in other countries' affairs, risk-averse China is perhaps an unlikely ally in President Barack Obama's pledge to "degrade" and "destroy" ISIS in Iraq and Syria. But with Beijing's growing unease about terrorist threats by Islamist extremists at home, analysts say China -- a U.N. Security Council permanent member - is unlikely to oppose plans to build a "broad coalition" to go after ISIS. "I think China in principle will quietly support this idea to curb ISIS," says Chen Dingding, an assistant professor of government at the University of Macau. "ISIS has openly listed China as a major threat to them and if they gain more influence, it's likely they will target Xinjiang and even other parts of China," he added.
