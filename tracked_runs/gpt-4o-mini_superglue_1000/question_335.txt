Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Call it the Twitterfication of social sharing. As if it wasn't enough for Twitter to limit our bursts of inspiration to 140 written characters, it has now rolled out Vine, a video-sharing app that limits your videos to just six seconds. What can you do with six seconds of smartphone video (which, for now, is available only on iPhones, causing an aggravated Android Nation to again wail and wait)? Not re-enact "Lawrence of Arabia" using action figures. That would take 2,270 Vine posts, give or take. Nor can you document a successful rodeo bull ride; those require at least eight seconds.
@highlight
With Vine, Twitter adds video to its short bursts of text
@highlight
The new app could spur more creativity among Twitter users
@highlight
It also might lead to lots of boring little videos in your feed
@highlight
The launch may crown Vine as the leader in the "Instagram for Video" race

Query: Given a new tool with which to share, or overshare, we all can expect more @placeholder missteps.
