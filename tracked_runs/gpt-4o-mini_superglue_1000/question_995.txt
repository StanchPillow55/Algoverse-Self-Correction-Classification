Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The 2014 Formula One season may have only just got going, but Ferrari is already playing catch up. That's the view of technical director James Allison, who admits the legendary Italian marque is some way behind early pacesetters Mercedes, labeling Ferrari's performance in Sunday's opening race as "unacceptable." While Mercedes enjoyed a fruitful preseason and took the checkered flag at Sunday's Australian Grand Prix through Nico Rosberg, Ferrari struggled by comparison. Double world champion Fernando Alonso was the team's highest-placed driver in fourth position, but the Spaniard finished over 30 seconds behind the victorious Rosberg. "While we can take some satisfaction from the reliability shown by the F14T, it is clear that we have our work cut out to improve our car in order to compete on equal terms with the Mercedes team," Allen told the team's official website.
