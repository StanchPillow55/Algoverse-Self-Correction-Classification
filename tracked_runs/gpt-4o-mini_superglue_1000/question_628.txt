Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Mitt Romney had another debate Saturday night in which he didn't make many mistakes, was smooth, knowledgeable, even presidential. It was his worst performance yet. The game has changed, and someone forgot to tell him. He is behind in national polls, and this time it's serious: His main rival, Newt Gingrich, is polling well not just in Iowa, but also across the country. Saturday night's debate was on a major network, with a wide audience, in the first state in the nation to hold a caucus -- and there is only one more debate before that voting. The conclusion is inescapable. Romney blew it.
@highlight
Todd Graham: Mitt Romney had a bad debate in Iowa, didn't seem to know he's trailing in polls
@highlight
He says Romney needed new strategy, but he blew chances to go after front-runner Gingrich
@highlight
When other candidates attacked him and Gingrich, Romney failed to differentiate himself
@highlight
Graham: Gingrich acted ready to take on Obama; Romney acted as if he were trying not to lose

Query: One of @placeholder's perceived weaknesses is his imprudence, rhetorical and otherwise.
