Question:
Passage: By Mark Duell UPDATED: 00:52 EST, 1 September 2011 One of America’s most famous historical figures who wrote the Declaration of Independence might not have fathered his slave’s children after all. It had been believed for more than a decade that former U.S. President Thomas Jefferson fathered his slave Sally Hemings’s youngest son, Eston. But DNA evidence that showed a Jefferson male fathered the boy actually suggests Mr Jefferson’s brother Randolph was the dad, a new book says. Changing history: It had been believed for more than a decade that U.S. President Thomas Jefferson fathered his slave Sally Hemings's youngest son, Eston
@highlight
Decade-long theory Jefferson fathered Eston Hemings
@highlight
Hemings was youngest son of president's slave Sally
@highlight
But study claims dad was probably Jefferson's brother

Query: 'It does address (these) reasons why @placeholder could have been the father, in a detailed manner, and shows the fallacies in these reasons, and should bring the reader back to a point where the issue is not proven'
