Question:
Passage: Lewis Hamilton could not even bring himself to look at Nico Rosberg, the winner of the Monaco Grand Prix. Neither put his arm around the otherâ€™s shoulder for the podium pictures. They then travelled back to the paddock press conference in separate minibuses. They sat on the dais side by side without so much as a glance at each other. The two World Championship contenders are not talking in private or public. Rosberg winked at his manager, Georg Nolte. A smile constantly played across his lips. Hamilton, by contrast, glowered from under the long, straight brim of his Mercedes cap. He answered enquiries in a downbeat manner.
