Question:
Passage: Brendan Rodgers believes Liverpool's team spirit will remain one of their biggest strengths as he insisted Mamadou Sakho's show of petulance was an isolated incident. The France defender has not travelled to Basle for the Champions League game but Liverpool manager Rodgers has made it clear that the player remained on Merseyside because of thigh problem sustained in training, not for any disciplinary reasons. Sakho stormed out of Anfield on Saturday after being omitted from the 18-man squad for the Merseyside derby but Rodgers has moved to draw a line under the issue, explaining that he has spoken to the defender and received an apology.
