Question:
Passage: Guadalajara, Mexico (CNN) -- Authorities found 26 bodies Thursday inside three abandoned vehicles in Guadalajara, Mexico, an official said. All the victims were men, said Ulises EnrÃ­quez, a spokesman for the Jalisco delegation of the Attorney General's Office. The vehicles were discovered near a monument on one of the city's main avenues, the state-run Notimex news agency reported, citing police sources. Jalisco state Attorney General Tomas Coronado Olmos told CNN affiliate TV Azteca that a message was found with the bodies, but he did not disclose what it said. In a Twitter post, Jalisco Gov. Emilio Gonzalez, a former mayor of Guadalajara, said he was "appalled and outraged" by the discovery, which came a day after authorities in Sinaloa state found 16 charred bodies inside two trucks that had been set ablaze.
