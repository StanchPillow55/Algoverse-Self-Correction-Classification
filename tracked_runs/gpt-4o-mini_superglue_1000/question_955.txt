Question:
Passage: Vice President Joe Biden has been a non-factor in the debt and budget fight so far. The last news wire photos of him came ten days ago, and he hasn't made any public statements about the standoff that has gripped Washington If Republicans were bluffing over Obamacare and the debt ceiling, it's now the Democrats' turn to play high-stakes poker. And the notoriously gaffe-prone Joe Biden has been called back from his Camp David vacation to put the screws on the GOP. The White House issued a statement on Monday saying that Obama would remind congressional leaders in the Oval Office at 3:00 p.m. that he 'will not pay a ransom for Congress reopening the government and raising the debt limit.'
