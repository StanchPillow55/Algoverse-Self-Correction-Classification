Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The final two teams left standing at Euro 2012 should come as no surprise, and nor should another painful exit for perennial underachievers England. A heart-breaking defeat on penalties in their quarterfinal was preceded by 120 minutes which saw the style of finalists Italy overwhelm English pragmatism and conquer their heart-on-sleeve spirit. So why does England continue to employ this bulldog style? And why can't the country who gave birth to the game reinvent itself like the all-conquering Spain team, who will be gunning for a third consecutive major title against Italy in Kiev on Sunday, or the dynamic Germans, young pretenders who fell at the semifinal stage?
