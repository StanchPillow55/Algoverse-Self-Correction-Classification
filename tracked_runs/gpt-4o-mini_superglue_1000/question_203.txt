Question:
Passage: By Matt Chorley, Political Editor for MailOnline Labour leader Ed Miliband tonight faces revolt from his English MPs over his refusal to bar Scottish MPs from voting on policies which only apply south of the border. Former Cabinet ministers Ben Bradshaw and John Denham have formed a new group dubbed English Labour to challenge the party leadership's refusal to admit it is 'unfair' for Scots to vote on English matters. Mr Miliband is under pressure for refusing to back home rule for England, and David Cameron said it should form part of the response to Scotland rejecting independence in last week's referendum.
