Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's statement about the Egyptian military's seizure of power is as telling for what he doesn't say as for what he does: he doesn't mention the word "coup." He doesn't call upon the military to restore power to "the democratically elected civilian government," but rather to "a democratically elected civilian government." In other words, it need not be deposed President Mohamed Morsy's. The thinking of the president and administration officials, according to a knowledgeable source, is that while the administration is not explicitly supporting the removal of Morsy from power -- it expressly did not support the move -- it is seeking to push the Egyptian military in a direction.
@highlight
The Obama administration did not use the word "coup"
@highlight
Use of the word would have legal ramifications resulting in the end of U.S. aid
@highlight
The U.S. priority is to preserve some space while trying to contain a combustible situation

Query: The president said he had "directed the relevant departments and agencies to review the implications under @placeholder law for our assistance to the government of Egypt."
