Question:
Passage: By Kieran Gill Should Roy Hodgson stay on as England manager? Roy Hodgson should not remain in charge of England after their worst World Cup since 1958, say 68 per cent in Sportsmail's online poll. England's two defeats, losing 2-1 to Italy before being beaten by the same scoreline to Uruguay, means the Three Lions won't get out of Group D. Costa Rica's 1-0 win over Italy on Friday was the final nail in England's World Cup coffin, but FA chairman Greg Dyke has assured Hodgson that he will remain in charge.
