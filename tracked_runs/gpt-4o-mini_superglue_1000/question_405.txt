Question:
Passage: A teenage girl who murdered her 'best friend' along with a female classmate kept up a disturbingly normal social media presence in the months before she confessed to the brutal killing. Rachel Shoaf, along with her friend Sheila Eddy, lured 16-year-old Skylar Neese out of her house in July 2012, before stabbing her to death and hiding her body in a Pennsylvania wood. It was six months before Shoaf and Eddy confessed to the killings - and remained active on social media through the frantic search for their friend. On July 7, 2012, just a day after she and Shoaf killed Miss Neese, Eddy tweeted a 'happy birthday' message to a friend.
