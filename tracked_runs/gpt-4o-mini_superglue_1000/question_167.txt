Question:
Passage: Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- When security guards arrived at the home of Oscar Pistorius on the night his girlfriend died, the first thing the track star told them was that everything was fine. That's what Pieter Baba, a security guard supervisor, testified Friday in Pistorius' murder trial. The athlete said everything was fine, but he was crying, Baba said, and he knew everything was not fine. Baba and the other guards then witnessed Pistorius descending from the upstairs carrying Reeva Steenkamp to the lower level. "I was so shocked, I couldn't think for a few moments," Baba testified. Pistorius pleaded not guilty Monday to one charge of murder and a firearms charge associated with Steenkamp's killing on Valentine's Day 2013 as well as two gun indictments unrelated to her death. Pistorius, 27, nicknamed "Blade Runner," has admitted killing his 29-year-old girlfriend, but says it was a tragic error after he mistook her for an intruder.
