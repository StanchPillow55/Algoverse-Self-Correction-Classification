Question:
Passage: (The Frisky) -- By T-minus 18 days until the Oscars and, of course, we are all starting to place bets on who we think will walk away with little golden men this year. Luckily, the Academy has proven itself to be pretty darn predictable over the years. If you're America's Sweetheart, you'll probably win Best Actress. If you sing in a flick, you are almost guaranteed Oscar gold. But there's another trend we've been noticing lately: the winners for Best Actress and Best Actor tend to be the person who's taken on the based-on-a-true-story role. In fact, 10 of the 20 top honors given in the 2000s went to actors who portrayed real people. Let's take a look, shall we?
@highlight
Sandra Bullock won Best Actress for playing Leigh Anne Tuohy
@highlight
Sean Penn won the Academy Award for for playing Harvey Milk
@highlight
Julia Roberts won an Oscar for her real-life role in "Erin Brockovich"

Query: The real Erin, however, did not get a statue for her cameo in the flick as a waitress who takes @placeholder's order.
