Question:
Passage: By Alexandra Klausner PUBLISHED: 14:31 EST, 29 November 2013 | UPDATED: 18:14 EST, 29 November 2013 Jason Kidd was charged $50,000 by the NBA for spilling his soda on the court at the Barclay’s Center in New York on Wednesday night, and it wasn’t a fine for being clumsy. The Brooklyn Nets coach was believed to have spilled his drink intentionally to buy his team more time in a game against the LA Lakers. Video footage of the event shows Kidd mouthing words which appear to be, ‘hit me.’ Following coach's orders, Nets player Tyshawn Taylor chest bumps his coach and the soda spills out all over the court.
