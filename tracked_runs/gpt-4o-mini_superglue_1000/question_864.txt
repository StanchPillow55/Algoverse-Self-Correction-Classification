Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- In just over three weeks, Jason Dufner has won his first two PGA Tour titles and got married. As the new leader of the FedEx Cup series, the American has catapulted himself into the top-15 of the world rankings and is considered a real contender to win his first major at next month's U.S. Open. But what he really wants is a spot in Davis Love's Ryder Cup squad come September as the U.S. team seeks to avenge the 2010 defeat by Europe. "I hope it gets Davis Love's attention. I think I will be No. 1 in the points, so I hope that gets his attention," Dufner told reporters after sinking a final-hole birdie to avoid a playoff at the Byron Nelson Championship on Sunday.
