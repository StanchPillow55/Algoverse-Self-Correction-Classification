Question:
Passage: Another member of state-funded Russia Today made waves on Wednesday -- not by standing behind Moscow, as the news network is wont to do, but by bucking it. From the anchor chair, Liz Wahl closed a show -- as seen in video which she later tweeted -- talking about the "ethical and moral challenges" she faces working for Russia Today, also known as RT. She spoke of being from a family who fled to America to escape Soviet forces during the 1956 Hungarian revolution, being the daughter of a U.S. military veteran and being the partner of a physician who works at a U.S. military base.
@highlight
Liz Wahl says RT is about "promoting a Putinist agenda, "bashing America"
@highlight
Wahl quits state-funded RT on-air, saying she believes in "disseminating the truth"
@highlight
Fellow RT personality Abby Martin had slammed "Russia's military occupation of Crimea"
@highlight
But Martin is still with RT, having made her remarks "in the context of her own ... show"

Query: In a statement, @placeholder said, "When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional."
