Question:
Passage: Thousands hoping to get away for Christmas could face chaos after airport staff voted to walk out for two days from December 23. Heathrow is expected to bear the brunt of the disruption, as nearly 500 check-in staff and ground crew members plan to strike over pay. Three of Heathrow’s five terminals will be affected, as well as Gatwick and Manchester Airports if the action goes ahead. The strike could affect check-in desks at Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester airports But last night, airport and airline bosses insisted they would cope. Heathrow said it had contingency plans in place to ‘minimise disruption for passengers’ and did not want to ‘raise unnecessary alarm’.
