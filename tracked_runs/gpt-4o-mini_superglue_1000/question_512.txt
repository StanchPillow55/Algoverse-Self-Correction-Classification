Question:
Passage: By Jason Groves, Chief Political Correspondent PUBLISHED: 12:46 EST, 21 August 2013 | UPDATED: 03:35 EST, 22 August 2013 Ed Miliband was told to look in the mirror and ask whether the 'electorate ever assent to me being Prime Minister?' Ed Miliband should consider resigning for the sake of the Labour Party, a senior Blairite warned yesterday. Brian Wilson, who served as energy minister under Tony Blair, said the Labour leader had a duty to 'look in the mirror and honestly answer the question: 'Will the electorate ever assent to me being Prime Minister?' Mr Wilson, who held a number of other senior roles, said opinion poll findings on Mr Miliband's personal popularity were 'somewhere between dire and disappointing'.
