Passage: 'African-American lives matter': Tracy Martin, father of Trayvon Martin, spoke out against the stigma surrounding young black men on MSNBC last night The father of Trayvon Martin, the boy shot dead in Florida in 2012, last night spoke out against the stereotypes that stigmatise young blacks in America. Speaking about the shooting of Michael Brown nine days ago at the hands of a policeman in Ferguson, Missouri, Tracy Martin told MSNBC he recognised attempts to smear the dead teenager's name. Trayvon was just 17 when he was killed by neighbourhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman. Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder after his lawyers painted Trayvon as a dope-smoking, school-skipping delinquent.
