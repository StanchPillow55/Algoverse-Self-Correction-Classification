Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- A young male pulled a handgun Friday afternoon inside a Philadelphia high school gymnasium, firing and hitting two fellow students, police said. The injured boy and girl, each 15, were transported in stable condition after being shot in the arm just before 3:30 p.m., Philadelphia police Lt. John Stanford said. The students were among about seven in the Delaware Valley Charter High School gym at that time -- some playing basketball, others in one corner -- according to city police Commissioner Charles Ramsey. "The suspect is part of that group," Ramsey said. Both victims appeared to have been struck once inside the gym of Delaware Valley Charter High School, said Stanford. Ramsey said that authorities didn't know yet if they were struck by the same bullet or more than one, noting that no shell was found at the scene.
