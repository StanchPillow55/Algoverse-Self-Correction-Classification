Question:
Passage: When Everton's Joel Robles and West Ham's Adrian were trying to put off those taking penalties during their FA Cup shoot-out, referee Neil Swarbrick was losing patience with the goalkeepers. Robles and Adrian were warned by the official for their antics several times and told to return to their line to wait for the penalty to be taken. But, with Robles already cautioned, the 24-year-old was on thin ice, especially when Swarbrick approached him with a yellow card in his hand. So, could the Everton goalkeeper have been sent off for a second bookable offence during the shoot-out that finished 9-8 in West Ham's favour?
