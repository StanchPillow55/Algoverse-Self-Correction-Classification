Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Mourners packed church pews Tuesday at a memorial service for seven victims slain in a shooting rampage at a small religious college in Oakland, California. "We realize that at this time we have to draw together, uniting for peace, praying for peace in our city, and praying to stop the violence," said a woman who introduced various parts of the service. Meanwhile, authorities continued searching for the weapon a gunman used Monday when he killed seven people execution-style at Oikos University. Accused shooter One Goh gave some details to investigators about Monday's attack, but refused to say where he disposed of the gun, police said.
