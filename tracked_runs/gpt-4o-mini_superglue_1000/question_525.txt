Question:
Passage: By Daniel Miller Updated: 13:19 EST, 16 February 2012 Syrian government forces launched a series of blistering attacks in the major cities of Deera, Hama and Homs, a day after President Bashar Assad's offer of a referendum was rejected by both rebel forces and the entire western world. Tanks and armoured personnel carriers rumbled through residential streets while terrified citizens took shelter in their homes as heavy artillery rained down reducing many buildings to rubble. In Deera, the border city where the uprising began last March, locals reported large explosions and machinegun fire echoing through districts under constant attack by government troops.
