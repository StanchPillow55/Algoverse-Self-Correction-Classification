Question:
Passage: (CNNGo) -- OK, you've decided Valentine's Day is the day to pop the big question. You cheesemeister. But picking February 14 means you're going to have to do it in spectacular fashion. And in a place in which she'll be so overcome by images of butterflies, rose petals and couples sprinting toward each other in meadows that a "No" is simply not a possibility. These are the sweetest places to begin the rest of your life. 10. Petra, Jordan A poet once described Petra as "a rose-red city half as old as time." Make this a metaphor for your own enduring romance by popping the question while this city carved into rock faces more than 2,000 years ago is lit up by rows of flickering candles.
