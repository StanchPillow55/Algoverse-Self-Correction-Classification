Question:
Passage: By Emma Innes PUBLISHED: 06:04 EST, 14 June 2013 | UPDATED: 07:34 EST, 14 June 2013 Hospital bosses have admitted responsibility for the death of a newborn baby following an ‘appalling catalogue of failings’ by midwives. Lesley Broughton and Jason Ham's first child, Ford, died of brain damage caused by oxygen starvation at Redditch’s Alexandra Hospital shortly after his birth on October 3, 2010. Ms Broughton, 31, lost so much blood during labour that she feared for her own life. She also had to wait more than two hours to be sent for an emergency Caesarean section after Ford’s heartbeat dropped.
