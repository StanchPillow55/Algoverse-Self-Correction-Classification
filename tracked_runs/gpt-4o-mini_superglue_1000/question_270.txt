Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Risking their lives to help disadvantaged Afghans became almost a norm for Tom and Libby Little. "We raised our three daughters through what was, at times, just hell," Libby Little said. "A hundred rockets a day was a good day." Family members lived underground to avoid bombings, she said. Yet they stayed out of a love for the people and a passion for providing eye care for the needy. But violence prevailed on Thursday. Tom Little, a New York optometrist, was among 10 people killed by gunmen in Badakhshan, a remote northeastern region of the country. The mostly foreign members of a medical team were robbed and shot one-by-one on a remote road. Their bodies were transferred to Kabul early Sunday, authorities said.
