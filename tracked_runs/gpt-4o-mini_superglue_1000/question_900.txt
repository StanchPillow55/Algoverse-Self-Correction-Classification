Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Starbucks, McDonald's, Zara -- many of the international chains have tried to colonize Paris but the city seems to have put up more resistance than, say, London or New York. Parisians still love their little neighborhood vendors selling one thing and selling it very well -- shops of a kind apparently threatened with extinction in other big cosmopolitan cities. Not that these often quirky Paris establishments are all old, family-run and hidden down a side street. Some are new and pushing retail boundaries far more boldly than your average timid multinational. When it comes to shopping in the French capital, some of the best things still come in small packages -- probably one beautifully wrapped and tied with a neat little bow.
