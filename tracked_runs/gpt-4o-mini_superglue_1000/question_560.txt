Passage: By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 10:58 EST, 7 May 2012 | UPDATED: 01:40 EST, 8 May 2012 Facebook co-founder and former Mark Zuckerberg roommate, Dustin Moskovitz, is by many accounts the world's youngest self-made billionaire. But as Facebook's long-awaited May 18 share floatation approaches, the 27-year-old isn't sipping champagne in the Caribbean.
