Question:
Passage: A grieving mother has told how her beautiful daughter was murdered and failed by South Africa's justice system in a chilling echo of the Oscar Pistorious case. British-born Lauren Sleep, 25, was allegedly strangled by her jealous boyfriend Chad Khan who feared their relationship was about to end. But her family claim that Khan has evaded arrest for eight years because of his family's status in South Africa and been allowed to disappear. And like the family of Reeva Steenkamp - who saw Pistorious jailed for just five years for culpable homicide - they fear they will never fully get justice.
