Question:
Passage: As England take stock ahead of surely the defining match of this Six Nations against Ireland, my advice would be: ‘Don’t buy into the cliches. Don’t waste a second about what is meant to happen and how such a massive occasion is meant to play out. Just have the confidence to produce your A game, execute and win.’ Rugby is full of these cliches and they can get into your head. ‘You never know which French team are going to turn up’; ‘The Italian pack will always make life difficult’; ‘The South Africans will always out-muscle you up front’; ‘New Zealand run the ball from everywhere’; ‘The Australians can’t scrummage’; ‘Playing Ireland on a wet afternoon in Dublin is hell’; ‘You must silence the crowd in Cardiff’, etc.

Query: England need to be very alert tactically in those opening exchanges against @placeholder — at kick-offs and re-starts for example.
