Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Fehmi Khairullah, a Syrian-American doctor living in New Jersey, says he cannot sleep these days. "The humanitarian situation in many parts of Syria has reached its lowest point. It is so horrific," said Khairullah, who collects and delivers aid to Syria. As violence escalates in the sanctions-hit country and - - many argue -- the lack of government cooperation, humanitarian groups have been unable to reach those suffering the most in the country. Even the International Committee of the Red Cross & Red Crescent, the only independent international aid agency operating inside Syria, has not reached trapped citizens in devastated areas such as the Baba Amr neighborhood in the city of Homs.
