Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- A niece of fashion designer Ralph Lauren appeared Tuesday at an Irish court hearing on charges that included air rage related to an incident on Monday, CNN affiliate TV3 reported. A judge was considering a bail application for Jennifer Lauren, 41, the Irish commercial broadcaster reported. Lauren spent Monday night at the Shannon Garda Station and appeared Tuesday at the hearing, which was held in a pub, state broadcaster RTE reported. Local media reported that the unlikely location was because there was no dedicated courthouse in the area. The incident occurred aboard a Barcelona-to-New York flight that was diverted to Shannon Airport. Lauren is charged with engaging in threatening, abusive or insulting behavior intended to disrupt the peace or being reckless as to whether a breach of the peace might have been caused, RTE said.
