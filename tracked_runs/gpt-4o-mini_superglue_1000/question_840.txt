Question:
Passage: Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Five American service members were killed Thursday after an improvised explosive device detonated in southern Afghanistan, officials said. The attack occurred several days after 30 Americans died in a helicopter crash in central-eastern Afghanistan. That was America's worst single-incident loss of life since the war began. No other details were provided regarding Thursday's incident. On Wednesday, Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi told reporters that coalition forces had killed 189 militants in joint operations against Taliban insurgents across the country in the past three weeks. Azimi announced that 362 insurgents had been detained since July 23, as NATO and Afghan forces stepped up raids against Taliban strongholds.
