Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Two former World Cup champions have already crashed out of contention for this year's trophy, and a third one will join them on Tuesday. Tiny Uruguay -- arguably the country that punches the farthest above its weight in global soccer -- is hoping it won't be them. But they need to beat Italy to get out of the group stage and into the knockout round. Italy has won the World Cup four times and been runner-up twice, but Uruguay has won it twice themselves. Ahead of the crunch match, here are some numbers that might surprise you: Size of Uruguay's population: About 3.3 million people, making it the smallest country in the World Cup this year. That's not many more than Italy's capital, Rome.
