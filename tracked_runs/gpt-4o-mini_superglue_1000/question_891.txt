Question:
Passage: A woman dubbed 'Jihottie' after she was cleared of smuggling money to an extremist fighter in Syria has insisted she did not get off because of her looks - on the day her friend was jailed. Nawal Msaad, 27, was found not guilty of making money available for terrorism after she was caught with £15,830 (20,000 euros) in her underwear at Heathrow Airport. A trial heard her school friend, Amal El-Wahabi, had hoodwinked her into taking the money to her husband Aine Davis, a drug dealer who went to Syria to fight in July last year. A jury found mother-of-two El-Wahabi guilty but cleared Msaad of making money available with 'reasonable cause to suspect that it would or may be used for the purposes of terrorism'.
