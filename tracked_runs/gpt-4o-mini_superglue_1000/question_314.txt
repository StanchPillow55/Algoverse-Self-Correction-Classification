Question:
Passage: By John Preston WOUNDED TIGER: A HISTORY OF CRICKET IN PAKISTAN by Peter Oborne (Simon & Schuster £25) One of the many strange things about Pakistani cricket is that the aggression, the competitiveness and the bloody-mindedness the team displays on the pitch are nothing compared with what goes on in the dressing room. Reading Peter Oborne’s splendidly eccentric, if at times understandably exasperated, history of Pakistan cricket, I lost track of the number of times a player threw a tremendous strop and stomped off into the sunset. Matters were not helped when Saeed Ahmed, booked to go out to bat at the fall of the first wicket, locked himself in the bathroom and refused to come out, Oborne notes wearily of the first Test against England in 1967. Only a few pages later, Saeed Ahmed is at it again, this time going AWOL on a shopping trip with his wife.
@highlight
Peter Oborne re-visits the match-fixing case involving Mohammad Amir
@highlight
Pakistani cricketers historically played for teams sponsored by the armed forces, police, or government departments
@highlight
The Taliban turn out to be keen cricketers, although Al-Qaeda are less keen

Query: He insists, very persuasively, that @placeholder was an innocent caught up in events that were way out of his control.
