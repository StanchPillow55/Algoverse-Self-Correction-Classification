Question:
Passage: The mother of Sandy Hook Elementary gunman Adam Lanza has been remembered at a small family-only gathering at the Kingston, New Hampshire home where she grew up. Nancy Lanza, who was shot by her 20-year-old son as she lay in bed in their Connecticut home last Friday, lived in the 1760s-era home where her brother James Champion, a policeman, now lives. On Thursday, around two dozen relatives and friends in dark clothing attended the home for the service, but it is not known whether the memorial also served as a funeral or if she has been buried. While authorities said her body had been claimed and released to a funeral home - without providing further details - they have not said whether Adam's body has been claimed.
