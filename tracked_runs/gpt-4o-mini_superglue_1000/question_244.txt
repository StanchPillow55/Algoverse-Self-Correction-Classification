Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- It was a penalty shootout that summed up Manchester United's season -- errant, careless and ultimately forlorn. This was the team that have dominated English football for years, one of the biggest on the planet. Yet here they were, slugging it out from the penalty spot with lowly Sunderland in the semifinal of the English League Cup, with a place at Wembley at stake. Usually so composed in pressure situations, United's players blinked, four of them missing from 12 yards out as this interminable season took another turn for the worse. Since Sunderland last won silverware in 1973, Manchester United have won 25 domestic trophies, but before the end of January the only competition they are still in with a realistic chance of winning is the European Champions League.
