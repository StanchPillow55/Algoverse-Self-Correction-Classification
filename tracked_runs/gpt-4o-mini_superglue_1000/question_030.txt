Question:
Passage: Getting humans to Mars will be no easy feat - it will take upwards of nine months to get there, and a complex spacecraft will be needed to land on the red planet and return the astronauts home. But with a view to one day making the journey a reality, Boeing has released a video that shows the steps that will need to be taken to get there. They explain how two of the six pieces needed for Mars travel, Nasa’s SLS and Orion, are in production now - but we’ll need a much bigger spacecraft to make the dream a reality.
