Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- The once ragtag Somalia-based al Qaeda affiliate group known as Al-Shabaab has grown into an economic powerhouse, raising tens of millions of dollars in cash every year from a variety of schemes involving extortion, illegal taxation and other "fees," according to a United Nations report. The United States believes the group is closely coordinating with al Qaeda groups in Yemen and may be plotting attacks in the region and abroad. The terrorist group now "generates between $70 million and $100 million per year, from duties and fees levied at airports and seaports, taxes on goods and services, taxes in kind on domestic produce, 'jihad contributions,' checkpoints and various forms of extortion justified in terms of religious obligation," according to the July 18 report from the U.N. Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea.
