Florida teenager Andrew Anderson, 19, was arrested on Tuesday by Collier County police for giving away discounts to customers he believed were in need at an East Naples store. 'People would come in on bicycles -- wearing all of the clothes they had, coming in with $2, $3 max,' he told NBC2. 'I wasn't actually stealing. Goodwill is a giving and helping company, so I took it upon myself to be giving and helping because I feel people deserve it.'
