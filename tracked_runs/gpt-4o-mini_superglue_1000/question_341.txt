Question:
Passage: Solving the mystery of how 900-year-old African coins ended up in remote Australia could not only recast the history of foreign contact Down Under, but shed light on Aboriginal rock art. How the ancient Kilwa coins, believed to date from about 1100, came to be discovered on the Wessels Islands off the Northern Territory in 1944 has long posed questions about foreign visits to far off Australian shores. Australian Ian McIntosh, a professor of anthropology at Indiana University-Purdue University in the United States, said rock art found on the islands -- which includes one image which appears to show a type of European sailing vessel -- could hold some clues.
@highlight
Coins date back to six centuries before Captain Cook claimed the island for the British throne in 1770- but where they came from remains a mystery
@highlight
Last month rock art was found that may provide clues about their origin
@highlight
Scientists hope to match the ships depicted in the art with known vessels

Query: Australian scientist and professor at Indiana University, @placeholder, points to the location where the copper coins were found
