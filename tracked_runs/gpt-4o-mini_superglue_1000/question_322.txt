Question:
Passage: By Hugo Duncan PUBLISHED: 06:50 EST, 8 November 2013 | UPDATED: 20:51 EST, 8 November 2013 France was rocked by a further downgrade to its credit rating yesterday as the country’s economic woes mounted. Credit agency Standard & Poor’s cut its rating on French debt from AA+ to AA in a humiliating setback for President Francois Hollande and his socialist administration. In a devastating analysis, the agency highlighted the risks posed by weak economic growth, high unemployment, the rising national debt and ‘elevated’ levels of tax and spending. The move, which made a mockery of Mr Hollande’s claim in August that ‘the recovery is here’, sparked a furious reaction in Paris.
@highlight
The move comes two years after the country lost its top-rated AAA status
@highlight
Polls show Hollande as one of the most unpopular French presidents ever
