Question:
Passage: Dylan Hartley escaped another lengthy ban which would have jeopardised his Six Nations participation but still left Stuart Lancaster facing a selection headache on Tuesday night. The 28-year-old Northampton hooker received a three-week suspension - the fifth ban of his career - at a disciplinary hearing in London following an ugly incident during Saturday’s East Midlands derby which saw him sent off by referee JP Doyle after 16 minutes for elbowing Leicester centre Matt Smith in the face. RFU judicial officer Jeremy Summers accepted Hartley’s guilty plea and mitigating circumstances, which included a degree of provocation by Smith, but took into consideration his appalling disciplinary record.
