Question:
Passage: By Margot Peppers PUBLISHED: 09:56 EST, 18 December 2013 | UPDATED: 13:58 EST, 18 December 2013 A haunting new short film starring Elle Fanning portrays the horrors of bulimia, but some say the depiction is somewhat too accurate. Directed by Rodrigo Prieto with the help of his 19-year-old daughter Ximena, who was anorexic in her early teens, The Likeness stars Elle Fanning as a girl troubled by body image issues as she tries to physically tear her own skin off in self-disgust. But while some claim the film truthfully captures the psychological agony of an eating disorder, others warn that it is more harmful than helpful for those who actually struggle with disordered eating.
