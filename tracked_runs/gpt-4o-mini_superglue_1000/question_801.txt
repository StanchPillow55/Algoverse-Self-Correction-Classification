Question:
Passage: This Christmas was always going to be difficult for the family for Lily-Mae McKinstry, a 10-year-old from Essex who tragically died of brain cancer last month. But the shadow hanging over the family's festive season has been partially lifted after mystery Christmas presents starting arriving in the post. The schoolgirl's parents have now discovered that their daughter spent her final days buying her relatives gifts online. Lily, from Chelmsford, lost her battle with a rare and terminal brain tumour earlier this winter, leaving her parents Andrew and Vicki heartbroken. But they have been left amazed at their daughter's ingenuity after they started receiving the gifts she bought with her father's credit card in the post.
