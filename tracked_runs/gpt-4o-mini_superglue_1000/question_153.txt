Passage: Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- The Australian editor of a Myanmar newspaper was ordered to remain in jail after a court hearing in Yangon Thursday. Officials revealed at the hearing that Ross Dunkley, the editor of the Myanmar Times, faces charges related to torturing and drugging a woman. Dunkley was arrested in early February. At the time, authorities said he faced immigration charges. At the hearing Thursday, authorities added the drug and torture charges stating that Myanmar law dictates that any foreigner who faces criminal charges always faces additional immigration charges. The woman making the allegations against Dunkley was at the hearing, and said the editor gave her a drug on two occasions that hampered her memory. On the second time, the woman said she jumped out of Dunkley's car to escape.
