Question:
Passage: (CNN)  -- New Chelsea signing Fernando Torres said his transfer deadline-day move to the English Premier League champions from division rivals Liverpool was a "step forward" in his career. After much media speculation over the striker's future, Torres joined the Blues on a five-and-half-year contract on Monday, in a deal secured just before the January transfer window came to a dramatic close. "I felt that I needed a step forward in my career and for my ambition as a footballer," the 26-year-old Torres said in an interview with the club's official website on Tuesday. "I am joining a team that is at the top level -- there is not another level after Chelsea," he added.
