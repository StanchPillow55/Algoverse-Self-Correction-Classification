Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- If Vladimir Putin wanted to get America's attention, he's done a pretty good job. The Russian president's opinion piece arguing against military intervention in Syria, published on The New York Times' website late Wednesday, set off a flurry of reactions -- some outraged, some impressed, and some just plain bemused. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez said the piece made him almost want to throw up, and House Speaker John Boehner said he was "insulted." Putin said he wrote the article "to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders." But he appeared to have raised some hackles with the last paragraph in which he disputed the idea of American exceptionalism.
