Question:
Passage: Click here to see more of our brilliant Match Zone, including an impressive 25-pass build-up for Lukaku's goal When Roberto Martinez met Samuel Eto’o one Sunday in late August for a coffee, there was only one question he wanted answering. Did he have the hunger to play on a cold afternoon in the North West, when the going was tough and the environment was unforgiving? Everton’s manager never had a concern about Eto’o’s quality but he needed to see if the desire was still there. Eto’o has never given Martinez a moment to think he made a wrong move but his decision was vindicated once again at blustery Turf Moor, as his two goals inspired Everton to a comfortable 3-1 victory over Burnley.
@highlight
Samuel Eto'o opened the scoring early on for Everton with a thunderous header in off the crossbar
@highlight
Danny Ings levelled the scores shortly after when he took the ball round Tim Howard and slotted home
@highlight
Romelu Lukaku restored Everton's lead in the second half, but was always second-best to his strike partner
@highlight
Eto'o made sure of the points with his second of the match in the second half, a wonderful curling effort

Query: ‘I like Samuel when he is in that type of form,’ said Martinez, who saw @placeholder atone for the mistake that gifted Burnley a goal by scoring Everton’s second.
