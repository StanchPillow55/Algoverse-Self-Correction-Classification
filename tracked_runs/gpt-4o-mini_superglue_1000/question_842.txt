Question:
Passage: There were echoes of Harald Schumacher's infamous pole-axing of Patrick Battiston as Manuel Neuer clattered in to Gonzalo Higuain in Sunday night's World Cup final. True, the giant German goalkeeper got the ball as he came out to punch clear early in the second half, but as his flying floored the Argentina strike, thoughts immediately turned to the 1982 World Cup semi-final. Then-Germany keeper Schumacher was nowhere near the ball when he took Battiston out, with the referee somehow not awarding a free-kick after the ball had trickled wide.
