Question:
Passage: Ukip has been condemned as 'absolutely vile' by Labour rising star Chuka Umunna, who accused Nigel Farage of trying to blame foreigners for all of Britain's problems. In his most outspoken attack yet, Mr Umunna said Ukip was 'sowing the seeds of division' by accusing 'that bunch over there' of being responsible for a shortage of housing, GP appointments and well-paid jobs. The shadow business secretary attacked Ukip's 'abhorrent' language about immigrants and the 'distasteful' spectacle of the Ukip Calypso song performed by DJ Mike Read in a mock Jamaican accent. Scroll down for video Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna condemned the 'abhorrent' views of Nigel Farage's Ukip which he claimed often go unchallenged
