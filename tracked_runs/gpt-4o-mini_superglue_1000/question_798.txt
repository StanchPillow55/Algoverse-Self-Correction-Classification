Question:
Passage: Barack Obama's Ivy-League educated half-brother is publishing his autobiography next month, painting a dramatically different picture of their few meetings from the one the president related in his best-selling 'Dreams from My Father' memoir. Mark Obama Ndesandjo includes an appendix in his book, cataloguing what he says are factual errors in 'Dreams' â€“ including words falsely attributed to his mother, a Jewish woman named Ruth. 'A lot of the stuff that Barack wrote is wrong in that book, and I can understand that,' he told the Associated Press last year when he planned to self-publish his book. 'To me,' Ndesandjo said then, 'for him the book was a tool for fashioning an identity and he was using composites. I wanted the record to be straight. I wanted to tell my own story, not let people tell it for me.'
