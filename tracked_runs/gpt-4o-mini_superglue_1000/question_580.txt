Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Are these the worst working hours in world sport? Twenty days at a time working four hours on and four hours off, crammed onto a boat with seven crewmates, some freeze-dried food and one change of clothes each. Repeat for nine months, until you have crossed the globe. "My family didn't want me to join this team," admits Liu Ming, who goes by the English name Leo on the boat. His teammate, Cheng Ying Kit, confides: "Actually, I haven't told my family yet. They don't know I'm going to do offshore sailing." Leo and Kit are fighting to join an experimental boat for one of sport's toughest events: the Volvo Ocean Race.
