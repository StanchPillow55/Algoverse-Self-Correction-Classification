Question:
Passage: By Emma Innes PUBLISHED: 05:15 EST, 30 April 2013 | UPDATED: 05:37 EST, 30 April 2013 All 15 to 65-year-olds should be tested for HIV, according to an influential American panel. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is calling for all Americans within this age range to be tested - regardless of whether they are considered to be at high risk. They hope this change might help to lift some of the stigma associated with HIV testing. Despite efforts to reduce cases of HIV infection in the United States in the past three decades, as many as 50,000 Americans become infected with the virus each year.
