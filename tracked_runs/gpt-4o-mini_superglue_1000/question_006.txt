Question:
Passage: (CNN)Ever wanted a Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition with even more curves? Plus-size model Robyn Lawley teamed up with Swimsuits for All last year to recreate the 2014 cover with bigger models. Now she doesn't need to invent an alternate version of the magazine. Lawley, who is a  size 12, is the first plus-size model and one of seven "rookies" featured in the 2015 swimsuit issue, on newsstands Tuesday. A size 12? That's still smaller than the average American woman, who wears a size 14. But in a fashion world where wearing a size 8 and standing 5' 8" can be considered "plus-size," the magazine featuring Lawley is a stitch closer to most women's reality.

Query: It's true that no one expects @placeholder's annual display of skin and teeny tiny bathing suits to be a realistic portrayal of average American women.
