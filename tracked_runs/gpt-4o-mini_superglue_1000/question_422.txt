Question:
Passage: Jerusalem (CNN) -- Palestinian inmates began leaving Israeli jails early Tuesday, setting in motion the historic swap that will trade more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners for one captured Israeli soldier. A total of 477 prisoners were being moved to meeting points with the Red Cross, according to a spokeswoman at Israel's Prison Authority. Israeli radio reported that more than 1,000 police officers were deployed to ensure public order and the safety of the convoys, which headed to the Egyptian border. Late Monday, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected appeals against the release of prisoners in exchange for captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.
