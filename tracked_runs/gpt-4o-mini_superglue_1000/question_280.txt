Question:
Passage: By Jamie Mcginnes PUBLISHED: 07:07 EST, 15 June 2012 | UPDATED: 11:06 EST, 15 June 2012 A three-year-old South African girl who suffered burns to 80 per cent of her body in an accident at a family barbecue is recovering after being given a new layer of 'cloned' skin. Doctors did not expect Isabella 'Pippie' Kruger to survive after she was seriously injured on New Year's Eve when a container of fire lighting fluid exploded at her home in Johannesburg. This week, little Pippie underwent a groundbreaking operation that saw 41 pieces of skin flown in from America to be grafted onto her back, face, chest, arms and legs.
