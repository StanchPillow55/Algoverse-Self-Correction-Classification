Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The Syrian government launched a major military operation Monday, sending thousands of troops into the town where the country's uprising began to carry out what witnesses described as a brutal, wider-scale crackdown. The United States threatened sanctions against the country, calling for a halt to Syria's "deplorable" actions. At the United Nations, a draft statement condemning the violence was being circulated among security council members, a U.N. diplomat said. Between 4,000 and 5,000 members of the Army and security forces equipped with tanks raided the southern city of Daraa just after 4 a.m. and began shooting indiscriminately, in some cases shooting into homes as people slept, according to an activist with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
