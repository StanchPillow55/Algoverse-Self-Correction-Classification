Question:
Passage: She might be one of the world's longest serving heads of state but it seems that not even the Queen is exempt from getting stuck in a traffic jam. The 88-year-old monarch was en route to a reception at Canada House in London, when her official Bentley got stuck in the notoriously heavy traffic in Trafalgar Square. Luckily for the Queen, who was travelling with the Duke of Edinburgh, her driver managed to extricate the car and get her to the event on schedule.
