Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The streets of Manila can be an unforgiving place for the city's taxi and public transport drivers. Chronic traffic jams and badly maintained roads are part of the daily grind but add in the possibility of floods during the annual typhoon season and a strong constitution is needed. But Josefina Barandon doesn't mind, and as one of the city's few female drivers will happily take to the streets in her electric jeepney as long as she is able to, come rain or shine. Barandon is one of three women driving Manila's 20-strong fleet of electric public vehicles that ply the streets of Makati, the capital's central business district.
