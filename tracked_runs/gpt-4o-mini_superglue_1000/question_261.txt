Question:
Passage: President Barack Obama on Saturday nominated Loretta Lynch as his next U.S. attorney general, describing the two-time U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York as a "tough, fair and independent" lawyer. "It's pretty hard to be more qualified for this job than Loretta Lynch," Obama said at the White House, where he was joined by Lynch and outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder. "I can think of no better public servant to be our next attorney general." The president said the Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Lynch twice before as a federal prosecutor. "It's my hope that the Senate will confirm her for a third time without delay," he said.
