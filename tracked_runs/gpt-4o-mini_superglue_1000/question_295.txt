Question:
Passage: Martin Skrtel may have suffered a nasty cut to the head during Liverpool's 2-2 draw with Arsenal on Sunday - but that did not stop him enjoying a day out with his family at Winter Wonderland. Skrtel scored an injury time equaliser for Liverpool to earn a point, but had earlier suffered a horrible wound which required eight stitches during six minutes on treatment on the pitch. The Slovakia defender suffered the injury after feeling the full force of Olivier Giroud's boot. But he was all smiles on Monday as he posed for a picture at the Christmas themed attraction with wife Barbara Lovasova and son Matteo.
