Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Experts are putting forward all sorts of reasons Mexico recently became more obese than the United States -- and one of the most overweight countries in the world. Poverty, tacos, urbanization, soda. Those are the widely discussed culprits. And they, along with the choices people in Mexico make, are no doubt part of the story. But there's an uberfactor here: Mexico's neighbor to the north. Could one reason for Mexico's growing, deadly obesity problem be that the country is unfortunate enough to share a border with the United States -- land of the Coke, home of diabetes?
@highlight
U.N. report says Mexico is now more obese than the United States
@highlight
John Sutter: Maybe we should blame Mexico's northern neighbor
@highlight
He says U.S. trends like fast food and sugary soda have drifted south
@highlight
Sutter: "The least the U.S. could do is be a better neighbor"

Query: "So do the @placeholder food and drink giants who sell vast quantities south of the border and have already proved adept at fending off sin taxes and other forms of anti-obesity regulation in the United States."
