Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Franklin Gomez is dying. His ribcage heaves up and down as a machine forces air into his lungs, screaming and beeping as it synchronizes with bags bringing him fluid and morphine. His four kids watch over him. His wife, Rosanna, squeezes my hand and says through tears: "He is going to die and I can't do anything." I first met Rosanna weeks after our daughter, Luna, was born. My friends Mirta and Maite had employed her as their caregiver and adored her affectionate way with children. Luna was lying in her playpen screaming, her eyes freshly opened. I raced around the apartment in my pajamas at 4 p.m., trying to figure out how to breast-feed. Luna became calm almost as soon as Rosanna picked her up.
