Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Nature abhors a vacuum but terrorism relishes one. And Iraq appears to be offering new space for al Qaeda and other militant groups, as political rivalries and sectarian animosities deepen. The coordinated bomb explosions across Baghdad Thursday -- which killed more than 60 people -- bear the hallmark of Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), which is closely associated with al Qaeda. No other group in Iraq has shown itself capable of such synchronized suicide attacks. Some, but not all, of the bombings were in Shiite neighborhoods; frequently al Qaeda's targets appear indiscriminate as part of a strategy to sow fear and stir sectarian tensions.
@highlight
Bombings are an indication that terror groups in Iraq are finding space to operate
@highlight
Attack came as Iraq's Shiite prime minister orders arrest of Sunni vice-president
@highlight
Iraqi officials speak of a new al Qaeda made up of Sunni fighters; U.S. officials say Shiite groups sponsored by Iran are a bigger danger
@highlight
Meanwhile the prime minister does not want Iraq to be a proxy battleground for Saudi Arabia and Iran

Query: But when the U.S. military left Iraq, it took its intelligence-gathering with it -- making the job of @placeholder counter-terrorism units more challenging still.
