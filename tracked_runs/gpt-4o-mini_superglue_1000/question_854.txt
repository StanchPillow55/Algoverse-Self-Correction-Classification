Question:
Passage: (CNN)More than 18 months ago, the body of Odin Lloyd was found in an industrial park in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. Lloyd had been shot seven times near a pile of construction waste. The semipro football player for the Boston Bandits was 27. Days after he was found dead, then-NFL star Aaron Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder. Testimony in the case against Hernandez began this week. Hernandez also faces murder charges in a 2012 double homicide. He has pleaded not guilty. The charges mark the latest turn in Hernandez's downward spiral. Just two years ago, he was one of the NFL's most promising tight ends, inking a $40-million contract extension with the New England Patriots.
