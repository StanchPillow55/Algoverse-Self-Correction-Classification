Question:
Paragraph: Gravitational Potential Energy is affected by position. Like the leaves on trees, anything that is raised up has the potential to fall. It has potential energy. You can see examples of people with gravitational potential energy in 1.5 Figure below. Gravitational potential energy depends on two things. It depends on its weight, because a large falling rock can do more damage than a leaf falling from a tree. It also depends on its height above the ground. Like the skateboarder, the higher the ramp, the faster he will be going when he reaches the bottom. Like all energy, gravitational potential energy has the ability to do work. In this case, weight has the potential to deliver a force. More important for us is that it has the ability to cause change. What kind of change you may ask? Gravitational potential energy has the ability to cause motion. 

Question: Why is the skateboarder, who is up on a ramp, able to move downward to the bottom of the ramp?

Answer: Because the skateboarder possesses gravitational potential energy which is causing motion
