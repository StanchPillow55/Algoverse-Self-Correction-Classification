Question:
Passage: Marco Rubio needed to get back on the radar after his fellow Floridian, Jeb Bush, jolted the political world this week with an announcement that he was considering a presidential run. The Republican senator got help from an unlikely source: President Barack Obama Rubio seized on Obama's decision to thaw relations with Cuba to become the first -- and most forceful -- of the potential 2016 presidential contenders to oppose the move. He appeared on every major news network except for MSNBC on Wednesday, hammering  Obama as "willfully ignorant" on U.S.-Cuba relations and promising to do everything within his power as an incoming chairman of a subcommittee that handles Cuba policy to "unravel" the administration's plans.
