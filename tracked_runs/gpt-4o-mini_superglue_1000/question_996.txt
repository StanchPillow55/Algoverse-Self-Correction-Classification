Question:
Passage: Luay al-Khatteeb has spoken to CNN previously about the rise of ISIS, and the challenges facing the Iraq's new oil minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi. Now, U.S. airstrikes have hit locations in eastern Syria where ISIS has been using mobile refineries to produce oil. CNN has revisited the conversation to find out the likely impact of the strikes. This is al-Khatteeb's analysis of the situation. What impact will the U.S. strikes on oil refineries have on ISIS? The impact of these strikes on ISIS oil refineries are going to be immense and grave. If they are hitting the facilities and the oil convoys on the smuggling roads they will significantly disrupt supply and regular production. If the bombardments continue it will impact the energy supply and deny ISIS much-needed fuel for their mobility and the servicing of the communities under their rule -- now around 8 million people between Iraq and Syria. It makes sense to target the refineries rather than the oil fields, as the crude can't be used to drive the tankers. The crude can be sold but the refined oil is much more valuable.
