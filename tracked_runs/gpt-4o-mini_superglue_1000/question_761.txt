Question:
Passage: It was a Pandora's Box of eccentricity and glamor. Open for just 33 months from 1977 to 1981, Studio 54 remains the ultimate discotheque. Only the beautiful, famous and socially-connected could be sure of entry. The lucky partygoers that made it into the New York City establishment reveled among celebrities, blaring music, champagne, bubbles, costumes, art, theater - and occasionally animals. Hundreds, however, never managed to pass the red velvet rope. For those left out in the cold, award-winning photographer Tod Papageorge was there - and has now compiled the madness into a book. Here is a taste of his spectacular insights.
