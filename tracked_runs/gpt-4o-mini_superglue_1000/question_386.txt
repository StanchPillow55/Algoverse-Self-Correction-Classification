Question:
Passage: (RollingStone.com ) -- Country fans are dancing on the streets of Chicago... and crying into their Guinness glasses in Dublin. Garth Brooks confirms new album, world tour The Windy City will be the first stop on Garth Brooks' world tour â€” his first in 13 years â€” as revealed Monday by a fan named Andy Roberts in Atlanta. The facility maintenance company owner announced the news on Twitter after a personal phone call from Brooks with the Chicago revelation. It seems Roberts was in the audience at one of the country superstar's Las Vegas concerts and asked during a Q-and-A portion of the show where the first tour stop will be. Brooks' answer was that he'd be the first to know and could do whatever he wanted with the information. As for the Chicago date and venue, the "Good Ride Cowboy" will announce that himself on Tuesday.
