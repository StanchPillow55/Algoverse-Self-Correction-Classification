Question:
Passage: By Joshua Gardner PUBLISHED: 14:09 EST, 16 September 2013 | UPDATED: 15:17 EST, 16 September 2013 Just hours after the nation was rocked by news of a mass shooting in Washigton’s Navy Yard, a politician in Russia shocked them once more by mocking the tragedy before a death toll had even been tallied. Alexei Pushkov took to Twitter Monday morning and used Obama’s words from a speech on the Syria crisis to ridicule Americans in the wake of the tragedy in the capital. ‘A new shootout at Navy headquarters in Washington – a lone gunman and 7 corpses. Nobody’s even surprised anymore,’ Pushkov tweeted two hours after shots first rang out. ‘A clear confirmation of American exceptionalism.’
