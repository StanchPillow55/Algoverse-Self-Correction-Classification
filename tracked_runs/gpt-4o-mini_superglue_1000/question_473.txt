Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- "Hey, Joe!" There was a time in American life that if you shouted those words on a busy street, or on a factory floor, you might see dozens of people turning expectantly toward you. Joes were everywhere. For much of U.S. history, Joseph was one of the top 10 names that families gave to their newborn sons. Today, Joe no longer even makes the top 20. America is ever-changing, in any number of ways, and one of the most fascinating of them can be found in the names mothers and fathers give to their sons and daughters. The Social Security Administration, in addition to sending checks to older Americans, keeps track of the names of the youngest Americans: newborns.
