Question:
Passage: By Jonathan O'Callaghan Harvard researchers have succeeded in creating quantum switches that can be turned on and off using a single photon. This technological achievement could pave the way for creating highly secure quantum networks. Built from single atoms, the first-of-their-kind switches could one day be networked via fiber-optic cables to form the backbone of a 'quantum Internet' that allows for perfectly secure communications. Quantum switches that can be turned on and off using a single photon have been created by researchers at Harvard, paving the way towards a 'quantum Internet' Professor of Physics Mikhail Lukin, together with Professor Vladan Vuletic of MIT, led a team consisting of graduate students Jeff Thompson and Lee Liu and postdoctoral fellows Tobias Tiecke and Nathalie de Leon to construct the new system.
@highlight
Researchers at Harvard University have made 'quantum switches'
@highlight
The tiny atom-sized devices can be turned on and off using a single photon
@highlight
They could one day be used as the backbone of a quantum Internet
@highlight
This would pave the way for 100 per cent secure communications
@highlight
Prototype quantum networks could appear as soon as the next decade

Query: 'What @placeholder and Tobias have done is create a hybrid system.
