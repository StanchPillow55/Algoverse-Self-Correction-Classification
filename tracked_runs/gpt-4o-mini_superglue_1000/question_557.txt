Passage: (CNN) -- The race is on to locate the latest Banksy on the streets of New York. The work shows a dog urinating on a fire hydrant -- with a thought bubble above the hydrant reading "You complete me." This is the third piece by the mysterious street artist to appear this week. The first depicted two boys reaching up to a sign which said "Graffiti Is a Crime." The second simply read "This is my New York Accent... normally I write like this." Banksy authenticated the works by publishing them on his website and within hours they were located and defaced.
