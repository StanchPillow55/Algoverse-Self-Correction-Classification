Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- The tight Senate race in Iowa just won't budge. The race opposing Republican Joni Ernst and Democrat Bruce Braley is still locked in a dead heat according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday. Ernst just barely edges out her Democratic rival by two points 45-43, a lead that keeps her within the poll's margin of error. The contest could tilt the balance of power in Washington in a year when Republicans are favored to take back the Senate. The results from the survey of 967 likely voters in Iowa echoes the two other nonpartisan polls in this month which also showed Ernst with a razor-thin one- to two-point edge.
