Question:
Passage: When Wrexham's Joe Clarke leads his non-League team out at Stoke City on Sunday, he will give silent thanks to his famous pal Adam Johnson who allowed him to live like a Premier League king rent-free in Cristiano Ronaldo's mansion when his future as a full-time professional was very much in the balance. Back in 2011, Clarke's career was at a crossroads. Having started out at the bottom of the football pyramid with Evesham Town, Redditch United and Solihull Moors, a move up to the Conference with Darlington hadn't worked out and he was forced to try out at Wrexham without a guaranteed salary.
@highlight
It could have been so different for Joe Clarke had he not had the help of his friend Adam Johnson when his career was in the balance in 2011
@highlight
The then Manchester City winger let Clarke stay rent-free in the mansion he was renting off none other than Cristiano Ronaldo
@highlight
Clarke couldn't afford to pay the petrol for the 160-mile round trip from his home to north Wales but Johnson stepped in to help
@highlight
Now four years on Clarke faces Mark Hughes' Stoke side in the FA Cup

Query: It might be too much to ask for some of @placeholder's magic to rub off on Clarke, but you never know.
