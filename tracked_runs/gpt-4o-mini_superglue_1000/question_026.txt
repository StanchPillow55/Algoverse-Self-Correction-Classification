Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Red Bull and Ferrari have pulled out of the Formula One Teams Association due to conflict over proposals for cost cutting in the elite motorsport. The umbrella group was formed at Ferrari's Maranello base in 2008 to help the teams protect their interests in talks with ruling body the FIA and F1's rights holders. While the Italian marque's president Luca di Montezemolo was the initial leader of FOTA, since late 2009 it has been headed by McLaren chief Martin Whitmarsh. Hispania left FOTA at the end of the team's first season in 2010, and the latest defections mean that nine of the 12 teams on the grid are part of the group.
