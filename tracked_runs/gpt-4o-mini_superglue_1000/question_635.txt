Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Britain hosts a sporting event over the next fortnight that manages to combine every conceivable stereotype associated with the nation -- rain, royalty and heroic British failure. Wimbledon follows the Queen's Diamond Jubilee -- when Britons, with Union Jacks in hand, stood in the pouring rain as the monarch cruised past in a barge on the Thames -- and a day after the exit of England's soccer team from a major international tournament -- as so often before on penalties -- after defeat by Italy in Euro 2012. Since its inception in 1877 the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in a small, affluent suburb of south west London that gives the event its name, has presided over a tournament -- the oldest and grandest on the tennis circuit -- that has become more than simply another fixture on the grand slam calender.
@highlight
Wimbledon is the oldest tennis tournament in the world
@highlight
It began in 1877; defending champion Novak Djokovic hails its "tradition"
@highlight
The tournament is a powerful brand exporting one aspect of "Britishness"
@highlight
But is Wimbledon still a relevant reflection of the country today?

Query: "If Wimbledon is going to be derided, it's because it seems remote and insulated from this type of @placeholder."
