Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The 6-year-old boy swallowed whole in an Indiana sand dune over the weekend could make a full recovery, a medical official said Monday. Rescuers dug furiously for three and a half hours to extract little Nathan Woessner, who was recovered unconscious and rushed to the University of Chicago Medicine's Comer Children's Hospital. But Tracy Koogler, medical director at the hospital's pediatric intensive care unit, said doctors are signaling progress and possibly a full recovery. The boy is on a ventilator, she said, and is breathing at the capacity of a moderate intensive-care-unit pneumonia patient. He could have his breathing tube out later this week and could be out of the hospital in 10 days to two weeks with rehabilitation to follow, Koogler said. It's unclear what kind of lasting health issues he may have.
