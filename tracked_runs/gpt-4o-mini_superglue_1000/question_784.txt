Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Pennsylvania needs to change its law in the wake of a scandal over alleged child sexual abuse by a then-member of Penn State's football coaching team, the governor said Sunday. A new law is needed to make sure reports of alleged child sexual abuse are made to government authorities, Tom Corbett said. "Should the law be changed? Absolutely," Corbett said on NBC's "Meet the Press." Corbett was the attorney general who began an investigation of former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky. A 23-page grand jury report released last weekend described crimes that Sandusky allegedly committed against young boys between 1994 and 2009 -- some of them on campus, both during and after his tenure at at Penn State.
