Question ID: record_78740

Question:
Passage: Exactly where the mutual animosity comes from is a mystery but the friction between Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi was clear for all to see at the Ballon d’Or awards for the best footballer in the world. The body language of both players and their partners as they sat waiting for the result spoke volumes. Scratch a little deeper and it’s clear from both players’ vote in the competition that they could not bring themselves to recognise the other’s remarkable talents. For the record, Ronaldo, who tearfully accepted the top award, voted for Gareth Bale, Mesut Ozil and Radamel Falcao. Messi plumped for Andres Iniesta, Xavi and Neymar. Friendship, Spanish football politics and sheer childishness came before a genuine appraisal of genius.
@highlight
Ronaldo and Messi appeared to ignore each other at the Ballon d'Or
@highlight
Even their girlfriends were pictured with their backs to one another
@highlight
Messi only voted for Barcelona players while Ronaldo didn't choose him
@highlight
One theory is they need a hint of animosity to keep them motivated

Query: Messi won the award for the first time and Ronaldo, having emerged triumphant the previous year, whispered to @placeholder to enjoy his moment because the award would soon be coming back to him.
