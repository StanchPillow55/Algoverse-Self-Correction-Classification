Question:
Passage: A retired Canadian Mountie admitted in court Thursday to killing his wife over a Ninetendo Wii game bet. Keith Wiens, who has been charged with second degree murder in the 2011 killing of his common law wife Lynn Kalmring, said in court in British Columbia that he only killed her because he feared for his life. On August 11, 2011 - the night that Kalmring died - the two had played a Ninetendo Wii video game after drinking alcohol and eating dinner. Dangerous games: Wiens, left, killed his wife Kalmring, right, after he refused to fulfill the terms of a bet hedged during a Wii game
