Question:
Passage: (CNN)The leaves that go into a cup of Ceylon tea play a surprisingly complex role in the history of Sri Lanka. It started with a single camellia sinesis plant brought from China in 1824 by the British, who had colonized the island then known as Ceylon in 1801. The plant was to be displayed in the Royal Botanical Gardens outside Kandy in the country's lush interior -- but it has since grown into a $1.5 billion export business for the teardrop shaped island nation off India's southern tip. Alongside the agricultural production of tea, which accounts for 2.5% of the country's $60 billion GDP, tea tourism is also emerging as a popular experience for travelers.
