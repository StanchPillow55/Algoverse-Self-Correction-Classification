Question:
Passage: The world is 'adrift' and America is in decline because of the 'extraordinary vacuum of leadership in this country,' New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Saturday. 'People both inside America and outside America no longer know what America stands for,' the outspoken politician told attendees of an Iowa GOP fundraiser, and that's because of 'the lack of leadership we have in the White House.' 'America is not being respected around the world the way we used to be and weâ€™re not being respected because we longer mean what we say and say what we mean,' Christie, a probable 2016 presidential candidate, told a group of roughly 1,000 Republicans at a party for Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad's birthday.
