Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Rutgers men's assistant basketball coach Jimmy Martelli resigned the same day his boss was fired after ESPN broadcast a lengthy video of players being physically and verbally abused, the university told CNN on Thursday. Rutgers gave no reason for Martelli's resignation Wednesday. The outcry over the treatment of the players arose after ESPN on Tuesday showed footage of head coach Mike Rice shoving and berating players. ESPN reported Thursday that Martelli also was involved, in a handful of instances where he shoved players and at least one instance where he called a player "a f**king fa**ot." The network posted a different video on its website that showed Martelli getting physical with players and an interview with Eric Murdock, a former director of player development for the Scarlet Knights, who said Martelli was known as "Baby Rice."
