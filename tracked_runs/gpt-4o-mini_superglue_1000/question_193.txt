Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- Iraq is open for business, and American companies should make an effort to invest there, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday. "President Obama and I and our government believe strongly that expanding economic opportunity is as essential as building democratic institutions," Clinton said while surrounded by executives from companies as far-ranging as Occidental Petroleum, JP Morgan Chase, General Electric, Microsoft and Lockheed Martin, in a round-table discussion aimed at getting companies focused on commercial opportunities in Iraq despite its current "tough environment." The meeting comes as the United States transitions from a military-led to a civilian-led partnership with the Iraqi government by the end of the year. The State Department is leading an inter-agency effort to support American companies in their efforts to secure commercial opportunities in Iraq.
