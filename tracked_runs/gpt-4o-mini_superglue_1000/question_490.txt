Question:
Passage: Broke, on the dole, a failed last ditch High Court appeal to clear his name, facing lengthy jail sentences for sexual assault and plotting his wife's murder, Man Haron Monis walked into the Lindt Cafe on Monday morning a man at the end of the line. Just three days earlier his all consuming desire to clear his name had for all practical reasons come to an end. The 50-year-old, who almost two decades earlier had fled Iran accused of scamming thousands from innocent citizens, faced widespread exposure as a sham Islamic cleric if convicted on more than 50 sex charges.
