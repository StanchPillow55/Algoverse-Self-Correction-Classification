Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The offices of SPARK, a nationwide coalition of girls-only programs, were abuzz Monday as news spread about Augusta National's decision to allow female members for the first time in its 80-year history. "Shock" was a common sentiment, the organization's executive director said, not because the famed Augusta, Georgia, club finally decided to open its doors to another gender, but because they hadn't done so until now. "The girls honestly were pretty surprised that Augusta had been discriminating against women like this," said Dana Edell, referring to the teenagers that comprise much of SPARK's staff. "They are horrified that (the club) could legally and blatantly (exclude women)."

Some online highlight the fact that the club is still overwhelmingly male
@highlight
The head of a "girl-fueled activist movement" says the decision gives girls hope

Query: Still, Edell -- from @placeholder, which bills itself as a "girls-fueled activist movement" -- said she feels more optimistic today about opportunities for her young team members and others girls like them than she did before Augusta National's announcement.
