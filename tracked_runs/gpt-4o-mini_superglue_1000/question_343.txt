Question:
Passage: London (CNN) -- Extremist Islamic cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri and four other men departed England on Friday night destined for the United States, hours after the High Court in London ended a years-long legal battle by ruling the men could be extradited "immediately." Two planes left the British Air Force base Mildenhall with al-Masri, Khaled al-Fawwaz, Adel Abdul Bary, Babar Ahmad and Talha Ahsan so they could face trial in the United States, Home Secretary Theresa May said in a statement. "We have worked tirelessly -- alongside the U.S. authorities, the police and the prison service -- to put plans in place so that tonight these men could be handed over within hours of the court's decision," May said. "It is right that these men, who are all accused of very serious offenses, will finally face justice."
