Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- We've all heard that Paul Ryan is Gov. Mitt Romney's running mate. But many still don't know the details of his proposals for health care reform. They offer a stark contrast to what the Obama administration would like to do. Medicare Medicare is a defined benefit program. That means the federal government decides each year what Medicare will cover. No matter what that costs, the government pays for most of it; individuals are responsible for the rest. Ryan's original plan, passed by the House of Representatives (but not the Senate) last year, would have changed Medicare to a defined contribution program, where the government would instead decide every year what it will pay.
@highlight
Aaron Carroll: Ryan's proposals for Medicare, Medicaid sharply differ from Obama's
@highlight
He says Ryan's Medicare plan could change quality of care, increase cost to seniors
@highlight
He says plan for block grants to states to pay for Medicaid would result in benefit cuts to poor, old
@highlight
Carroll: Obama's approach is different; ideally a compromise would keep best of both plans

Query: Many private plans were unable to come in under traditional @placeholder, and only in certain markets in the country.
