Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Growing up in Lisbon, I was always pleased to tuck into the little fish pates offered as part of the entrees at my local restaurant. Little did I know, that many years later, this Portuguese staple of sardines would become one of the hooks which would lift the Iberian nation out of recession. In the second quarter of this year, Portugal's economy outperformed many other countries in the European Union with growth of 1.1%, thanks in part to its exports, which rose by more than 5%. But the export euphoria was short lived: many knew that behind those chunky fish fillets, Portugal had some economic bones to swallow.

The Portuguese government has been unable to convince creditors to ease its deficit reduction targets
@highlight

@highlight

Query: "The @placeholder are looking for healthy and safe products... a safe process is very important to the Chinese market because they are very aware of contamination problems, of pollution problems" says Ferreira.
