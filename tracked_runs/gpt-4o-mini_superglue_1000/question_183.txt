Question:
Passage: Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has leapt to the defence of Gareth Bale following his side's 2-1 defeat by Valencia on Sunday. With the scores tied at 1-1, Bale broke forward and opted to shoot rather than pass to striker Karim Benzema who had taken up a dangerous position inside the box. That missed chance proved costly as Nicolas Otamendi then powered the ball in from a corner to secure victory for Valencia as Madrid's 22-match winning run came to an end.
