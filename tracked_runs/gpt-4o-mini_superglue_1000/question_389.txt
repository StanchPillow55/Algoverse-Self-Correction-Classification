Question:
Passage: Thirty soldiers until recently stationed in West Africa will be quarantined in Italy when they arrive Wednesday after leaving the Ebola-stricken region this morning, Army officials tell CNN. The soldier will join Army Major General  Darryl A. Williams, commander of U.S. Army Africa, and approximately 10 other personnel who are now in "controlled monitoring" in Italy after returning there from West Africa over the weekend, according to multiple U.S. military officials. The American personnel are effectively under quarantine, but Pentagon officials declined to use that terminology. Williams' plane was met on the ground by Italian authorities "in full CDC gear," the official said, referring to the type of protective equipment worn by U.S. health care workers.
@highlight
30 U.S. soldiers will join a group of approximately 10 in Italy already under quarantine.
@highlight
The Pentagon is using the term "controlled monitoring," which effectively a quarantine.
@highlight
There's no indication that anyone on the team has symptoms of Ebola.
@highlight
It's unclear why they're undergoing this kind of monitoring, which is not Pentagon policy.

Query: The @placeholder has, though, published plans that detail how it will handle troops who are deployed to the region -- including potential quarantines.
