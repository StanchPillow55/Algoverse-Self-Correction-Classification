Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Six years ago Thursday, then-President George W. Bush appeared on television screens across America and somberly addressed the nation. An Iraqi crowd pulls down a statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad in April 2003.

Six years later, the conflict in Iraq drags on -- with war-fatigued Americans shoving the military operation to the deep recesses of their psyches as they grapple with an economic crisis at home.
