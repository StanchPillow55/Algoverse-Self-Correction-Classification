Question:
Passage: By Joshua Gardner PUBLISHED: 12:48 EST, 6 August 2013 | UPDATED: 13:14 EST, 6 August 2013 A set of identical twins who happen to both be American astronauts will soon become subjects of a NASA experiment about the genetic-level effects of living in space. Mark and Scott Kelly are genetically indiscernible from one another and researchers hope to use that biological fluke to their advantage by comparing the brothers’ bodies when one goes to space while the other stays behind on Earth. The study is the first of its kind and will take place as Scott Kelly becomes the first American to spend an entire year living in space.
@highlight
Scott Kelly will become the first American to spend a year in outer space in 2015
@highlight
Retired astronaut and husband to Gabrielle Giffords, Mark Kelly, will remain on Earth as scientists compare their blood and tissue samples

Query: @placeholder’s sample will serve to determine what, if any, genetic changes occur during extended stays outside Earth.
