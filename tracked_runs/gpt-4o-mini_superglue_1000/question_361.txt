Question:
Passage: London, England (CNN) -- A South African has become so fat on her diet of marshmallows that she's been taken to England to lose weight. She's "quite a character," her new caretakers say, but settling her into her new home has proven tricky -- she's an orangutan who has never seen another of her species before. Oshine, the animal, arrived at the Monkey World Ape Rescue Center in southern England last week, the center announced on Twitter. "We have a new arrival, very large & orange!" the center said September 1 -- but kept details close to its chest.
