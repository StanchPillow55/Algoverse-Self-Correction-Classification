Question:
Passage: United Nations (CNN) -- We have all heard about the Arab Spring, the rapid change which swept through the streets of the Middle East and North Africa. In New York in March, there was a brief coincidental Security Council spring. 10 out of 15 nations approved a Security Council resolution endorsing a firm response to a crackdown in Libya. NATO bombing soon followed. I saw and felt a difference. U.N. diplomats and staff expressed confidence and hope that the international organization was finally going to make a difference by being unified and taking dramatic action to help citizens threatened by their own government.
@highlight
The U.N. authorized action in Libya swiftly but Syria has been a different story
@highlight
Russia and China are getting their diplomatic revenge; they feel the Libya resolution was over-interpreted
@highlight
Other nations fear a Syria resolution would help to destabilize a key Middle East country
@highlight
Some countries are imposing their own unilateral sanctions against Syria

Query: He now recommends citizens go around the @placeholder deadlock by using websites to highlight Syrian or other government repression, and encourage more boycotts of products from companies involved with "problem" nations.
