Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- A Ukrainian transport plane was shot down Monday by a rocket that Kiev's government contends appeared to be coming from Russia. The plane was about four miles high over eastern Ukraine's Luhansk region near the Russian border, where the Ukrainian military has been battling pro-Russian separatists, officials said. Crew members of the Antonov-26 made contact with the army, officials said, and the Ukrainian military is trying to bring them into territory it controls. The plane's altitude was too high to be fired upon from the ground with a portable missile system, a statement from Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said.
