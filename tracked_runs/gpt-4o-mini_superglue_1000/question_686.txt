Question:
Passage: By Christopher Wilson PUBLISHED: 20:10 EST, 23 January 2013 | UPDATED: 21:25 EST, 23 January 2013 A drunken brawl with his equerry. A married mistress, secret hotel assignations, an illegitimate child — surely our brand-new hero Prince Harry isn’t up to his old tricks again already? Thankfully not. But details emerged this week of another Prince Harry — the Queen’s uncle, not her grandson — which shed light on the pressures of life as a royal soldier and which demonstrate that, in the House of Windsor, change does not come quickly. Extraordinarily, it’s the sale of a small pair of gilt cufflinks which have brought to light just how our Prince Harry has, by comparison with his namesake, comported himself with rather more decorum than we might previously have given him credit for.
@highlight
Details have emerged this week of a punch-up between royal soldier Prince Henry, the Queen's uncle, and his loyal equerry over a married woman
@highlight
Prince Henry was infatuated by Mrs Beryl Markham, who was rumoured to have given birth to his son

Query: But the demands of trying to be both a royal prince and a soldier — the very thing young Prince @placeholder was trying to explain about his own life this week — had a lot to do with it.
