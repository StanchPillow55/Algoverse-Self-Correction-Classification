Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Chris Hoy became Great Britain's most decorated Olympian of all time after his victory in the men's keirin took his tally to six gold medals. Hoy fought off a late charge from Germany's Maximilian Levy in the final sprint to cross the line first and then confirmed he is "99.9%" certain never to race in the Olympics again. The 36-year-old was roared home by a vociferous crowd in the Velodrome to complete a dream Games for Team GB who won seven of the 10 track cycling gold medals on offer. Earlier in the day Laura Trott added to the gold she won in the women's team pursuit with triumph in the omnium event, but home crowd favorite Victoria Pendleton was beaten to gold by Australian Anna Meares in the individual sprint.
