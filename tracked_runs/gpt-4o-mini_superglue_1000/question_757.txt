Question:
Passage: Amanda Knox is due to find out today whether she faces a retrial for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher. Italian supreme court judges are expected to decide if ‘Foxy Knoxy’ and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele  Sollecito should be retried – or whether their acquittal in 2011 should be confirmed.
