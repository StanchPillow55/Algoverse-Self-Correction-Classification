Question:
Passage: By Rebecca English PUBLISHED: 13:23 EST, 3 December 2013 | UPDATED: 21:04 EST, 3 December 2013 It was, she joked, rather like the blind leading the blind. Still, with a little help from actress Barbara Windsor the Duchess of Cornwall managed to pull off a billion euro charity deal today.
