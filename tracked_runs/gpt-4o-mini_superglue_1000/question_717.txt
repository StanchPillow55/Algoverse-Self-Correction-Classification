Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- After sushi and ramen, Japanese beef is on the list of must-eats for many visitors to Japan. But other than knowing that it tastes great and costs a lot, many tourists turn up with little knowledge of what to expect from Japanese beef. Considered the caviar of beef in Japan, Wagyu (which literally means "Japanese cow") refers to specific breeds of cattle that come from a direct, traceable and pure bloodline. There are four Wagyu breeds: black (accounting for more than 90% of Wagyu beef), brown/red, shorthorn and polled. In recent years, efficient marketing efforts have elevated Wagyu to near-divine status among foodies.
