Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Want to get an iPhone 5 on Friday? You'll probably need to wait in line. Or pay someone to do it for you.

And in San Francisco, a man working through a micro-tasking company (more on what that means in a second) has been diligently waiting in line, for a price, since Monday. "You're going to wait here until Friday? God watch over you," a stranger told that person, who was using a service called TaskRabbit, according to his Twitter feed.
