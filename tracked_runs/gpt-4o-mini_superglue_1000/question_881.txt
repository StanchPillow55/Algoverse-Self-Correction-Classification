Question:
Paragraph:  We were cornered in a sort of way already.  But these butchers up the cavern had been surprised, they were probably scared, and they had no special weapons, only those little hatchets of theirs.  And that way lay escape.  Their sturdy little forms--ever so much shorter and thicker than the mooncalf herds--were scattered up the slope in a way that was eloquent of indecision.  I had the moral advantage of a mad bull in a street.  But for all that, there seemed a tremendous crowd of them.  Very probably there was.  Those Selenites down the cleft had certainly some infernally long spears.  It might be they had other surprises for us.... But, confound it!  if we charged up the cave we should let them up behind us, and if we didn't those little brutes up the cave would probably get reinforced.  Heaven alone knew what tremendous engines of warfare--guns, bombs, terrestrial torpedoes--this unknown world below our feet, this vaster world of which we had only pricked the outer cuticle, might not presently send up to our destruction.  It became clear the only thing to do was to charge!  It became clearer as the legs of a number of fresh Selenites appeared running down the cavern towards us.
