Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Filippo Inzaghi has scored some big goals in his time -- but his next goal may prove the most important and arguably the toughest. One of AC Milan's most revered strikers has been given the opportunity to revitalize the ailing Serie A giant after being handed a two-year deal to become the club's new coach. Inzaghi's joy is his former teammate Clarence Seedorf's misery with the Dutchman dismissed after Milan finished eighth last season, ruling the club out of European football for the first time in 16 years. Inzaghi has long been linked with the job following his impressive work with the club's youth team.
