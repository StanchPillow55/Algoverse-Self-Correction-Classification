Question:
Passage: A survivor of Elliot Rodger's deadly rampage has recounted the heart-wrenching phone call she made to her mother after she lay beside her two dying friends. 'I've been shot,' Bianca de Kock, 20, told her mother Sharrese. 'I don't know what happened. It's crazy. But I love you. I love you so muchâ€¦ I'm afraid I'm going to die.' The 20-year-old student was walking with two of her Tri Delta sisters to their sorority house at the University of California, Santa Barbara on Friday when they were sprayed with bullets. De Kock, whose arm and chest were struck, was the only survivor; her friends, freshman Veronika Weiss, 19, and senior Katie Cooper, 22, both died in the attack.
