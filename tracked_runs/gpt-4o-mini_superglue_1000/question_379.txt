Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- Watching President Obama react to what he called his "shellacking" in the midterm elections had me remembering then-President Bill Clinton back on November 9, 1994 -- the day after he and his fellow Democrats lost control of the House and the Senate. I was then CNN's Senior White House correspondent and I vividly remember attending Clinton's news conference. Like Obama this week, he was humble in defeat. None of us knew what to expect from Clinton on that day 16 years ago, but he came out and was direct -- he said that he took responsibility for the political disaster.
