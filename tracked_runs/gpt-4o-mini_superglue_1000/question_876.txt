Question:
Passage: Fernando Alonso has accused the Italian media of attempting to destabilise Ferrari following the latest rumours linking him with a move away from the team. Earlier this week it was reported Alonso and Sebastian Vettel would swap teams for next season, despite the former having another two years remaining on his contract, whilst the latter has an additional year with Red Bull. Alonso is clearly becoming exasperated at the need to constantly fend off questions on the subject of whether he will leave Ferrari, more so than the team's lack of results as he is now without a win for 27 races, a statistic that often fuels the rumours regarding a potential departure.
