Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Jose Mourinho revealed that he will take time to learn about Real Madrid before deciding to make any major changes, as he was unveiled as the Spanish club's new coach on Monday. The 47-year-old has signed a four-year contract just two weeks after leading Inter Milan to success in the European Champions League final, sealing an unprecedented treble for the Italian club in his second season at the San Siro. Real paid a reported $10 million compensation to Inter to secure his services after ending Chilean coach Manuel Pellegrini's only season in charge, which ended without a trophy despite a massive spending spree on the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka.
