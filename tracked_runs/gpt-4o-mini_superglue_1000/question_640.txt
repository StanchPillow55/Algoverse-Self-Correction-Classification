Question:
Passage: As career moves go, they don’t come any more extreme than swapping Barnsley for Panathinaikos. From Yorkshire grit to Ancient Greece. Sitting in his seaside apartment in the upmarket Athens suburb of Glyfada, Luke Steele has had time to reflect on the dramatic switch that took him to the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium in the summer after six years at Oakwell. ‘It’s the biggest change I’ve had in my life,’ says the former Manchester United and England Under 21 goalkeeper ‘There’s all the culture surrounding the place — and I live by the sea, so it’s drastically different from the streets of Yorkshire. People ask how I’ve adapted but it’s not like I’ve gone to Mars.
