Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- It would be easy to criticize the burgeoning science of astrobiology as an intellectual endeavor best left to more profligate times. The search for extraterrestrial life and expeditions to hunt for life in Earth's extremes -- from the bottom of the oceans and Antarctica's extremes -- seem like luxuries for excitable explorers and space scientists. The enthusiasm about alien life isn't new; the ancient Greeks wondered whether there were other habitable worlds. But it is only recently that the search for extraterrestrial life has been underpinned by experiments -- telescopes to search for Earth-like planets orbiting distant stars, rovers, like NASA's Curiosity, to hunt for life on Mars.
