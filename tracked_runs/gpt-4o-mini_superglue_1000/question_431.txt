Question:
Passage: Prince Andrew is expected to hold crisis talks with the Queen today as he returned to Britain after a luxury holiday amid the growing furore over claims he had sex with an under-age girl. The Duke of York last night appeared in public for the first time since he was accused of abusing the girl ‘procured’ for him by his close friend and convicted paedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. The prince – who looked sombre as he left his luxury £22,000-a-week Swiss ski chalet yesterday – is today expected to meet with his most senior aides and lawyers in his mansion close to Windsor Castle.
