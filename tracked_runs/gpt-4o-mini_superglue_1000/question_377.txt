Question:
Passage: In Steven Gerrard’s dreams, Wednesday night ends with him celebrating like it is 2009. Liverpool blow Real Madrid away, their stuttering season catches fire and more memories are created to last a lifetime. His nightmares, however, involve an embarrassment, of Liverpool finding themselves on the receiving end of a scoreline similar to the 4-0 drubbing they administered to Real, when these teams last collided five years ago. The first scenario, he believes, is possible, particularly if Brendan Rodgers’ side are swept along on a wave of emotion. If Liverpool use the energy that a highly-charged Anfield crowd will give them, Gerrard hopes they can swarm all over Los Blancos.
@highlight
Liverpool beat Real Madrid 4-0 in 2009 at Anfield in the Champions League

Query: I can’t give away tactics but with due respect to the team in 2009 individually @placeholder have improved so we have huge respect for their current team.
