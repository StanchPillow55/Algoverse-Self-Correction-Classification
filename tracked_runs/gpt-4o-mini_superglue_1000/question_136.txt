Question:
Passage: Prince Harry was far from upset about being demoted to fifth-in-line to the throne by the new arrival, saying the news was 'great'. The prince was on typically cheeky form as he welcomed competitors, even joking that he can't wait to see his brother 'suffer more'. Questions about the royal baby didn't prevent him from giving competitors the welcome they deserved however, with Harry even performing a traditional Maori 'hongi' greeting as he met the Ngati Ranana Maori Dancers during a New Zealand Invictus Team reception at New Zealand House in London.
