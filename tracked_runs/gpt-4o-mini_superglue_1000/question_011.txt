Question:
Passage: By Damien Gayle PUBLISHED: 07:24 EST, 15 November 2012 | UPDATED: 10:52 EST, 15 November 2012 The European Space Agency's Sun-watching Proba-2 satellite has sent back incredible footage of three partial solar eclipses as seen from Earth's orbit. During a total solar eclipse, like the one seen from Australia on Tuesday night, the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, its alignment such that it appears large enough to block out the Sun's rays. Since Proba-2 orbits Earth about 14.5 times per day, it can dip in and out of the Moon’s shadow around the time of a solar eclipse.
@highlight
The ESA's Proba-2 satellite dipped in and out of the Moon's shadow three times during Monday night's eclipse
@highlight
It captured images in ultra-violet, revealing stormy active regions on the Sun’s face, including sunspots and solar flares

Query: The Proba-2 satellite: The Sun-watching satellite only saw partial eclipses as the @placeholder was never completely covered up from its vantage point in the Earth's orbit
