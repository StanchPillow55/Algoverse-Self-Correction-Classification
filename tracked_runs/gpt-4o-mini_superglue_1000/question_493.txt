Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- A 20-year-old man waiting in line for a ride at Disney's California Adventure Park fell 25 to 30 feet Wednesday night, Anaheim police spokesman Sgt. Rick Martinez said Thursday. The man was in the building housing the queue for the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, when he put his leg over the railing and fell, Martinez said. "The guest was standing in line with friends on a second-floor platform when he climbed over a barrier to the area below and lost his balance and fell approximately 25 feet," Disneyland spokeswoman Suzi Brown said in a statement. Paramedics on site treated the man, Martinez said. A dispatcher for Metro Cities Fire Authority, which serves seven Orange County cities, said the man was brought to University of California Irvine Medical Center.
