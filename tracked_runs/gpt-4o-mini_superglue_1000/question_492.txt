Question:
Passage: By James Rush PUBLISHED: 11:32 EST, 17 January 2014 | UPDATED: 13:35 EST, 17 January 2014 A divorced couple who stole almost £500,000 from their severely brain-damaged daughter's £2.6million compensation fund have been jailed. A judge said Cathy Watson, 44, betrayed the trust between a mother and a daughter 'in the most appalling and distressing way' as she sentenced her to five-and-a-half years in prison. Watson's ex-husband, Robert Hills, 50, was jailed for three years and four months after Judge Jacqueline Davies outlined how the pair spent huge amounts of cash on top-of-the-range cars, jewellery and even cosmetic surgery.
