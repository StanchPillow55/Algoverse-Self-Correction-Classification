Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The gruesome images are clear. There's little doubt Syrians suffered a chemical attack last month. But videos of the aftermath -- including 13 shown to Congress -- do nothing to show who was responsible. President Barack Obama says he has "high confidence" that the regime is to blame -- the strongest position short of confirmation. But his administration has not released hard evidence. Secretary of State John Kerry says declassifying any more information could endanger "sources and methods" of U.S. intelligence gathering. Britain, France and NATO also blame Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for the horror in a Damascus suburb last month.
