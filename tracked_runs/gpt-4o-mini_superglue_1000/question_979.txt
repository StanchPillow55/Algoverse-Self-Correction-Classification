Question:
Passage: Apple CEO Tim Cook has come out as gay for the first time, declaring his sexual orientation is one of the 'greatest gifts God has given me'. Mr Cook, 53, said he had been open with many people about his sexuality for years but wanted to maintain a level of privacy in the public sphere. However, in a first-person article for BloombergBusinessweek, he said he hopes coming out will inspire people to insist on their right to equality - and that is 'worth the trade-off with my own privacy'. The declaration makes Mr Cook the highest-profile business CEO to have come out as being gay.
