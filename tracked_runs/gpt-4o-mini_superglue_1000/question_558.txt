Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- With her signature Friday on Senate Bill 1070, Gov. Jan Brewer launched Arizona into a maelstrom of national controversy, community conflict and extreme fiscal risk. In doing so, she failed a basic test of courageous leadership -- recognizing and acting responsibly when political symbolism and populist pandering crosses into dangerous policy. The governor should have known better, if only because recent history demonstrates the folly in enacting measures like Arizona's SB 1070. SB 1070 will be subject to multiple legal challenges, and the state will devote precious resources to defend a law that has so many serious constitutional flaws that it will likely never be implemented. The neighboring state of California faced this circumstance 15 years ago when Gov. Pete Wilson championed Proposition 187, enacted by voters in November 1994.
@highlight
New immigration law follows in footsteps of California's Prop. 187, says Thomas Saenz
@highlight
He says California found that its attempt to control immigration was pre-empted by federal law
@highlight
Saenz says Arizona will have to expend resources to administer and flawed legislation

Query: Nonetheless, @placeholder will experience extreme and dire consequences, just as California experienced a decade-and-a-half ago.
