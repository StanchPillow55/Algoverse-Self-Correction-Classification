Question:
Paragraph: Should places at the same distance from the equator have the same climate? You might think they should. Unfor- tunately, you would not be correct to think this. Climate types vary due to other factors besides distance from the equator. So what are these factors? How can they have such a large impact on local climates? For one thing, these factors are big. You may wonder, are they as big as a car. Think bigger. Are they bigger than a house? Think bigger. Are they bigger than a football stadium? You are still not close. We are talking about mountains and oceans. They are big features and big factors. Oceans and mountains play a huge role in climates around the world. You can see this in Figure above . Only one of those factors is latitude, or distance from the equator. 

Question: Name at least one factor of climate

Answer: Distance from the equator
