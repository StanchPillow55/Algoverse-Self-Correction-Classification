Question:
Passage: The Nintendo Wii U has seen its star dim somewhat since its launch in November 2012. Worldwide sales numbers for the console have been disappointing and some gamers have complained that the number of desirable games for the system hasn't grown quickly enough. However, the man who brought to life Nintendo legends like Mario, Link and Donkey Kong is preaching patience with the console, saying the Wii U, with its touchscreen controller that augments big-screen play, is so different that it will take time for people to understand its real value. Shigeru Miyamoto is Nintendo's most successful video game designer, creating some of the world's most popular franchises with "Donkey Kong," "Super Mario Bros.," "The Legend of Zelda" and "Pikmin" before eventually turning his attention to the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS.
