Question:
Passage: Louis van Gaal's wife may have spent her birthday watching Manchester United, but she was treated to some belated celebrations on Monday afternoon. The Dutch manager dedicated Sunday's 4-0 victory over Queens Park Rangers to his other half, Truus, claiming that three points at Old Trafford was the best present she could ask for. But the 63-year-old ensured his partner had more to smile about than just footballing matters, by taking her for a long lunch at Piccolino restaurant in Hale, just outside Manchester.
