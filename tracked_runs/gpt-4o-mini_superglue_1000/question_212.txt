Question:
Passage: Had the Queen been watching Italy’s defeat to Costa Rica she would have been unimpressed by Mario Balotelli. Before the game, knowing that an Italy win would boost England’s slim chances of advancing from Group D, Balotelli tweeted: ‘If we beat Costa Rica I want a kiss, obviously on the cheek, from the UK Queen.' The former Manchester City forward led the Italian line brilliantly in their 2-1 win over England on Saturday in Manaus, but he was abject against Costa Rica, fluffing two decent chances in the first half and offering little after the break.
