Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The woman charged in a deadly day care fire that killed four small children is expected to be back in Texas within the next 24 hours, a U.S. Congresswoman said Monday. Jessica Tata, who has dual citizenship in the U.S. and Nigeria, fled to Lagos shortly after the fatal fire at her Houston home in February. She arrived in Atlanta early Monday morning and was booked into Fulton County Jail, officials said in a statement. Tata also made an appearance in magistrate court, where she waived her extradition rights. According to U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, arrangements are being made for her transport back to Texas. However, Lee did not know exactly when Tata would arrive in Houston or how she would be traveling.
