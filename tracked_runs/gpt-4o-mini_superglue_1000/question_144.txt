Question:
Passage: New Orleans (CNN) -- Suddenly, after years of the National Football League advancing toward the end zone of equality in its hiring practices, diversity has been smacked for a sack and a fumble. Let's get the brutal numbers out of the way, and then I'll move to the contradiction to everything I just said, which is the brilliant career of Ozzie Newsome. I mean, among the recent vacancies in the NFL, where 70% of the players are black, there were eight openings for head coaches and seven for general managers. None were filled by minorities. Zero. Zilch. How strange, because this is a 93-year-old league whose most impressive guy at running a franchise these days is darker than Vince Lombardi of the past and Bill Belichick of the present.
@highlight

@highlight
Newsome has been the Ravens' general manager since 2002
@highlight
Under Newsome, the Ravens have reached the playoffs seven times

Query: "Whether you're a player or a scout or anybody else in the @placeholder organization, Ozzie wants you to be you, and he lets you be you."
