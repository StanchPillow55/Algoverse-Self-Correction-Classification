Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- University of North Carolina whistle-blower Mary Willingham did not just review numbers on a spreadsheet, she emphasized to CNN, but worked with the "overwhelming majority" of the athletes she analyzed in a study about literacy -- one that was summarily dismissed by university officials the same day. Her findings, that 8% of a sample of UNC students playing the money-making college sports of football and basketball were reading below a 3rd grade level, were met with scathing criticism by the university during a faculty council meeting Friday afternoon. In the meeting, Provost James Dean said the university's initial analysis of Willingham's research determined that she made a "range of serious mistakes" in how she arrived at the reading levels of the athletes she assessed.
@highlight

@highlight
Willingham was shocked by the number of UNC athletes who struggled to read
@highlight
She stands by her data
@highlight
University releases own data

Query: @placeholder, again, disputes that expert opinion, and says all but four of those athletes are in, left in or graduated in good academic standing.
