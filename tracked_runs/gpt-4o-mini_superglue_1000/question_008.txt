Question:
Context: Bail (Canada) -- Bail in Canada refers to the release (or detention) of a person charged with a criminal offence prior to being tried in court or sentenced. A person may be released by a peace officer or by the courts. A release on bail by the courts is officially known as a judicial interim release. There are also a number of ways to compel a person's appearance in court without the need for an arrest and release. The Canadian constitution guarantees the right not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause. Unlike some other jurisdictions, for example the United States and the Philippines, there are no bondsmen or bail insurance policies in Canada.
