Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- To many outsiders, cricket can seem like a pedestrian pursuit. But the tragic death of Australian batsman Phil Hughes has prompted the "gentlemen's game" to ask itself serious and searching questions about safety. The 25-year-old was struck on the head by a ball from fast bowler Sean Abbott during a state match in Sydney and died on Thursday from his injuries. Tributes have flooded in for Hughes but the cricket family has also shown acute concern for Abbott, who, at just 22, has been shattered by his inadvertent role in a former teammate's death. And a pair of former England fast bowlers are united in the hope that Abbott, who recently made his debut for Australia in the limited overs format, can eventually rebuild his career.
