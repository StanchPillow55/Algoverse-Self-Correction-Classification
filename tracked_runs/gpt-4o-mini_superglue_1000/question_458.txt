Except Richard Pope, Paul Gunter and Simon Odoni didn’t owe their flashy lifestyles to luck. They owed them to an elaborate scam which fleeced 2,300 people out of £85million.

'Arrogant': Paul Gunter, seen aboard Richard Pope's boat No Slack, had built up a portfolio of 26 homes using money stolen from thousands of victims
