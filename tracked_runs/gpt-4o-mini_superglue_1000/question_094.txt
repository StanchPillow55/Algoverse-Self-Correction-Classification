Question:
Passage: London (CNN) -- All eyes in show business will turn to London on Sunday, as the stars of films from Steven Spielberg's political drama "Lincoln" to the Bond extravaganza "Skyfall" gather for the British Academy Film Awards ceremony. The Baftas, as the awards are known, are seen as one of the indicators for success in the Oscars. "Lincoln" leads the field with 10 Bafta nominations, while Tom Hooper's film version of the long-running stage musical "Les Miserables" and Ang Lee's "Life of Pi" each have nine nods. All three are in the running for best film in the British movie awards, along with "Argo," (seven nominations) a thriller set during the Iran hostage crisis, and "Zero Dark Thirty," (five nods) directed by Katheryn Bigelow -- the only woman to win a best director Oscar -- about the hunt for Osama bin Laden.
