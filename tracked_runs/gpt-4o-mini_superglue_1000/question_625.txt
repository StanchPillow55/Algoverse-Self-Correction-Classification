Question:
Passage: WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Washington souvenirs worth $100,000 -- including images of the Capitol dome and printings of the U.S. Constitution -- are locked in storage, blocked from sale in the new U.S. Capitol Visitors Center because the items are made in China. Political-themed souvenirs such as this Obama bobblehead doll are for sale across Washington. Rep. Bob Brady, D-Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Administration Committee, said he warned operators of the visitors center not to purchase merchandise made outside the United States, but they did it anyway. Although the center has the goods in hand, Brady said, "I'm not allowing them to sell those products."
