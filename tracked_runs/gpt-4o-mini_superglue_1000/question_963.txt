Question:
Passage: Not even Mike Brown could find a way through, nor could Marland Yarde or Danny Care. Harlequins simply could not unlock the door. It was a ruthless lock-out – another triumph for the Wolf-pack. Saracens’ fabled defence left their London rivals without a point in front of their own supporters at The Twickenham Stoop last Friday night, while accumulating 39 of their own in a stunning Aviva Premiership mis-match. It was the latest herculean feat founded on Paul Gustard’s succinct instructions to the players, as they prepare to go into ‘monster’ mode. ‘”Go get ‘em”; that’s the message,’ he said. ‘”Go get ‘em; be aggressive”. People are confrontational in attack, so to counter that we have to be confrontational in defence. Rugby is a physical game of chess – you are fighting for space and territory. The task for a defence is to take space away from an attack, put them under pressure then hopefully you get turn-overs.
