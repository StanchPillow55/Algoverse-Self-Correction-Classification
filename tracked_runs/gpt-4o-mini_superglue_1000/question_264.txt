Passage: By Daily Mail Reporter She's a self-confessed 'daddy's girl', and Victoria McClure is willing to do anything for her father - even pull together a wedding in just two weeks. Joey McClure, has waged a 12-year war on gastrointestinal cancer, but his most recent prognosis was not good. Victoria's fiance, Kevin Stixrud, proposed on Christmas Eve last year, and the pair were quick to set a date for December this year. However doctors treating her dad said she wouldn't wait that long, so the wedding was brought forward to February 14 - Valentines Day.
