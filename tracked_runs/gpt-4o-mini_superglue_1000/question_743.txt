Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Seven suspected pirates were in the custody of Yemeni authorities early Friday, after they were picked up in the pirate-plagued Gulf of Aden. International warships are now patrolling a vast area off the horn of Africa. The Royal Danish Navy said one of its warships, the HDMS Absalon, rescued the seven men Wednesday after they were found in a powerless skiff with rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47s aboard, navy spokesman Jesper Lynge told CNN. They were found approximately 75 nautical miles (140 kilometers) off the coast of Yemen after a distress call, Lynge said. A reporter on board the HDMS Absalon, Rasmus Tantholt, who works for Denmark's TV2, did not dispute the Danish navy's account.
