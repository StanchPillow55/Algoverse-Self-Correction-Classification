Question:
Paragraph: Dylan and Jez are two orphans who meet in their twenties and vow to achieve their shared childhood dream of living in a stately home .  In pursuit of this dream they spend their days living in a disused gas holder , spending as little money as possible and conning the upper classes out of their riches .  During one of their biggest cons , their lives are touched by Georgie , who needs money to save the Down's syndrome foundation that her brother attends .  When a con goes wrong , the two find themselves in gaol to be released only after their entire fortune is rendered useless because of a recall of 50 notes .  It is down to an elaborate plan involving Dylan , Jez and Georgie , to break them out of gaol in order to save their dream .  The film , in essence , is part Ealing comedy , part underdog farce with a sequence of madcap adventures set against a striking soundtrack by contemporary Britpop artists .  Unlike straight rom-coms or mainstream comedies of the period Shooting Fish contained a generous blending of fact and fantasy . 

Question: Why were they conning the rich and living in a disused gas holder?

Answer: Live in stable upper class
