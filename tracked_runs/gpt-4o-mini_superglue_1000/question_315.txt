Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- The United States might replace its ambassador to Libya after WikiLeaks published his colorful cables to Washington about the eccentricities of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, complicating relations with the notoriously sensitive regime. Ambassador Gene Cretz, a career diplomat named to the post in 2008, is back in Washington for consultations with the State Department. A senior U.S. official, speaking on background because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue, said, "One of the issues that we are evaluating is his ability to serve our interests as ambassador in light of what's happened." The cables refer to Gadhafi as "mercurial and eccentric" and describe a "voluptuous" blonde Ukrainian as his nurse and companion.
