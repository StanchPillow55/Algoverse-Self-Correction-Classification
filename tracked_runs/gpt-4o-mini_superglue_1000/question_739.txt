Question:
Paragraph: The film is set in Igloolik in the Eastern Arctic wilderness at the dawn of the first millennium .  http://atanarjuat.com/legend/legend_film.php The wind is blowing over a bleak snowy landscape while a man tries to herd away some marauding dogs .  We hear the voice of an old man singing a childish song .  Inside a stone house a strange shaman by the name of Tungajuaq , who comes from up north , is singing playfully to the gathered community and camp leader Kumaglak .  But among the spectators there are some mistrustful faces .  Flash forward to another day .  Qulitalik is bidding goodbye to his sister Panikpak , wife of Kumaglak , promising to come if she calls for help in her heart .  She gives him her husband's rabbit's foot for spiritual power .  Qulitalik tells his sister , `` Tulimaq is the one they 'll go after now . ''  It seems that Qulitalik is leaving to escape a threat , and the hope is that one day he will return to help .  As Panikpak watches him leave , we hear a voice-over from a woman : `` We never knew what he was or why it happened .  Evil came to us like Death .  It just happened and we had to live with it . ''  Flash back to the original scene in the stone house .  The visitor and the camp leader Kumaglak are in a `` friendly '' spiritual duel involving binding in leather thongs .  But Panikpak is startled when the stone lamp in front of her breaks in half , and , to the horror of those present , Kumaglak falls over dead .  The visitor removes the leader's walrus-tooth necklace from Kumaglak's body , and , passing by Tulimaq , he puts the necklace around the neck of Sauri , the son of the murdered leader Kumaglak , saying , `` Be careful what you wish for '' .
