Question:
Passage: White sand beaches, azure waters, minimal crowds and authentic local cultural experiences - a wish list for many when it comes to the perfect holiday and also, remarkably, just some of the features of the least popular destinations in the world. While France, US, Spain, China and Italy make up the top five most visited nations on the planet with tourist arrivals in the tens of millions some of the most incredible landscapes in the world were largely avoided by international tourists in the past year. For some places, such as Palau in the Western Pacific and Niue in the South Pacific, geography is a major barrier to them being a place appreciated by millions rather than the few thousand who make the effort to grace their shores. For others, the reasons aren't so clear.
@highlight
The Pacific Ocean nation of Kiribati, five hours south of Hawaii, was the least visited destination in 2013
@highlight
The United Nations World Tourism Organisation's 2014 report tallied the number of international arrivals
@highlight
Caribbean nations Dominica, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Anguilla, Montserrat and Kiribati are included
@highlight
Also on the wrong end of the visitors list are Pacific Islands countries of Palau, Niue and East Timor
@highlight
The tiny nations Liechtenstein and Moldova flew the not-so popular flag for Europe

Query: @placeholder is densely populated but the Grenadines, a series of 31 islands, are most certainly not - tranquil and beautiful with white sand and the bluest of blue water, and easily accessible via new ferries.
