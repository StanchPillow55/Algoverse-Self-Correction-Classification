Question:
Passage: A Muslim terror leader whom the United States released from the Guantanamo Bay military prison camp in 2006 has sent at least 2,500 jihadis from Saudi Arabia and some from Yemen to join the self-proclaimed 'Islamic State' army in Syria and Iraq, according to a highly placed Pentagon source. That's more than twice the number of jihadi soldiers killed in U.S.-led coalition airstrikes over ISIS-held territory in Syria and Iraq. Ibrahim al-Rubaish, now the spiritual leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), was captured by American troops in 2001 and spent five years at 'Gitmo' before the George W. Bush administration released him into Saudi custody.
@highlight
Ibrahim al-Rubaish is considered the chief spiritual leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)
@highlight
Al-Rubaish went from Gitmo to a Saudi 'rehabilitation' program, and later escaped and rejoined al-Qaeda in Yemen
@highlight
Said in 2013: 'It is my duty to spur the Muslims to kill the Americans'
@highlight
Now he has recruited at least 2,500 Saudi Muslims and some Yemenis to join ISIS in Iraq and Syria, according to highly placed Pentagon sources
@highlight
US-led allied airstrikes have killed more than 1,100 ISIS fighters, less than half of the number al-Rubaish has dispatched to the battlefield on his own
@highlight
Some of the men Rubaish sent to Syria brought young sons with them,  Defense Department sources said, where they are schooled in jihad

Query: 'That's been true of all the prisoners that were released from @placeholder,' Obama said.
