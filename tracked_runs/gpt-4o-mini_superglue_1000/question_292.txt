Question:
Passage: By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 15:41 EST, 8 August 2013 | UPDATED: 17:38 EST, 8 August 2013 The list of San Diego Mayor Bob Filner's sexual harassment victims just keeps getting longer and lewder. Not only did he inappropriately interact with a mayoral staffer, campaign volunteer and constituent - it seems the mayor targeted female veterans who had been raped while in the military. At least eight female military veterans are among the total 13 women who have come forward to claim that the San Diego mayor sexually harassed them, from hitting on them to groping. Two of the veterans, Eldonna Fernandez and Gerri Tindley, shared their stories of the predatory Filner with CNN Wednesday.
