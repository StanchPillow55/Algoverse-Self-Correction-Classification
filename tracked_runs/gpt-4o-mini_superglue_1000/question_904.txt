Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- "I was surrounded by cameramen, all on their knees like proposing Victorian swains, shooting upwards to make my skirt look even shorter. I had no idea this was going to happen -- this was publicity that I certainly had not planned." Model Jean Shrimpton. On a sultry spring day in 1965, silence descended on the packed crowd gathered at Australia's biggest sporting event. All eyes were on British supermodel Jean Shrimpton as she arrived at the prestigious Melbourne Cup Carnival -- or more accurately, all attention was focused on the 22-year-old's legs. "The most beautiful girl in the world" had stepped out at Flemington Racecourse wearing a minidress five inches above her knees, with no hat, stockings or gloves.
