Question:
Passage: (Mashable) -- Yesterday, Tweetie 2 for iPhone disappeared from the App Store. Its replacement, simply titled Twitter, is now available. This comes a little more than a month after Twitter acquired Tweetie from its creator, Loren Brichter. In addition to being free, the app now carries the distinction of being "version 3.0." If you were expecting a big update and iPad support alongside the new name, brace yourselves; Tweetie -- er -- Twitter has remained relatively unchanged from its prior release. That's not a bad thing; as we reported in our original reviews of Tweetie 2 and Tweetie 2.1, Tweetie is one of the best Twitter experiences for any platform and, in our opinion, was the winning app on the iPhone by a wide margin.
