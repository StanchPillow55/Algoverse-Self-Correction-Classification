Question:
Passage: TOKYO, Japan (CNN) --  Police found three men dead in a car parked outside a spa Monday morning -- the latest in a string of suicides involving detergent, officials said. According to local media reports, more than 60 people have committed suicide across Japan in the last month by mixing detergent and other chemicals, and inhaling the hydrogen sulfide gas that results. A passerby discovered the bodies of the three men in Tamioka, north of Tokyo, police said. In western Japan, police found a 21-year-old man with a plastic bag over his head Monday. A police officer in Suma, where the body was found, said authorities found detergent containers by the foot of the man. They suspect the man may have inhaled the toxic gas after mixing them in the bag.
