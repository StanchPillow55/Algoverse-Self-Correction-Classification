Question:
Passage: Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul sent a strong signal Tuesday to 2016-watchers that Benghazi isn't dead as a presidential campaign issue, slamming former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for failing to prevent the 2012 terror attack in the Libyan port city that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other American personnel. 'We have to defend ourselves,' he told a conservative audience at a summit hosted by Heritage Action for America. 'We also have to defend our diplomatic missions around the world.' 'I put a lot of blame at the feet of Hillary Clinton for not defending the embassy – or the consulate – in Benghazi. I think she did a terrible job. And I think that it's inexcusable, basically, when you're asked for security that you not provide it.'
