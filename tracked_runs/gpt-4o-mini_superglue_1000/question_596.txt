Question:
Passage: Owen Farrell is happy to concede centre stage to George Ford when the former school friends start their first England match together in Saturday's QBE International against Samoa. Ford, the Aviva Premiership's form fly-half, has been told 'you're the boss, so get bossing' by Stuart Lancaster as the head coach seeks to address the lack of tried and tested depth in the position. As Lancaster's first-choice 10 for most of his reign, Farrell has become accustomed to the role of team general and the vocal 23-year-old is at ease with the responsibility of giving orders. George Ford (left) and Owen Farrell are in good spirits during England's captain's run at Twickenham
