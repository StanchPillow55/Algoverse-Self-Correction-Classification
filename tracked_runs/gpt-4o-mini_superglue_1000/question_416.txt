Question:
Passage: By Associated Press Reporter Incredible pictures show the dramatic moment rescuers met a deputy sheriff off who spent 45-minutes bravely battling choppy seas to keep a teenage surfer's head above water and pulled the two to safety. Deputy Terry Brown kept the 14-year-old boy identified only as Joshua afloat off Southern Oregon's coast after he got caught in a rip current on Monday and the two are now recovering from hypothermia at Sutter Coast Hospital.
