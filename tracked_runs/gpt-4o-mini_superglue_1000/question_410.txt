Question:
Passage: The fourth alleged victim of a Republican businessman told the court today that he hit then raped her twice after taking her to his remote cabin. Gregory Nathan Peterson, 37, faces multiple charges of rape, kidnap and sexual abuse of women he lured on dates. The 34-year-old woman was the final witness at Peterson's two-day preliminary hearing in Salt Lake City, Utah to decide whether there is enough evidence for him to stand trial. It was also revealed that she had met with the third alleged victim, who testified yesterday. The women found out that Peterson had made them both watch TV show Big Love - an HBO series about a polygamist with three wives.
