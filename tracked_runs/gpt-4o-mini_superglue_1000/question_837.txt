THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Fridays are acceptable! Just doesn't have the same ring, especially on the most awesome day of the week! Well, I'm Carl Azuz. I welcome you to CNN Student News; we're kicking things off right now! First Up: Health Care AZUZ: First up, follow the bouncing health care bill: It's in the House, then the Senate, then the House again. It's hard to keep up with. But another health care reform bill -- the set of changes to the legislation that's already law -- moved move from the Senate back to the House yesterday. Now the House, as you might remember, had dealt with this legislation before. But because the Senate made adjustments to it, the House had to pass the new version. Well, it did last night, and it will become law when President Obama signs it. It'll cost more than $60 billion in addition to the $875 billion health reform law. Democratic leaders had put these changes on the fast track. Part of the reason for the quick turnaround is recess. Congress is scheduled to start its two-week Easter break today.
