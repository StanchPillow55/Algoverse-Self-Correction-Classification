Question:
Passage: By Catherine Townsend PUBLISHED: 16:46 EST, 15 April 2013 | UPDATED: 16:46 EST, 15 April 2013 On Homeschoolers Anonymous, former students of homeschooling families have begun blogging about childhood experiences they claim have left them traumatized and unprepared for adult life. The Daily Beast reports that Kierstyn King (formerly Kierstyn Paulino) used to write entries with titles like 'The Case for Christians in Government'. Now 22, on her 18th birthday King 'escaped' from her fundamentalist family in Georgia. These days, she has trouble walking into a church without having a panic attack. She blames her at-home education, which she claims 'contributed to the amount of hurt I and many others who grew up in this radical/evangelical/conservative/christian subculture endured and continue to endure.'
