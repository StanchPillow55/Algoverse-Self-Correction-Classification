Question:
Passage: The accusations against the Revlon CEO are ugly -- but that doesn't mean Twitter can't pretty them up with some humor. According to the New York Post, the cosmetics company's CEO, Lorenzo Delpani, is being sued by a former company scientist, Alan Meyers, who is alleging discrimination. Meyers says in the suit that the Italian-born Delpani expressed disdain for such groups as Jews, blacks and Americans as a whole. According to the suit, Delpani said he could "smell a black person when he entered a room," noted that "Jews stick together" and said Americans were "small-minded" and "dirty." A Revlon representative told the Post that the suit was a product of an unhappy ex-employee. Meyers was let go because he "repeatedly demonstrated critical lapses in judgment and failed to perform at the high standard we demand of our employees," she said.
