Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Sprinter Shawn Crawford might have been coming to the latter part of his athletics career, but his failure to inform doping regulators as to his "whereabouts" has landed the Olympic gold medalist with a two-year ban. The American, who sprinted to 200 meter gold at the Athens 2004 Games, has been sanctioned after failing to provide the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) with a location for drug testing three times during the past 18 months. The "whereabouts" rule requires athletes in advance to tell regulators where they are for one hour every day and make themselves available at that time for a drug's test.
