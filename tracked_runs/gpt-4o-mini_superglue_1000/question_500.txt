Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- It's logical -- especially when it has the support of Capt. Kirk and Mr. Spock. Residents of Earth and other planets have until Monday to weigh in on new names for two of Pluto's moons, by voting on a website set up by the SETI Institute. Based on those votes, the Northern California scientific research organization will then propose names to the International Astronomical Union, which makes the final call. And the runaway top pick, as of Friday evening, is Vulcan. Roman mythology aficionados may see that as a tribute to the god of fire. But for others -- most notably, for legions of Star Trek fans -- it is better known as the home planet of Spock, the ever rational, ever loyal member of the starship Enterprise.
