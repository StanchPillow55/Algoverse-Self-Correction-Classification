Question:
Passage: Funny, isn’t it, how trends come around again. I started at Marks & Spencer in the early Seventies, when bell-bottom flares and denims filled the racks. Now, in 2015, they’re back in fashion. What I’m more surprised about is seeing a Seventies throw-back in our politics. Labour’s attack this week on a major British business smacked of the destructive anti-business mood that went out of political fashion decades ago. Stefano Pessina — the boss of Boots the chemist — voiced his fears about the implications of a Labour government. Scroll down for video Stuart Rose (left), who left M&S in 2010 after saving the company, has branded Ed Miliband (right) a '1970s throwback' following comments which he says 'smack of anti-business mood'
