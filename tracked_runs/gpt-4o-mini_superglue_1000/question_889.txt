Passage: LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- President Obama mixed jokes with serious discussion Thursday during an appearance on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno." President Obama chats it up with Jay Leno on "The Tonight Show" on Thursday. While presidential candidates have used comedy shows for campaigning as far back as Richard Nixon's performance on "Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In" in 1968, Obama became the first sitting president to appear before a late-night talk show studio audience. Obama complimented guitarist Kevin Eubanks on his suit, and he cracked jokes about the Secret Service and "American Idol" host Simon Cowell.
