Question:
Passage: Scene of The Beatles' last ever live concert in 1966 as well as home field for both the Giants and 49ers, San Francisco's Candlestick Park is closing later this month after more than half a century. The cold and windy workhorse stadium has over the years been host to a wide range of memorial events, from countless sporting triumphs to a mass for 70,000 people held by Pope John Paul II in 1987. But the 'Stick' was also a fierce place, where whipping winds and fog from San Francisco Bay often made for chilly conditions for fans and players. After more than a half century of hosting sporting and cultural events, including the Beatles final concert on Aug. 29, 1966, Candlestick Park in San Francisco is officially closing later this month
