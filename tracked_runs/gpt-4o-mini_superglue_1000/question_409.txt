Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- Mitt Romney seemed to channel his inner CEO on Thursday when he sketched out a chart on entitlements on a whiteboard. There he stood, hair slicked down, white shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbows, listing differences between his and President Barack Obama's Medicare plans. If the scene seemed better suited to a corporate boardroom than the campaign trail, it is because the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is far more comfortable throwing out ideas than with having them challenged, experts say. "It speaks to some of the issues he's been having," said Trevor Parry-Giles, a political communication professor at the University of Maryland. "There are a number of ways in which businesses operate that are not analogous to the campaign context."
