Question:
Passage: These images show the disturbing moment that a murdered police officer pleaded for his life before being executed by masked gunmen who launched a deadly terrorist attack on an anti-Islamist newspaper in France. A video from the scene of yesterday's massacre shows officer Ahmed Merabet - believed to be a Muslim - lying wounded on the pavement and begging for mercy before being shot at point-blank range by the terrorists. As they approach, the 42-year-old is seen raising his hand in appeal for mercy, before the gunman asks: 'Do you want to kill us?' The policeman then answers: 'No, it's OK chief.' They then shoot him through the head with the assault rifle.
