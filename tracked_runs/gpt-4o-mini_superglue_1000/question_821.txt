Passage: By Bianca London A mother, who wanted to create an extravagant cake for her daughter's fourth birthday, went all out - by baking a four foot tall Peppa Pig cake. Devoted Maria Young spent four days creating the 133,000-calorie treat to look like piglet George. She got builder husband Wayne to make a wooden frame and then covered it in sponge, icing and Rice Krispies. It's life size!
