Question:
Passage: Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libya's interim leadership gave residents in Bani Walid a 48-hour notice to leave the city as it sent reinforcements there and to the former regime's other remaining strongholds of Sirte and Sabha. As the National Transitional Council sought to assert control over all of Libya, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, Jeffrey Feltman, arrived Wednesday in Tripoli on an unannounced visit. Feltman met with NTC head Mustafa Abdel Jalil and Mahmoud Jibril, chairman and head of international affairs of the NTC, as well as with many civil society representatives. "I am encouraged by these individuals and these organizations' efforts," Feltman said.
