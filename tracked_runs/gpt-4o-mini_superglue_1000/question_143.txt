Question:
Passage: Lionel Messi has once again cast doubt on his Barcelona future by telling the world he does not know where he will play next season. The Argentina superstar had shot down suggestions he would join a club in the Barclays Premier League after Barcelona’s 3-1 win over Atletico Madrid on Sunday. However, the 27-year-old fuelled talk of a move to Chelsea after naming Blues boss Jose Mourinho as his third choice for the prestigious FIFA Coach of the Year.
