Passage: Julie Neville, wife of footballer Phil Neville (right), revealed her husband has never mopped or used a Hoover after he made his first coffee in December Phil Neville has failed to tackle a single piece of housework during his 15-year marriage, his wife revealed yesterday. The football pundit, who has just made his first cup of coffee at the age of 37, has no idea where the ironing board is kept and would not know how to turn on an oven. ‘All his talent is in his toes, that’s for certain,’ a remarkably sanguine Julie Neville said.
