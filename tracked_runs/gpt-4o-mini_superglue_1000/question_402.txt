Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The biggest challenge was finding an Edward. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart play Edward and Bella in "Twilight." "The most perfect guy in the world," "Twilight" director Catherine Hardwicke said, ticking off the characteristics of "Twilight's" vampire hero. "Cannot be Leo [DiCaprio]; cannot be Brad Pitt. They don't fit in high school anymore. And there are a lot of cute guys, but do they really look like they've lived for 108 years?" Probably not, but with a fan base as large as "Twilight's," Hardwicke had to search for one. And if the thousands of screaming girls who show up at autograph signings are any measure, she found him in Robert Pattinson.
