Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Whatever the outcome of the Trayvon Martin case, it will be viewed less as a determination of the shooter's guilt or innocence and more as a victory or loss for civil rights, George Zimmerman's lawyer fears. Mark O'Mara said he has been busy trying to dispel the racial overtones in the case by getting out more evidence about his client. His hope, he said, is that people will divorce a verdict from the real civil rights questions. The civil rights issue "The more people that consider an acquittal of George Zimmerman to be a loss for civil rights, the worse for civil rights," he told CNN's Piers Morgan.
