Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Brazil is waiting to welcome the world for the biggest football tournament on the planet -- but has it taken its eye off the greatest show on earth -- the Olympics? The South American nation was shamed Tuesday after International Olympic Vice President John Coates claimed Rio de Janeiro's preparations for the 2016 Games was the "worst" he had ever witnessed. Coates, who has been involved in the Olympics for nearly 40 years, has made six trips to Rio as part of the commission involved in ensuring the Brazilian city is ready to host the Games. And while the World Cup, which starts on June 12 may take priority, Brazil's ability to juggle two huge events has been called into question.
