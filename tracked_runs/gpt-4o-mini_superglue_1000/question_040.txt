Question:
Passage: Gareth Bale looked fresh enough to go out and do it all again. This is how it must feel to be high on the euphoria of an unstoppable rise to the top of the world. It had just gone midnight in the concrete underbelly of the Stadium of Light and his eyes sparkled as Bale tried to explain the emotion of scoring the goal Real Madrid have waited 12 years to score. ‘When you’re a little boy you dream of lifting the Champions League trophy and to lift the 10th one for Real Madrid is special,’ said Bale, pausing en route to the carefully choreographed celebrations waiting in the Spanish capital.
