Question:
Passage: LONDON, England (CNN) -- Jenni Hunt is an attractive, talented and ambitious professional from Portland, Oregon. She runs her own Internet business, selling on online auction site eBay and advising others how to navigate the site to gain maximum profits. Carrie Stevens says working online means she can spend more time with her daughter Amie. Jenni, 36, is also a full-time mother who home-schools her kids. Superwoman? Perhaps. But Jenni is one of an increasing number of stay-at-home moms who are using the Internet to have it all. Jenni was a high-tech Silicon Valley marketing executive when, in 1999, she gave up work to look after her baby boy. She had her second child in 2002, and it was then that she discovered eBay.
