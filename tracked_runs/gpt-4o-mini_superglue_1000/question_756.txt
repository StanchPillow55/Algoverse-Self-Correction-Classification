Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Donald Trump's decision to let Miss California USA Carrie Prejean keep her title convinced Shanna Moakler to quit as head of the pageant's California organization. Shanna Moakler talks with HLN's Mike Galanos about why she resigned as director of Miss California USA. Moakler, a former Miss USA, said she could not stay with Trump's Miss Universe organization "when I no longer believe in it." As the Miss California USA co-executive director, Moakler did not hide her displeasure with Prejean during the controversy over her same-sex marriage comments and the emergence of semi-nude photos. Moakler spoke exclusively with Mike Galanos, host of HLN's Prime News, about why she resigned.
