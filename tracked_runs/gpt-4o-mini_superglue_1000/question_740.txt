Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- As Afghan President Hamid Karzai's calculated and risky backtracking on the U.S.-Afghan security agreement puts him on a collision course with most Afghans, the United States needs to demonstrate patience, take the Afghan public's side and be tactful at a sensitive time in a highly volatile part of the world. Observers describe Karzai's actions as erratic, arrogant or impulsive. Others suggest that he be ignored or bypassed. To some, he seems to be displaying signs of exhaustion and irrationality. These views miscast Karzai's motives and miss the point of his tactical political maneuvering. He is engaging in canny clan-style brinksmanship.
@highlight
Omar Samad: Most Afghans upset at Karzai's balking at deal to let some troops stay on
@highlight
Samad: Karzai jockeying to protect his political, financial interests after his term ends
@highlight
He says Afghans worry about security but also want to keep the gains of the past 12 years
@highlight
Samad: Afghans will deal with Karzai; U.S. must be patient and promote democratic reforms

Query: Whether these last resort overtures will open any doors to a just and peaceful settlement or help his side with the upcoming elections has yet to be determined, but at least he will be able to make a case that he did not toe the @placeholder line.
