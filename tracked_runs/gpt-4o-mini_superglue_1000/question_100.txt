Question:
Passage: By Chris Wheeler PUBLISHED: 16:57 EST, 30 January 2014 | UPDATED: 01:08 EST, 31 January 2014 Manchester City are in talks over a £35million deal to sign Porto centre back Eliaquim Mangala and his team-mate Fernando. They may struggle to pull off the double transfer before Friday’s 11pm deadline  but City are determined to seal the deals no later than this summer. They have been encouraged by a significant shift in Porto’s position over the last 48 hours after the cash-strapped  Portuguese club indicated they are willing to reduce the asking price if it means having the money in the bank now.
