Question:
Passage: Israeli drink maker SodaStream International Ltd. will relocate a factory next year that activists criticized for being in an Israeli settlement in the West Bank, a representative said Wednesday. Nirit Hurwitz said that the decision to move the facility to Lehavim in Israel's southern Negev region is for 'purely commercial' reasons and is not connected to pressure from Palestinian activists who had boycotted the company because of its location. Activists launched a campaign boycotting the company because of the factory being in an Israeli settlement in the West Bank, a territory captured by Israel in 1967 that's claimed by the Palestinians.
