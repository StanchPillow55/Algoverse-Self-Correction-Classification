Question:
Passage: A new report, backed by London mayor Boris Johnson, may make it easier for Australians to work and travel within the UK. The report, penned by Commonwealth Exchange's Tim Hewish, urges the British government to rethink their immigration laws when it comes to Australia and New Zealand, by creating a 'bilateral mobility zone' between the countries. The report encourages a system similar to Australia's Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement (TTTA) with New Zealand, which allows free movement between both countries.
