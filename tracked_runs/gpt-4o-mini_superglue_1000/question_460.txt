Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- Politics is full of second chances. Former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford -- now U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford -- is living proof. Former Rep. Anthony Weiner is trying to travel the same road to political redemption. And now add former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer to the list, as he embarks on a similar journey. In this age of lighting fast news cycles and fleeting memories, are disgraced politicians sitting in the penalty box for a shorter time before launching a comeback? A Republican political strategist thinks it reflects a lower opinion of politicians. "The required waiting time has been greatly condensed in recent years, indicating present voters are holding elected officials to a much lower standard then previous generations," said John Brabender, a longtime top political adviser to 2012 Republican presidential candidate and former Sen. Rick Santorum.
