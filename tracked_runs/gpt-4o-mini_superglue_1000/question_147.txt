Question:
Passage: It is a hammer blow for Fulham fans. Felix Magath has declared that he wouldn’t sign Brazilian superstar Neymar, even if he had the chance to get him for free. Despite the club playing Championship football next season, Magath sees no role at Craven Cottage for one of the best players in the world. The Fulham manager appeared on Germany’s major TV channel ZDF after Argentina’s victory over Switzerland, to give his own expert view on the World Cup. Talking to former Bayern Munich star Hasan Salihamidaic, the German coach said that he didn’t like players like Neymar. VIDEO scroll down to watch Thomas Muller leading Germany's training
