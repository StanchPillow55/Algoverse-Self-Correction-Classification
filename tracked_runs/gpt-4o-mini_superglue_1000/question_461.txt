Passage: Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A top Taliban political leader delivered a message Friday to President Obama, calling his attempt to lure away Taliban fighters with money "an old weapon that has failed already."

"This war will come to an end when all invaders leave our country and an Islamic government based on the aspirations of our people is formed in the country."
