Question:
Passage: Well this is awkward. The Prime Minister makes a lot of his special relationship with Barack Obama - but it seems the President who calls him 'bro' doesn't feel the same way. Mr Obama is following the wrong David Cameron on Twitter - a computer game-lover from Oregon who tweets about Back to the Future and Star Trek. While @DavidCameron enjoys the attention of the U.S. premier, British counterpart @David_Cameron has been left high and dry by the most powerful man in the world. Scroll down for video One-way relationship: David Cameron faithfully follows his U.S. counterpart on Twitter - but Barack Obama has not returned the favour, despite following 645,000 people. Instead he follows an Oregon movie fan
