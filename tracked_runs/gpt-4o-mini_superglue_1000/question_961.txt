Question:
Passage: Earth appears as an insignificant-looking pale blue dot below Saturn's majestic rings in a breathtaking new image from the Cassini spacecraft. The picture was captured on July 19 by the probe's wide-angle camera from a distance of 900 million miles. Magnifying the image five times reveals not only the Earth but also the moon, a fainter smudge to the right of the planet. The images were taken by the Cassini spacecraft, which has been orbiting the ringed giant since its arrival in the Saturn system in 2004, and astronomer Carolyn Porco, who oversees the Cassini imaging team at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado said: 'The whole event underscores for me our 'coming of age' as planetary explorers.'
@highlight
Photos taken from Saturn by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft show Earth as a tiny pale blue dot
@highlight
The images have been transmitted from 898 million miles away on the outer edge of our solar system

Query: The @placeholder has only been pictured in images from outer space on two other occasions.
