Question:
Passage: Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- How well Zsa Zsa Gabor is recovering from hip replacement surgery a week ago depends on whom you ask: her husband or her daughter. Prince Frederic Von Anhalt said his wife of 24 years is in "critical" condition, but daughter Francesca Hilton said her condition is "guarded." Gabor, 93, suffered a broken hip in a fall at her Bel Air, California, home nine days ago. "It's up and down," Von Anhalt said Monday afternoon. "It worries me very much." The publicist for Hilton, however, gave a more optimistic report. Edward Lozzi said the glamour icon was able to sit up in bed and talk, an improvement that followed a blood transfusion and the removal of her morphine drip over the weekend.
