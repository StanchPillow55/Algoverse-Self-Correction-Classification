Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- After an eventful 12-plus months that began with him being named Time's Person of the Year and ended with his blistering critique of the Vatican bureaucracy, Pope Francis got a chance to celebrate on Wednesday -- by presiding over Christmas Eve Mass at St. Peter's Basilica. The Mass, typically one of the biggest events on the Roman Catholic calendar, was attended by 8,000 people inside the Basilica while another 3,000 followed along on screens set up in St. Peter's Square. This year, a drone outside and various 3-D cameras inside recorded the Mass. Pope Francis personally requested a performance of Mozart's Mass in C minor for the service, according to a Vatican spokesman.
