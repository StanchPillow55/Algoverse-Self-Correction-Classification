Question:
Passage: Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is likely to blame  his 'role model' dead brother at trial to avoid the death penalty. When Tsarnaev's case begins, his lawyers are likely to pin their hopes - and the bombings themselves - on his older brother, Tamerlan: a Golden Gloves boxer, college student, husband and father who also followed radical Islam was named by a friend as a participant in a grisly 2011 triple slaying. 'He was the eldest one and he, in many ways, was the role model for his sisters and his brother,' said Elmirza Khozhugov, the former husband of Tamerlan's sister, Ailina.
