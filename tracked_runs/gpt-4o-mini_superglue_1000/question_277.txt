Question:
Passage: (CNN)  -- What's a July Fourth celebration without fireworks? Many cities across the United States will find out Saturday. Milwaukee holds its lakefront show on July 3, so as not to compete with surrounding communities. As municipalities grope for ways to shore up budgets, expensive pyrotechnics displays are becoming the latest victims of the economic downturn. "They need to have things in the community like that to keep things going. So I'm sad to see it going," said Seth Stolz, of Flint, Michigan, which will go without its traditional July Fourth explosions in the sky this year, according to CNN affiliate WJRT. He was accustomed to watching the show from his home.
