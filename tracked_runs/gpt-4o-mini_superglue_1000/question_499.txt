Question:
Passage: Zintan, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan rebels said Monday they remain in control of a key western town they seized from Moammar Gadhafi forces Saturday, although clashes continued just east of it. The Libyan government said earlier its forces had retaken Bir al-Ghanam but Jumma Ibrahim, a rebel spokesman in the western mountain region, said the claims were false. Rebel commander Nasser abu al Qassem told CNN Monday that the rebels are holding firm on the town's eastern outskirts, squaring off against loyalists just a few miles away at a key road junction the rebels hope to take in the days ahead.
