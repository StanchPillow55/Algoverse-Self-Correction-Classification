Passage: Click HERE to view the stats from the frenetic game using our fantastic match zone service The works of Mozart might reduce a man to tears; Sergio Aguero, likewise. It was the Tottenham manager Maurico Pochettino who made the comparison between the two men in the run up to this match, attempting to convey something of the Argentine’s special talent. Perhaps he might wish to temper his praise in future, for Aguero played like a man inspired by the compliment. He was sublime and Pochettino, if not quite weeping by the end, would at least have been overwhelmed with emotion: frustration, mainly.
@highlight
Sergio Aguero opened the scoring after 13 minutes before Christian Eriksen equalised almost immediately
@highlight
The Argentine striker converted then first penalty of the afternoon shortly after but missed another in the first-half
@highlight
Roberto Soldado had a chance to make it 2-2 but missed his spot-kick
@highlight
Aguero made no mistake with the FOURTH of the day, converting his hat-trick in the process
@highlight
Federico Fazio was sent off for tugging Aguero back before the penalty, and he later scored his fourth goal

Query: And yet Pochettino’s despair was legitimate given that @placeholder played well, were the victim of some poor decisions, and had the opportunity to bring the the game back to 2-2 on 61 minutes when Roberto Soldado missed a penalty.
