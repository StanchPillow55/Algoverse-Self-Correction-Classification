George Mitchell said Thursday it is critical that Major League Baseball restore the integrity of the game. Former Sen. George Mitchell gives his report Thursday on steroid use in baseball. "This is a serious problem that cannot be solved by anything less than a well-conceived, well-executed and cooperative effort by everyone involved in baseball," Mitchell said in announcing his findings. "Everyone involved in baseball over the past two decades -- commissioners, club officials, the Players Association, the players -- shares, to some extent, in the responsibility for the steroid era," he said.
