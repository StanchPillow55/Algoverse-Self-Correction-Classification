Question:
Passage: Morocco have appealed against sanctions levied by the African Football Confederation following the decision to withdraw from hosting this year's African Nations Cup. The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FMRF) announced in November that it would not be going ahead with the tournament which started in January due to fears over the ongoing ebola outbreak in West Africa. Equatorial Guinea eventually stepped in as replacement hosts but CAF came down hard on the Moroccan governing body, banning its national side from the next two editions of the competition and imposing fines and compensation orders totalling almost Â£7million. Ivory Coast defeated Ghana in the final to win the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea
