Question:
Passage: By James Nye PUBLISHED: 10:30 EST, 14 January 2013 | UPDATED: 10:30 EST, 14 January 2013 The complex trial of a married man who is accused of strangling his mistress and the 15-month-old child they had together is due to begin this week. Authorities in St. Petersburg, Florida allege that former Air Force Sergeant Ralph 'Ron' Wright Jr. killed Paula O'Conner and son Alijah in July 2007 after she tried to sue him for their child's medical bills that would expose his infidelity. Expected to last three weeks and take in more 70 witnesses, the trial hinges on DNA evidence disputed by the defense and centered around a glove found at the scene of the murders that the prosecution say proves Wright, 44, is the culprit.
