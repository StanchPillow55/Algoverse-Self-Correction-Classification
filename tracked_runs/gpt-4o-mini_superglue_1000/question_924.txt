Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- World champion Marc Marquez clinched his 11th victory of the season Sunday after returning to winning ways at the British MotoGP at Silverstone. The 21-year-old has had a stunning season so far, clinching 10 pole positions and winning all but one of twelve races. His only blip was a fourth-place finish in the last MotoGP in the Czech Republic. But the Spanish Honda rider didn't have it all his own way at Silverstone and enjoyed a pulsating fight with two-time world champion Jorge Lorenzo, whose Yamaha teammate Valentino Rossi was third. "Honestly Jorge was much stronger than I expected," Marquez said after extending his championship lead to 89 points over Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa, who was fourth.
