Question:
Passage: Thousands of Australians scored illegal drugs from a website run like eBay, where they could check out reviews on dope, meth, ecstasy and cocaine and order their highs through the post at a quarter of the street price. A 30-year-old Texan man named Ross Ulbricht is alleged by the FBI to have created the website and to have run it from a Bondi apartment in Sydney for the first six months, but he has plead not guilty to the charges against him. Lawyer turned journalist Eileen Ormsby, from Melbourne, began investigating online drug supermarket Silk Road in 2011 after a woman she met at a party told her how easy it was to buy drugs from it.
