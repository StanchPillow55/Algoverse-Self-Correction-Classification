Question:
Passage: Ed Miliband yesterday promised to increase the education budget every year – and echoed Tony Blair’s landmark 1997 election pledge to keep primary class sizes to a maximum of 30. Mr Miliband told an audience at his old secondary school that if he wins office in May, spending on education will benefit from a ‘real terms’ increase every year of the next Parliament. He accused David Cameron of planning to inflict ‘big cuts in spending’ which would ‘short change our children’s future’ if he is elected for a second term. Labour leader Ed Miliband promised to create thousands of new school places in England to cap class sizes for five, six and seven year olds
