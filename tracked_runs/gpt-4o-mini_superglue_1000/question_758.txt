Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- At the age of 12, Stephen Wolfram was reading college physics textbooks and toying around with a computer roughly "the size of a large desk. With 8K of 18-bit words of core memory. And programmed with paper tape." By the age of 20, he had gotten his Ph.D. and was on his way to inventing his own computational system. But last year, at the age of 50, Wolfram launched what may be his most ambitious effort -- Wolfram|Alpha, a knowledge engine that answers users' questions on the Web by computing answers in real time with the help of a vast collection of databases.
