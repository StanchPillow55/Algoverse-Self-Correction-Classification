Question:
Passage: Where there’s 'Smoke' there’s OJ. The 66-year-old disgraced gridiron great has hired himself a fellow felon - Willie Hartwell, aka Smoke - to protect him in prison. OJ has been worried about attacks from aggressive inmates at the Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada, where he has been incarcerated since 2008. He fears there are prisoners who want to make a name for themselves by hurting 'The Juice,' especially on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the brutal murders of his ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman. 'He found the biggest guy who is in great shape and willing to fend off the bullies to help OJ out -- but, of course, it comes at a price,' a close friend revealed.
