Question:
Passage: Former NBA star Dennis Rodman apologized Thursday for his much-criticized outburst about an American citizen imprisoned in North Korea, saying he was stressed out and had been drinking when he made the remarks on CNN. The family of that imprisoned American, Kenneth Bae, said Thursday that they accepted Rodman's apology for his "outrageous" remarks but said they hope his comments "have not further endangered" Bae. The eccentric basketball veteran is in North Korea for a controversial visit that has been rife with bizarre moments, including Rodman's rendition of "Happy Birthday" to the country's leader Kim Jong Un at a packed sports stadium on Wednesday.
