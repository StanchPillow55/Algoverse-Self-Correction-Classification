Question:
Passage: Sometimes, coming on as a late substitute in an international football match can be difficult. And that proved the case for England midfielder Ross Barkley, who got a telling off from Roy Hodgson just seconds after entering the field of play. 'Keep it tight' will have been the message from the England manager, as Barkley came on to tighten the midfield in the latter stages of the match. With the score at 3-1, Barkley received the ball but was unable to keep hold of it, losing possession in Scotland's favour. Roy Hodgson was furious when Ross Barkley gave the ball away just seconds after coming on
