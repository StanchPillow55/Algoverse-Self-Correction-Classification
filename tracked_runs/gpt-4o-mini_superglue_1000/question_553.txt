Question:
Passage: (CNN)NBA star Chris Paul has been called for many technical fouls through the years. His latest is drawing perhaps the most notice, and his criticism of the female referee who called it has drawn a $25,000 fine from the league. The conversation around the technical has centered on what Paul said about rookie referee Lauren Holtkamp, one of two female officials in the NBA. The NBA said Paul was being fined for "public criticism of officiating." The league's statement announcing the fine didn't mention the official's gender. Paul said her call during a Los Angeles Clippers loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers was "ridiculous" and "terrible."
@highlight
Chris Paul said a rookie referee made a bad call, so working in the NBA "might not be for her."
@highlight
Critics called him sexist while supporters said he was just complaining about what he thought was a bad call
@highlight
Paul has been fined once before -- $15,000 in 2011

Query: And she gave me a tech," the @placeholder point guard told reporters after the game Thursday.
