Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Who can ever forget the electrifying series of presidential debates in which Lyndon B. Johnson, outlining his Great Society program, went head-to-head in 1964 with Republican nominee Barry Goldwater, who boldly stood his ground on rock-solid, small-government ideals? Or the 1968 debates that America couldn't take its eyes off: Richard Nixon, trying once again to make it to the White House, toe to toe with Vice President Hubert Humphrey in what was shaping up to be a close election with starkly different platforms. The 1972 presidential debates, of course -- Nixon, who was by then the incumbent, trading verbal body slams with his Democratic challenger, George McGovern, against the backdrop of the Vietnam war -- were like a professional wrestling grudge match, with each excited camp of viewers at home pulling for its man to triumph.
@highlight
Bob Greene: After Nixon vs. Kennedy in 1960, there were no presidential debates until 1976
@highlight
He says Nixon's sweaty showing in '60 helped put candidates off TV debates
@highlight
In subsequent campaigns, neither LBJ nor Nixon debated their rivals
@highlight
Greene: Now debates are nearly mandatory, much as candidates might like to avoid them

Query: And in 1972, when @placeholder was the incumbent and far ahead in the polls, he barely deigned to say McGovern's name during the fall campaign, much less debate him.
