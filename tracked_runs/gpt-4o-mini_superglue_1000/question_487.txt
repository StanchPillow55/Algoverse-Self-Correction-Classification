Question:
Passage: By Amanda Williams Supermarket chain Aldi is in a battle with environmental campaigners after trying to tear down a 200-year-old tree. Workers at the Ecology Building Society (EBS) have been fighting to save the 98 ft high tree, which is due to be felled by the low cost food chain as they try and build a new store in Silsden, West Yorkshire. Contractors have already started to cut branches from the tree using chainsaws, as EBS staff stood under the tree in protest. The society has half of the lime tree’s branches on their grounds.
