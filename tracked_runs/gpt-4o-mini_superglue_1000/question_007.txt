Question:
Passage: (Wired) -- 2011 was supposed to be the year of the tablet. After the 2010 launch of the iPad demonstrated there was a lucrative market for consumer-class slates, all the key consumer electronics manufacturers strapped Android to their would-be iPad killers, hoping to catch up to Apple's massive lead. But Android tablets aren't selling. iPads still claim over 60% of global market share, according to IDC research. As technology web site AllThingsD claimed, "Consumers don't want tablets, they want iPads." And, indeed, comparably priced Android competitors haven't stood up to Apple's two tablets. Now there's a new approach: Aim low. In September, Amazon wowed us with the unveiling of its Kindle Fire tablet, the first low-priced, high-quality consumer-class tablet to look like a formidable competitor to iPad.
