Question:
Passage: By Lydia Warren PUBLISHED: 15:20 EST, 22 October 2012 | UPDATED: 15:23 EST, 22 October 2012 Yet more doubts have been raised over the authenticity of 'reality television' show Breaking Amish after one character revealed she has been divorced, which is rarely allowed in the Amish community. Cast member Rebecca accepts a proposal from Abe on the TLC show, which depicts the two meeting in New York for the 'first time' - yet they are believed to already have a child together in real life. It has now been claimed that, despite the 'revelation' on the show, Rebecca left her first husband, Rufus Hostetler, to start a relationship with Abe in 2010.
