Passage: (CNN) -- Police on the Caribbean island of Nevis said Monday a local man has been arrested and charged in the recent armed robbery of vacationing Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. The suspect, 28-year-old Vedel Browne, turned himself in Sunday after officials declared him "a person of interest," and released his photo to the media, according to Sgt. Cledwyn Jeffers of the Royal St. Christopher and Nevis Police Force. Browne was formally charged with robbery Monday afternoon, said Sgt. Stephen Hector of the police force. Hector said the offense is a felony and carries a maximum sentence of 20 years upon conviction.
