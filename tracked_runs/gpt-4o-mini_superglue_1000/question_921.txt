Question:
Passage: By Sophie Jane Evans and Richard Spillett and Ruth Styles The Duke of Cambridge stepped in to help his over-heating wife today as they cheered on a Welsh swimmer during their visit to the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Prince William, who was joined by his brother Prince Harry, repeatedly fanned Kate using her identity card as they watched Jazz Carlin win the 800m freestyle gold medal at Tollcross Swimming Centre. Donning a blue top, jeans and wedges, the Duchess was pictured pulling a silly face as she was cooled down by her husband and a poolside official. Just minutes earlier, she had made a very public display of affection by clasping the Duke's hand, before laying her hand on his leg.
