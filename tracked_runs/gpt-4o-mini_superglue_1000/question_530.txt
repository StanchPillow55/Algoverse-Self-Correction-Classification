Question:
Passage: The British businessman accused of ordering a hit on his new wife while on honeymoon in South Africa will appear in a Cape Town court on Tuesday. Shrien Dewani was returned to the country Monday by UK officials. He denies murdering Anni Dewani, 28, in November 2010 in Cape Town. He has avoided extradition for the past three years on mental health grounds, but  upon losing his latest appeal, British authorities have agreed to return him to South Africa to stand trial. The extradition request was approved on the proviso that if Dewani was not fit to stand trial in the next 18 months, he will be returned to the United Kingdom.
