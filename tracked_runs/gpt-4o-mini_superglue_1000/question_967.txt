Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Last week, The New York Times gave us an inside look at what it's like to work at Foxconn, the manufacturing company that owns several China-based factories that crank out Apple's iPads, iPhones and iPods by the millions. The story is full of examples of horrifying working conditions in Foxconn's factories that would never fly here in the United States. Here are some of the more troubling ones from the Times story: Foxconn is a 24-hour operation. Employees work six days a week, sometimes in 12-hour shifts. They're on their feet for so long that their legs begin to swell. There are underage workers. They live in crowded dorms on the factory's campus. In recent years, there have been reports of workers leaping from buildings in apparent suicides.
