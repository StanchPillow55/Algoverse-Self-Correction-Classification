Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- A coalition of Iranian reformist groups is urging opponents of the regime to stage non-violent protests on the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution next week. The Council for Coordinating the Reforms Front called Thursday for people to march "with their green colors" in support of the opposition Green Movement on February 11. Such protests represent a show of force for citizens who oppose the government's stiff crackdown on people who demonstrated against the June election victory of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a vote regarded as fraudulent by many. "We will show all of the small-minded people who sit on the thrones as rulers, and label any opposition as tools of foreign enemies, the fate of single-voiced [autocratic] systems and establishments," the council said in a written statement.
