Question:
Passage: The Obama administration went into the first hours of the new enrollment period under the Affordable Care Act with confidence that last year's problems with HealthCare.gov were behind them. "We've spent the last year improving and upgrading HealthCare.gov, to make it faster and easier to use," President Barack Obama said in his weekly address as the enrollment period launched Saturday morning. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said that more than 23,000 people submitted an application in the first eight hours of enrollment and more than 1.2 million unique visitors shopped for coverage on HealthCare.gov last week. There were reports, including from USA Today, of some glitches in the enrollment process. When asked by CNN whether applicants were having any problems with the website, officials declined to comment.
