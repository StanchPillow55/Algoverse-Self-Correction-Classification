Question:
Passage: (CNN)The 2015 Dakar rally suffered tragedy on only its third day of competition when motorbike rider Michal Hernik was found dead. But mystery surrounds how the 39-year-old Pole lost his life. No damage was found to either his body or bike, said race director Etienne Lavigne. Hernik, who was located just a few hundred meters from the race track, had removed his helmet prior to his death. "The circumstances surrounding his death have yet to be determined, as the competitor did not show any external signs of an accident," said a rally statement. Hernik -- who was competing in his first Dakar -- was found at kilometer 206 on the stage between San Juan and Chilecito, in northern Argentina.
