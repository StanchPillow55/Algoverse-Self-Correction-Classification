Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The Pakistani military reported killing 40 militants Thursday near the border with Afghanistan -- the latest in a string of clashes in a frontier region rife with extremism. Pakistani soldiers carry their weapons as they patrol. On the other side of the border, however, security forces have made such gains that a top American commander said Wednesday he does not expect a Taliban offensive in eastern Afghanistan this spring. The flare-up of violence on the Pakistani side of the border, along with the commander's comments in Washington, suggest that the Taliban and its al Qaeda allies may be focusing more on western Pakistan even as violence subsides just across the border in Afghanistan.
