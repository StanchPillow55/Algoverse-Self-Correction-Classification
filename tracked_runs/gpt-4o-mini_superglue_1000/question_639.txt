Question:
Passage: Alan Pardew wants to banish his nearly-man reputation in the FA Cup and lead his Crystal Palace side all the way to Wembley glory. The 53-year-old lost as a player whilst with the Eagles as Manchester United lifted the trophy in 1990 after a replay, and came within seconds of leading West Ham to the famous cup in 2006 only for Steven Gerrard to thrash home a stoppage-time equaliser - with Liverpool going on to win on penalties. Since then Pardew's luck has been in short supply, winning just one FA Cup tie in his near-four-year reign at Newcastle before he left the club to return to Selhurst Park at the start of the year.
