Question:
Passage: By Joshua Gardner and Ap Reporter PUBLISHED: 10:13 EST, 9 December 2013 | UPDATED: 13:13 EST, 9 December 2013 The Washington Redskins helped round out a humiliating year with a stomping from the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday that left stands nearly empty by halftime. Blizzardy conditions drove fans away last night in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, but the faint dusting of snow at FedEx Field left the Skins with no excuse. And most all the footprints in what little snow did fall were on Robert Griffin III's side of the field, proving yet again the once-promising quarterback's team has lost its mojo.
