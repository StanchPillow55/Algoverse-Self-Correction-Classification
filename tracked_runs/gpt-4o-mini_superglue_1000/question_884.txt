Question:
Passage: By Chris Kitching for MailOnline When you’ve been walking around the world for nearly 16 years, you would think your toughest obstacles would be extreme temperatures or complete mental and physical exhaustion. But Karl Bushby’s biggest adversary hasn’t been the elements or his own body – it’s been Russian border officials. The former British paratrooper was denied entry into Russia in 2012 despite previous visits, forcing him to take a detour on an epic quest that may end with a major gap unless he is allowed to return to the transcontinental nation.
