Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The period since September 11, 2001, will never be described by any historian as a golden age of U.S. foreign policy. I know. I have just written a history on it, and it's not pretty. Since 9/11, the United States has swung unsettlingly from one set of flawed policies to another. First, the unilateralist excess of the first term of the Bush administration; its signature error was the invasion of Iraq. Then, the reactive swing of Barack Obama, toward disengagement and dithering. In a tragic irony, a war in Iraq may someday also be seen as the enduring symbol of his errors.
@highlight
David Rothkopf: Both Bush and Obama have overseen unsettled era of post 9/11 foreign policy
@highlight
Obama has made mistakes of judgment, execution, but in final 2 years he can change, he says
@highlight
How? Take page from Bush. He cleaned Cabinet in term 2, admitted errors, he says
@highlight
Rothkopf: Obama must create change from within his administration

Query: Because whatever mistakes Bush made in office -- and they were many -- in his second term, @placeholder recognized the urgent need for change and instituted a sweeping reordering of his administration, its policies and priorities.
