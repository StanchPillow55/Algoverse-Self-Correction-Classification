Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama used the annual White House Iftar dinner Monday evening to briefly discuss the crises unfolding in the Mideast. "Even as we celebrate all that we have in common, we know that in too many corners of the world, we see violence and terror, and those who would destroy rather than build," he said. The White House Iftar dinner was started by former President Bill Clinton. President George W. Bush continued the tradition after the 9-11 terror attacks. President Obama has also continued to host them. The dinner is meant to honor Muslims who are celebrating the end of a day of fasting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
