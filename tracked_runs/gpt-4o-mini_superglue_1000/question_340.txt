Question:
Passage: (EW.com) -- Well ... you can't say "Cougar Town's" cast and producers didn't try. The third season of ABC's comedy returned significantly lower in the ratings. In its new (and much tougher) time period, "Cougar Town" delivered 4.8 million viewers and a 1.8 adults 18-49 rating Tuesday night. This is a series low for the show (The CW's "Ringer" also had some particularly bad news, below). It's arguably unfair to compare "Cougar Town" to its own 3.4 premiere last year (from which it's down 47 percent). The show debuted in the fall on Wednesday nights with a lead-in from top-rated "Modern Family." Whereas last night's time slot in a few short months has been haunted by the short-lived "Man Up" (which premiered to a 2.4 rating) and "Work It" (2.0). "Cougar Town's" 1.8 rating is about average for this slot, but that's not great considering the two shows that mainly generated that number were cancelled. It's lead-in, "Last Man Standing," had 7.6 million viewers and a 2.0 rating.
