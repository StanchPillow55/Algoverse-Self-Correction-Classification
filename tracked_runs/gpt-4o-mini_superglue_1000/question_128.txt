Question:
Passage: Kliptown, South Africa (CNN) -- Brian Munyai has spent nearly all of his 22 years living in a small metal shack that has never had electricity or running water. He shares a pit latrine with his neighbors. He bathes in a bucket with water drawn from the communal tap. At night, he reads by an oil lamp. Conditions like this are typical for the nearly 40,000 people who live in the slums of Kliptown, a district in the largely black township of Soweto, South Africa. Generations of families have lived in these ramshackle homes just 15 miles from Johannesburg, the economic capital of the country.
