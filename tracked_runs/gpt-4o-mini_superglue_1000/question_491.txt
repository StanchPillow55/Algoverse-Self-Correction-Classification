Passage: By Daily Mail Reporter A nine-year-old girl who shaved her head in support of a friend with cancer has been barred from her school for violating its dress code. Kamryn Renfro, from Grand Junction, Colorado, thought she was making a kind gesture by shaving off her hair to support Delaney Clements, 12, who is also bald after undergoing chemotherapy. 'It felt like the right thing to do,' Kamryn told KUSA. Delaney, who suffers from neuroblastoma, said: 'I was really excited that I would have somebody to support me and I wouldn't be alone with people always laughing at me', KREX reported.
