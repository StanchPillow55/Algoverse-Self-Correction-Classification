Question:
Passage: Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced that the Australian government will donate $20 million to help staff a 100-bed Ebola response clinic in Sierra Leone. Mr Abbott said that the government would be contracting an external company to deploy staff to the region. The clinic will be built by the UK and over 200 staff will be needed to run it, comprising mostly of locals. However, Australian volunteers and international medics will also be needed. The mission follows a deal struck between the governments of Australia and the UK and healthcare provider Aspen Medical to manage services in a British military field hospital in Sierra Leone.
