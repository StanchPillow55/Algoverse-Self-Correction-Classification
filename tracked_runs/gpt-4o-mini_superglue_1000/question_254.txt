Question:
Passage: Los Angeles (CNN) -- Although Daniel Day-Lewis appears on track to win the best actor Oscar next month, he suggests his win at the Screen Actors Guild Awards Sunday may actually hurt his chances. "There's a good chance I won't," Day-Lewis said backstage at the SAG Awards. His riveting portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in Steven Spielberg's "Lincoln" has been honored with the Golden Globe and SAG best actor awards. While those awards are often predictive of the Oscar best actor winner, Day-Lewis is downplaying his chances. "I think members of the Academy love surprises, so the worst thing that can happen to you is some kind of expectations," he said. "I think they'd probably be delighted if it was anybody else."
