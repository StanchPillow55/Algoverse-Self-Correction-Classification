Question:
Wayne and Bernadette are movie stars heading to the premiere of their latest film. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city. The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?


Reference Answer:
Bernadette takes 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 minutes to get to the theater.
Her ride takes 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 minutes longer than Wayne’s to get to the theater.
Thus, she should leave 12 + 5 = <<12+5=17>>17 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater 5 minutes sooner than he does.
