Question:
Carver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years less than twice the age of his son.  How old is his son, in years?


Reference Answer:
Let x be the age of Carver's son.
Since Carver's age (45) is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, then 45=(2*x)-5.
Add 5 to each side of the equation and we get 50=2*x.
Thus, the age of Carver's son is x=25 years old.
