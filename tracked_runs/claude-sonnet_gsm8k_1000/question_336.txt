Question ID: 1201

Question:
There are 66 fish in the fish tank. One-third of the fish have red stripes, and 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. Altogether, how many fish have red stripes and blue stripes?


Reference Answer:
One-third of the fish in the fish tank have red stripes, a total of 1/3*66 = <<1/3*66=22>>22 fish
The number of fish in the fish tank with no red stripes is 66-22 =<<66-22=44>>44
5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, a total of 5/11*44 = <<5/11*44=20>>20 fish
Altogether, the number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is 20+22 = <<20+22=42>>42 fish
