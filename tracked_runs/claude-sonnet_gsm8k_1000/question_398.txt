Question:
Ellen is on a diet. She eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs her $6, while the yogurt is half the price. How much does Ellen pay for one carrot every day when in total she pays $11 for her goods?


Reference Answer:
Ellen's yogurt cost is half the price of the salad, so it's $6 / 2 = $<<6/2=3>>3.
For the two carrots Ellen needs to pay $11 - $6 - $3 = $<<11-6-3=2>>2.
So one carrot costs $2 / $2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.
