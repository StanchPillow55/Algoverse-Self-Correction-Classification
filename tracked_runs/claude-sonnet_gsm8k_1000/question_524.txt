Question ID: 591

Question:
Four dogs sat in a line within the veterinarian's waiting room.  The first dog was the Affenpinscher, who weighed only 10 pounds.  Next to him sat a Dachshund, who weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher.  Next to the Dachshund sat a Papillon, who weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.  And at the end of the line sat a Mastiff, who weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon.  How much did the Mastiff weigh, in pounds?


Reference Answer:
The Affenpinscher weighed 10 pounds, and the Dachshund weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, or 2*10=20 pounds.
The Papillon weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, or 20/4=<<20/4=5>>5 pounds.
And the Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon, or 5*44=<<44*5=220>>220 pounds.
