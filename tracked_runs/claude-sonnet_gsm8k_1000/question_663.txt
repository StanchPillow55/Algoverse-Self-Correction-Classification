Question:
Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. If his father also gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, and each marble weighs 2kgs, calculate the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store.


Reference Answer:
After buying twenty marbles from his friend Johanna, Solomon had 20+50 = <<20+50=70>>70 marbles.
Solomon's father gave him 2/5*20 = <<2/5*20=8>>8 more marbles.
Adding Johanna's and Solomon's marbles, he has a total of 8+70 = <<8+70=78>>78 marbles.
If each marble weigh 2 kgs, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in store is 78 * 2 kgs = <<78*2=156>>156 kgs
