Question ID: 203

Question:
Carl’s favorite food is cheese. He ate a sandwich every day this week for lunch and used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it. How many slices of cheese did he use?


Reference Answer:
His 2-slice sandwiches used 2 * 7 = <<2*7=14>>14 slices of cheese for all 7 days of the week.
His cheese and egg omelets used one more slice than his sandwiches, so they used 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 slices of cheese each.
He made 3 omelets, so they used 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 slices of cheese.
Carl’s sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni used 14 + 9 + 8 = <<14+9+8=31>>31 slices of cheese in all.
