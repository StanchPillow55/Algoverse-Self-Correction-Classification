Question ID: 475

Question:
It takes 240 minutes of walking to break in a new pair of shoes. Jason wants to try out for the track team in three weeks. If he can walk 4 days a week to break in the new shoes, how long does he have to spend walking each day?


Reference Answer:
First find how many days Jason has to prepare for the tryouts: 3 weeks * 4 days/week = <<3*4=12>>12 days
Then divide the time it takes to break the shoes in by the time Jason can spend each day to find how long he needs to walk each day: 240 minutes / 12 days = <<240/12=20>>20 minutes/day
