Question:
A pound of almonds costs $10 while a pound of walnuts costs $15. How much more does it cost for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts?


Reference Answer:
One-half pound of almonds cost $10/2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.
One-fifth pound of almonds cost $10/5 = $<<10/5=2>>2.
A one-third pound of walnuts costs $15/3 = $<<15/3=5>>5.
So, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $5 + $5 = $10.
And 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $2 + $5 = $7.
Therefore, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $10 - $7 = $3 more than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.
