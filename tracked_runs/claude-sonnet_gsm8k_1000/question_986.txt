Question:
Bruce works for 5 hours on Tuesday. On Wednesday he works twice the time he works on Tuesday. On Thursday he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. How many hours does Bruce work in all these three days?


Reference Answer:
On Wednesday, Bruce works for 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 hours.
On Thursday, Bruce works for 10 â€“ 2 = <<10-2=8>>8 hours.
On these three days, Bruce works for 5 + 10 + 8 = <<5+10+8=23>>23 hours.
