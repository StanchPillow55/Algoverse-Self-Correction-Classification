Question:
Robert is building a 15 foot long, 10 foot wide, rectangular wooden fence around his garden.  He needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing he builds.  How many wooden slats will he need?


Reference Answer:
A rectangle has 2 long sides and Robert wants them to be 15 feet long so 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30 feet long
A rectangle has 2 short sides and Robert wants them to be 10 feet wide so 2*10= <<2*10=20>>20 feet wide
Together, he will need 30 feet and 20 feet of fencing so 30+20 = <<30+20=50>>50 feet of fencing
He needs 2 wooden slats per 1 foot of fencing and he is building 50 feet of fencing so he needs 50*2 = <<2*50=100>>100 wooden slats
