Question:
Debra is monitoring a beehive to see how many bees come and go in a day. She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours. She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours. Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?


Reference Answer:
Debra first sees 30 bees leave the hive, then sees 1/2 that many return, 30 x 1/2 = <<30*1/2=15>>15 bees that return and 15 bees that are still away from the hive.
Debra sees twice as many bees as first left the hive--which was 30--fly from the hive in the next 6 hours, 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 bees that leave the hive.
In total, 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 bees left the hive.
There were 90 bees total that left the hive - 15 bees that already returned = <<90-15=75>>75 bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.
#### 75
