Question:
Bubbles collects stuffed animals. She has three stuffed puppies, five stuffed koalas, two stuffed zebras and four stuffed frogs. If she wants to buy enough stuffed goats, such that the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of all of her stuffed animals, how many stuffed goats should she buy?


Reference Answer:
Let x = the number of stuffed goats.
The current number of stuffed animals are (puppies + koalas + zebras + frogs) or 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = <<3+5+2+4=14>>14 stuffed animals total.
Take the total stuffed animals, add x and divide by the number of stuffed goats to get to 30% or x / (14 + x) = .3
Cross multiply to get x = 0.42 + .3x
Subtract .3 x from each side, .7x = 0.42
Bubbles needs x = <<6=6>>6 goats added.
