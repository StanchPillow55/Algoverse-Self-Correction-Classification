Question ID: 326

Question:
Some people got on a bus at the terminal. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. Then at the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. If there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop, how many people got on the bus at the terminal?


Reference Answer:
There were 20 - 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 people on the bus before 8 people got in at the second stop.
There were a total of 12 + 7 =<<12+7=19>>19 people at the second stop before 7 people went down.
So, 19 - 5 = <<19-5=14>>14 people got on the bus at the terminal.
#### 14
