Question:
On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.  He caught 4 times that amount on Friday and half the amount of his Friday's catch on Saturday.  If 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, how many servings does he have?


Reference Answer:
He caught 3 pounds on Thursday and caught 4 times the amount on Friday for a total of 3*4 = <<3*4=12>>12 pounds
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of the 12 pounds he caught on Friday so he caught 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pounds
In three days he has caught 3+12+6 = <<3+12+6=21>>21 pounds of crawfish
3 pounds is a serving and he caught 21 pounds so he has 21/3 = <<21/3=7>>7 servings of crawfish
