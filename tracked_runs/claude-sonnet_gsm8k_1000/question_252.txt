Question:
Verna loves to eat fruit. She bought three apples at $1.50 each, five oranges at $0.80 each, and six peaches at $0.75 each.  If she gave $20, how much change did she receive?


Reference Answer:
Three apples cost 3 x $1.50 = $<<3*1.5=4.50>>4.50.
Five oranges cost 5 x $0.80 = $<<5*0.8=4>>4.
Four peaches cost 6 x $0.75 = $<<6*0.75=4.50>>4.50.
Thus, Verna paid a total of $4.50 +$4+ $4.50 = $<<4.5+4+4.5=13>>13.
Therefore, Verna received $20 - $13 = $<<20-13=7>>7.
