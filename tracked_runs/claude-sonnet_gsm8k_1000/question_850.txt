Question ID: 110

Question:
Marcell and Beatrice are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, so they unroll as many as they can find. Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Beatrice's was two roll-ups wide and 24 rolls up long while Marcell's was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. If they both ate their entire amount, how many did they eat on average?


Reference Answer:
Beatrice ate 48 because 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48.
Marcell ate 42 because 14 x 3 = <<14*3=42>>42
In total they ate 90 because 48 + 42 = <<48+42=90>>90
On average they ate 45 because 90 / 2 = <<90/2=45>>45
#### 45
