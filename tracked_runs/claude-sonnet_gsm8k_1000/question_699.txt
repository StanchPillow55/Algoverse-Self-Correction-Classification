Question ID: 45

Question:
Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job. A blog article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and  2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.


Reference Answer:
If she wrote five articles on Monday, then on Tuesday she wrote 2/5* 5 = 2 more articles.
The total number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is 5+2 = <<5+2=7>>7
On Wednesday, the number of articles was twice the number she wrote on Tuesday, so it was 2*7 = <<2*7=14>>14 articles.
Over the three days, she wrote 5+7 +14 = <<5+7+14=26>>26 articles.
If each article takes her 4 hours to research and write about, she spent 4*26 = <<4*26=104>>104 hours on all the articles.
