Question:
Dominick went to his team's changing room and saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs kept there. If there were 20 helmets, calculate the total number of items Dominick saw.


Reference Answer:
If the number of helmets was 20, there were 2 footballs/helmet * 20 helmets = <<20*2=40>>40 footballs
There were half as many robots as helmets, so in total, there were 1 robot/2 helmets * 20 helmets = <<1/2*20=10>>10 robots.
The total number of items in the changing room is 10 robots + 40 footballs + 20 helmets = <<10+40+20=70>>70 items
#### 70
