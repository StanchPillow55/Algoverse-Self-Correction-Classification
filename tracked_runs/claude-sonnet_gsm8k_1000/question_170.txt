Question ID: 608

Question:
Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25. He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?


Reference Answer:
The price of the two clothing items totals 35 + 25 = <<35+25=60>>60 dollars before discount.
The total sale discount comes to 60 * 0.3 = <<60*0.3=18>>18 dollars.
The final sale price comes to 60 - 18 = <<60-18=42>>42 dollars.
Joe ends up with 50 - 42 = <<50-42=8>>8 dollars change.
