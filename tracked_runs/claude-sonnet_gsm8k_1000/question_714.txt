Question ID: 1096

Question:
Billy is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes. He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. If he takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off, and helps people on all the other days. How many people does he help? (Remember there are 31 days in March.)


Reference Answer:
First find the number of days between March 1st and April 19th: 31 days + 19 days = <<31+19=50>>50 days
Then subtract the percentage of time Billy takes off from 100% to find the percentage of time he works: 100% - 20% = 80%
Then multiply that number by 80% to find the number of days Billy works: 50 days * 80% = <<50*80*.01=40>>40 days
Then find how many people Billy can help per day: 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = <<2*3=6>>6 people/day
Then multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works to find the total number of people he helps: 6 people/day * 40 days = <<6*40=240>>240 people
#### 240
