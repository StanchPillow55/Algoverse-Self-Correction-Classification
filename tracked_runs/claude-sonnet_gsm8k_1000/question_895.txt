Question ID: 448

Question:
A salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576. He sold 17 of them for $20 at a flash sale on Monday, and the rest were sold to a department store for $25 each throughout the rest of the week. How much money, in dollars, was the salesman's profit?


Reference Answer:
The salesman made 17 × $20 = $<<17*20=340>>340 at the flash sale on Monday.
There were 48 - 17 = <<48-17=31>>31 sneakers left.
At the department store he made 31 × $25 = $<<31*25=775>>775 throughout the week.
In total he made $340 + $775 = $<<340+775=1115>>1115.
The profit made by the salesman was $1115 - $576 = $<<1115-576=539>>539.
