Question:
Lana is brewing cups of tea for her friends. She has 27 cups, and she divides these into 3 rows. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. She then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. How many cups of mint tea are in each row?


Reference Answer:
If there are 15 cups of cinnamon tea, then there are a total of 27 â€“ 15 = <<27-15=12>>12 cups of chamomile or mint tea.
As there are equal amounts of chamomile tea and mint tea, there is a total of 12 cups / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cups of mint tea.
Dividing these into rows shows that each row holds 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 cups of mint tea.
