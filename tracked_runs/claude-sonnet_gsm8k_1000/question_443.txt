Question:
There are 10000 gallons of water in a pool. Using a water pump, Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. They use water from the tank to water their vegetable garden. If the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day, how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days?


Reference Answer:
The water pump takes 1/2 *10000 = <<5000=5000>>5000 gallons of the pool's water into the tank.
If 500 gallons of water is used daily for six days, the total amount of water used after six days is 500*6 = <<500*6=3000>>3000 gallons.
The total amount of water remaining in the tank will be 5000-3000 = <<5000-3000=2000>>2000 gallons
#### 2000
