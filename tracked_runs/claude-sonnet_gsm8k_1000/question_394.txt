Question:
Aiden is making his famous steakhouse-seasoned meatballs for a neighborhood cookout. He adds two tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef he uses. He gets sixteen meatballs from each pound of meat. If he wants to make 80 meatballs for the cookout, how much of his secret seasoning will he need?


Reference Answer:
To make 80 meatballs, Aiden will need 80 / 16 = <<80/16=5>>5 pounds of meat.
Aiden will need 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs.
