Question:
Bob thinks he needs 56 popsicle sticks to recreate the Washington Monument for his history project.  His favorite popsicles come 8 to a box and cost $2.00 per box.  How much will it cost Bob to build his project?


Reference Answer:
He needs 56 popsicle sticks to build his project and they come 8 to a box so he needs 56/8 = <<56/8=7>>7 boxes
Each box costs $2.00 and he needs 7 boxes so it will cost him 2*7 = $<<2*7=14.00>>14.00
