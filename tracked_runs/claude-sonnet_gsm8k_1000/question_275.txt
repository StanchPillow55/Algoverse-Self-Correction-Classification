Question:
John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.  The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.  He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties?


Reference Answer:
He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties
So he bought 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 red ties
Each red tie cost $40 * .5 = $<<40*.5=20>>20 more than blue ties
So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60
So he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties
So he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties
#### 800
