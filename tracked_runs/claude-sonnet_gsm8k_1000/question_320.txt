Question ID: 130

Question:
Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves in her department store's Santa village. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them, then 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. How many elves are left?


Reference Answer:
First, divide the starting number of elves by 3 to find out how many quit after being vomited on, which is 60 elves / 3 = <<60/3=20>>20 elves.
Then subtract that number from the starting number of elves to find out how many are left: 60 elves - 20 elves = <<60-20=40>>40 elves.
Then subtract the number of elves who quit after being kicked to find the total number who left: 40 elves - 10 elves = <<40-10=30>>30 elves.
