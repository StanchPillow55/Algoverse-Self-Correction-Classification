Question:
Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are trying to catch them all, Pokemon that is.  Together they have caught 339 Pokemon.  Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. How many Pokemon has Stan caught?


Reference Answer:
Let x represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught
Stan: 4x-13
Alex: 5+(4x-13)=4x-8
Total: x+4x-13+4x-8=339
9x-21=339
9x=360
x=<<40=40>>40 Pokemon
Stan:4(40)-13=147 Pokemon
