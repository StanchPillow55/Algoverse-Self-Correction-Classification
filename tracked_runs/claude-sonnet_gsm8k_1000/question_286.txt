Question:
Greta wanted brownies for her birthday.  She made a batch for herself; one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.  At her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.  When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting.  During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.  How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire day?


Reference Answer:
Her office sent her home with a 1/2 dozen brownies so she had 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 individual brownies
Her friends had 4 dozen brownies and 1 1/2 dozen were eaten so 4-1.5 = <<4-1.5=2.5>>2.5 dozen brownies left
She made 1 dozen brownies and had 2.5 dozen left from the party so 1+2.5 = <<1+2.5=3.5>>3.5 dozen brownies
Every dozen is 12 and she has 3.5 dozen so she has 12*3.5 = <<12*3.5=42>>42 individuals brownies
She has 42 individual brownies plus the 6 individual brownies sent home from work so she has a total of 42+6 = <<42+6=48>>48 individual brownies
