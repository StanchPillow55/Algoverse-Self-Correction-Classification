Question:
On Monday the post office delivered 425 letters. On Tuesday they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. On Wednesday they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. How many letters did the post office deliver Monday - Wednesday?


Reference Answer:
Monday = <<425=425>>425 letters
Tuesday = (1/5) * 425 + 17 = <<(1/5)*425+17=102>>102 letters
Wednesday = 2 * 102 + 5 = <<2*102+5=209>>209 letters
Total = 425 + 102 + 209 = <<425+102+209=736>>736 letters
The post office delivered 736 letters on Monday - Wednesday.
