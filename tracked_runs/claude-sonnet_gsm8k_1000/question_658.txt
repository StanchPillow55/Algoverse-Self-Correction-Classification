Question:
Marilyn wants to buy a pair of boots online. On Amazon.com, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4. On eBay, those same pair of shoes are only $13, but shipping costs twice as much as it does on Amazon. How much more expensive do the boots work out to be on eBay?


Reference Answer:
The total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $<<16+4=20>>20
Shipping on eBay costs $4 x 2 = $<<4*2=8>>8
The total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $<<13+8=21>>21
The boots cost $21 - $20 = $<<21-20=1>>1 more on eBay
