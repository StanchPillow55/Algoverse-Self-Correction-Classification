Question ID: 41

Question:
The great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 1000 feet.  Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 400 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If holding the gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?


Reference Answer:
With the gemstone, Polly could throw the javelin 3 times farther than 400 feet, for a distance of 3*400=<<3*400=1200>>1200 feet.
1200 feet is beyond the 1000-foot reach of the dragon's flames by a distance of 1200-1000=<<1200-1000=200>>200 feet.
