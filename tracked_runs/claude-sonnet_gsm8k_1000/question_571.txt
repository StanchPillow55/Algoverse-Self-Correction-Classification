Question:
Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week.  The bag has 36 cookies and she puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week.  Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days.  Jenny eats the rest of the cookies.  How many cookies does Jenny eat?


Reference Answer:
The son gets 4 cookies a day for 5 days so he eats 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20 cookies
Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days so he eats 1*7 = <<1*7=7>>7 cookies
There are 36 cookies in a bag and her son eats 20 and her husband eats 7 so Jenny eats 36-20-7 = <<36-20-7=9>>9 cookies
