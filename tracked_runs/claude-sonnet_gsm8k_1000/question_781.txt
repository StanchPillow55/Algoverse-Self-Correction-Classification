Question:
Shawnda decides that her neighborhood kids could really use a bike inflation service. She decides the best way to charge is by the tire. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. On the first day, 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated. 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. Finally, one person actually came by on a unicycle. How many dollars did she make that day?


Reference Answer:
There were 10 bike tires to fill up because 2 times 5 equals <<2*5=10>>10.
There were 9 tricycle tires to fill up because 3 times 3 equals <<3*3=9>>9.
There was one unicycle tire to fill up because 1 times 1 equals 1.
There were 20 total tires to fill up because 10 plus 9 plus 1 equals <<10+9+1=20>>20.
She made $5 because 20 times .25 equals <<20*.25=5>>5.
