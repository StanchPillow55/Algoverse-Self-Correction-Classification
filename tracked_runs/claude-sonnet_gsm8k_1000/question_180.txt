Question:
An interior design firm offers installation for $129.00.  It includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.  They will install additional items for an extra $15.00 per item.  Angela has 6 mirrors and 2 chandeliers and 20 pictures that she needs installed/hung.  How much will this cost her?


Reference Answer:
The service includes 4 mirrors and she has 6 so that's 6-4 = <<6-4=2>>2 extra mirrors
An additional item is an extra $15.00 so that's 2*15 = $30.00
The service includes 1 chandelier and she has 2 so that's 2-1 = 1 extra chandelier
An additional item is an extra $15.00 so that's 1*15 = $<<1*15=15.00>>15.00
The service includes 10 pictures and she has 20 to that's 20-10 = <<20-10=10>>10 extra pictures
An additional item is an extra $15.00 so that's 10*15 = $<<10*15=150.00>>150.00
The service costs $129.00 and the extra mirrors are $30.00, the chandelier is $15.00 and the pictures are $150.00 for a total of 129+30+15+150 = $<<129+30+15+150=324.00>>324.00
