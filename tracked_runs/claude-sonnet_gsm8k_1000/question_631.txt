Question:
Seth is twice as old as Brooke. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. How old is Seth?


Reference Answer:
To solve this problem, we can set up an equation where x represents Brooke’s age and 2x represents Seth’s age and noting that in two years, the sum of their ages is (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28.
Then we add all the values together, 3x + 4 = 28.
And we subtract 4 from each side, 3x +4 - 4 = 28 – 4.
Then we divide each side by 3x/3 = 24/3.
We find that x = <<8=8>>8, or Brooke’s age is 8.
Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth is 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.
