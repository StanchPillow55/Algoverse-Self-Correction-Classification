Question:
Topher, the green giant, wears enormous shoes.  The length of one of his shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes.  If the length of one of Topher’s shoes is 8-feet and 4-inches, how long, in inches, is one of Bobby’s shoes?


Reference Answer:
Since Topher’s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.
If we let the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, in inches, be x.
Then the length of Topher’s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.
Subtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90
Solving for x, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10
#### 10
