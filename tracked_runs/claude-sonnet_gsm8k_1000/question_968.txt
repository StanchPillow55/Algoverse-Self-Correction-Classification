Question ID: 919

Question:
To raise money for their class fund, each of the 30 students from one class sold lollipops that cost $0.8 per lollypop. On average, each student sold 10 lollipops. If they bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, how much money was the class able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops?


Reference Answer:
The class got $0.8 - $0.5 = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3 profit from each lollipop.
So each student raised $0.3 x 10 = $<<0.3*10=3>>3 from selling 10 lollipops.
Therefore, they were able to raise a total of $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90.
