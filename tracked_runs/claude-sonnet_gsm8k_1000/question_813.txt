Question:
Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance by their mother. The two girls decided to combine their allowance to surprise their father on his birthday. They bought a cake which costs $11. They also bought 1 dozen balloons which were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons. The remaining money was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?


Reference Answer:
There are 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pairs of balloons in 1 dozen.
The cost for buying a dozen balloons was $0.5 x 6 = $<<0.5*6=3>>3.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream was $7 x 2 = $<<7*2=14>>14.
The total cost of their purchases is $11 + $3 +$14 = $<<11+3+14=28>>28.
So their mother gave each of them $28/2 = $<<28/2=14>>14.
