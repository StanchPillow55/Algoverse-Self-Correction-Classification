Question:
Bill is trying to dig a well in his backyard. He can dig 4 feet/hour through soil and half that fast through clay. If he has to dig through 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay, how long will it take him to dig the well?


Reference Answer:
First find how fast Bill can dig through clay: 4 feet/hour / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 feet/hour
Then find how long he spends digging through clay in total: 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = <<8/2=4>>4 hours
Then find how long he spends digging through soil in total: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = <<24/4=6>>6 hours
Then add the time he spends digging through soil and clay to find the total digging time: 4 hours + 6 hours = <<4+6=10>>10 hours
