Question:
A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds and a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.  How many sunflower seeds are there altogether?


Reference Answer:
The small sunflower has 3 x 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 seeds.
The large sunflower has 36 x 50% = <<36*50*.01=18>>18 more seeds than the small sunflower.
The large sunflower has 36 + 18 = <<36+18=54>>54 seeds.
Together, the two sunflowers have a total of 36 + 54 = <<36+54=90>>90 seeds.
