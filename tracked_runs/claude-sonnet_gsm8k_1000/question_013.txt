Question:
Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice and gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, if there are 25 kilograms of rice per sack, how many kilograms does she gave to her cousin and brother?


Reference Answer:
Goldy gave a total of 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 sacks of rice to his brother and cousin.
Therefore she gave 25 x 7= <<25*7=175>>175 kilograms of rice.
