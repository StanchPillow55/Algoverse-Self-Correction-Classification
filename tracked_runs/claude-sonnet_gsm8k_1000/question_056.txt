Question:
Annabelle is saving for a phone that costs $400. She already has $80 in her savings. Her first job, where she earns $10 per hour, pays her for 20 hours of work. She is also paid for 15 hours of work at her second job, where she earns $5 an hour. In dollars, how much money does Annabelle still need to save?


Reference Answer:
Subtracting Annabelle’s initial savings shows that she still needs to save $400 – $80 = $<<400-80=320>>320.
From her first job, she earns $10 * 20 hours = $<<10*20=200>>200.
From her second job, she earns $5 * 15 hours = $<<5*15=75>>75.
She therefore still needs to save $320 – $200 – $75 = $<<320-200-75=45>>45.
