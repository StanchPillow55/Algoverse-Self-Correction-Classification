Question ID: 1006

Question:
The Smith family is getting ready for summer and needs to have their swimming pool filled. The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. How much will it cost to fill the pool?


Reference Answer:
Mr. Smith found the volume of the pool to be 14 feet wide x 25 feet long x 4 feet deep = <<14*25*4=1400>>1,400 cubic feet
He followed the pool company instructions and found his pool required 1,400 x 5.9 = <<1400*5.9=8260>>8,260 gallons of water.
The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 x 8,260 gallons = $<<0.10*8260=826>>826.
