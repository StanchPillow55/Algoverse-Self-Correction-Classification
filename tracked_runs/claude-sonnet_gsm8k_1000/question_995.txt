Question:
Twenty students are working together to raise money for a charity. Each earns the same amount. The charity raises a total of $175,000. $50,000 comes from organizations and the rest from the students. How much did each student raise?


Reference Answer:
Amount raised by all students was 175,000-50,000 = <<175000-50000=125000>>125,000 dollars.
Amount raised by each student was 125,000/20 = <<125000/20=6250>>6,250 dollars.
#### 6,250
