Question:
John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 lego sets and he sells them for $15 each. He ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 left. How many lego sets does he still have?


Reference Answer:
He spent $160 on video games because 8 x 20 = <<8*20=160>>160
He earned $165 from his sale because 160 + 5 = <<160+5=165>>165
He sold 11 lego sets because 11 x 15 = <<11*15=165>>165
He has 2 sets left because 13 - 11 = <<13-11=2>>2
