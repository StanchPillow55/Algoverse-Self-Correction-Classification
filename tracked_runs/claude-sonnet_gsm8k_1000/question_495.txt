Question ID: 707

Question:
Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. If 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, what percent of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes?


Reference Answer:
First find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes: 100% - 80% = 20%
Then multiply that percentage by the percentage of water taken from the river: 20% * 40% = 8%
