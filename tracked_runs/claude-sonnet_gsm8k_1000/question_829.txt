Question:
On Tuesday, Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. On Sunday he exercised for 23 minutes. On Monday he exercised for 16 minutes. How many minutes does he have to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal?


Reference Answer:
On Sunday and Monday he exercised a total of 39 minutes because 23 + 16 = <<23+16=39>>39
On Tuesday he has to exercise for 78 minutes because 39 x 2 = <<39*2=78>>78
#### 78
