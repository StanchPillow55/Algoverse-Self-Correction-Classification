Question:
Isabelle bought party supplies for her little sisterâ€™s birthday party. She spent $12 on ingredients for the cake, $43 on birthday presents, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on goodie bags for the party guests. She split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents. How many dollars did each person pay?


Reference Answer:
Isabelle spent 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = $<<12+43+15+4+22=96>>96 on party supplies.
The cost was evenly split 3 ways, so each person paid 96 / 3 = $<<96/3=32>>32.
