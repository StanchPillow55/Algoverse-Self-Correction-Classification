Question:
Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?


Reference Answer:
Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans.
So, he saved $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 on the tattered jeans.
The original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $<<22+2=24>>24.
Cole bought the tattered jeans for $<<28=28>>28
Hence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $<<28+4=32>>32.
Therefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 more than the tattered jeans.
