Question:
Adam went to a store to buy some sweets. He bought 7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B. One candy of type A costs $0.5, and one candy of type B costs $0.75. How much change did Adam get, if he paid the cashier $15?


Reference Answer:
For type A candies Adam needed to pay 7 * 0.5 = $<<7*0.5=3.5>>3.5.
For the other type of candies, Adam needed to pay 10 * 0.75 = $<<10*0.75=7.5>>7.5.
So Adam had to pay 3.5 + 7.5 = $<<3.5+7.5=11>>11 in total for his shopping.
If Adam gave the cashier $15, that means he got 15 - 11 = $<<15-11=4>>4 of change.
