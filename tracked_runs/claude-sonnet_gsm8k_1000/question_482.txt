Question:
One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. He can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe and 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes mine in a month with 30 days?


Reference Answer:
First find how much ore a dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe: 12 pounds/day * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pounds/day
Then multiply that amount by 150% to find how much a dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe: 24 pounds/day * 150% = <<24*150*.01=36>>36 pounds/day
Then multiply the amount one dwarf can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe by the number of dwarves: 36 pounds/day/dwarf * 40 dwarves = <<36*40=1440>>1440 pounds/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = <<1440*30=43200>>43200 pounds/day
#### 43200
