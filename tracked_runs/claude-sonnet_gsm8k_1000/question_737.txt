Question ID: 34

Question:
Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. If Raymond has 40 jewels, how many jewels does Siobhan have?


Reference Answer:
Half of Raymond's jewels is 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20
Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, he has 20+5 = <<5+20=25>>25 jewels.
If Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, he has 25-2 = 23 jewels.
