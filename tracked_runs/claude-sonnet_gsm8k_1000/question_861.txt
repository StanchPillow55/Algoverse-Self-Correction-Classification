Question:
Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard for the Easter egg hunt.  Lamar finds 5 eggs. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar.  Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy.  And Mei finds half as many as Charlie.  How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?


Reference Answer:
Cole hides 3 x 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 eggs.
Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 eggs.
Charlie finds 10 - 2 = <<10-2=8>>8 eggs.
Mei finds 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 eggs.
The children find a total of 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = <<5+10+8+4=27>>27 eggs.
The total number of hidden eggs still in the yard is 36 - 27 = <<36-27=9>>9 eggs.
