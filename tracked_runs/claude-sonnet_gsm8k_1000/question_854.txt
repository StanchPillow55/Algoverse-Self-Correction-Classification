Question:
Darren decides to do body exercises for a whole week. He does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses on the first day. On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than on the first day, ten fewer squats, and doubles the number of dumbbell presses. What's the total count of the activities he's done in the two days?


Reference Answer:
The total count of activities for the first day is 100+50+20 = <<100+50+20=170>>170
On the second day, he does 100+20 = <<100+20=120>>120 pushups
He also does 50-10 = <<50-10=40>>40 squats on the second day
For the dumbbell presses, he doubles the number of the first day, which becomes 2*20 = <<2*20=40>>40
The total count for the three activities on the second day is 40+40+120 = <<40+40+120=200>>200
For the two days, his total count for all the three activities is 200+170 = <<200+170=370>>370
