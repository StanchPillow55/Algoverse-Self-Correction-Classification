Question:
Nick had twice as many candies as George. Then George ate 5 candies. Now George has 3 candies left. How many candies does Nick have?


Reference Answer:
George has 3 candies now but he already ate 5. So he had 5 + 3 = <<5+3=8>>8 candies at the start.
Nick had twice as many candies as George, so he had 2 * 8 = <<2*8=16>>16 candies originally.
#### 16
