Question ID: 380

Question:
Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months at an interest rate of 10%. She has to pay an equal amount every month. How much does she have to pay per month?


Reference Answer:
Karan's interest is $3,650 Ã— 0.1 = $<<3650*0.1=365>>365.
In total Karan has to pay $3650 + $365 = $<<3650+365=4015>>4015.
Every month she has to pay $4015 / 5 = $<<4015/5=803>>803.
