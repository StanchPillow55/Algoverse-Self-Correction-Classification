Question:
The ice cream parlor was offering a deal, buy 2 scoops of ice cream, get 1 scoop free.  Each scoop cost $1.50.  If Erin had  $6.00, how many scoops of ice cream should she buy?


Reference Answer:
Each scoop cost $1.50. If she buys 2, she gets one free. So it will cost her 2 * 1.50 = $<<2*1.50=3.00>>3.00 for thee scoops total.
If you break it down, 3 scoops of ice cream cost $3.00 so 3/3 = $<<3/3=1.00>>1.00 per scoop
Erin has $6.00 and each scoop ends up costing $1.00 each then 6/1 = <<6/1=6>>6 scoops total
