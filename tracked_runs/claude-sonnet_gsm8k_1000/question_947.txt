Question:
A house and a lot cost $120,000. If the house cost three times as much as the lot, how much did the house cost?


Reference Answer:
Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.
The cost of the house is 3/4 of the total cost, which is $120,000. 3/4 * $120,000 = $<<3/4*120000=90000>>90,000.
#### 90000
