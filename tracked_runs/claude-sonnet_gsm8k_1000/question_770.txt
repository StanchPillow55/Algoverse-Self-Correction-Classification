Question:
Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on car fuel and donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. He gives his daughter 200$ to use for her weekly expenses and 700$ to his wife to budget for groceries and other household goods. If Zaid earns 6000$ per month, how much money will he still have after all these expenses and donations?


Reference Answer:
When Zaid spend 1/4 of his salary on rent, he parts with 1/4*$6000 = $<<1/4*6000=1500>>1500
Car fuel costs him 1/3*$6000 = $<<6000*1/3=2000>>2000
Total expenses amount to $2000+$1500 = $<<2000+1500=3500>>3500
The total amount of money he remains with is $6000-$3500 = $<<6000-3500=2500>>2500
He donates half of the remaining amount, which is 1/2*$2500 = $<<1/2*2500=1250>>1250
The total amount of money given to his wife and daughter is $200+$700 = $<<200+700=900>>900
After the amount that he gave the wife and daughter, the total amount remaining is $1250-$900 = $<<1250-900=350>>350
