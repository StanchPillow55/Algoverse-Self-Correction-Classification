Question:
Three friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets to the fair. They also spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. They also went on 2 different rides which costs $33 for each ride. If they agreed to split all the costs evenly, how much did each of them pay?


Reference Answer:
They spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $<<20.25-4.5=15.75>>15.75 on food.
They spent $33 x 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66 for the rides.
They spent a total of $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.
So each of them paid $102/3 = $<<102/3=34>>34.
