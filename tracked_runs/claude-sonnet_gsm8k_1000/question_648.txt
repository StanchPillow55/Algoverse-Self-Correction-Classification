Question:
Larry cooked dumplings for a group of friends.  There are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females among them. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. How many dumplings did Larry cook if each female ate 3 dumplings and there were no leftovers?


Reference Answer:
So each male ate 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 dumplings.
Hence, the 8 males ate a total of 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 dumplings.
The 6 females ate a total of 6 x 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 dumplings.
So, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is 18 + 32 = <<18+32=50>>50.
