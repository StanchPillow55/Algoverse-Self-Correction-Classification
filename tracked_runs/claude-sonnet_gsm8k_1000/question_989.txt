Question:
Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. While Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin. How many fish were they able to catch?


Reference Answer:
Locsin caught 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 starfishes.
They caught 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 starfishes.
Locsin caught 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 seahorses
They caught 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 seahorses
Locsin caught 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 clownfish.
So, they caught 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 clownfish.
Therefore, Anakin and Locsin were able to catch a total of 15 + 9 + 8 = <<15+9+8=32>>32 fish.
