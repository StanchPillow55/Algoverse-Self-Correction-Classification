Question:
Dora wants to buy a skipping rope that costs $6, a board game that costs $11, and a playground ball that costs $2. She has saved $2 from her allowance, and her mother gave her $16. How much more money does Dora need to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball?


Reference Answer:
The total cost of the skipping rope, the game, and the ball is $6 + $11 + $2 = $<<6+11+2=19>>19.
The total amount of money from the allowance and her mother is $2 + $16 = $<<2+16=18>>18.
Dora needs $19 âˆ’ $18 = $1.
