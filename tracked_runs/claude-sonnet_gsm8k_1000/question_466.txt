Question:
Skyler has 100 hats on his hand with the colors red, blue, and white. Half of the hats are red, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, and the rest are white. How many white hats does Skyler have?


Reference Answer:
If half of the hats are red, there are 1/2*100= <<1/2*100=50>>50 red hats.
The remaining number of hats which are not red is 100-50 = <<100-50=50>>50
3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, a total of 3/5*50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30 hats
If the rest of the remaining hats are white, then there are 50-30 = <<50-30=20>>20 white hats.
