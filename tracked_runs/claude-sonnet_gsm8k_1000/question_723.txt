Question:
Carlos and Benji are at the beach. Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour. If Carlos uses the boat for 3 hours and Benji uses the raft for 5 hours, how much will they pay for their rentals, altogether?


Reference Answer:
Carlos would have to pay $30 x 3 = $<<30*3=90>>90
Benji would have to pay $18 x 5 = $<<18*5=90>>90
All together, Carlos and Benji will have to pay $90 + $90 = $<<90+90=180>>180
#### 180
