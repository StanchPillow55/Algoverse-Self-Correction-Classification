Question:
Tim wanted to make lemonade for a pool party.  For a gallon of lemonade, his recipe called for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.  He found that 6 lemons would yield 1 cup of juice.  He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?


Reference Answer:
Tim is going to make one gallon twice as tart as the others and each gallon needs 1 cup of juice. So he needs 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 cups for the tart batch
In addition, he will make 4 regular gallons of lemonade, which each need 1 cup juice so 4*1 = <<4*1=4>>4 cups total
All total he will need 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 cups of juice
Each cup requires 6 lemons each and he needs 6 cups of juice so 6 * 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 lemons needed
