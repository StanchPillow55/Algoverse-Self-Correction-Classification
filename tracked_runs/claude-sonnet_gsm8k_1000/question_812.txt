Question:
Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?


Reference Answer:
Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.
He had cooked too many, so he must have needed 115 – 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double last year’s amount.
Therefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.
