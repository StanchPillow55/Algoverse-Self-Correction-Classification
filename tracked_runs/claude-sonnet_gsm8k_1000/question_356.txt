Question:
Bill is ordering a new truck. He has decided to purchase a two-ton truck with several added features: a king cab upgrade, a towing package, leather seats, running boards, and the upgraded exterior light package.  The base price of the truck is $30,000, and the other features are at extra cost. The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500.  What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?


Reference Answer:
The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, at a cost of $7,500/3=$<<7500/3=2500>>2500.
The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats at a cost of $2500-$500=$2000
The total cost of the truck is $30,000+$7500+$2500+$2000+$1500=$<<30000+7500+2500+2000+1500=43500>>43,500
#### 43,500
