Question:
Lucy sells apples from her orchard at $4 per piece. On Monday, she sold all the apples picked. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. Come Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day. If Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday, how many apples did she pick over the three days?


Reference Answer:
Since each apple costs $4, it means that on Monday, Lucy picked 56/4 = <<56/4=14>>14 apples
Combining Monday and Tuesday, Lucy picked 14 + 12 = <<14+12=26>>26 apples
On Wednesday, she picked 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 apples
All together, Lucy picked 26 + 24 = <<26+24=50>>50 apples.
#### 50
