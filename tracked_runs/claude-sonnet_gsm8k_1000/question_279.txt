Question ID: 996

Question:
Four children are playing togetherâ€”Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, and the total age of the children is 20. If Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old, calculate the age of Wilfred.


Reference Answer:
If the combined age of the children is 20, the average age of the group is 20 years / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 years.
Helene is twice as old as the group's average age, meaning Helene is 2 * 5 years = <<2*5=10>>10 years old.
The total age of the three children is 10 years + 3 years + 4 years = <<10+3+4=17>>17 years.
Wilfred's age is 20 years - 17 years = <<20-17=3>>3 years.
