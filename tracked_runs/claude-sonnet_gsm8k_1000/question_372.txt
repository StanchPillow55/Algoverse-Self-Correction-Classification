Question:
Juan asked his neighbor, Herb, how much his house was worth. Herb answered that he paid $76,000 for the house. If Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, calculate the value of the two houses combined.


Reference Answer:
Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, meaning Juan's house is 30/100*$76000= $<<30/100*76000=22800>>22800 less expensive than Herb's house.
Juan's house is worth $76000-$22800 = $<<76000-22800=53200>>53200
The combined total value of Juan's and Herb's house is $76000+$53200 = $<<76000+53200=129200>>129200
#### 129200
