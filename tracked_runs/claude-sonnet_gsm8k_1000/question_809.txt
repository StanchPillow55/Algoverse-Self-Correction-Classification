Question:
Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liamâ€™s age was twice the age of Vince. How old is Vince now?


Reference Answer:
Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = <<16-2=14>>14 years old.
Vince's age two years ago was 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 years old because Liam's age is twice his.
So Vince age now is 7 + 2 = <<7+2=9>>9 years old.
