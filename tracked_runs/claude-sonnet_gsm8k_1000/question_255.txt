Question:
Janet gets a job as a waitress.  She makes $10 an hour from wages and another $15 an hour from tips.  She wants to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment.  If she works 40 hours a week how many weeks will she need to work to save the down payment?


Reference Answer:
She makes 10+15=$<<10+15=25>>25 an hour from working
That means each week she makes 25*40=$<<25*40=1000>>1000
She wants to make 10000*.2=$<<10000*.2=2000>>2000
So she needs to work 2000/1000=<<2000/1000=2>>2 weeks
