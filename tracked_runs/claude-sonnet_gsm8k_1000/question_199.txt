Question:
Jamie earns $20 per hour for 8 hours of work each day. Should she need to work additional hours, she is paid a special hourly rate that is 150% of her regular hourly rate. Last Tuesday, she worked 11 hours. How much was she paid, in dollars, for her work that day?


Reference Answer:
The first 8 hours pay 20*8=<<20*8=160>>160.
The overtime hourly rate is 1.50*20=$<<1.50*20=30>>30/hr.
She worked 11-8=<<11-8=3>>3 overtime hours
Then the additional 3 hours pay 3*30=<<3*30=90>>90.
She was paid 160+90=<<160+90=250>>250.
