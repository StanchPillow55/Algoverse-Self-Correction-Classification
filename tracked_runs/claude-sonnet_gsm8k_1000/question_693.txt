Question:
Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y. How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?


Reference Answer:
There are 55 - 10 = <<55-10=45>>45 goats left in Farm X.
Mr. Smith sold 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 goats from Farm Y.
Thus, 45 - 20 = <<45-20=25>>25 goats are left in Farm Y.
Therefore, there are a total of 45 + 25 = <<45+25=70>>70 goats left in the two farms altogether.
#### 70
