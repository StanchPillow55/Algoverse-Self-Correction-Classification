Question:
The Llesis family drove and hiked 6 hours to their vacation spot. They drove an average of 50 miles per hour and hiked an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drive. If it took them 1.5 hours to hike, how far was their vacation spot?


Reference Answer:
Half the average speed of Llesis family driving is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour.
Hence, their average speed hiking was 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 miles per hour.
So, they hiked 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 miles.
It took them a total of 6 - 1.5 = <<6-1.5=4.5>>4.5 hours driving.
So, they drove 50 x 4.5 = <<50*4.5=225>>225 miles.
Therefore, their vacation spot was 30 + 225 = <<30+225=255>>255 miles far.
