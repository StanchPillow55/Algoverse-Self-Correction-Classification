Question:
Roger goes to the store to buy some coffee.  The normal brand of coffee he buys cost $5 per pound.  He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out.  He decides to buy a week's worth of coffee and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day.  He also decided to buy himself a donut for $2.  How much did everything cost?


Reference Answer:
The coffee he bought was 5*.2=$<<5*.2=1>>1 more expensive per pound than what he normally buys
So it cost 5+1=$<<5+1=6>>6 per pound
He goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 pounds of coffee a week
So he paid 6*7=$<<6*7=42>>42 on coffee
That means his total bill was 42+2=$<<42+2=44>>44
#### 44
