Question:
Jade bought a new cell phone with an incredible camera, so she spent all week taking pictures of her daily life. At the end of the week, she had taken 210 photos. She wants to upload all her photos on her Instagram. If she uploads 7 photos in one batch and she uploads 6 batches each day, how many days will she need to upload all of her photos?


Reference Answer:
Jade needs a total of 210 photos / 7 photos/batch = <<210/7=30>>30 batches to upload all her photos.
Each day she uploads 6 batches, so she will need 30 รท 6 = <<30/6=5>>5 days in total to upload all the photos.
