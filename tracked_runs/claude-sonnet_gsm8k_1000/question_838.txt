Question:
Ram uses a lot of pens. He discovered that he can save money by mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. If he buys 25 pens and then uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low, how many total pens does he get to have?


Reference Answer:
He can make 5 pens when the 25 run low because 25 / 5 = <<25/5=5>>5
He can make 1 pen when the ink in the re-made pens runs low because 5 / 1 = <<5/1=5>>5
He will have 31 total pens because 25 + 5 + 1 = <<25+5+1=31>>31
#### 31
