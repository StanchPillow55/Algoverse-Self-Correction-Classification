Question:
Gabriel and Luri each own a portable media player that can store up to 100 songs. Gabriel has 20 songs on his player while Luri has 3 times as many songs. How many fewer songs can Luri add to his player than Gabriel can add to his?


Reference Answer:
Gabriel can still store 100 - 20 = <<100-20=80>>80 songs.
Luri has 20 x 3 = <<20*3=60>>60 songs stored in his player.
Thus, Luri can still store 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40 songs.
Luri can add 80 - 40 = <<80-40=40>>40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel.
