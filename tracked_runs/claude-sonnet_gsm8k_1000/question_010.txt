Question:
Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits that her child no longer needed.  At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits.  Then, Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.  How many outfits does she have for her baby?


Reference Answer:
Her friend gave her 24 outfits and she received twice as many at the baby shower so she received 2*24 = 48 baby outfits
Her friend gave her 24 outfits, she received 48 at the baby shower and her mom gave her another 15 for a total of 24+48+15 = <<24+48+15=87>>87 baby outfits
