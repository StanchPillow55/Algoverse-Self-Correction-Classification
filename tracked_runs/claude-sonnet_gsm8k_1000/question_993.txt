Question:
Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.  If it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, how many potatoes did Gomer eat?


Reference Answer:
5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes is 23-5=<<23-5=18>>18 scoops of mashed potatoes.
3 less than 6 potatoes is 6-3=<<6-3=3>>3 potatoes.
1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes is 3-1=<<3-1=2>>2 scoops of mashed potatoes.
Thus, if Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, and it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes, then Gomer ate 18*(3/2)=<<18*(3/2)=27>>27 potatoes.
