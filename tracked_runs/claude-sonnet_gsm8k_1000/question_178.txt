Question:
A company decided to take its employees on a tour to explore an ancient site. The employees were divided into 3 groups of 200 employees. Each group was assigned 7 tour guides. How many is the total number of people going on this tour?


Reference Answer:
The number of employees is 3 groups * 200 employees/group = <<3*200=600>>600 employees.
The number of tour guides is 3 groups * 7 guides/group = <<3*7=21>>21 guides.
The total number of people going on this tour is 600 employees + 21 guides = <<600+21=621>>621 people.
