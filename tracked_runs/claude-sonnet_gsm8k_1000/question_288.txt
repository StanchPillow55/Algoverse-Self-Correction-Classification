Question:
Grandpa loves to eat jelly beans, but how many jelly beans he can eat depends on the size of the beans.  It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.  And eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean.  How many small beans can Grandpa eat?


Reference Answer:
If Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, then eating 75 large beans is the same as eating 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 medium-sized jelly beans.
If 1 medium-sized bean is the same as 3 small beans, then 150 medium-sized beans are equal to 150*3=<<150*3=450>>450 small jelly beans.
