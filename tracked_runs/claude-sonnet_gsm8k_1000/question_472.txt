Question:
Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack.  They are currently on sale for buy one get one free.  She also has a $2.00 coupon.  How much will each individual razor cost, in cents, after the discount if she buys 2 packs of razors?


Reference Answer:
Buy one get one free means she gets 2 packs for the price of 1 and she has a $2.00 coupon, so the razors will cost her $4-$2 = $2.00
Each pack has 4 razors and she buys 2 packs for a total of 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 razors
The razors cost $2.00 and she bought 8 so that means each razor costs $2.00/8 = $<<2/8=0.25>>0.25 each
