Question:
A landscaping company is delivering flagstones to a customerâ€™s yard. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. If the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, how many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip?


Reference Answer:
The 80 flagstones weight 75 * 80 = <<75*80=6000>>6000 pounds.
Thus, the landscaping company will need 6000 / 2000 = <<6000/2000=3>>3 trucks to transport the flagstones in one trip.
