Question:
A shoe store was having a weekend sale on a brand of popular tennis shoes. On Friday the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. The next day they sold double that number of shoes. On the last day of the sale they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, but six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. How many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale?


Reference Answer:
On Saturday 14*2=<<14*2=28>>28 shoes were sold
On Sunday 28/2=<<28/2=14>>14 shoes were sold
Before the returns were made 14+28+14=<<14+28+14=56>>56 pairs of shoes were sold
After the returns were made 56-6=<<56-6=50>>50 pairs of shoe were sold
