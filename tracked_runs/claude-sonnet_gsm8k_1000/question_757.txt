Question:
Brittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares. The comforter had 14 red squares, 4 more blue squares than red squares, 6 more green squares than blue squares, and 12 fewer white squares than green squares.  How many square feet is Brittany's comforter?


Reference Answer:
With 4 more blue than red squares, the comforter has 14+4=<<14+4=18>>18 blue squares.
With 6 more green than blue squares, the comforter has 24 green squares.
With 12 fewer white squares than green squares, the comforter has 12 white squares.
In total, the comforter has 14+18+24+12 = <<14+18+24+12=68>>68 squares that are 1-foot by 1-foot in size.
Since each square is 1-foot by 1-foot, then each square equals one square foot.
Thus, the comforter is 68 square feet.
