Question:
Juan wants to add croissants to his bakery menu.  It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.  He wants to start with making 4 dozen a day for a week.  How many pounds of butter will he need to make these croissants?


Reference Answer:
1/4 pound of butter makes 1 dozen croissants and he wants to make 4 dozen so thatâ€™s 4*.25 = <<4*.25=1>>1 pound of butter
He wants to add 4 dozen croissants a day to the menu for a total of 7 days so he needs 1*7 = 7 pounds of butter
