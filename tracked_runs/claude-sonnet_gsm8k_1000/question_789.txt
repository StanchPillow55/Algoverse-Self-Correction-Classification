Question:
John injured his back and needs to go to physical therapy.  He went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.  Each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time.  If the sessions cost $125 per hour how much did the physical therapy cost?


Reference Answer:
Each week he did 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 hours of physical therapy
So it cost 4*125=$<<4*125=500>>500 per week
This means he spent 500*6=$<<500*6=3000>>3000
#### 3000
