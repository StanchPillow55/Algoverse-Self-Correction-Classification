Question:
Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. How much more did Kelly pay than Becky?


Reference Answer:
Before the discount, Becky would have paid 20 apples x $0.45/apple = $<<20*0.45=9>>9
With the discount, Becky paid $9 - $1 = $<<9-1=8>>8.
Before the discount Kelly would have paid 20 apples x $0.50/apple = $<<20*0.5=10>>10
With a 10 percent discount Kelly paid ($10 x 10)/100 = $<<(10*10)/100=1>>1 less
In total Kelly paid $10 - $1 = $<<10-1=9>>9.
Kelly paid $9 - $8 = $<<9-8=1>>1 more than Becky.
