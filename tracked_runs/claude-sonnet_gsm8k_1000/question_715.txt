Question:
John just started watching a new show.  Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode.  How many minutes will John spend watching the show if he watches every episode?


Reference Answer:
Since there are half as many episodes as the number of minutes per episode, we perform 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 episodes in total.
Since each episode is 20 minutes long, to find the total run time we perform 10*20= <<10*20=200>>200 minutes of run time in total.
