Question:
Candy has a chair rental business. During the weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day; but during weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. If this continues, how many chairs in total will Candy be able to rent out in two 4-week months?


Reference Answer:
During weekdays, a total of 60 x 5 = <<60*5=300>>300 chairs are rented.
During the weekends, a total of 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200 chairs are rented.
In a week, 300 + 200 = <<300+200=500>>500 chairs are rented.
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, 500 x 4 = <<500*4=2000>>2000 chairs are rented in a month.
Thus, a total of 2000 x 2 = <<2000*2=4000>>4000 chairs are rented in two months.
