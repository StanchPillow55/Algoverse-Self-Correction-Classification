Question ID: 627

Question:
On a particular week, a tow truck pulled ten cars for each of the first three days and then four fewer cars on each of the remaining days of the week. Calculate the total number of cars it towed that week.


Reference Answer:
On the first three days, towing ten cars a day, the tow truck pulled 3*10 = <<3*10=30>>30 cars.
It pulled four fewer cars each day, which is 10-4 = <<10-4=6>>6 cars on the remaining days.
If it pulled ten cars for three days and four less on the remaining days, then it pulled for 7-3 = 4 days, four cars less each day.
For the four days, the car pulled 6*4= <<6*4=24>>24 cars.
The total number of cars it pulled that week is 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 cars.
