Question ID: 28

Question:
Henry made two stops during his 60-mile bike trip. He first stopped after 20 miles. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. How many miles did he travel between his first and second stops?


Reference Answer:
He traveled 20 miles + 15 miles = <<20+15=35>>35 miles not counting the distance between stops.
Henry traveled 60 miles - 35 miles = <<60-35=25>>25 miles between his first and second stop.
