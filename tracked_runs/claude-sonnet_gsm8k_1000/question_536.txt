Question:
Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day from her parents. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each every day and saves the change in her piggy bank. How much money does she put in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days?


Reference Answer:
If each lollipop costs 25 cents, 4 lollipops cost 4 * 25 cents = <<4*25=100>>100 cents
Since 100 cents = $1 she spends $1 everyday.
Her savings everyday is $5 - $1 = $<<5-1=4>>4
If she saves $4 every day for 5 days, she will have $4 * 5 = $<<4*5=20>>20
