Question:
Cayley markets various newspapers to get a commission on each copy sold. He gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times and an 8% commission on each of the Wall Street Journal. How much commission will he earn in total from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of Wall Street Journal if each costs $5 and $15 respectively?


Reference Answer:
He gets a commission of 10% on each copy of the New York Times so for 6 copies he will get 6*$5*(10/100) = $<<6*5*(10/100)=3>>3
He gets a commission of 8% on each copy of Wall Street Journal so for 10 copies he will get 10*$15*(8/100) = $<<10*15*8/100=12>>12
He will make a total commission of $3+$12 = $<<3+12=15>>15
#### 15
