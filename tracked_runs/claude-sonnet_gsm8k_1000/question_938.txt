Question:
John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs.  How fast does he run?


Reference Answer:
He has 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 possible running days.
He runs half of those so he runs 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 days.
So for two days, he runs 3/2=<<3/2=1.5>>1.5 hours.
So in total, he runs 3+1.5+1.5=<<3+1.5+1.5=6>>6 hours.
So he runs 60/6=<<60/6=10>>10 mph.
