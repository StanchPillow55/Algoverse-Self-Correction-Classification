Question:
Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens and also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red. If each pack has 5 pens, how many pens does Alain have?


Reference Answer:
Alain has a total of 5 x 5= <<5*5=25>>25 red pens.
And he has a total of 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 packs of black pens.
So, the total number of black pens he has is 10 x 5 = <<10*5=50>>50.
Therefore, the total number of pens he has is 50 + 25= <<50+25=75>>75.
#### 75
