Question:
Kenny is selling his Pokemon cards to buy a ticket to an amusement park, which costs $100. He has a collection of cards and plans to sell them for $1.5 each. He keeps 1/3 of them and gets to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash. How many cards did he start with?


Reference Answer:
He made $150 selling the cards because 100 + 50 = <<100+50=150>>150
He sold 100 cards because 150 / 1.5 = <<150/1.5=100>>100
The cards he sold were 2/3 of his collection because 1 - (1/3) = 2/3
He started with 150 cards because 100 / (2/3) = <<100/(2/3)=150>>150
#### 150
