Question:
At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women. After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. How many women are left if 22 men stayed at the party?


Reference Answer:
There were a total of 25 men + 15 women = <<25+15=40>>40 people who attended the party.
After an hour, 40 people / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 people left the party.
This means 40 people - 10 people = <<40-10=30>>30 people stayed.
Out of the 30 who stayed, 30 people - 22 men = <<30-22=8>>8 were women.
