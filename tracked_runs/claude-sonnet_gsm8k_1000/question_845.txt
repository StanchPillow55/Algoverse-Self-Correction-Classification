Question:
Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. How much more candy does Amy have after two weeks?


Reference Answer:
First find the the difference in the number of pieces of candy the two people each per day: 4 pieces/day - 3 pieces/day = <<4-3=1>>1 piece/day
Then find the number of days in 2 weeks: 2 weeks * 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14 days
Then multiply the difference per day by the number of days to find the total difference after 14 days: 1 piece/day * 14 days = <<1*14=14>>14 pieces
#### 14
