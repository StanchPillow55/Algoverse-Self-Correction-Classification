Question:
Jeremy saw 12 birds in their backyard and threw a stone at them, scaring away 1/3 of that number. A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. How many birds are now in the backyard?


Reference Answer:
The total number of birds scared away after he threw the stone at them is 1/3 * 12 = <<1/3*12=4>>4 birds.
The total number of birds remaining is 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 birds.
If 20 more birds joined, the total number of birds in the backyard will become 8 + 20 = <<8+20=28>>28 birds.
