Question:
Beatrice bought ten packets of crayons for her Art class. Six of the packets had eight pieces of colors each, and the other four packets had sixteen pieces of colors each. How many colors of crayons did Beatrice buy in all?


Reference Answer:
Six packets had 6 x 8 = <<6*8=48>>48 colors of crayons.
Four packets had 4 x 16 = <<4*16=64>>64 colors of crayons.
Therefore, Beatrice bought 48 + 64 = <<48+64=112>>112 colors of crayons in all.
