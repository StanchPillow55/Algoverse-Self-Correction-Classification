Question ID: 58

Question:
Stephen placed an online order for groceries.  His final bill came to $40.00.  Because this was through a delivery vendor, they tacked on a 25% fee to his final total and charged him $3.00 in delivery fees.  Stephen also added a $4.00 tip.  After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?


Reference Answer:
He spent $40.00 on groceries but they charged him a 25% fee so that's 40*.25 = $10.00
There is also a $3.00 delivery fee and a $4.00 tip for an extra $3 + $4 = $<<3+4=7.00>>7.00 in fees
His groceries were $40.00, there's a $10.00 fee plus another $7.00 in delivery/tip fees for a final total of $40 + $10 + $7 = $<<40+10+7=57.00>>57.00
