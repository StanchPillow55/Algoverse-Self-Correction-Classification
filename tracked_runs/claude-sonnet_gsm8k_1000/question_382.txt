Question:
Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.  He works 2 hours less than he sleeps and he walks his dog for an hour each day.  How much free time does Harold have left in his day?


Reference Answer:
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps and he sleeps for 10 hours so he works 10-2 = <<10-2=8>>8 hours
He sleeps for 10 hours, works for 8 hours and walks his dog for 1 hour for a total of 10+8+1 = <<10+8+1=19>>19 hours
There are 24 hours in a day and his busy for 19 hours so that leaves 24-19 = <<24-19=5>>5 hours left of free time
