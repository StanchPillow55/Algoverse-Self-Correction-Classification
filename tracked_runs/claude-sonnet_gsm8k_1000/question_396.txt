Question:
Walter bought 60 apples from the store. He ate 2/5 of them and gave his sister 25% of the remaining number. If he then sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each, how much money did he receive?


Reference Answer:
From the 60 apples that Walter bought, he ate 2/5*60=<<2/5*60=24>>24 apples
The number of apples remaining was 60-24=<<60-24=36>>36
Walter gave 25/100*36=<<25/100*36=9>>9 apples to his sister.
He remained with 36-9=<<36-9=27>>27 apples.
He then sold the apples for 27*$3=$<<27*3=81>>81 to his uncle.
