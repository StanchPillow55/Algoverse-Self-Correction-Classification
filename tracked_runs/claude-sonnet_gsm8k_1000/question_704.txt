Question:
Gus spent $20.00 at the grocery store.  He bought 2 bag of chips for $2.00 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00 and a bottle of soda for $1.00.  How much did the apple pie cost?


Reference Answer:
He bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each so they cost 2*2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00
He spent $4.00 on chips, $8.00 on fried chicken and $1.00 on soda so he spent 4+8+1 = $<<4+8+1=13.00>>13.00
He spent $20.00 and all of the groceries, except for the pie cost $13.00 so that means the apple pie cost 20-13 = $<<20-13=7.00>>7.00
