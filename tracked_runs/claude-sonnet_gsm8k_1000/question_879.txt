Question:
Mario needs to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs.  Assuming his dogs each has four legs and each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, how much will it cost him to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs?


Reference Answer:
Dogs have 4 legs and a pair is 2 legs so each dog has 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 pair of legs
There are 6 dogs and they each have 2 pair of legs so they have 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 pair of legs
The snowshoes cost $12 per pair and he needs to buy 12 pairs so he will spend 12*12 = $<<12*12=144>>144 on snowshoes
