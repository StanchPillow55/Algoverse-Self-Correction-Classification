Question ID: 619

Question:
Each pole on a road intersection has 4 street lights. If the number of poles at each intersection is 6, and the road has 4 intersections, calculate the total number of functioning street lights if 20 streetlights from the total number are not working.


Reference Answer:
If the number of poles at each intersection is 6, and the road has 4 intersections, the total number of poles having street lights is 6*4=<<6*4=24>>24
Since each pole on a road intersection has 4 street lights, the total number of streetlights in all the poles is 24*4=<<24*4=96>>96
If 20 streetlights from the total number are not working, the number of functioning street lights is 96-20=<<96-20=76>>76
