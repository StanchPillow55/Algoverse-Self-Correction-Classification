Question:
Richard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 60 cherries. If Robert has 30 cherries, and has 10 more than Richard, how many more cherries does Robert have than Jerry?


Reference Answer:
Since Robert has 30, then 60 - 30 = <<30=30>>30 cherries are left to be shared by Richard and Jerry.
Richard has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 cherries since Robert has 10 more cherries than him.
Jerry has 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 cherries.
So Robert has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 more cherries than Jerry.
#### 20
