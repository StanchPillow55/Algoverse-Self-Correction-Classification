Question:
Johnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.  He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, and another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces.  How many blocks does Johnny pick up if he picks up all the legos?


Reference Answer:
The first set had 500 pieces, and the second set had 3 times as many as the first set, so the second set has 500*3=<<500*3=1500>>1500 pieces
The third set had one-quarter of the 500 pieces, so that means it had 500*.25= <<500*.25=125>>125 pieces
In total, that means Johnny picked up 500 + 1500+ 125= <<500+1500+125=2125>>2125 blocks
#### 2,125
