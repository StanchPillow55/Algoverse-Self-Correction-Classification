Question:
Jeff owns a catering company.  During a recent event, he sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for the party.  When they were returned, 10 glasses were broken as well as 6 plates.  How many glasses and plates does Jeff have now?


Reference Answer:
He had 8 dozen glasses so he had 8*12 = <<8*12=96>>96 glasses
He had 4 dozen plates so he had 4*12 = <<4*12=48>>48 plates
10 glasses were broken and he started with 96 so he now has 96-10= 86 glasses
6 plates were broken and he started with 48 so he now has 48-6 = <<48-6=42>>42
All total he has 86 glasses and 42 plates so 86+42 = <<86+42=128>>128 glasses and plates
#### 128
