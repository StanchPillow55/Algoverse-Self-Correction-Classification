Question ID: 80

Question:
Two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. Then a boy got 6 liters of water. How many liters of water were left?


Reference Answer:
Each of the girls got 24 x 1/6 = <<24*1/6=4>>4 liters of water.
So the two girls got a total of 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 liters.
Thus, a total of 8 + 6 = <<8+6=14>>14 liters of water were gotten by the two girls and the boy.
Therefore, 24 - 14 = <<24-14=10>>10 liters of water were left.
