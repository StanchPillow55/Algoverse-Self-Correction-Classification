Question:
Mrs. Cruz is looking for a house that will not go beyond her $400 000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $350 000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?


Reference Answer:
The brokerage fee is $350 000 x 5/100 = $<<350000*5/100=17500>>17500.
The transfer fee is $350 000 x 12/100 = $<<350000*12/100=42000>>42000.
The total price of the house is $350 000 + $17500 + $42000 = $409 500.
So, it is $409 500 - $400 000 = $<<409500-400000=9500>>9500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.
#### 9500
