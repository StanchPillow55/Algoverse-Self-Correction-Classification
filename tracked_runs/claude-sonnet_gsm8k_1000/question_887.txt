Question:
Stetson made a bet with Alec that he would give up $10 for each orange he eats. While at the farm, Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked. If they picked 60 oranges, calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up?


Reference Answer:
If they picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them, he ate 2/5*60 = <<60*2/5=24>>24 oranges.
If he gave $10 for every orange he ate, then he gave up $10*24 = $<<10*24=240>>240
