Chris has a two-speed lawn mower. He can mow his entire lawn in "turtle" mode in 1 hour, or 40 minutes in "rabbit" mode. Today, he experimented by mowing half in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode. How many minutes did it take him to mow the lawn?


Reference Answer:
He spends 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 minutes in turtle mode
He spends 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 minutes in rabbit mode
He took 30+20=<<30+20=50>>50 minutes to mow the lawn.
