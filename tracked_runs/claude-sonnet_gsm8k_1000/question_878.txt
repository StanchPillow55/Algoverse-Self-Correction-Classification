Question:
The bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. How many loaves of bread did they have left?


Reference Answer:
The Bakery sold 93 + 39 = <<93+39=132>>132 loaves.
The Bakery made 200 loaves and sold 132, leaving 200 - 132 = <<200-132=68>>68 loaves remaining.
The grocery store returned 6 loaves, so there were 6 + 68 = <<6+68=74>>74 loaves left.
