Question:
Alicia's clothes have to be sent to the dry cleaners weekly.  Her weekly drop-off includes 5 blouses, 2 pants and 1 skirt.  If they charge her $5.00 per blouse, $6.00 per skirt and $8.00 per pair of pants, how much does she spend on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks?


Reference Answer:
The blouses cost $5.00 each to dry clean and she has 5 so that's 5*5 = $<<5*5=25.00>>25.00
The one skirt she has costs $6.00 to dry clean
The pants cost $8.00 to dry clean and she has 2 pairs so that's 8*2 = $<<8*2=16.00>>16.00
In one week she spends 25+6+16 = $<<25+6+16=47.00>>47.00 on dry cleaning
Over 5 weeks, she will spend 5*47 = $<<5*47=235.00>>235.00 on dry cleaning
