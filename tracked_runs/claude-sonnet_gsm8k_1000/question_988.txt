Question:
Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month.  She sets 25% of her paycheck aside to put towards fancy shoes.  Each pair of shoes she buys costs $1,000.00.  How many shoes can she buy in a year?


Reference Answer:
She is paid $2,000.00 a month and she saves 25% for shoes so she saves 2000*.25 = $<<2000*.25=500.00>>500.00
She saves $500.00 a month for 12 months so she saves 500*12 = $<<500*12=6000.00>>6,000.00
Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00 and she has saved $6,000.00 so she can buy 6000/1000 = 6 pair of shoes per year
