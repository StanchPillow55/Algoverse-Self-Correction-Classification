Question:
A train has 172 people traveling on it. At the first stop 47 people get off and 13 more people get on, and at the next stop another 38 people get off. How many people are on the train?


Reference Answer:
At the first stop 172 people - 47 people = <<172-47=125>>125 people are on the train.
Then 13 more people get on increasing it to 125 people + 13 people = <<13+125=138>>138 people.
At the next stop 138 people - 38 people = <<138-38=100>>100 people remain on the train.
