Question:
Betsy and Donovan made a meal together. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. The meal was made in 98 minutes. How many minutes long was Betsy's part?


Reference Answer:
Let D = Donovan's time in minutes
Betsy = D + <<+18=18>>18
2D + 18 = 98
2D = 80
D = <<40=40>>40
Betsy = 40 + 18 = <<40+18=58>>58 minutes
Betsy's part took 58 minutes.
#### 58
