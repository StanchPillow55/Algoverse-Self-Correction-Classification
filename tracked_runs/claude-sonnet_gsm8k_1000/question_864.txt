Question:
Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes.  In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points.  In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points.  How many total points did he score?


Reference Answer:
He scored 4*.25=<<4*.25=1>>1 point more in the second 20 minutes
So he scored 4+1=<<4+1=5>>5 points in the second 20 minutes
So in total, he scored 4+5=<<4+5=9>>9 points in the 40 minutes
