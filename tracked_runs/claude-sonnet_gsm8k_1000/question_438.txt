Question:
Toula went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 3 dozen donuts which cost $68 per dozen, 2 dozen mini cupcakes which cost $80 per dozen, and 6 dozen mini cheesecakes for $55 per dozen. How much was the total cost?


Reference Answer:
The total charge for the doughnuts was 3 x $68 = $<<3*68=204>>204.
The total charge for the mini cupcakes was 2 x $80 = $<<2*80=160>>160.
The total charge for the mini cheesecakes was 6 x $55 = $<<6*55=330>>330.
Therefore the total amount Toula paid for the pastries was $204 + $160 + $330 = $<<204+160+330=694>>694.
