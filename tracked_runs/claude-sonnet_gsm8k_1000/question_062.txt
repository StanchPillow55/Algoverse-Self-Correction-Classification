Question ID: 1204

Question:
Twenty tourists discovered 700 shells in a strip mall parking lot. They had divided into three groups, Alphas, The finders, and Gogetters to find as many shells as possible. If team Alphas found 40% of the shells, and team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, how many shells did team Gogetters find?


Reference Answer:
Team Alphas found 40/100*700 = <<40/100*700=280>>280 shells.
If team Alphas found 280 shells, the other teams found 700-280 = 420 shells.
Team The Finders found 60% of the remaining shells, a total of 60/100*420 = <<60/100*420=252>>252 shells.
If The finders found 252 shells, team Gogetters found 420-252 = 168 shells.
