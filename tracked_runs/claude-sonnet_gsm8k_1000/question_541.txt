Question:
Three people invested $1200 in a joint savings account.  After Dylan's investment of 2/5 of the total amount, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount.  Skyler's investment accounted for the rest. How much money was Skyler's investment?


Reference Answer:
Dylan's investment was 2/5 * $1200 = $<<2/5*1200=480>>480
Frances and Skylers' investment was $1200 - $480 = $<<1200-480=720>>720
Frances invested 2/3 * $720 = $<<2/3*720=480>>480
Dylan's and Frances's total investments were $480 + $480 = $<<480+480=960>>960
Skyler invested $1200 - $960 = $<<1200-960=240>>240
