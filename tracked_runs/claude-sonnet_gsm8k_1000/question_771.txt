Question ID: 1089

Question:
Nathan has a bouncy ball that bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. If he drops it from the third-floor balcony in the mall, where each story is 24 feet high, how high does the ball go on its second bounce?


Reference Answer:
First find the total height from which Nathan drops the ball: 24 feet/story * 3 stories = <<24*3=72>>72 feet
Then multiply that number by 2/3rds to find the height of the ball after one bounce: 72 feet * 2/3 = <<72*2/3=48>>48 feet
Then multiply that number by 2/3rds to find the height of the ball after two bounces: 48 feet * 2/3 = <<48*2/3=32>>32 feet
#### 32
