Question:
Elvis starts driving from his house and travels west for 5 hours. Then he turns around and travels east for 8 hours. If he was driving at an average speed of 18mph for both parts of the journey, how far is he from his house now?


Reference Answer:
During the first part of the journey he travels west for 5 hours at a speed of 18mph so he covered a distance of 5*18 = <<5*18=90>>90 miles
Then he travels east at the same speed for 8 hours so he covered a distance of 8*18 = <<8*18=144>>144 miles
His distance from his house now is the difference between his east and west movements which is 144-90 = <<144-90=54>>54 miles
