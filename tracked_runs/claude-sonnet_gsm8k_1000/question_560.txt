Question:
Sue lives in a fun neighborhood.  One weekend, the neighbors decided to play a prank on Sue.  On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard.  On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put these newly painted white flamingos back out on Sue's front yard.  Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos?


Reference Answer:
On Saturday, one third of the original 18 pink flamingos were removed and painted white: 18*1/3=<<18*1/3=6>>6 white flamingos.
This left 18 pink - 6 = <<18-6=12>>12 pink flamingos.
On Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added, for a total of 12 + 18 = <<12+18=30>>30 pink flamingos on the front lawn.
Altogether, there were 30 pink and 6 white flamingos on the lawn, so there were 30 pink - 6 white =<<30-6=24>>24 more pink flamingos.
