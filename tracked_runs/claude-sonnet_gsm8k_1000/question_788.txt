Question:
George, a grade six teacher, ordered 600 burritos for the sixth-grade class picnic. If there were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given ten burritos, with Mr. George eating 20 of them, calculate the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic?


Reference Answer:
The total number of burritos eaten by the students is 50*10 = <<50*10=500>>500
If Mr George also ate 20, the total number of burritos eaten at the picnic is 500+20 = <<500+20=520>>520
There were 600-520 = <<600-520=80>>80 leftover burritos.
#### 80
