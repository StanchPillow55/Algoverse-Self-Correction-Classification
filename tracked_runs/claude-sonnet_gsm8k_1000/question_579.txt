Question ID: 1193

Question:
Jason was told he could earn $3.00 for doing his laundry,  $1.50 for cleaning his room, $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb each week and $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher.  In a two week period, Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, did his laundry once, took the trash out twice and cleaned his room once.  How much money did Jason earn?


Reference Answer:
Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times at $0.50 each so he made 6*.50=$<<6*.50=3.00>>3.00
Jason did his laundry 1 time at $3.00 so he made 1*3 = $<<1*3=3.00>>3.00
Jason took the trash out 2 times at $0.75 each so he made 2*.75 = $<<2*.75=1.50>>1.50
Jason cleaned his room 1 time at $1.50 each so he made 1*1.50 = $<<1*1.50=1.50>>1.50
Jason made 3+1.50+1.50+3 = $<<3+1.5+1.5+3=9.00>>9.00
