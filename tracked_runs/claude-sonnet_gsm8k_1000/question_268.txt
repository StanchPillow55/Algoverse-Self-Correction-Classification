Question:
John hires a driving service to get him to work each day.  His work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day.  He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.  He gets charged $2 per mile driven and he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?


Reference Answer:
He has to travel 30*2=<<30*2=60>>60 miles per day
That means he travels 60*5=<<60*5=300>>300 miles per week
So he pays 300*2=$<<300*2=600>>600 per week
That means he pays $600*50=$<<600*50=30000>>30000 a year for miles driven
He also gives $150*12=$<<150*12=1800>>1800 a year as a bonus to his driver
So he pays $30000+$1800=$<<30000+1800=31800>>31,800 a year
#### 31800
