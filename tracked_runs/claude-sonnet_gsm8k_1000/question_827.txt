Question ID: 48

Question:
Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden. The wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long. How many pieces did she obtain?


Reference Answer:
If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 inches.
Since the wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long, Tracy obtained 48/6=<<48/6=8>>8 pieces
