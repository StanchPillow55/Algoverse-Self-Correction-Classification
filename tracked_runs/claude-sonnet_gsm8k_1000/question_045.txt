Question:
A watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found out that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took them home. When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. How many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks?


Reference Answer:
When Ashlyn found out that 30% of the melons were ready, she took home 30/100 *120 = <<30/100*120=36>>36 watermelons.
The number of watermelons remaining on the farm is 120-36 =<<120-36=84>>84
When she returned two weeks later, she found that 3/4*84 = <<3/4*84=63>>63 were ready for harvest,
The number of watermelons that were not ready is 84-63 =<<84-63=21>>21
