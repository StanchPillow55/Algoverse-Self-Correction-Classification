Question ID: 1160

Question:
Last week the IRS received 5168 tax reports. On Monday and Tuesday they received a total of 1907 reports. On Thursday and Friday they received a total of 2136 reports. How many reports did they receive on Wednesday?


Reference Answer:
Mon/Tues = 1907
Thur/Fri = 2136
Mon, Tues, Thur, Fri = 1907 + 2136 = <<1907+2136=4043>>4043
5168 - 4043 = <<5168-4043=1125>>1125 reports
The IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday of last week.
