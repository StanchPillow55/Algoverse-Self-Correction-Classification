Question:
Mara added 3 slices of cake to a plate that already had 2 slices on it. She was getting hungrier so she tripled the number of slices she currently has. She ate 2 slices and while she was distracted, her friend stole 5 slices off her plate. What number of cake slices remained on the plate?


Reference Answer:
Mara had 3+2=<<3+2=5>>5 slices of cake.
She was hungry and tripled the amount to 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 slices.
She ate a couple, leaving 15-2=<<15-2=13>>13 slices.
Her friend came and stole some which left Mara to 13-5=<<13-5=8>>8 slices.
