Question:
Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.  She ended up returning one item that cost $15.00.  After she returned the item, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00 and a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00.  She put both of these purchases on her credit card.  What is the new balance on her credit card?


Reference Answer:
She charged $85.00 on her card and just returned a $15.00 purchase so right now, her credit card has 85-15 = $<<85-15=70.00>>70.00 balance
The frying pan is 20% off of $20.00 so .20*20.00 = $<<20*.01*20=4.00>>4.00
The frying pan costs $20.00 and the discount price is $4.00 so the new price is 20-4=$<<20-4=16.00>>16.00
The towel set is 10% off of $30.00 so .10*30 = $<<10*.01*30=3.00>>3.00
The towel set costs $30.00 and the discount price is $3.00 so the new price is 30-3= $<<30-3=27.00>>27.00
Her new purchases total 16+27 = $$<<16+27=43.00>>43.00
After the return, her card balance was $70.00 and she just added $43.00 in purchases so her new balance is 70+43 = $<<70+43=113.00>>113.00
