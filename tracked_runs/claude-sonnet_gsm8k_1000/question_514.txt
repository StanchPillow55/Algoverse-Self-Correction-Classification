Question ID: 104

Question:
Poppy is solving a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, then her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. How many jigsaw pieces are left to be placed?


Reference Answer:
Poppy has placed 1000 pieces / 4 = <<1000/4=250>>250 pieces.
This means there are 1000 – 250 = <<1000-250=750>>750 pieces remaining.
Her mom therefore places 750 / 3 = <<750/3=250>>250 pieces.
This leaves a total of 750 – 250 = <<750-250=500>>500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.
