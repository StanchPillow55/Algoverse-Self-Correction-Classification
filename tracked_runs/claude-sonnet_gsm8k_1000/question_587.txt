Question ID: 1194

Question:
From her science class study, Brady learned that each whale in the sea has 40 gallons of blood. She also learned that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Calculate the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have.


Reference Answer:
Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, then a shark has 3*40 = <<3*40=120>>120 gallons of blood.
10 sharks swimming in the sea will have 10*120 = <<10*120=1200>>1200 gallons of blood.
