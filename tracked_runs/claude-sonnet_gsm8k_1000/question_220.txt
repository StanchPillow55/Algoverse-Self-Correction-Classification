Question:
Jamaal is at the gym. He has been using an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight that he uses by 50%. It turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. What is the weight, in pounds, that he now uses?


Reference Answer:
An increase of 50% of 8 is 1.5*8=12.
He switches to a 12-2=<<12-2=10>>10 pound weight.
