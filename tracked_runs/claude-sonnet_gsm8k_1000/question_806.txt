Question:
Roy has saved 40% more in money earned by chores than his brother Anthony.  Anthony has saved $10.00 more than their sister Eva.   Eva has saved $20.00.  How much money does Roy have?


Reference Answer:
Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva who has $20.00 so he has 10+20 = $<<10+20=30.00>>30.00
Roy has saved 40% more than his brother who has $30.00 so Roy has saved .40*30 = $12.00
All total, Roy has 12.00 more than his brother, so he has 12+30 = $<<12+30=42.00>>42.00
