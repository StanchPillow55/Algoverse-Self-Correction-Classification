Question:
Carson lives in an old house where the pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees. Every log of wood Carson burns heats the house up by 5 degrees. If it was 45 degrees during the day, and it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, how many logs does Carson need to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing?


Reference Answer:
First find the night-time temperature: 45 degrees - 33 degrees = <<45-33=12>>12 degrees
Then find how much Carson needs to heat his house to avoid the pipes freezing: 32 degrees - 12 degrees = <<32-12=20>>20 degrees
Then divide the amount of heat Carson needs by the amount of heat each log produces: 20 degrees / 5 degrees/log = <<20/5=4>>4 logs
