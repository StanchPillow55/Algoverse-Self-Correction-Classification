Question:
Apple High School is holding graduation in their Fine Arts Center this year which has space for 6000 people.  After accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?


Reference Answer:
Add graduate and faculty seats together. 950 + 300 = <<950+300=1250>>1250 seats for faculty and graduates
Minus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 6000 - 1250 = <<6000-1250=4750>>4750 remaining seats.
Divide amount of graduates by remaining seats. 4750/950 = <<4750/950=5>>5 tickets
