Question ID: 107

Question:
Frankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?


Reference Answer:
Let W be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.
After Monday, he had 7 - 1 = <<7-1=6>>6 hours of TV left.
After Tuesday, he had 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours of TV left.
After Thursday, he had 5 - 1 - 1/2 = 3 1/2 hours of TV left.
After Friday, he had 3 1/2 - 2 = 1 1/2 hours of TV left.
Each 30-minute episode is 1/2 hour.
Thus, W = 1 1/2 / 1/2 = 3 episodes.
