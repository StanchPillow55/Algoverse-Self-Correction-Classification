Question:
Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills from the bank account.  He loses 10 bills while getting home.  After that, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.  Thomas then triples his money.  He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.  How many 5 dollar bills does he have?


Reference Answer:
He withdrew 1000/20=<<1000/20=50>>50 bills
So he has 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 bills left over
He uses half the bills to pay for something, so he has 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 bills
He triples his money which gives him 20*3=<<20*3=60>>60 bills
So he has 60*20=$<<60*20=1200>>1200
Converting to 5s means he has 1200/5=<<1200/5=240>>240 bills
#### 240
