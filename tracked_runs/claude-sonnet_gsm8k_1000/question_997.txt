Question:
Felix notices that kids in the neighborhood are always getting things stuck in trees. Since he is an expert tree climber, he decided to start charging kids to get their stuff out. He charges based on how high he has to climb. Every branch he has to climb up costs $.25. During the week he made $105. On average, how many branches did he climb per day?


Reference Answer:
He climbed 420 branches in total because 105 / .25 = <<105/.25=420>>420
He climbed on average 60 branches a day because 420 / 7 = <<420/7=60>>60
#### 60
