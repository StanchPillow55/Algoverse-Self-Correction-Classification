Question:
Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm. Ali gives her sister half of the total money he has and uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. Calculate the amount of money he has after buying the dinner.


Reference Answer:
Four $10 bills have a value of 4*$10 =$<<4*10=40>>40
The six $20 bills also are worth 6*$20 = $<<6*20=120>>120
Ali has $40+$120 = $<<40+120=160>>160
When he gives his sister half of the money, he remains with the other half, which totals 1/2*$160 = $<<1/2*160=80>>80
He then spends 3/5*$80 = $<<3/5*80=48>>48 on dinner.
The total amount of money that Ali has now is $80-$48 = $<<80-48=32>>32
