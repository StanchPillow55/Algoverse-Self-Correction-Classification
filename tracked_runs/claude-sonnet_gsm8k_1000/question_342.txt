Question:
Jenny is dividing up a pizza with 12 slices. She gives 1/3 to Bill and 1/4 to Mark. If Jenny eats 2 slices, how many slices are left?


Reference Answer:
First find how many slices 1/3 of the pizza is by multiplying 1/3 by the total number of slices: 12 slices * 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 slices
Do the same thing to find how many slices 1/4 of the pizza is: 12 slices * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 slices
Then subtract the slices each of the three people ate to find the remaining number of slices: 12 slices - 4 slices - 3 slices - 2 slices = <<12-4-3-2=3>>3 slices
