Question:
Robert wants to buy a bookshelf and a sofa and has received two offers. Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. What is the cost difference between the two offers?


Reference Answer:
Furniture United's offer is 1,350 + (6 *350) = $<<1350+(6*350)=3450>>3,450
Cozy Homes's offer is 1,100 + (9 * 250) = $<<1100+9*250=3350>>3,350
The difference is 3,450 â€“ 3,350 = $<<3450-3350=100>>100
#### 100
