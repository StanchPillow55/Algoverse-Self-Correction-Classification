Question:
Jaime places eggs on the tray. Each tray can hold 24 eggs. If he has 64 eggs and 2 trays, how many eggs won't he be able to place on the tray?


Reference Answer:
Jaime will be able to place a total of 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48.
Therefore, there are 64 - 48 = <<64-48=16>>16 eggs that he won't be able to place on the tray.
#### 16
