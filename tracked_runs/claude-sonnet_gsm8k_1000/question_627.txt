Question:
Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris.  Kris kept 9 of the stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. How many stickers did Seth have in the beginning?


Reference Answer:
Luis gave 9 + 7 = <<9+7=16>>16 stickers to Kris.
Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris which means that he had 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 stickers.
Seth had 32 x 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 stickers.
#### 64
