Question ID: 570

Question:
Peter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. How many total action figures will he have by the end of the week?


Reference Answer:
There are 7 days in a week so if he wishes to spend an equal amount of $70 each day that would be $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10
For four days (Sunday through Wednesday) he will spend 4*$10 = $<<4*10=40>>40
He will spend $40 on wooden action figures of $5 each which gives $40/$5 = <<40/5=8>>8 wooden action figures
For the remaining 3 days he will spend 3*$10 = $<<3*10=30>>30
He will spend $30 on plastic action figures of $2 each which gives $30/$2 = <<30/2=15>>15 plastic action figures
Altogether, he will have 8+15 = <<8+15=23>>23 action figures.
