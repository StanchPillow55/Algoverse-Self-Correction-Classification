Question:
Gene is sewing a quilt out of old souvenir t-shirts. He has one shirt from each vacation he has been on. Every shirt is its own quilt block. Each row is made of blocks from a different year of vacations. He goes on four vacations a year and has been vacationing since he was 23 years old. He is now 34. How many quilt blocks does he have in total?


Reference Answer:
Gene has been on 34 - 23 = <<34-23=11>>11 years of vacations, so he has 11 rows of blocks.
He goes on 4 vacations a year, so he has been on 4 * 11 = <<4*11=44>>44 vacations.
Gene has 1 shirt from each vacation, so he has 44 * 1 = <<44*1=44>>44 quilt blocks in all.
#### 44
