Question:
Last year there were 50 students enrolled in a calligraphy class. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment. How many students are enrolled this year in the calligraphy class?


Reference Answer:
There was an increase of 50 x 20/100 = <<50*20/100=10>>10 students in enrollment.
So, there is a total of 50 + 10 = <<50+10=60>>60 students who were enrolled this year.
