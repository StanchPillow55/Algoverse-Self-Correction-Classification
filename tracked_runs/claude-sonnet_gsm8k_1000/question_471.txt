Question:
The basketball team went to the steakhouse to eat dinner.  The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.  The second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size.  The third player ate a one-pound steak.  And the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals.  In total, how many ounces of meat were consumed by the team?


Reference Answer:
The second player consumed 8 1-ounce beef tips, for a total weight of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 ounces.
Thus, the total combined weight includes 6 ounces from the first player, 8 ounces from the second player, and 1 pound, which is 16 ounces, from the third player, for a combined total of 6+8+16=<<6+8+16=30>>30 ounces.
