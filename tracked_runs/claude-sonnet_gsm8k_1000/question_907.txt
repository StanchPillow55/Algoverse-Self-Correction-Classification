Question ID: 405

Question:
Tyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game.  Each sandwich required 1 pound each of meat and cheese and would serve 4 people.  There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?


Reference Answer:
Each sandwich serves 4 people and he had 20 people in total to make food for so 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 sandwiches
1 pound of meat cost $7.00 per sandwich and he had to make 5 so 7*5 = $<<7*5=35.00>>35.00 for meat
1 pound of cheese cost $3.00 per sandwich and he had to make 5 so 3*5 = $<<3*5=15.00>>15.00 for cheese
When you add the meat and cheese together, he would spend 35+15 = $<<35+15=50.00>>50.00
