Question:
After scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. How many points did Erin have before?


Reference Answer:
Erin now has three times more points than Sara, which is 3*8= <<3*8=24>>24 more points than Sara.
This means Erin has a total of 8+24 = <<8+24=32>>32 points now.
Before, Erin had 32-14= <<32-14=18>>18 points
