Question ID: 723

Question:
The restaurant has 170 normal chairs and 23 chairs for babies. If 20 of the normal chairs and 13 of the baby chairs were sent to the carpenter for repair, how many chairs does the restaurant have left?


Reference Answer:
Before sending the chairs and baby chairs to the carpenter the restaurant had 170 + 23 = <<170+23=193>>193 chairs.
They sent 20 + 13 = <<20+13=33>>33 chairs to the carpenter.
Now, they have 193 - 33 = <<193-33=160>>160 chairs left.
#### 160
