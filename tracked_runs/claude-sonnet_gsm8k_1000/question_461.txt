Question ID: 775

Question:
Henry needs to assemble some toys, specifically 57 cars and 73 motorcycles. Henry knows that to assemble all the toys he will need 4 wheels for each car and 2 wheels for each motorcycle. How many wheels will be left if he has a box with 650 wheels in it?


Reference Answer:
The total number of wheels needed for all the cars is 57 cars x 4 wheels/car = <<57*4=228>>228 wheels
The total number of wheels needed for all the motorcycles is 73 motorcycles x 2 wheels/motorcycle = <<73*2=146>>146 wheels
Combining the number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles gives a total of 228 wheels + 146 wheels = <<228+146=374>>374 wheels
The number of wheels left in the bag will be 650 wheels â€“ 374 wheels = <<650-374=276>>276 wheels
