Question ID: 274

Question:
It's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season. She has bought 20 packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds to plant. If a packet of tomato seeds costs $40 and a packet of celery seeds costs $30, how much money did she use to buy the seeds?


Reference Answer:
The total amount of money she used to buy the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40/packet = $<<20*40=800>>800
The celery seeds cost her 80 packets * $30/packet = $<<80*30=2400>>2400
For the seeds, Mrs. Rylan paid $2400 + $800 = $<<2400+800=3200>>3200
#### 3200
