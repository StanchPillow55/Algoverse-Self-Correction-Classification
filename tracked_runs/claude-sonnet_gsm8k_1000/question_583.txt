Question:
Jane has saved $4 of her allowance every week for the past 8 weeks. If she continues to save the same amount each week, how many more weeks will it take for her to have saved a total of $60?


Reference Answer:
She has already saved 8 * $4 = $<<8*4=32>>32.
She needs to save an additional $60 - $32 = $<<60-32=28>>28.
It will take her 28 / 4 = <<28/4=7>>7 more weeks to save the rest of the money.
