Question:
Adam has $100 and wants to spend it to open a rock stand. He can buy rocks for $5 each and sell them for $7 each. If he invests all his money in the rock stand but only sells 60% of his inventory, how much money does he lose?


Reference Answer:
He can buy 20 rocks because 100 / 5 = <<100/5=20>>20
He sells 12 of these rocks because 20 x .6 = <<20*.6=12>>12
He makes $84 selling these because 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84
He lost $16 on his business because 100 - 84 = <<100-84=16>>16
#### 16
