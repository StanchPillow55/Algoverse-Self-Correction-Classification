Question:
To have the car for the weekend, Wilson's report card needs to show that he received 80 or higher in his math class.  His math grade is calculated by the average of 5 test scores.  On those tests, he received: 65, 94, 81, 86 and 74.  What is his current math grade?


Reference Answer:
He received 65, 94, 81, 86 and a 74 on his 5 math tests so that's 65+94+81+86+74 = <<400=400>>400
His math grade is calculated by the average test grade on his 5 tests so his math grade is 400/5 = <<400/5=80>>80
#### 80
