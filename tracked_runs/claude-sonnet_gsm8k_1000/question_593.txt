Question:
Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles.  But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%.  If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles, in seconds?


Reference Answer:
If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, which was two seconds faster than Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles, then Gerald initially would run the 400-meter hurdles in 38+2=<<38+2=40>>40 seconds.
10% of 40 seconds is 40*0.1=<<40*0.1=4>>4 seconds.
The improved diet reduced Gerald's race time to 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 seconds.
