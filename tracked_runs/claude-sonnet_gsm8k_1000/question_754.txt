Question:
A real estate agent has spent $5 on each newspaper ad and spent $75 on each television ad. He bought 50 newspaper ads and 15 television ads. How much did the real estate agent spend on buying all the ads?


Reference Answer:
He spent a total of $5 x 50 = $<<5*50=250>>250 for the newspaper ads.
He spent a total of $75 x 15 = $<<75*15=1125>>1125 for the television ads.
Therefore, the real estate agent spent $250 + $1125 = $<<250+1125=1375>>1375 on buying all the ads.
