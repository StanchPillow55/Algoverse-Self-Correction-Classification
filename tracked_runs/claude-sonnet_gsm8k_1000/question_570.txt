Question:
The educational shop is selling notebooks for $1.50 each and a ballpen at $0.5 each.  William bought five notebooks and a ballpen. How much did he spend in all?


Reference Answer:
The cost of the six notebooks was 5 x $1.50 = $7.5.
Therefore, William spent a total of $7.50 + $0.50 = $<<7.5+0.5=8>>8 in all.
