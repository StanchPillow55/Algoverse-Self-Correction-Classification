Question ID: 1210

Question:
To kick off summer, Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends.  They fill up 10 packs of balloons that have 30 balloons per pack.  By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left.  How many balloons did they throw?


Reference Answer:
They started off with 10 packs of balloons that had 30 balloons each for a total of 10*30 = <<10*30=300>>300 balloons
They started with 300 balloons and had 12 left which means they threw 300-12 = <<300-12=288>>288 balloons
#### 288
