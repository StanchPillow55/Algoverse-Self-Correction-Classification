Question:
Martha is planning her Christmas party. She invited 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people. 8 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 that number had previous commitments. How many people show up for Martha's party?


Reference Answer:
First find the total number of people from 6-person families: 2 families * 6 people/family = <<2*6=12>>12 people
Then find the total number of people from 4-person families: 3 families * 4 people/family = <<3*4=12>>12 people
Add those two numbers to find the total number of people Martha invited: 12 people + 12 people = <<12+12=24>>24 people
Then find the number of people who couldn't come because they were sick: 8 people / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 people
Then subtract the people who couldn't come from the total to find the number who showed up: 24 people - 2 people - 8 people = <<24-2-8=14>>14 people
