Question ID: 551

Question:
Carly wants to treat her friends. She orders five hamburgers at $4 each, ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each pack, and five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each can.  How much change does Carly get back if she gives one fifty-dollar bill?


Reference Answer:
The cost of 5 hamburgers is 5 x $4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
The cost of 10 packs of potato fries is 10 x $0.30 = $<<10*0.3=3>>3.
And, the cost of 5 cans of fruit drinks is 5 x $2 = $<<5*2=10>>10.
Thus, the total cost is $20 + $3 + $10 = $<<20+3+10=33>>33.
Therefore, Carly gets a change of $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.

Response:
To determine how much change Carly will receive after making her purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she ordered and then subtract that total from the amount she paid with her fifty-dollar bill.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the hamburgers
Carly orders 5 hamburgers at $4 each. The cost for the hamburgers can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of hamburgers} = \text{Number of hamburgers} \times \text{Price per hamburger} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the potato fries
Carly orders 10 packs of potato fries at $0.30 each. The cost for the fries can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of potato fries} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Price per pack} = 10 \times 0.30 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fruit drinks
Carly orders 5 cans of fruit drinks at $2 each. The cost for the fruit drinks can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of fruit drinks} = \text{Number of cans} \times \text{Price per can} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of all items
Now, we will sum the costs of the hamburgers, potato fries, and fruit drinks to find the total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of hamburgers} + \text{Cost of potato fries} + \text{Cost of fruit drinks}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 20 + 3 + 10 = 33 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the change Carly receives
Carly pays with a fifty-dollar bill. To find out how much change she receives, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid:

\[
\text{Change} = \text{Amount paid} - \text{Total cost} = 50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Carly receives **$17** in change.
