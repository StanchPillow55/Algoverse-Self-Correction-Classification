Response:
To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to break down the distances he ran each day and then sum them up.

1. **Identify the distances run each day:**
   - On **Monday**, Sam ran **3 miles**.
   - On **Tuesday**, Sam ran **5 miles**.
   - On **Wednesday**, Sam ran **3 miles**.
   - On **Thursday**, Sam ran **5 miles**.
   - On **Friday**, Sam ran **3 miles**.
   - On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, we assume Sam did not run, so he ran **0 miles** on those days.

2. **Calculate the total miles for each day:**
   - Monday: 3 miles
   - Tuesday: 5 miles
   - Wednesday: 3 miles
   - Thursday: 5 miles
   - Friday: 3 miles
   - Saturday: 0 miles
   - Sunday: 0 miles

3. **Sum the distances:**
   - Total miles = (Monday miles) + (Tuesday miles) + (Wednesday miles) + (Thursday miles) + (Friday miles) + (Saturday miles) + (Sunday miles)
   - Total miles = 3 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 + 0 + 0

4. **Perform the addition step by step:**
   - First, add the miles for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:
     - 3 + 5 = 8 (for Monday and Tuesday)
     - 8 + 3 = 11 (adding Wednesday)
   - Next, add the miles for Thursday and Friday:
     - 11 + 5 = 16 (adding Thursday)
     - 16 + 3 = 19 (adding Friday)
   - Finally, add the miles for Saturday and Sunday (which are both 0):
     - 19 + 0 = 19
     - 19 + 0 = 19

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - Therefore, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is **19 miles**.

Thus, the final answer is:

**19 miles**
