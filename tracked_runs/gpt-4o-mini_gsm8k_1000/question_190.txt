Question ID: 491

Question:
Jaime places eggs on the tray. Each tray can hold 24 eggs. If he has 64 eggs and 2 trays, how many eggs won't he be able to place on the tray?


Reference Answer:
Jaime will be able to place a total of 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48.
Therefore, there are 64 - 48 = <<64-48=16>>16 eggs that he won't be able to place on the tray.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many eggs Jaime can place on the trays and how many eggs will remain unplaced.

1. **Determine the capacity of the trays**:
   Each tray can hold 24 eggs. Jaime has 2 trays.
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of trays} = \text{Number of trays} \times \text{Capacity of each tray}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of trays} = 2 \times 24 = 48 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of eggs Jaime has**:
   Jaime has a total of 64 eggs.

3. **Calculate how many eggs can be placed on the trays**:
   Since the total capacity of the trays is 48 eggs, Jaime can place 48 eggs on the trays.

4. **Calculate how many eggs will remain unplaced**:
   To find out how many eggs will not fit on the trays, we subtract the number of eggs that can be placed from the total number of eggs Jaime has.
   \[
   \text{Eggs not placed} = \text{Total eggs} - \text{Eggs placed}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Eggs not placed} = 64 - 48 = 16 \text{ eggs}
   \]

Thus, the number of eggs that Jaime won't be able to place on the tray is **16 eggs**.

Final answer: **16 eggs**.
