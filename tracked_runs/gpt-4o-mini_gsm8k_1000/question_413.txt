Question ID: 383

Question:
Millie decides to open a lemonade stand. She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?


Reference Answer:
She has enough supplies to make 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 cups of lemonade.
She sells all of the lemonade for 36 * $1 = $<<36*1=36>>36.
Her total profit for selling the lemonade is $36 - $18 = $<<36-18=18>>18.
It will take Millie 36 / 4 = <<36/4=9>>9 hours of work to sell all of the lemonade.
Her hourly profit is $18 / 9 hours = $<<18/9=2>>2 per hour.

Response:
To determine how much profit Millie makes per hour from her lemonade stand, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make.**
   - Each pitcher holds 12 cups.
   - Millie makes 3 pitchers.
   - Total cups = Number of pitchers × Cups per pitcher
   \[
   \text{Total cups} = 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lemonade.**
   - Millie sells each cup for $1.
   - Total revenue = Total cups × Price per cup
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 36 \text{ cups} \times 1 \text{ dollar/cup} = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of supplies.**
   - Millie spends $18 on supplies.

4. **Calculate the total profit.**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 36 \text{ dollars} - 18 \text{ dollars} = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine how long Millie spends running the lemonade stand.**
   - Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour.
   - To find out how many hours she needs to sell all 36 cups, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Hours} = \frac{\text{Total cups}}{\text{Cups per hour}} = \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Calculate the profit per hour.**
   - Profit per hour = Total profit / Total hours
   \[
   \text{Profit per hour} = \frac{18 \text{ dollars}}{9 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour}
   \]

Finally, Millie's profit per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[
\boxed{2 \text{ dollars/hour}}
\]

   - Millie makes 3 pitchers.
   \[
   \text{Total cups} = 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade.**
   - Millie sells each cup for $1.
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 36 \text{ cups} \times 1 \text{ dollar/cup} = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the total cost of supplies.**
   - Millie spends $18 on supplies.

4. **Calculate the total profit.**
   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs.
   \[
   \text{Total profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 36 \text{ dollars} - 18 \text{ dollars} = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total time spent selling lemonade.**
   - Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour.
   - To find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups:
   \[
   \text{Time (hours)} = \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Calculate the profit per hour.**
   - To find the profit per hour, divide the total profit by the total hours spent.
   \[
   \text{Profit per hour} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Total hours}} = \frac{18 \text{ dollars}}{9 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour}
   \]

Finally, Millie's profit per hour spent running the lemonade stand is:
\[
\boxed{2 \text{ dollars/hour}}
\]
