Question ID: 425

Question:
Lillian's garden doesn't have any bird feeders in it so she wants to add some. She builds 3 and buys 3 others. Each bird feeder seems to attract 20 birds throughout the day until Lillian notices that the birds seem to prefer the feeders she made herself which attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones. How many birds can Lillian expect to see in her garden each day if the same amount keep coming to her bird feeders?


Reference Answer:
Lillian has 3 store-bought + 3 self-made bird feeders = <<3+3=6>>6 bird feeders in all.
Lillian first notices each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, 6 x 20 = <<6*20=120>>120 birds.
Then Lillian notices that her 3 self-made bird feeders attract 10 more birds each, 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 extra birds.
Each day Lillian can expect to see 120 + 30 = <<120+30=150>>150 birds in her garden.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of birds attracted to Lillian's garden by both the bird feeders she built and the ones she bought.

1. **Identify the number of feeders**:
   - Lillian builds 3 bird feeders.
   - Lillian buys 3 bird feeders.
   - Total number of bird feeders = 3 (built) + 3 (bought) = 6 feeders.

2. **Determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder**:
   - Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
   - Each feeder that Lillian built attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Therefore, each built feeder attracts:
     \[
     20 \text{ (birds from store-bought)} + 10 \text{ (additional birds)} = 30 \text{ birds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted to the built feeders**:
   - Since there are 3 built feeders, the total number of birds attracted to these feeders is:
     \[
     3 \text{ (built feeders)} \times 30 \text{ (birds per built feeder)} = 90 \text{ birds}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted to the bought feeders**:
   - Since there are 3 bought feeders, the total number of birds attracted to these feeders is:
     \[
     3 \text{ (bought feeders)} \times 20 \text{ (birds per bought feeder)} = 60 \text{ birds}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted to all feeders**:
   - Now we add the number of birds attracted to the built feeders and the bought feeders:
     \[
     90 \text{ (birds from built feeders)} + 60 \text{ (birds from bought feeders)} = 150 \text{ birds}
     \]

Thus, Lillian can expect to see a total of **150 birds** in her garden each day.

Final answer: **150 birds**.
