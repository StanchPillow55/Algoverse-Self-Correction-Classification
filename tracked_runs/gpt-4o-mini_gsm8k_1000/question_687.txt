Response:
To find out how much Peter paid in total for the popsicles and ice cream bars, we will calculate the cost of each item separately and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the popsicles.**

Peter purchased 20 popsicles at a price of $0.25 each. To find the total cost of the popsicles, we multiply the number of popsicles by the price per popsicle:

\[
\text{Cost of popsicles} = \text{Number of popsicles} \times \text{Price per popsicle}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Cost of popsicles} = 20 \times 0.25
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
20 \times 0.25 = 5.00
\]

So, the total cost for the popsicles is **$5.00**.

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the ice cream bars.**

Peter also purchased 4 ice cream bars at a price of $0.50 each. To find the total cost of the ice cream bars, we again multiply the number of ice cream bars by the price per ice cream bar:

\[
\text{Cost of ice cream bars} = \text{Number of ice cream bars} \times \text{Price per ice cream bar}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Cost of ice cream bars} = 4 \times 0.50
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
4 \times 0.50 = 2.00
\]

So, the total cost for the ice cream bars is **$2.00**.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost.**

Now, we add the total costs of the popsicles and the ice cream bars together to find the total amount Peter paid:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of popsicles} + \text{Cost of ice cream bars}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 5.00 + 2.00
\]

Now, we perform the addition:

\[
5.00 + 2.00 = 7.00
\]

Thus, the total amount Peter paid is **$7.00**.

**Final Answer:**

Peter paid a total of **$7.00**.
