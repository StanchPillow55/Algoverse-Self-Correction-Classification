Question ID: 427

Question:
Kenny is selling his Pokemon cards to buy a ticket to an amusement park, which costs $100. He has a collection of cards and plans to sell them for $1.5 each. He keeps 1/3 of them and gets to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash. How many cards did he start with?


Reference Answer:
He made $150 selling the cards because 100 + 50 = <<100+50=150>>150
He sold 100 cards because 150 / 1.5 = <<150/1.5=100>>100
The cards he sold were 2/3 of his collection because 1 - (1/3) = 2/3
He started with 150 cards because 100 / (2/3) = <<100/(2/3)=150>>150
#### 150

Response:
To determine how many Pokemon cards Kenny started with, we need to set up an equation based on the information provided in the problem.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Kenny wants to buy a ticket to an amusement park that costs $100.
   - He sells his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each.
   - He keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the remaining 2/3.
   - After selling the cards, he has enough money to buy the ticket and also has $50 left for spending cash.

2. **Setting Up the Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of Pokemon cards Kenny started with.

3. **Calculating the Number of Cards Sold**:
   - If Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, then he sells 2/3 of them.
   - The number of cards he sells is:
     \[
     \text{Cards sold} = \frac{2}{3}x
     \]

4. **Calculating the Money Earned from Selling Cards**:
   - Since he sells each card for $1.5, the total money he earns from selling the cards is:
     \[
     \text{Money earned} = \left(\frac{2}{3}x\right) \times 1.5 = \frac{2 \times 1.5}{3}x = \frac{3}{3}x = x
     \]

5. **Total Money Needed**:
   - Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and wants to have $50 left for spending cash, so the total amount of money he needs is:
     \[
     \text{Total needed} = 100 + 50 = 150
     \]

6. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - We know that the money he earns from selling the cards must equal the total amount he needs:
     \[
     x = 150
     \]

7. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - From the equation \( x = 150 \), we find that:
     \[
     x = 150
     \]

8. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the number of Pokemon cards Kenny started with is \( \boxed{150} \).
