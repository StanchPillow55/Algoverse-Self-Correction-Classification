Question ID: 1082

Question:
James decided to walk to the store.  When he got halfway there he realized he forgot something at home and had to walk back.  If his home is 4 miles from the store and he walks 4 miles per hour how long did it take him to reach the store?


Reference Answer:
He walked 4/2=<<4/2=2>>2 miles there before turning around
So in total he walked 2+2+4=<<2+2+4=8>>8 miles, he walked 2 miles to the halfway point than 2 miles home.
That means it took him 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 hours

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to break down James's journey step by step.

1. **Distance to the Store**: 
   James's home is 4 miles from the store.

2. **Halfway Point**: 
   When James gets halfway to the store, he has walked half of 4 miles:
   \[
   \text{Halfway distance} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Walking Back**: 
   After realizing he forgot something, James walks back home from the halfway point. The distance back home is also 2 miles.

4. **Total Distance Walked**: 
   Now, we can calculate the total distance James walked:
   - Distance to halfway point: 2 miles
   - Distance back home: 2 miles
   - Total distance walked = 2 miles + 2 miles = 4 miles

5. **Walking Speed**: 
   James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

6. **Time Calculation**: 
   To find out how long it took him to walk the total distance of 4 miles, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

7. **Final Answer**: 
   The question asks how long it took him to reach the store. Since he did not reach the store (he turned back halfway), we can conclude that he did not spend any time walking to the store itself. However, if we consider the time spent walking to the halfway point and back home, it took him 1 hour in total.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{It took James 1 hour to walk to the halfway point and back home.}
\]
