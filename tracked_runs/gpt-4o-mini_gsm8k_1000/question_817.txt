Question ID: 340

Question:
Josh decides to take up juggling to perform at the school talent show a month in the future.  He starts off practicing juggling 3 balls, and slowly gets better adding 1 ball to his juggling act each week.  After the end of the fourth week the talent show begins, but when Josh walks on stage he slips and drops three of his balls.  2 of them are caught by people in the crowd as they roll off the stage, but one gets lost completely since the auditorium is dark.  With a sigh, Josh starts to juggle on stage with how many balls?


Reference Answer:
Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks for a total of 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7
Josh drops 3 balls when he trips on stage leaving him with 7-3= <<7-3=4>>4 balls
#### 4

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many balls Josh is juggling at the end of the fourth week before the talent show, and then account for the balls he drops during his performance.

1. **Initial Number of Balls**: Josh starts practicing with 3 balls.

2. **Adding Balls Each Week**: Josh adds 1 ball to his juggling act each week. We need to calculate how many balls he has at the end of each week for 4 weeks.

   - **Week 1**: 
     \[
     3 + 1 = 4 \text{ balls}
     \]
   - **Week 2**: 
     \[
     4 + 1 = 5 \text{ balls}
     \]
   - **Week 3**: 
     \[
     5 + 1 = 6 \text{ balls}
     \]
   - **Week 4**: 
     \[
     6 + 1 = 7 \text{ balls}
     \]

   After 4 weeks, Josh is juggling **7 balls**.

3. **Dropping Balls During Performance**: When Josh walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 of his balls.

4. **Balls Caught and Lost**: Out of the 3 balls he drops:
   - 2 balls are caught by people in the crowd.
   - 1 ball is lost completely.

5. **Calculating the Number of Balls Remaining**: To find out how many balls Josh is juggling on stage after the incident, we subtract the number of balls he dropped from the total number of balls he had.

   - Total balls before dropping: 7
   - Balls dropped: 3
   - Balls remaining after dropping: 
     \[
     7 - 3 = 4 \text{ balls}
     \]

Thus, after accounting for the balls he dropped, Josh is left juggling **4 balls** on stage.

**Final Answer**: Josh starts juggling on stage with **4 balls**.

Response:
To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Balls**: Josh starts practicing juggling with 3 balls.

2. **Adding Balls Each Week**: Josh adds 1 ball to his juggling act each week. Since the talent show is in 4 weeks, we can calculate the total number of balls he will be juggling at the end of the fourth week.

   - **Week 1**: 3 balls
   - **Week 2**: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
   - **Week 3**: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
   - **Week 4**: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

   So, at the end of the fourth week, Josh will be juggling **6 balls**.

3. **Incident on Stage**: When Josh walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 of his balls.

4. **Balls Caught and Lost**: Out of the 3 balls he dropped:
   - 2 balls are caught by people in the crowd.
   - 1 ball gets lost completely.

5. **Calculating Remaining Balls**: To find out how many balls Josh is juggling on stage, we subtract the number of balls he dropped from the total number of balls he was juggling.

   - Total balls before the incident: 6
   - Balls dropped: 3
   - Remaining balls after dropping: 6 - 3 = 3 balls

6. **Final Count**: Since 2 of the dropped balls were caught and 1 was lost, the number of balls Josh has left to juggle is:

   - Remaining balls after catching and losing: 3 balls (as calculated above)

Thus, Josh starts to juggle on stage with **3 balls**.

**Final Answer**: 3 balls.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Practice**: Josh starts practicing juggling with 3 balls.

2. **Weekly Progression**: Each week, he adds 1 ball to his juggling routine. We need to determine how many balls he is juggling at the end of each week:
   - **Week 1**: 3 balls
   - **Week 2**: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
   - **Week 3**: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
   - **Week 4**: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

   At the end of the fourth week, Josh is juggling **6 balls**.

3. **Incident on Stage**: When Josh walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 of his balls. 

4. **Recovery of Balls**: Out of the 3 balls he dropped:
   - 2 balls are caught by people in the crowd.
   - 1 ball is lost completely.

5. **Calculating Remaining Balls**: 
   - Initially, he had 6 balls.
   - After dropping 3 balls, he has: 
     \[
     6 - 3 = 3 \text{ balls}
     \]
   - Since 2 of the dropped balls are caught, they are not lost to him. Therefore, he still has:
     \[
     3 \text{ balls (remaining)} + 2 \text{ balls (caught)} = 5 \text{ balls}
     \]
   - However, since he lost 1 ball completely, we need to subtract that from the total:
     \[
     5 - 1 = 4 \text{ balls}
     \]

6. **Final Count**: Thus, when Josh starts juggling on stage, he has **4 balls**.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
