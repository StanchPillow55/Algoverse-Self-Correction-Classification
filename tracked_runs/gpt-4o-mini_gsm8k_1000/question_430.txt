Question ID: 798

Question:
When Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.  After 2 months, he was given a raise of $0.50 per hour.  On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was.  If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?


Reference Answer:
Billy has a salary of $10+0.50+$1.00=$<<10+0.5+1=11.50>>11.50 per hour.
Sally is paid $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, for a total of $10+$0.50=$<<10+0.5=10.50>>10.50 per hour.
If Billy works 20 hours, he will be paid 20*$11.50=$<<20*11.5=230>>230
If Sally works 20 hours, she will be paid 20*$10.50=$<<20*10.50=210>>210.
Thus, if both work 20 hours, Billy will be paid $230-$210=$20 more.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will first calculate Billy's hourly wage at different points in time, then determine Sally's hourly wage, and finally calculate how much more money Billy earns than Sally when both work 20 hours.

1. **Billy's Initial Hourly Wage:**
   - When Billy was first hired, his hourly wage was $10.00.

2. **Billy's Wage After 2 Months:**
   - After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour.
   - New hourly wage = Initial wage + Raise
   - New hourly wage = $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50.

3. **Billy's Wage After 1 Year:**
   - On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour.
   - New hourly wage = Previous wage + Raise
   - New hourly wage = $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

4. **Sally's Starting Salary:**
   - Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary.
   - Sally's starting salary = Billy's starting salary + $0.50
   - Sally's starting salary = $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50.

5. **Calculating Earnings for Both:**
   - Both Billy and Sally work 20 hours.
   - **Billy's Earnings:**
     - Billy's hourly wage after 1 year is $11.50.
     - Earnings = Hourly wage × Hours worked
     - Billy's earnings = $11.50 × 20 = $230.00.
   
   - **Sally's Earnings:**
     - Sally's hourly wage is $10.50.
     - Earnings = Hourly wage × Hours worked
     - Sally's earnings = $10.50 × 20 = $210.00.

6. **Difference in Earnings:**
   - To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings.
   - Difference = Billy's earnings - Sally's earnings
   - Difference = $230.00 - $210.00 = $20.00.

Thus, the final answer is that Billy earns **$20.00** more than Sally.
