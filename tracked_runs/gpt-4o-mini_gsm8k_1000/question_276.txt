Question ID: 219

Question:
Four students scored a total of 251 points in a board game. Naomi scored 68 of the points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi and Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. How many points did Jojo score?


Reference Answer:
Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 1/2 (68) + 10 = 44 points
Brianna scored 68 + 17 = <<68+17=85>>85 points
Naomi, Yuri + Brianna scored = 68 + 44 + 85 = <<68+44+85=197>>197 points
Jojo scored the rest 251 - 197 = <<251-197=54>>54 points
Jojo scored 54 points.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will first define the points scored by each student based on the information given.

1. **Identify the points scored by Naomi**:
   - Naomi scored \( N = 68 \) points.

2. **Calculate the points scored by Yuri**:
   - According to the problem, Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
   - Half of Naomi's score is \( \frac{N}{2} = \frac{68}{2} = 34 \).
   - Therefore, Yuri's score \( Y \) can be calculated as:
   \[
   Y = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]

3. **Calculate the points scored by Brianna**:
   - Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
   - Therefore, Brianna's score \( B \) is:
   \[
   B = N + 17 = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

4. **Calculate the total points scored by all students**:
   - The total points scored by all four students is given as 251 points.
   - We can express this as:
   \[
   N + Y + B + J = 251
   \]
   where \( J \) is the score of Jojo.

5. **Substituting the known values into the equation**:
   - We substitute \( N \), \( Y \), and \( B \) into the equation:
   \[
   68 + 44 + 85 + J = 251
   \]

6. **Calculate the sum of the known scores**:
   - First, we add \( 68 + 44 + 85 \):
   \[
   68 + 44 = 112
   \]
   \[
   112 + 85 = 197
   \]

7. **Substituting back into the equation**:
   - Now we have:
   \[
   197 + J = 251
   \]

8. **Solve for Jojo's score**:
   - To find \( J \), we subtract 197 from both sides:
   \[
   J = 251 - 197 = 54
   \]

Thus, Jojo scored \( \boxed{54} \) points.
