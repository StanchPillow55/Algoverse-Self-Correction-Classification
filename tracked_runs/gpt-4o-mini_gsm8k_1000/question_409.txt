Question ID: 106

Question:
John has 3 boxes.  Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.  The walls are 1 inch thick.  What is the total inner volume of all 3 boxes?


Reference Answer:
The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension
So each box has 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 inch width
It also has a 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 inch height
Finally, it has a 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 inch depth
So the inner volume of one box is 4*3*2=<<4*3*2=24>>24 cubic inches
So in total the inner volume of the 3 boxes is 3*24=<<3*24=72>>72 cubic inches
#### 72

Response:
To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box, taking into account the thickness of the walls.

### Step 1: Determine the outer dimensions of one box
The outer dimensions of each box are given as:
- Length = 5 inches
- Width = 6 inches
- Height = 4 inches

### Step 2: Calculate the inner dimensions
Since the walls of the box are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract twice the wall thickness from each dimension to find the inner dimensions. This is because the thickness affects both sides of each dimension.

- **Inner Length**:
  \[
  \text{Inner Length} = \text{Outer Length} - 2 \times \text{Wall Thickness} = 5 - 2 \times 1 = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ inches}
  \]

- **Inner Width**:
  \[
  \text{Inner Width} = \text{Outer Width} - 2 \times \text{Wall Thickness} = 6 - 2 \times 1 = 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ inches}
  \]

- **Inner Height**:
  \[
  \text{Inner Height} = \text{Outer Height} - 2 \times \text{Wall Thickness} = 4 - 2 \times 1 = 4 - 2 = 2 \text{ inches}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the inner volume of one box
The inner volume \( V \) of one box can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
\[
V = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height}
\]
Substituting the inner dimensions:
\[
V = 3 \text{ inches} \times 4 \text{ inches} \times 2 \text{ inches}
\]
Calculating this:
\[
V = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ square inches}
\]
\[
V = 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total inner volume for all 3 boxes
Since there are 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
\[
\text{Total Inner Volume} = 3 \times 24 \text{ cubic inches} = 72 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

### Final Answer
The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[
\boxed{72} \text{ cubic inches}
\]
