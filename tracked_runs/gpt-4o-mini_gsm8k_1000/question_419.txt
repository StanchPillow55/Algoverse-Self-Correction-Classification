Question ID: 10

Question:
A new program had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, but then reduced by 30% in the third month. How many downloads did the program have total over the three months?


Reference Answer:
The number of downloads of the program in the second month increased to 3*60 = <<3*60=180>>180
In the first two months, the total number of downloads of the program was 180+60 = <<180+60=240>>240
In the third month, the number of downloads of the program reduced by 30/100*180 = <<30/100*180=54>>54
There were 180-54 = <<180-54=126>>126 downloads in the third month.
In the three months, the total number of downloads of the program was 126+240 = <<126+240=366>>366

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down into three parts: calculating the downloads for each month and then summing them up.

1. **Downloads in the First Month:**
   The problem states that there were 60 downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in Month 1} = 60
   \]

2. **Downloads in the Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Downloads in Month 2} = 3 \times \text{Downloads in Month 1} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Downloads in the Third Month:**
   The downloads in the third month are reduced by 30% from the second month's downloads. First, we need to find 30% of the second month's downloads:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of Month 2} = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   Now, we subtract this reduction from the second month's downloads to find the total downloads in the third month:
   \[
   \text{Downloads in Month 3} = \text{Downloads in Month 2} - 30\% \text{ of Month 2} = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   Now, we sum the downloads from all three months:
   \[
   \text{Total Downloads} = \text{Downloads in Month 1} + \text{Downloads in Month 2} + \text{Downloads in Month 3}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total Downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126
   \]
   Now, we perform the addition:
   \[
   60 + 180 = 240
   \]
   \[
   240 + 126 = 366
   \]

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[
\boxed{366}
\]
