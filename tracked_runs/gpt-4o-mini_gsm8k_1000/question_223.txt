Question ID: 1053

Question:
Alison qualified for a spot on the running team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a tank top for $10, a pair of running shorts for $5 more than the top cost, and a pair of tennis shoes that were originally $48 but were on sale for half price. She had a coupon for $2 off the package of $8 athletic socks that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?


Reference Answer:
The shorts were $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $5 + $10 = $<<5+10=15>>15.
Her tennis shoes were half the original $68 price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
With her coupon, the socks were $8 - $2 = $<<8-2=6>>6.
The shirt, shorts, shoes, and socks together cost $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $<<10+15+24+6=55>>55.

Response:
To determine how much Alison spent on athletic gear, we will break down the costs of each item she purchased step by step.

1. **Cost of the tank top**: 
   - Alison bought a tank top for $10.
   - Cost of tank top = $10.

2. **Cost of the running shorts**: 
   - The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top.
   - Cost of running shorts = Cost of tank top + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15.

3. **Cost of the tennis shoes**: 
   - The original price of the tennis shoes is $48, but they are on sale for half price.
   - Sale price of tennis shoes = Original price / 2 = $48 / 2 = $24.

4. **Cost of the athletic socks**: 
   - The package of athletic socks costs $8, and Alison has a coupon for $2 off.
   - Cost of athletic socks after coupon = Original price - Coupon = $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, we will sum up all the costs to find the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear:

- Total cost = Cost of tank top + Cost of running shorts + Cost of tennis shoes + Cost of athletic socks
- Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6

Now, let's calculate the total:

\[
10 + 15 = 25
\]
\[
25 + 24 = 49
\]
\[
49 + 6 = 55
\]

Thus, the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is **$55**.

**Final Answer**: Alison spent $55 on athletic gear.
