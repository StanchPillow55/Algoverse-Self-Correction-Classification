Question ID: 342

Question:
Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits that her child no longer needed.  At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits.  Then, Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.  How many outfits does she have for her baby?


Reference Answer:
Her friend gave her 24 outfits and she received twice as many at the baby shower so she received 2*24 = 48 baby outfits
Her friend gave her 24 outfits, she received 48 at the baby shower and her mom gave her another 15 for a total of 24+48+15 = <<24+48+15=87>>87 baby outfits

Response:
To find out how many baby outfits Laurel has in total, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Outfits from her friend**: Laurel received 24 baby outfits from her friend.
   \[
   \text{Outfits from friend} = 24
   \]

2. **Outfits from her baby shower**: Laurel received twice the amount of outfits from her friend at her baby shower. To find out how many outfits she received at the baby shower, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Outfits from baby shower} = 2 \times \text{Outfits from friend} = 2 \times 24 = 48
   \]

3. **Outfits from her mom**: Laurel's mom gifted her an additional 15 baby outfits.
   \[
   \text{Outfits from mom} = 15
   \]

4. **Total outfits**: Now, we will add all the outfits together to find the total number of outfits Laurel has:
   \[
   \text{Total outfits} = \text{Outfits from friend} + \text{Outfits from baby shower} + \text{Outfits from mom}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total outfits} = 24 + 48 + 15
   \]

5. **Performing the addition**:
   - First, add the outfits from the friend and the baby shower:
     \[
     24 + 48 = 72
     \]
   - Next, add the outfits from her mom:
     \[
     72 + 15 = 87
     \]

Thus, the total number of baby outfits Laurel has is:
\[
\text{Total outfits} = 87
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{87}
\]
