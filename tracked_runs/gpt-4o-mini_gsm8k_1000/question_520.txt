Question ID: 557

Question:
A bag of buttons had 21 buttons in it. Seven buttons had two holes and the rest had four holes. How many holes were in all the buttons in the bag?


Reference Answer:
There were 21 - 7 = <<21-7=14>>14 buttons with four holes.
The four-holed buttons had 14 * 4 = <<14*4=56>>56 holes.
The two-holed buttons had 7 * 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 holes.
Thus, there were 56 + 14 = <<56+14=70>>70 holes in all the buttons in the bag.
#### 70

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag.

1. **Identify the total number of buttons**: 
   The problem states that there are 21 buttons in total.

2. **Determine the number of buttons with two holes**: 
   We know that 7 buttons have two holes.

3. **Calculate the number of buttons with four holes**: 
   To find out how many buttons have four holes, we subtract the number of buttons with two holes from the total number of buttons:
   \[
   \text{Number of buttons with four holes} = \text{Total buttons} - \text{Buttons with two holes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of buttons with four holes} = 21 - 7 = 14
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with two holes**: 
   Each of the 7 buttons with two holes contributes 2 holes. Therefore, the total number of holes from these buttons is:
   \[
   \text{Holes from buttons with two holes} = 7 \times 2 = 14
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with four holes**: 
   Each of the 14 buttons with four holes contributes 4 holes. Therefore, the total number of holes from these buttons is:
   \[
   \text{Holes from buttons with four holes} = 14 \times 4 = 56
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of holes in all buttons**: 
   Now, we add the total number of holes from both types of buttons:
   \[
   \text{Total holes} = \text{Holes from buttons with two holes} + \text{Holes from buttons with four holes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total holes} = 14 + 56 = 70
   \]

Thus, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is \( \boxed{70} \).
