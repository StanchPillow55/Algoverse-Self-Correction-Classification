Question ID: 1286

Question:
James likes to check the coin return of the vending machine for change. One day he finds a quarter, two nickels, and 7 dimes. How much money in cents does James have?


Reference Answer:
First figure out how much the nickels are worth: 2 * 5 cents = <<2*5=10>>10 cents
Then figure out how much the dimes are worth: 7 * 10 cents = <<7*10=70>>70 cents
Finally, add the value of the nickels, dimes and quarter: 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = <<25+10+70=105>>105 cents
#### 105

Response:
To determine how much money James has, we need to calculate the total value of the coins he found: one quarter, two nickels, and seven dimes. We'll calculate the value of each type of coin separately and then sum them up.

1. **Value of the quarter**:
   - A quarter is worth 25 cents.
   - Since James found 1 quarter, its total value is:
     \[
     1 \text{ quarter} \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 25 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Value of the nickels**:
   - A nickel is worth 5 cents.
   - Since James found 2 nickels, their total value is:
     \[
     2 \text{ nickels} \times 5 \text{ cents/nickel} = 10 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Value of the dimes**:
   - A dime is worth 10 cents.
   - Since James found 7 dimes, their total value is:
     \[
     7 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 70 \text{ cents}
     \]

4. **Total value of all coins**:
   - Now we add the values of the quarter, nickels, and dimes together:
     \[
     25 \text{ cents (quarter)} + 10 \text{ cents (nickels)} + 70 \text{ cents (dimes)} = 105 \text{ cents}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money that James has is **105 cents**.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{105}
\]
