Question ID: 307

Question:
Sandy wants to lose as much weight as Joey does but needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. If Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, how many weeks will it take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight?


Reference Answer:
Joey loses 8 pounds / 4 weeks = <<8/4=2>>2 pounds per week.
In order to match Joey, Sandy should lose 2 pounds / 4 = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 of a pound per week.
To find the number of weeks it will take, divide the number of pounds by the rate of weight loss: 8 pounds / 0.5 pounds/week = <<8/0.5=16>>16 weeks
#### 16

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week and then find out how long it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

1. **Determine Joey's weekly weight loss:**
   Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight he loses in one week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

   \[
   \text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

2. **Determine how much weight Sandy wants to lose:**
   Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks, which is 8 pounds.

3. **Determine Sandy's weight loss rate:**
   According to the problem, Sandy takes 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will take 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

4. **Calculate Sandy's weight loss rate:**
   To find out how much weight Sandy loses per week, we divide the total weight she loses (2 pounds) by the number of weeks it takes her (4 weeks):

   \[
   \text{Sandy's weekly weight loss} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

5. **Determine how long it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds:**
   Now we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds at her rate of 0.5 pounds per week. We can use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total weight to lose}}{\text{Weekly weight loss}}
   \]

   Substituting in the values:

   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds/week}} = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Thus, it will take Sandy **16 weeks** to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

**Final Answer: 16 weeks**
