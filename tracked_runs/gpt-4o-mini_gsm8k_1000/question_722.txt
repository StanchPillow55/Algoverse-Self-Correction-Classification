Question ID: 1317

Question:
Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. They have a total of 70 legs, all together. How many of the animals are chickens?


Reference Answer:
Let C be the number of chickens.
There are 20-C cows.
The cows have 4*(20-C) legs.
The cows have 2C legs.
The total number of legs is 2C+4(20-C)=70.
2C+80-4C=70
2C=10
C=<<5=5>>5

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( c \) = number of chickens
- \( w \) = number of cows

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of animals (chickens and cows) is 20:
   \[
   c + w = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each:
   \[
   2c + 4w = 70
   \]

Now we have a system of equations:
1. \( c + w = 20 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( 2c + 4w = 70 \)  (Equation 2)

### Step 1: Simplify Equation 2
We can simplify Equation 2 by dividing all terms by 2:
\[
c + 2w = 35
\]
Now we have a new system of equations:
1. \( c + w = 20 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( c + 2w = 35 \)  (Simplified Equation 2)

### Step 2: Solve the System of Equations
We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution. From Equation 1, we can express \( c \) in terms of \( w \):
\[
c = 20 - w
\]

Now, substitute \( c \) into the simplified Equation 2:
\[
(20 - w) + 2w = 35
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( w \)
Combine like terms:
\[
20 - w + 2w = 35
\]
\[
20 + w = 35
\]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
w = 35 - 20
\]
\[
w = 15
\]

### Step 4: Find \( c \)
Now that we have \( w \), we can find \( c \) using Equation 1:
\[
c + 15 = 20
\]
Subtract 15 from both sides:
\[
c = 20 - 15
\]
\[
c = 5
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
