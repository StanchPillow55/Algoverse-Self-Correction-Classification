Question:
Alfie, the albatross, flies 400 kilometers every day.  If the circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers, how many days will it take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth?


Reference Answer:
Half of 40,000 kilometers is 40,000/2=<<40000/2=20000>>20,000 kilometers.
At 400 kilometers per day, it will take Alfie 20,000/400=50 days to fly a distance equal to half the earth's circumference.
#### 50

Response:
To determine how many days it will take Alfie the albatross to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Half the Circumference of the Earth:**
   The circumference of the Earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. To find half of this distance, we divide by 2:

   \[
   \text{Half the circumference} = \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Determine Alfie's Daily Flight Distance:**
   Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day.

3. **Calculate the Number of Days Required:**
   To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance he needs to fly by the distance he flies each day:

   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Daily distance}} = \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{20,000}{400} = 50
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   It will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]
