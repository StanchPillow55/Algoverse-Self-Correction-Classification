Question ID: 409

Question:
Carolyn works for a delivery service company that hires on a contract basis. In May, they hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months.


Reference Answer:
When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000
In the two months, the company paid a total of $72000+$96000 = $<<72000+96000=168000>>168000

Response:
To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May

1. **Number of employees hired in May**: 40
2. **Hourly wage per employee**: $15
3. **Hours worked per week**: 40

First, we calculate the weekly payment for one employee:
\[
\text{Weekly payment per employee} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked} = 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours} = 600 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total payment for all employees in May:
\[
\text{Total payment for May} = \text{Weekly payment per employee} \times \text{Number of employees} = 600 \, \text{dollars} \times 40 = 24000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. We need to determine how many employees are still working in June.

1. **Number of employees whose contracts expired**:
\[
\text{Employees expired} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \, \text{employees}
\]

2. **Number of employees remaining in June**:
\[
\text{Remaining employees} = 40 - 10 = 30 \, \text{employees}
\]

Now, we calculate the total payment for the remaining employees in June:
\[
\text{Total payment for June} = \text{Weekly payment per employee} \times \text{Remaining employees} = 600 \, \text{dollars} \times 30 = 18000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total payment for both months

Finally, we add the total payments for May and June:
\[
\text{Total payment for both months} = \text{Total payment for May} + \text{Total payment for June} = 24000 \, \text{dollars} + 18000 \, \text{dollars} = 42000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[
\boxed{42000 \, \text{dollars}}
\]

\[

**Total payment for all employees in May**:

\]
\[
\text{Total payment for all employees} = 600 \, \text{dollars} \times 40 = 24000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June

1. **Contracts expired**: 1/4 of the employees
2. **Number of employees whose contracts expired**:
\[
\text{Employees with expired contracts} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]
3. **Remaining employees**:
\[
\text{Remaining employees} = 40 - 10 = 30
\]

**Total payment for remaining employees in June**:
\[
\text{Total payment for remaining employees} = \text{Total payment for one employee} \times \text{Remaining employees}
\]
\[
\text{Total payment for remaining employees} = 600 \, \text{dollars} \times 30 = 18000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total payment for both months

**Total payment for both months**:
\[
\text{Total payment for both months} = \text{Total payment for May} + \text{Total payment for June}
\]
\[
\text{Total payment for both months} = 24000 \, \text{dollars} + 18000 \, \text{dollars} = 42000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June is **$42,000**.

\]
\[

\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. We need to determine how many employees continued to work in June.

1. **Number of employees whose contracts expired**:
\[
\text{Number of employees expired} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

2. **Number of employees remaining**:
\[
\text{Number of employees remaining} = 40 - 10 = 30
\]

Now, we calculate the total payment for the remaining employees in June:
\[
\text{Total payment for June} = \text{Weekly payment per employee} \times \text{Number of remaining employees}
\]
\[
\text{Total payment for June} = 600 \, \text{dollars} \times 30 = 18000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total payment for both months

Now, we add the total payments for May and June to find the overall total:
\[
\text{Total payment for both months} = \text{Total payment for May} + \text{Total payment for June}
\]
\[
\text{Total payment for both months} = 24000 \, \text{dollars} + 18000 \, \text{dollars} = 42000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is **$42,000**.
