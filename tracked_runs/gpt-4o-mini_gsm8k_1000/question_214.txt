Question ID: 677

Question:
Carol and Jennifer are sisters from Los Angeles who love collecting signatures from celebrities. During their summer break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After five weeks, Carol and Jennifer compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Carol has 20 signatures in her book, and Jennifer has 44. The sisters have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they decide they want to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?


Reference Answer:
Carol and Jennifer have already collected 20 + 44 signatures = <<20+44=64>>64 signatures.
Since their goal is 100, they need to collect 100 - 64 signatures. 100 - 64 = <<100-64=36>>36 signatures
#### 36

Response:
To find out how many signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have**:
   - Carol has 20 signatures.
   - Jennifer has 44 signatures.
   - To find the total signatures they currently have, we add these two amounts together:
     \[
     \text{Total signatures} = \text{Carol's signatures} + \text{Jennifer's signatures} = 20 + 44 = 64
     \]

2. **Determine the target number of signatures**:
   - The sisters want to reach a total of 100 signatures.

3. **Calculate how many more signatures they need**:
   - To find out how many more signatures they need to collect, we subtract the total signatures they currently have from their target:
     \[
     \text{Signatures needed} = \text{Target signatures} - \text{Total signatures} = 100 - 64 = 36
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Carol and Jennifer need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]
