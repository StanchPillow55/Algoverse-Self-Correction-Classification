Question ID: 1306

Question:
Dr. Hugo Grumpus and his assistant, Igor, were preparing to perform a laboratory experiment.  Dr. Grumpus told Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes, and to place them all on the lab bench.  By accident, Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, two more than the number of Petri dishes requested.  And while he had picked up the correct number of beakers, he lost several on the way to the lab bench.  In total, the number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.  How many beakers did Igor lose?


Reference Answer:
On the lab bench, there were half of the requested number of test tubes, or 16/2=<<16/2=8>>8 test tubes.
On the lab bench, there were 14+2=<<14+2=16>>16 Petri dishes.
Since the remaining items on the bench were beakers, there were 29-8-16=<<29-8-16=5>>5 beakers on the lab bench.
Thus, Igor lost 7-5=<<7-5=2>>2 beakers.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many beakers Igor lost. Let's break down the information given step by step.

1. **Items Requested by Dr. Grumpus:**
   - Test tubes: 16
   - Beakers: 7
   - Petri dishes: 14

2. **Items Gathered by Igor:**
   - Test tubes: Igor gathered half of what was requested, so:
     \[
     \text{Test tubes gathered} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
     \]
   - Petri dishes: Igor gathered two more than the number requested, so:
     \[
     \text{Petri dishes gathered} = 14 + 2 = 16
     \]
   - Beakers: Igor gathered the correct number, which is 7.

3. **Total Items Gathered by Igor:**
   Now we can calculate the total number of items Igor gathered before losing any beakers:
   \[
   \text{Total items gathered} = \text{Test tubes} + \text{Beakers} + \text{Petri dishes}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total items gathered} = 8 + 7 + 16 = 31
   \]

4. **Total Items on the Lab Bench:**
   We know from the problem that the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29. This means that some beakers were lost. Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor lost.

5. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   Since Igor started with 7 beakers and lost \( x \) of them, the number of beakers he actually placed on the lab bench is:
   \[
   7 - x
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of items on the lab bench can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total on lab bench} = \text{Test tubes} + (\text{Beakers} - x) + \text{Petri dishes}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   29 = 8 + (7 - x) + 16
   \]

6. **Simplifying the Equation:**
   Now we simplify the equation:
   \[
   29 = 8 + 7 - x + 16
   \]
   \[
   29 = 31 - x
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \):**
   To find \( x \), we rearrange the equation:
   \[
   x = 31 - 29
   \]
   \[
   x = 2
   \]

Thus, Igor lost **2 beakers**.

**Final Answer:**
Igor lost 2 beakers.
