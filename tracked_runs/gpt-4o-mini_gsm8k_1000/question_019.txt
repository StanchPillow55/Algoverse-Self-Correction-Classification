Question ID: 1172

Question:
Alice likes to count the puffs of clouds in the sky while she eats her lunch outside at school. On Monday she counts just 3 puffs of clouds. Each day after that through Friday, though, she sees double the number of clouds in the sky as the day before. At the end of the week, how many clouds will she have counted in the sky at lunch across all five days?


Reference Answer:
On Monday Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds in the sky, and double that on Tuesday, 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 puffs of clouds.
On Wednesday she sees twice that amount, 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 puffs of clouds.
On Thursday she sees twice that amount, 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 puffs of clouds.
On Friday she sees twice the amount of the day before, 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 puffs of clouds.
In total, across all five days, she sees 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = <<3+6+12+24+48=93>>93 total cloud puffs.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day from Monday to Friday, given that she starts with 3 puffs on Monday and sees double the number of clouds each subsequent day.

Let's break it down day by day:

1. **Monday**: 
   - Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
   - Total for Monday = 3

2. **Tuesday**: 
   - She sees double the number of clouds from Monday.
   - Number of clouds on Tuesday = 2 * 3 = 6
   - Total for Tuesday = 6

3. **Wednesday**: 
   - She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday.
   - Number of clouds on Wednesday = 2 * 6 = 12
   - Total for Wednesday = 12

4. **Thursday**: 
   - She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday.
   - Number of clouds on Thursday = 2 * 12 = 24
   - Total for Thursday = 24

5. **Friday**: 
   - She sees double the number of clouds from Thursday.
   - Number of clouds on Friday = 2 * 24 = 48
   - Total for Friday = 48

Now, we will sum the total number of clouds counted over the five days:

\[
\text{Total clouds} = \text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} + \text{Thursday} + \text{Friday}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total clouds} = 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Now, let's perform the addition step by step:

- First, add Monday and Tuesday:
  \[
  3 + 6 = 9
  \]

- Next, add Wednesday:
  \[
  9 + 12 = 21
  \]

- Then, add Thursday:
  \[
  21 + 24 = 45
  \]

- Finally, add Friday:
  \[
  45 + 48 = 93
  \]

Thus, the total number of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is:

\[
\boxed{93}
\]
