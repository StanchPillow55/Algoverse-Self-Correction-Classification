Question ID: 381

Question:
Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour and stopped after 5 hours. How many kilometers farther did Cho hike?


Reference Answer:
Cho = 14 * 8 = <<14*8=112>>112 km
Chloe = 9 * 5 = <<9*5=45>>45 km
112 - 45 = <<112-45=67>>67 km
Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.
#### 67

Response:
To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference between those distances.

### Step 1: Calculate Cho's Distance
Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. We can use the formula for distance:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

For Cho:

\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \times 8 = 112 \, \text{km}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Chloe's Distance
Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. Using the same distance formula:

\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \times 5 = 45 \, \text{km}
\]

### Step 3: Find the Difference in Distances
Now, we need to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe. We do this by subtracting Chloe's distance from Cho's distance:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}}
\]

Substituting the distances we calculated:

\[
\text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km}
\]

Calculating the difference:

\[
\text{Difference} = 112 - 45 = 67 \, \text{km}
\]

### Final Answer
Cho hiked **67 kilometers farther** than Chloe.
