Question ID: 471

Question:
There are 30 students in Marissaâ€™s class. Each student started the year with 10 pencils. After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils in class were used. At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. How many pencils were left?


Reference Answer:
There were 30 x 10 = <<30*10=300>>300 pencils in the class at the start of the year.
After two months, 300 x 1/5 = <<300*1/5=60>>60 pencils were used.
Thus, 300 - 60 = <<300-60=240>>240 pencils were left unused after two months.
Therefore, 240 x 1/3 = <<240*1/3=80>>80 pencils were left at the end of the year.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year.**
2. **Determine how many pencils were used after two months.**
3. **Calculate the number of pencils remaining after two months.**
4. **Find out how many pencils were left at the end of the year.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year.

Each of the 30 students started with 10 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils at the beginning is:

\[
\text{Total pencils} = \text{Number of students} \times \text{Pencils per student} = 30 \times 10 = 300
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many pencils were used after two months.

According to the problem, \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the total pencils were used after two months. We calculate this as follows:

\[
\text{Pencils used} = \frac{1}{5} \times \text{Total pencils} = \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of pencils remaining after two months.

To find the number of pencils remaining after two months, we subtract the number of pencils used from the total number of pencils:

\[
\text{Pencils remaining} = \text{Total pencils} - \text{Pencils used} = 300 - 60 = 240
\]

### Step 4: Find out how many pencils were left at the end of the year.

At the end of the year, only \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining pencils were left. We calculate this as follows:

\[
\text{Pencils left at the end of the year} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Pencils remaining} = \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:

\[
\boxed{80}
\]
