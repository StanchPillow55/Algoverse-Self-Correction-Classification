Question:
Mark is a copy-editor. He edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Mark edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?


Reference Answer:
Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences for each of them.
From Publisher A, he earns 5 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<5*500=2500>>2500 cents.
Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.
Thus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.
Thus, he earns 2500 + 5000 = <<2500+5000=7500>>7500 cents in total.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of sentences edited for each publisher**:
   Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, and he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers. Therefore, the number of sentences he edits for each publisher is:
   \[
   \text{Sentences per publisher} = \frac{\text{Total sentences}}{2} = \frac{1000}{2} = 500
   \]

2. **Determine the payment rate for Publisher A**:
   According to the problem, Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.

3. **Calculate the total earnings from Publisher A**:
   To find out how much Mark earns from Publisher A, we multiply the number of sentences he edits for Publisher A by the payment rate:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Publisher A} = \text{Sentences edited for A} \times \text{Rate per sentence for A}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Publisher A} = 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Determine the payment rate for Publisher B**:
   The problem states that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays:
   \[
   \text{Rate per sentence for B} = 2 \times \text{Rate per sentence for A} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total earnings from Publisher B**:
   Similarly, we calculate how much Mark earns from Publisher B:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Publisher B} = \text{Sentences edited for B} \times \text{Rate per sentence for B}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Publisher B} = 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total earnings for the week**:
   Finally, we add the earnings from both publishers to find Mark's total earnings for the week:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from Publisher A} + \text{Earnings from Publisher B}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents}
   \]

Thus, Mark makes a total of **7500 cents** in a week.

**Final Answer**: 7500 cents

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Mark earns in a week from both publishers.

1. **Identify the payment rates**:
   - Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.
   - Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Therefore, the payment from Publisher B is:
     \[
     \text{Payment from Publisher B} = 2 \times \text{Payment from Publisher A} = 2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of sentences edited**:
   - Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
   - Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we divide the total sentences by 2:
     \[
     \text{Sentences for Publisher A} = \text{Sentences for Publisher B} = \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences}
     \]

3. **Calculate earnings from each publisher**:
   - **Earnings from Publisher A**:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from Publisher A} = \text{Number of sentences} \times \text{Payment per sentence} = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
     \]
   - **Earnings from Publisher B**:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from Publisher B} = \text{Number of sentences} \times \text{Payment per sentence} = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}
     \]

4. **Calculate total earnings**:
   - To find Mark's total earnings for the week, we add the earnings from both publishers:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from Publisher A} + \text{Earnings from Publisher B} = 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents}
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Mark makes a total of **7500 cents** in a week.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7500}
\]
