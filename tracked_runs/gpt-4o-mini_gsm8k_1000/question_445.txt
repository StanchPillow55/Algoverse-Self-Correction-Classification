Question:
Tyler wants to buy a dictionary that costs $18, a dinosaur book that costs $13, and a children's cookbook that costs $8. He has saved $14 from his allowance. If Tyler earns $5 per hour, how many hours does he have to work to afford his books?


Reference Answer:
Tyler wants to purchase books that cost $18 + $13 + $8 = $<<18+13+8=39>>39.
Tyler needs $39 and currently has $14, so he needs to earn $39 - $14 = $<<39-14=25>>25.
Tyler can earn $25 at a rate of $5 per hour by doing 25 / $5 = <<25/5=5>>5 hours of work.

Response:
To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books he wants to buy, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the books.**
   - The cost of the dictionary is $18.
   - The cost of the dinosaur book is $13.
   - The cost of the children's cookbook is $8.

   We will add these amounts together to find the total cost:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 18 + 13 + 8
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   18 + 13 = 31
   \]
   \[
   31 + 8 = 39
   \]

   Therefore, the total cost of the books is **$39**.

2. **Determine how much money Tyler currently has.**
   - Tyler has saved $14 from his allowance.

3. **Calculate how much more money Tyler needs.**
   To find out how much more money Tyler needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost of the books:

   \[
   \text{Additional money needed} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Amount saved}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Additional money needed} = 39 - 14
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   39 - 14 = 25
   \]

   Therefore, Tyler needs an additional **$25**.

4. **Determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn the additional money.**
   Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the additional money needed by his hourly wage:

   \[
   \text{Hours needed} = \frac{\text{Additional money needed}}{\text{Hourly wage}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Hours needed} = \frac{25}{5}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   25 \div 5 = 5
   \]

   Therefore, Tyler needs to work **5 hours** to afford the books.

5. **Final answer:**
   Tyler has to work **5 hours** to afford the dictionary, dinosaur book, and children's cookbook.
