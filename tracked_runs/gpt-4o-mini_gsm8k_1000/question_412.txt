Response:
To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we first need to calculate the total number of gifts she has to wrap. 

1. **Calculate the total number of gifts:**
   - Gifts for family: 6
   - Gifts for friends: 4
   - Gifts for teachers: 2

   Total gifts = Gifts for family + Gifts for friends + Gifts for teachers
   \[
   \text{Total gifts} = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount of ribbon available:**
   Monica has a total of 144 inches of ribbon.

3. **Calculate the amount of ribbon per gift bow:**
   To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts.

   \[
   \text{Ribbon per gift bow} = \frac{\text{Total ribbon}}{\text{Total gifts}} = \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12}
   \]

   Now, we perform the division:
   \[
   \text{Ribbon per gift bow} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Monica can use **12 inches of ribbon** for each gift bow.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
