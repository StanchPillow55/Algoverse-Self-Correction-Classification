Question ID: 118

Question:
A customs officer at the main port of SeaSide clearances counted 2 containers of imported vehicles, each having 5 vehicles inside. The next day, more containers were brought in, and the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Calculate the number of containers that were imported on the second day, assuming all the containers contain 5 vehicles.


Reference Answer:
On the first day, 2*5 = <<2*5=10>>10 vehicles were Imported,
On the next day, the number of vehicles imported through the port is 30-10 = <<30-10=20>>20 vehicles
If each container has 5 vehicles, the number is 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 containers.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of vehicles from the first day.**
   - We know that there are 2 containers, and each container has 5 vehicles.
   - Therefore, the total number of vehicles from the first day can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Vehicles from first day} = \text{Number of containers} \times \text{Vehicles per container} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ vehicles}
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of vehicles after the second day.**
   - According to the problem, the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30 vehicles.

3. **Calculate the number of vehicles added on the second day.**
   - To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles:
     \[
     \text{Vehicles added on second day} = \text{Total vehicles} - \text{Vehicles from first day} = 30 - 10 = 20 \text{ vehicles}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of containers imported on the second day.**
   - Since we know that each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers that were imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:
     \[
     \text{Number of containers on second day} = \frac{\text{Vehicles added on second day}}{\text{Vehicles per container}} = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ containers}
     \]

5. **Final answer.**
   - Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:
     \[
     \boxed{4}
     \]
