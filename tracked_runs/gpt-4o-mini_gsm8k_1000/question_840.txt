Question ID: 627

Question:
On a particular week, a tow truck pulled ten cars for each of the first three days and then four fewer cars on each of the remaining days of the week. Calculate the total number of cars it towed that week.


Reference Answer:
On the first three days, towing ten cars a day, the tow truck pulled 3*10 = <<3*10=30>>30 cars.
It pulled four fewer cars each day, which is 10-4 = <<10-4=6>>6 cars on the remaining days.
If it pulled ten cars for three days and four less on the remaining days, then it pulled for 7-3 = 4 days, four cars less each day.
For the four days, the car pulled 6*4= <<6*4=24>>24 cars.
The total number of cars it pulled that week is 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 cars.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of days in the week**: There are 7 days in a week.

2. **Calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days**:
   - The tow truck towed 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     \text{Cars towed in first three days} = 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of cars towed on the remaining days**:
   - The remaining days of the week are \(7 - 3 = 4\) days.
   - The problem states that the tow truck towed 4 fewer cars on each of these remaining days compared to the first three days.
   - Since it towed 10 cars each day for the first three days, the number of cars towed on each of the remaining days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days**:
   - The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
     \[
     \text{Cars towed in remaining four days} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of cars towed for the entire week**:
   - Now, we add the number of cars towed in the first three days to the number of cars towed in the remaining four days:
     \[
     \text{Total cars towed} = \text{Cars towed in first three days} + \text{Cars towed in remaining four days}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cars towed} = 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}
     \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed by the tow truck that week is \( \boxed{54} \).
