Question:
Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?


Reference Answer:
Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.

Response:
To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market from selling her duck eggs, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks each day.**
   Janet's ducks lay a total of 16 eggs per day.

2. **Determine how many eggs Janet consumes and uses for baking.**
   - Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
   - She uses 4 eggs for baking muffins.
   - Therefore, the total number of eggs she consumes and uses is:
     \[
     3 \text{ (for breakfast)} + 4 \text{ (for baking)} = 7 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining after Janet's consumption.**
   To find out how many eggs are left for selling, we subtract the number of eggs Janet uses from the total number of eggs laid:
   \[
   16 \text{ (total eggs)} - 7 \text{ (eggs used)} = 9 \text{ eggs remaining}
   \]

4. **Determine how much Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs.**
   Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at a price of $2 per egg. To find the total revenue from selling the eggs, we multiply the number of eggs by the price per egg:
   \[
   9 \text{ eggs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/egg} = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **State the final answer.**
   Therefore, Janet makes **$18** every day at the farmers' market.

Final Answer: **$18**
