Question ID: 29

Question:
Gloria is shoe shopping when she comes across a pair of boots that fit her shoe budget. However, she has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels that together cost five dollars less than the boots. If one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, how many dollars are the boots?


Reference Answer:
The second pair of heels costs 33 * 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66.
The heels together cost 66 + 33 = $<<66+33=99>>99.
The boots cost $5 more than both pairs of heels together, so the boots cost 99 + 5 = $104.
#### 104

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of the boots based on the information provided about the high heels.

1. **Identify the cost of the high heels:**
   - One pair of heels costs $33.
   - The other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair. Therefore, the cost of the second pair is:
     \[
     2 \times 33 = 66 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the two pairs of high heels:**
   - The total cost of both pairs of heels is:
     \[
     33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Relate the cost of the boots to the cost of the high heels:**
   - According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Let \( B \) represent the cost of the boots. We can express this relationship mathematically:
     \[
     B = 99 + 5
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the boots:**
   - Now, we can solve for \( B \):
     \[
     B = 99 + 5 = 104 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars.
