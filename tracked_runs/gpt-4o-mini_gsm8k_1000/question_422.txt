Question ID: 4

Question:
Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?


Reference Answer:
If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.

Response:
To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily feed requirement for the chickens**:
   Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day. Since Wendi has 20 chickens, we can calculate the total daily feed requirement as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total daily feed} = \text{Number of chickens} \times \text{Feed per chicken}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total daily feed} = 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon**:
   Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. We can find the total feed given in these two meals:

   \[
   \text{Total feed given in morning and afternoon} = \text{Morning feed} + \text{Afternoon feed}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total feed given in morning and afternoon} = 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount of feed needed for the final meal**:
   To find out how much feed Wendi needs to give in the final meal, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed requirement:

   \[
   \text{Feed needed for final meal} = \text{Total daily feed} - \text{Total feed given in morning and afternoon}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Feed needed for final meal} = 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
   \]

Thus, Wendi needs to give her chickens **20 cups of feed** in the final meal of the day.

Final Answer: **20 cups**
