Question ID: 1004

Question:
Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, while Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each. If Peter and Martha have totals of 64 and 56 chocolate bars respectively, how many more chocolate bars does Peter have in each box than Martha?


Reference Answer:
Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 equal boxes so there are 64/4 = <<64/4=16>>16 bars in each box
Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 equal boxes so there are 56/7 = <<56/7=8>>8 bars in each box
Peter has 16-8 = <<16-8=8>>8 bars more than Martha in each box
#### 8

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many chocolate bars Peter and Martha have in each of their boxes, and then find the difference between the two amounts.

1. **Determine the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter:**
   - Peter has 4 boxes, and the total number of chocolate bars he has is 64.
   - Let \( p \) be the number of chocolate bars in each box that Peter has.
   - The total number of chocolate bars can be expressed as:
     \[
     4p = 64
     \]
   - To find \( p \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
     \[
     p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
     \]
   - Therefore, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

2. **Determine the number of chocolate bars in each box for Martha:**
   - Martha has 7 boxes, and the total number of chocolate bars she has is 56.
   - Let \( m \) be the number of chocolate bars in each box that Martha has.
   - The total number of chocolate bars can be expressed as:
     \[
     7m = 56
     \]
   - To find \( m \), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:
     \[
     m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
     \]
   - Therefore, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

3. **Calculate how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:**
   - We need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in Peter's box and Martha's box:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
     \]

Thus, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

**Final Answer:**
Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.
