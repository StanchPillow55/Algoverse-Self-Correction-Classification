Question ID: 785

Question:
Carrie was given ten twenties and 140 quarters by her aunt to use for lunch. If she spent all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties, calculate the total amount of money she paid for the lunch.


Reference Answer:
Since she spent all the quarters, she paid her lunch partly by quarters totaling 140*$0.25 = $<<140*0.25=35>>35
She also used 3/5*10 = <<3/5*10=6>>6 of the twenties to pay for the lunch.
The total amount of the twenties that she used is 6*$20 = $<<6*20=120>>120
She spent $120+$35 = $<<120+35=155>>155 on the lunch.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch using the money she received from her aunt.

1. **Calculate the total amount from the twenties:**
   - Carrie has ten $20 bills.
   - The total amount from the twenties can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total from twenties} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount from the quarters:**
   - Carrie has 140 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - The total amount from the quarters can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total from quarters} = 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the amount spent from the twenties:**
   - Carrie spent \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total amount from the twenties.
   - We already calculated the total from the twenties as $200.
   - The amount spent from the twenties can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Amount spent from twenties} = \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on lunch:**
   - The total amount spent on lunch is the sum of the amount spent from the quarters and the amount spent from the twenties.
   - We have:
     - Amount spent from quarters = $35
     - Amount spent from twenties = $120
   - Therefore, the total amount spent on lunch is:
     \[
     \text{Total amount spent} = 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch is:
     \[
     \boxed{155} \text{ dollars}
     \]
