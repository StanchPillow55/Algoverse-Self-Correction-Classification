Question ID: 871

Question:
Tobias bought a big pizza with 60 pieces. He ate 2/5 of the pieces on the first day, 10 pieces on the second day, and 7/13 of the remaining pieces on the third day. How many pizza pieces has he eaten so far?


Reference Answer:
On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5*60 = <<2/5*60=24>>24 pieces of the pizza.
On the second day, Tobias ate 10 more pieces of the pizza, totaling 24+10 = <<24+10=34>>34 pieces
The number of pieces of pizza remaining is 60-34 = <<60-34=26>>26
On the third day, Tobias ate 7/13*26 = <<7/13*26=14>>14 pieces of pizza.
So far, he has eaten 14+34 = <<14+34=48>>48 pieces of the pizza he bought.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating how many pieces of pizza Tobias has eaten each day and keeping track of the remaining pieces.

1. **Total Pieces of Pizza**: Tobias starts with a big pizza that has 60 pieces.

2. **Pieces Eaten on the First Day**:
   - Tobias ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total pieces on the first day.
   - To find out how many pieces that is, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Pieces eaten on the first day} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \text{ pieces}
     \]

3. **Remaining Pieces After the First Day**:
   - After eating 24 pieces, the remaining pieces are:
     \[
     \text{Remaining pieces} = 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
     \]

4. **Pieces Eaten on the Second Day**:
   - On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces.
   - The remaining pieces after the second day are:
     \[
     \text{Remaining pieces} = 36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}
     \]

5. **Pieces Eaten on the Third Day**:
   - On the third day, Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining pieces.
   - We need to calculate how many pieces that is:
     \[
     \text{Pieces eaten on the third day} = \frac{7}{13} \times 26
     \]
   - First, we simplify \( \frac{7}{13} \times 26 \):
     \[
     \frac{7 \times 26}{13} = \frac{182}{13} = 14 \text{ pieces}
     \]

6. **Total Pieces Eaten**:
   - Now we can find the total number of pieces Tobias has eaten so far by adding the pieces eaten each day:
     \[
     \text{Total pieces eaten} = 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \text{ pieces}
     \]

Thus, the total number of pizza pieces that Tobias has eaten so far is \( \boxed{48} \).
