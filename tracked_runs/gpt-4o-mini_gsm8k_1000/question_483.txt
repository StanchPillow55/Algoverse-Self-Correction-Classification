Question ID: 485

Question:
Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes cost. If her shoes cost $80, how much did her bag cost?


Reference Answer:
First triple the cost of the shoes: $80 * 3 = $<<80*3=240>>240
Then subtract $20 to find the cost of the handbag: $240 - $20 = $<<240-20=220>>220
#### 220

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of Jillian's handbag based on the information provided about the cost of her shoes.

1. **Identify the cost of the shoes**: 
   The problem states that Jillian's shoes cost $80.

2. **Set up the equation for the handbag**: 
   According to the problem, Jillian's handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes. We can express this relationship mathematically.

   Let \( S \) be the cost of the shoes, and \( B \) be the cost of the handbag. The relationship can be expressed as:
   \[
   B = 3S - 20
   \]

3. **Substitute the cost of the shoes into the equation**: 
   We know that \( S = 80 \). Now we can substitute this value into the equation:
   \[
   B = 3(80) - 20
   \]

4. **Calculate \( 3 \times 80 \)**:
   \[
   3 \times 80 = 240
   \]

5. **Subtract 20 from 240**:
   \[
   B = 240 - 20 = 220
   \]

6. **Conclusion**: 
   The cost of Jillian's handbag is \( B = 220 \).

Thus, the final answer is that Jillian's handbag costs **$220**.
