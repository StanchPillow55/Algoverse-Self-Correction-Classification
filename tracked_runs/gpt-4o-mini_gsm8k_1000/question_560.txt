Question ID: 193

Question:
Sue lives in a fun neighborhood.  One weekend, the neighbors decided to play a prank on Sue.  On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard.  On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put these newly painted white flamingos back out on Sue's front yard.  Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos?


Reference Answer:
On Saturday, one third of the original 18 pink flamingos were removed and painted white: 18*1/3=<<18*1/3=6>>6 white flamingos.
This left 18 pink - 6 = <<18-6=12>>12 pink flamingos.
On Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added, for a total of 12 + 18 = <<12+18=30>>30 pink flamingos on the front lawn.
Altogether, there were 30 pink and 6 white flamingos on the lawn, so there were 30 pink - 6 white =<<30-6=24>>24 more pink flamingos.
#### 24

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, keeping track of the number of pink and white flamingos throughout the weekend.

1. **Initial Setup (Friday Morning)**:
   - The neighbors placed **18 pink flamingos** in Sue's front yard.
   - At this point, the count is:
     - Pink flamingos: **18**
     - White flamingos: **0**

2. **Saturday Morning**:
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos. 
   - To find out how many flamingos were taken back, we calculate one third of 18:
     \[
     \text{One third of 18} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]
   - So, they took back **6 pink flamingos**.
   - After taking back the flamingos, the count is:
     - Pink flamingos: \( 18 - 6 = 12 \)
     - White flamingos: **6** (the 6 flamingos that were painted white)

3. **Sunday Morning**:
   - The neighbors added another **18 pink flamingos** to the collection.
   - Now we update the counts:
     - Pink flamingos: \( 12 + 18 = 30 \)
     - White flamingos: **6** (no change here)

4. **Final Calculation (Noon on Sunday)**:
   - We need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos:
   - The difference is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Number of pink flamingos} - \text{Number of white flamingos} = 30 - 6 = 24
     \]

Thus, at noon on Sunday, there are **24 more pink plastic flamingos** than white plastic flamingos.

**Final Answer**: 24
