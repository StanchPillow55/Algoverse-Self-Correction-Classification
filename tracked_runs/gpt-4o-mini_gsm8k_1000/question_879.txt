Question:
Mario needs to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs.  Assuming his dogs each has four legs and each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, how much will it cost him to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs?


Reference Answer:
Dogs have 4 legs and a pair is 2 legs so each dog has 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 pair of legs
There are 6 dogs and they each have 2 pair of legs so they have 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 pair of legs
The snowshoes cost $12 per pair and he needs to buy 12 pairs so he will spend 12*12 = $<<12*12=144>>144 on snowshoes

Response:
To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of legs for all the dogs**: 
   Each dog has 4 legs. Therefore, for 6 dogs, we calculate the total number of legs as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total legs} = \text{Number of dogs} \times \text{Legs per dog} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed**: 
   Each pair of snowshoes is designed to fit 2 legs (one pair for each leg of a dog). To find out how many pairs of snowshoes are needed for 24 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of pairs of snowshoes} = \frac{\text{Total legs}}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ pairs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for the snowshoes**: 
   Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. To find the total cost for 12 pairs, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of pairs} \times \text{Cost per pair} = 12 \times 12 = 144
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:
   \[
   \boxed{144}
   \] 

In conclusion, Mario will need to spend $144.00 to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs.
