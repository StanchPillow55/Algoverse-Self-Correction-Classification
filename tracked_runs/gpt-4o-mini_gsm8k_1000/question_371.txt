Question ID: 174

Question:
Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?


Reference Answer:
There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.
Billy only takes 5 seconds to cut the potatoes, so it takes 5 seconds * 60 potatoes / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes to cut the potatoes.
So it will take him a total of 90 minutes peeling + 5 minutes cutting = <<90+5=95>>95 minutes total prepping the potatoes.

Response:
To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the 60 potatoes, we need to calculate the total time it takes him to peel and cut each potato.

1. **Time to Peel One Potato**:
   - Billy takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
   - To convert this into seconds (since the cutting time is given in seconds), we use the conversion factor that 1 minute = 60 seconds:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ minutes} = 1.5 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 90 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. **Time to Cut One Potato**:
   - Billy takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.

3. **Total Time for One Potato**:
   - Now, we add the time to peel and the time to cut one potato:
   \[
   \text{Total time for one potato} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to cut}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time for one potato} = 90 \text{ seconds} + 5 \text{ seconds} = 95 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Total Time for 60 Potatoes**:
   - To find the total time for 60 potatoes, we multiply the time for one potato by the number of potatoes:
   \[
   \text{Total time for 60 potatoes} = 95 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time for 60 potatoes} = 5700 \text{ seconds}
   \]

5. **Convert Total Time into Minutes**:
   - To convert seconds back into minutes, we divide by 60:
   \[
   \text{Total time in minutes} = \frac{5700 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 95 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is **95 minutes**.

Final answer: **95 minutes**.
