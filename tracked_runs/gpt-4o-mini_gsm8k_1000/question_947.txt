Question:
A house and a lot cost $120,000. If the house cost three times as much as the lot, how much did the house cost?


Reference Answer:
Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.
The cost of the house is 3/4 of the total cost, which is $120,000. 3/4 * $120,000 = $<<3/4*120000=90000>>90,000.
#### 90000

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information provided.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( L \) be the cost of the lot.
   - Let \( H \) be the cost of the house.

2. **Set Up Equations**:
   - According to the problem, the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. This gives us our first equation:
     \[
     H + L = 120,000
     \]
   - The problem also states that the house costs three times as much as the lot. This gives us our second equation:
     \[
     H = 3L
     \]

3. **Substitute**:
   - We can substitute the expression for \( H \) from the second equation into the first equation. So, we replace \( H \) in the first equation:
     \[
     3L + L = 120,000
     \]

4. **Combine Like Terms**:
   - Combine the terms on the left side:
     \[
     4L = 120,000
     \]

5. **Solve for \( L \)**:
   - To find \( L \), divide both sides by 4:
     \[
     L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000
     \]

6. **Find \( H \)**:
   - Now that we have \( L \), we can find \( H \) using the equation \( H = 3L \):
     \[
     H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000
     \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   - The cost of the house is \( H = 90,000 \).

Thus, the final answer is that the house cost **$90,000**.

     \]
   - We are also told that the house costs three times as much as the lot. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     H = 3L
     \]

3. **Substitute the Second Equation into the First**:
   - We can substitute \( H \) from the second equation into the first equation:
     \[
     3L + L = 120,000

   - Now that we have \( L \), we can find \( H \) using the equation \( H = 3L \):
     \[
     H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000
     \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   - The cost of the house is \( \boxed{90,000} \).

To summarize, we defined the variables, set up the equations based on the problem's conditions, substituted to find the cost of the lot, and then calculated the cost of the house. The final answer is that the house costs $90,000.
