Question ID: 960

Question:
A pirate crew is digging for buried treasure on the island marked X on a map. They dug ten holes the first day, thirteen holes the second day, and eight holes the third day. They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in. On the fourth day of digging, they unearthed a treasure chest full of gold, jewels, and an aged hat. The island had four times as many holes by then as it did at the end of the first day. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?


Reference Answer:
Let X mark the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.
The island had 4 * 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 holes when they found the treasure.
They dug 10 + 13 + 8 = <<10+13+8=31>>31 holes the first three days.
After filling in 2 holes, they had 31 - 2 = <<31-2=29>>29 holes dug.
When they found the treasure, they had 29 + X = 40 holes dug.
Thus, the pirates dug 40 - 29 = <<40-29=11>>11 holes on the fourth day.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the total number of holes dug by the pirates over the first three days and then determining how many holes they dug on the fourth day.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug in the first three days.

- **Day 1:** The pirates dug 10 holes.
- **Day 2:** The pirates dug 13 holes.
- **Day 3:** The pirates dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes.

First, we calculate the total number of holes dug on Day 3 before filling in the holes:
\[
\text{Holes dug on Day 3} = 8
\]
Next, we account for the holes that were filled in:
\[
\text{Holes remaining after filling} = 8 - 2 = 6
\]

Now, we can find the total number of holes dug after three days:
\[
\text{Total holes after Day 3} = 10 + 13 + 6 = 29
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.

At the end of the first day, the total number of holes dug is:
\[
\text{Holes at the end of Day 1} = 10
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[
\text{Total holes at the end of Day 4} = 4 \times \text{Holes at the end of Day 1} = 4 \times 10 = 40
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

Let \( x \) be the number of holes dug on the fourth day. The total number of holes at the end of the fourth day can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Total holes at the end of Day 4} = \text{Total holes after Day 3} + x
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
40 = 29 + x
\]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 40 - 29 = 11
\]

### Final Answer

The number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]
