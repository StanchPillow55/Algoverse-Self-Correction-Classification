Response:
To determine how much Ella would earn after 12 hours of dog walking, we first need to find her earnings per hour based on the information given.

1. **Calculate the hourly rate:**
   Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of work. To find her hourly rate, we divide her total earnings by the number of hours worked.

   \[
   \text{Hourly Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{\text{Total Hours}} = \frac{33}{3}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \text{Hourly Rate} = 11
   \]

   So, Ella earns $11 per hour.

2. **Calculate earnings for 12 hours:**
   Now that we know Ella's hourly rate is $11, we can calculate how much she would earn for 12 hours of dog walking.

   \[
   \text{Earnings for 12 hours} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Number of Hours} = 11 \times 12
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 132
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, if Ella continues to walk dogs at the same rate, she would earn **$132** after 12 hours.

\[
\boxed{132}
\]
