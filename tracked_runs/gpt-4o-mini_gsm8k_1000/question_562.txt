Question ID: 1168

Question:
The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If the 3 ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters, what was the length of the red rope in centimeters?


Reference Answer:
Let Y = the length of the yellow rope in centimeters
Blue rope = Y - 7
Red rope = 4 * (Y - 7)
Y + Y - 7 + 4 (Y - 7) = 37 cm
6Y - 35 = 37
6Y = 72
Y = <<12=12>>12 cm
The red rope was 20 cm long.

Response:
Let's denote the lengths of the ropes as follows:

- Let \( r \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( b \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   r = 4b
   \]

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   b = y - 7
   \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   r + b + y = 37
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( r \) and \( b \) into the combined length equation.

First, substitute \( r = 4b \) into the combined length equation:
\[
4b + b + y = 37
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
5b + y = 37
\]

Next, substitute \( b = y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5b + y = 37 \):
\[
5(y - 7) + y = 37
\]
Distributing the 5 gives:
\[
5y - 35 + y = 37
\]
Combining like terms results in:
\[
6y - 35 = 37
\]
Now, add 35 to both sides:
\[
6y = 72
\]
Dividing both sides by 6 gives:
\[
y = 12
\]

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope using \( b = y - 7 \):
\[
b = 12 - 7 = 5
\]

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope using \( r = 4b \):
\[
r = 4 \times 5 = 20
\]

Thus, the length of the red rope is:
\[
\boxed{20} \text{ centimeters}
\]
