Question ID: 1230

Question:
Charlie is a tennis pro.  He spends most of the day teaching others lessons on how to improve their game.  His standard fee is $80 per hour for lessons, but he reduces his rate by 25% when he is giving lessons to a veteran.   If today Charlie has 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate and 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, what is the total amount of money he will make for the day, in dollars?


Reference Answer:
4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate cost 4*$80=$<<4*80=320>>320.
Reducing the rate by 25% for veterans means he takes $80/4=$<<80/4=20>>20 off his standard fee.
Thus, for veterans, he charges the reduced rate of $80-$20=$<<80-20=60>>60 per hour,
Thus, 2 1-hour lessons with veterans cost 2*$60=$<<2*60=120>>120.
All together, Charlie will make $320+$120=$<<320+120=440>>440 for the day.

Response:
To find out how much money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the earnings from both his standard lessons and the lessons he gives to a veteran.

1. **Calculate the earnings from standard lessons:**
   - Charlie's standard fee is $80 per hour.
   - He has 4 lessons at this rate.
   - Total earnings from standard lessons = Number of lessons × Fee per lesson
   \[
   \text{Total earnings from standard lessons} = 4 \text{ lessons} \times 80 \text{ dollars/lesson} = 320 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the reduced rate for veteran lessons:**
   - Charlie reduces his rate by 25% for lessons with a veteran.
   - To find the reduced rate, we first calculate 25% of the standard fee:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 80 \text{ dollars} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Now, we subtract this amount from the standard fee to find the reduced rate:
   \[
   \text{Reduced rate} = 80 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the earnings from veteran lessons:**
   - Charlie has 2 lessons with a veteran at the reduced rate of $60 per hour.
   - Total earnings from veteran lessons = Number of lessons × Reduced fee per lesson
   \[
   \text{Total earnings from veteran lessons} = 2 \text{ lessons} \times 60 \text{ dollars/lesson} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total earnings for the day:**
   - Now we add the earnings from standard lessons and veteran lessons:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Total earnings from standard lessons} + \text{Total earnings from veteran lessons}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 320 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} = 440 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is \(\boxed{440}\) dollars.
