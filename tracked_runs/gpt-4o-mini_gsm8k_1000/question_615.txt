Question ID: 281

Question:
A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba. If there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in a snake park, what is half the number of spots they all have combined?


Reference Answer:
A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba, meaning a mamba has 70/2= <<70/2=35>>35 spots.
If there are 40 cobras in a snake park, they all have a total of 70*40 = <<40*70=2800>>2800 spots.
60 mambas in a snake park, each having 35 spots, have 60*35 = <<60*35=2100>>2100 spots total.
Together, all the snakes in the park have 2100+2800=<<2100+2800=4900>>4900 spots.
Half the number of spots they all have combined is 1/2*4900=<<1/2*4900=2450>>2450

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of spots on a mamba.**
   We know that a cobra has 70 spots and that it has twice as many spots as a mamba. Let \( x \) be the number of spots on a mamba. According to the problem:
   \[
   70 = 2x
   \]
   To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]
   Therefore, a mamba has 35 spots.

2. **Calculate the total number of spots for all cobras.**
   There are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots. The total number of spots for all cobras is:
   \[
   \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of spots for all mambas.**
   There are 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots. The total number of spots for all mambas is:
   \[
   \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100
   \]

4. **Calculate the combined total number of spots for all snakes.**
   Now, we add the total spots for cobras and mambas:
   \[
   \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900
   \]

5. **Find half the number of spots they all have combined.**
   To find half of the combined total spots:
   \[
   \text{Half of combined total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2450}
\]
