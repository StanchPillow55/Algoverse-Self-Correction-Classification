Question:
Walter is collecting money for charity. First he collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well. How much is Walter's lawyer going to contribute?


Reference Answer:
Walter collects $500 + $1500 + $200 = $<<500+1500+200=2200>>2,200 he collects from everyone for charity.
His lawyer has offered to donate 3 times that amount, $2,200 x 3 = $<<3*2200=6600>>6,600 that Walter's lawyer is going to donate.
#### 6,600

Response:
To determine how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to follow the steps outlined in the problem and calculate the total amount donated by others before the lawyer's contribution.

1. **Calculate the total amount collected from neighbors and online fund:**
   - Amount collected from neighbors: $500
   - Amount collected from the online fund: $1500

   We add these two amounts together:
   \[
   \text{Total from neighbors and online fund} = 500 + 1500 = 2000
   \]

2. **Add the contribution from Walter's friend:**
   - Walter's friend contributes: $200

   We add this amount to the previous total:
   \[
   \text{Total before lawyer's contribution} = 2000 + 200 = 2200
   \]

3. **Calculate the lawyer's contribution:**
   - The lawyer donates three times the total amount collected from everyone else (neighbors, online fund, and friend). Therefore, we need to calculate:
   \[
   \text{Lawyer's contribution} = 3 \times \text{Total before lawyer's contribution}
   \]
   Substituting the total we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Lawyer's contribution} = 3 \times 2200 = 6600
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Walter's lawyer will contribute **$6600**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6600}
\]
