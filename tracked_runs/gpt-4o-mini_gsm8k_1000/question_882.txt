Question ID: 258

Question:
Nancy is returning her overdue books to the library. She owes $0.50 cents each on 8 books, plus a flat $2.00 fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. How much does she have to pay total?


Reference Answer:
First multiply the late fee per book by the number of books: $0.50/book * 8 books = $<<0.5*8=4.00>>4.00
Then add the "more than a week overdue" fee to the answer from the previous step to find the total: $4.00 + $2.00 = $<<4+2=6.00>>6.00

Response:
To find out how much Nancy has to pay for her overdue books, we can break the problem down into two parts: the cost for the overdue books and the flat fee for having overdue books.

1. **Calculate the cost for the overdue books:**
   - Nancy has 8 overdue books.
   - The fine for each overdue book is $0.50.
   - To find the total cost for the overdue books, we multiply the number of books by the fine per book:

   \[
   \text{Cost for overdue books} = \text{Number of books} \times \text{Fine per book}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost for overdue books} = 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00
   \]

   So, the total cost for the overdue books is $4.00.

2. **Add the flat fee for having overdue books:**
   - Nancy also has a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue.
   - We simply add this flat fee to the total cost for the overdue books:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for overdue books} + \text{Flat fee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00
   \]

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $6.00.

In conclusion, after calculating both the fines for the overdue books and the flat fee, we find that Nancy has to pay a total of **$6.00**.
