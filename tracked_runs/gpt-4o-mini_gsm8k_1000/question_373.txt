Question:
Max plans to watch two movies this weekend. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long while the second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. How many minutes will it take Max to watch the two movies?


Reference Answer:
One hour has 60 minutes.
The first movie is 60 + 30 = <<60+30=90>>90 minutes long.
Two hours is equal to 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.
The second movie is 120 + 5 = <<120+5=125>>125 minutes long.
Max will take 90 + 125 = <<90+125=215>>215 minutes to watch the two movies.

Response:
To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch both movies, we need to convert the lengths of each movie from hours and minutes into just minutes, and then add those two amounts together.

### Step 1: Convert the first movie's length to minutes.
The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. 

1 hour is equal to 60 minutes. Therefore, we convert the hours to minutes:
\[
1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]
Now, we add the additional 30 minutes:
\[
60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes}
\]
So, the first movie is 90 minutes long.

### Step 2: Convert the second movie's length to minutes.
The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.

Again, we convert the hours to minutes:
\[
2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]
Now, we add the additional 5 minutes:
\[
120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes}
\]
So, the second movie is 125 minutes long.

### Step 3: Add the lengths of both movies together.
Now we need to add the lengths of both movies to find the total time Max will spend watching them:
\[
90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer
Therefore, it will take Max a total of **215 minutes** to watch both movies.
