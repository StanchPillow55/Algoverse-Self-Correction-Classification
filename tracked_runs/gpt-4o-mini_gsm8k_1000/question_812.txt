Question ID: 108

Question:
Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?


Reference Answer:
Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.
He had cooked too many, so he must have needed 115 – 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double last year’s amount.
Therefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.
#### 50


=== Turn 1 ===


Response:
Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year. According to the problem, he wants to make twice as many cookies this year, so he intended to bake:

\[
2x
\]

However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended. Therefore, the total number of cookies he actually baked is:

\[
2x + 15
\]

After baking, he accidentally drops 5 cookies, which means the number of cookies he has left is:

\[
(2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10
\]

We know from the problem that after dropping the cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Thus, we can set up the equation:

\[
2x + 10 = 110
\]

Now, we will solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[
2x = 110 - 10
\]
\[
2x = 100
\]

2. Divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = \frac{100}{2}
\]
\[
x = 50
\]

Thus, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]

To verify, if Henry baked 50 cookies last year, then he intended to bake:

\[
2 \times 50 = 100
\]

Adding the 15 extra cookies he baked gives:

\[
100 + 15 = 115
\]

After dropping 5 cookies, the total he has left is:

\[
115 - 5 = 110
\]

This matches the information given in the problem, confirming that our solution is correct. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]
