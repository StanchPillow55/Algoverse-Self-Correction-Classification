Response:
To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people transported by the buses and cars.

1. **Calculate the number of people transported by the buses:**
   - There are 12 buses.
   - Each bus carries 35 people.
   - Therefore, the total number of people transported by the buses can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total people from buses} = \text{Number of buses} \times \text{People per bus} = 12 \times 35
   \]

   Now, let's perform the multiplication:

   \[
   12 \times 35 = 420
   \]

   So, 420 people were transported by the buses.

2. **Calculate the number of people transported by the cars:**
   - There are 20 private cars.
   - Each car carries 3 people.
   - Therefore, the total number of people transported by the cars can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total people from cars} = \text{Number of cars} \times \text{People per car} = 20 \times 3
   \]

   Now, let's perform the multiplication:

   \[
   20 \times 3 = 60
   \]

   So, 60 people were transported by the cars.

3. **Calculate the total number of people inside the church:**
   - Now, we add the total number of people from the buses and the cars:

   \[
   \text{Total people inside the church} = \text{Total people from buses} + \text{Total people from cars} = 420 + 60
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   420 + 60 = 480
   \]

Thus, the total number of people inside the church is **480**.

Final answer: **480** people were inside the church.

   So, there are 60 people in the cars.

3. **Calculate the total number of people inside the church:**
   - To find the total number of people who attended the ceremony, we need to add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars:

   \[
   \text{Total people inside the church} = \text{Total people in buses} + \text{Total people in cars} = 420 + 60
   \]

   Now, let's do the addition:

   \[
   420 + 60 = 480
   \]

Thus, the total number of people inside the church is **480**.
