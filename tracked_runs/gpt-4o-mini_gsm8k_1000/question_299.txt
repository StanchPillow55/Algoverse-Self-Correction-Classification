Question ID: 715

Question:
A company wanted to buy 500 computers and had $700 for each computer. However, when they went to order, they realized the price of each computer was 10% higher than they had planned for. Calculate the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices.


Reference Answer:
When they went to order, the company realized the prices of each computer had increased by 10/100*700 = $<<10/100*700=70>>70
The total buying price at the new prize is $700+$70 = $<<700+70=770>>770
Since they wanted to buy 500 computers, they paid a total of $770*500 = $<<770*500=385000>>385000
#### 385000

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the original price per computer.**
   The company planned to buy 500 computers at a price of $700 each.

   \[
   \text{Original price per computer} = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the increase in price due to the 10% increase.**
   The price of each computer increased by 10%. To find the new price, we first calculate 10% of the original price.

   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Now, we add this increase to the original price to find the new price per computer.

   \[
   \text{New price per computer} = 700 + 70 = 770 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 500 computers at the new price.**
   Now that we have the new price per computer, we can calculate the total cost for 500 computers.

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of computers} \times \text{New price per computer}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 500 \times 770
   \]

   To perform the multiplication:

   \[
   500 \times 770 = 385000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   The total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

   \[
   \boxed{385000} \text{ dollars}
   \]
