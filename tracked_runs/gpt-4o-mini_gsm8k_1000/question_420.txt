Question ID: 173

Question:
Jessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month. Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much does she pay in a year?


Reference Answer:
First find the total minimum payment each month: $300/month + $200/month + $500/month = $<<300+200+500=1000>>1000/month
Then multiply that number by 50% to find how much extra Jessica pays each month: $1000/month * .5 = $<<1000*.5=500>>500/month
Add that number to the total minimum payment to find how much Jessica pays per month: $1000/month + $500/month = $<<1000+500=1500>>1500/month
Now multiply that number by the number of months in a year to find Jessica's annual payment: $1500/month * 12 months/year = $<<1500*12=18000>>18,000/year

Response:
To determine how much Jessica will pay on all her debts each month, we need to calculate 50% more than the minimum payments for each of her debts and then find the total amount she will pay in a year.

1. **Calculate the minimum payments:**
   - Student loans: $300/month
   - Credit card: $200/month
   - Mortgage: $500/month

2. **Calculate 50% more than the minimum payments:**
   - For the student loans:
     \[
     \text{50% of } 300 = 0.5 \times 300 = 150
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total payment for student loans} = 300 + 150 = 450
     \]

   - For the credit card:
     \[
     \text{50% of } 200 = 0.5 \times 200 = 100
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total payment for credit card} = 200 + 100 = 300
     \]

   - For the mortgage:
     \[
     \text{50% of } 500 = 0.5 \times 500 = 250
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total payment for mortgage} = 500 + 250 = 750
     \]

3. **Calculate the total monthly payment:**
   Now, we add up all the payments:
   \[
   \text{Total monthly payment} = 450 + 300 + 750
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total monthly payment} = 1500
   \]

4. **Calculate the total payment in a year:**
   To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by the number of months in a year (12):
   \[
   \text{Total yearly payment} = 1500 \times 12
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total yearly payment} = 18000
   \]

Thus, the total amount Jessica pays on all her debts in a year is \(\boxed{18000}\).
