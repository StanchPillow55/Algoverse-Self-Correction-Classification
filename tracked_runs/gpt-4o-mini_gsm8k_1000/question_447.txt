Question:
Conor lives near a beach and loves going there every day to have fun. On a particular week, he found 50 people at the beach on the first day. The next day, 20 more people were present at the beach than on the first day, and on the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day. If Conor saw an average of 60 people each day the rest of the week, calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week.


Reference Answer:
There were 50 people at the beach on the first day. On the second day, the number of people at the beach increased to 50 people + 20 people = <<50+20=70>>70 people
The third day, the total number of people at the beach was twice the number on the second day: thus, 2 * 70 people = <<70*2=140>>140 people
For the remaining days of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people per day, for a total of 60 people/day * 4 days = <<60*4=240>>240 people
Conor saw a total of 240 people + 140 people + 70 people + 50 people = <<240+140+70+50=500>>500 people

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down day by day and then calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach over the week.

1. **Day 1**: 
   - The number of people at the beach is given as 50.

   \[
   \text{People on Day 1} = 50
   \]

2. **Day 2**: 
   - It is stated that there were 20 more people present than on the first day. Therefore, we add 20 to the number of people from Day 1.

   \[
   \text{People on Day 2} = 50 + 20 = 70
   \]

3. **Day 3**: 
   - The total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day. Thus, we multiply the number of people from Day 2 by 2.

   \[
   \text{People on Day 3} = 2 \times 70 = 140
   \]

4. **Days 4 to 7**: 
   - It is given that Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week. Since there are 4 days remaining in the week (Day 4, Day 5, Day 6, and Day 7), we can calculate the total number of people for these days.

   \[
   \text{Total for Days 4 to 7} = 60 \times 4 = 240
   \]

5. **Total for the Week**: 
   - Now, we will sum the number of people from each day to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week.

   \[
   \text{Total People} = \text{People on Day 1} + \text{People on Day 2} + \text{People on Day 3} + \text{Total for Days 4 to 7}
   \]

   Plugging in the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Total People} = 50 + 70 + 140 + 240
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition step by step:

   \[
   50 + 70 = 120
   \]
   \[
   120 + 140 = 260
   \]
   \[
   260 + 240 = 500
   \]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 

\[
\boxed{500}
\]
