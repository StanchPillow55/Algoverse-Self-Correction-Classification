Question ID: 740

Question:
A class of 50 students has various hobbies. 10 like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and the rest like to either play video games or play music. How many like to play video games if the number that like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball?


Reference Answer:
The number of students that like to play music is twice as many as the number who like basketball, so 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10
The number that like to play video games is 50 total students - 10 baking - 5 basketball - 10 music = <<50-10-5-10=25>>25

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of students**: We know that there are 50 students in total.

2. **Identify the number of students with specific hobbies**:
   - Students who like to bake: 10
   - Students who like to play basketball: 5

3. **Determine the number of students who like to play music**:
   - According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball.
   - Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:
     \[
     \text{Number of students who like to play music} = 2 \times 5 = 10
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of students who like to play video games**:
   - We know the total number of students is 50. We can find the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students.
   - The number of students who like to bake is 10, the number who like to play basketball is 5, and the number who like to play music is 10. Therefore, the total number of students who have specified hobbies is:
     \[
     \text{Total with specified hobbies} = 10 + 5 + 10 = 25
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of students who like to play video games**:
   - Now, we subtract the total number of students with specified hobbies from the total number of students:
     \[
     \text{Number of students who like to play video games} = 50 - 25 = 25
     \]

6. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is \( \boxed{25} \).
