Question ID: 211

Question:
Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?


Reference Answer:
First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.
Then, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2
Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32
Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4

Response:
To solve the problem, we will define variables for the number of red and white chickens, set up equations based on the information given, and then solve those equations step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
   - Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

2. **Set Up the Relationships:**
   - According to the problem, Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     w = r + 2
     \]

3. **Set Up the Egg Production Equation:**
   - Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, so the total egg production from red chickens is \( 3r \).
   - White chickens produce 5 eggs per day, so the total egg production from white chickens is \( 5w \).
   - The total number of eggs collected each day is 42. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     3r + 5w = 42
     \]

4. **Substitute for \( w \):**
   - We can substitute \( w \) from the first equation into the second equation:
     \[
     3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
     \]

5. **Expand and Simplify:**
   - Distributing the 5:
     \[
     3r + 5r + 10 = 42
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     8r + 10 = 42
     \]

6. **Solve for \( r \):**
   - Subtract 10 from both sides:
     \[
     8r = 32
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 8:
     \[
     r = 4
     \]

7. **Find \( w \):**
   - Now that we have \( r \), we can find \( w \) using the equation \( w = r + 2 \):
     \[
     w = 4 + 2 = 6
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total egg production:
     - Red chickens: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) eggs
     - White chickens: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) eggs
     - Total: \( 12 + 30 = 42 \) eggs, which matches the information given in the problem.

Thus, the number of red chickens Jerry has is \( \boxed{4} \).

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given about Jerry's chickens and the eggs they produce.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
   - Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

2. **Set Up Relationships**:
   - According to the problem, Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     w = r + 2
     \]

3. **Egg Production**:
   - Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, so the total egg production from red chickens is:
     \[
     3r
     \]
   - White chickens produce 5 eggs per day, so the total egg production from white chickens is:
     \[
     5w
     \]

4. **Total Egg Collection**:
   - Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs each day. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     3r + 5w = 42
     \]

5. **Substitute for \( w \)**:
   - We can substitute \( w \) from the first equation into the second equation. Replacing \( w \) gives:
     \[
     3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
     \]

6. **Simplify the Equation**:
   - Distributing the 5:
     \[
     3r + 5r + 10 = 42
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     8r + 10 = 42
     \]

7. **Isolate \( r \)**:
   - Subtract 10 from both sides:
     \[
     8r = 32
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 8:
     \[
     r = 4
     \]

8. **Find \( w \)**:
   - Now that we have \( r \), we can find \( w \):
     \[
     w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
     \]

9. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify the total egg production:
     - Red chickens produce: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) eggs.
     - White chickens produce: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) eggs.
     - Total eggs: \( 12 + 30 = 42 \), which matches the information given in the problem.

Thus, the calculations are consistent and correct.

**Final Answer**:
Jerry has \( \boxed{4} \) red chickens.
