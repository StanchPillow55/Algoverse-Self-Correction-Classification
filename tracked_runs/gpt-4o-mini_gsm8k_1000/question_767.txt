Question:
Molly is catering a birthday party for her sister and invited 16 people. 10 people want the chicken salad which is $6.50 per person and 6 people want the pasta salad at $6 per person. What is the total amount Molly will pay for the catering?


Reference Answer:
Multiply the number of people who want chicken salad by the cost per person, so the cost is 10 x $6.50 = $<<10*6.5=65>>65.
Multiply the amount of people who want pasta salad by the cost per person, so the cost is 6 x $6.00 = $<<6*6=36>>36.
The total cost of chicken salad and pasta salad is $65 + $36 = $<<65+36=101>>101.

Response:
To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad separately and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate the cost for the chicken salad:**
   - Number of people wanting chicken salad: 10
   - Cost per person for chicken salad: $6.50

   To find the total cost for the chicken salad, we multiply the number of people by the cost per person:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for chicken salad} = \text{Number of people} \times \text{Cost per person}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for chicken salad} = 10 \times 6.50 = 65.00
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost for the pasta salad:**
   - Number of people wanting pasta salad: 6
   - Cost per person for pasta salad: $6.00

   Similarly, we calculate the total cost for the pasta salad:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for pasta salad} = \text{Number of people} \times \text{Cost per person}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for pasta salad} = 6 \times 6.00 = 36.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the total catering cost:**
   Now we add the total costs for both types of salad:
   \[
   \text{Total catering cost} = \text{Total cost for chicken salad} + \text{Total cost for pasta salad}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total catering cost} = 65.00 + 36.00 = 101.00
   \]

Thus, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is **$101.00**. 

Final answer: **$101.00**
