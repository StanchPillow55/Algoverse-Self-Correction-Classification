Question ID: 90

Question:
Ted the T-Rex was planning to bring potato salad to the dinosaur picnic.  He knows that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult.  If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?


Reference Answer:
Half of 10 pounds is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 pounds.
To feed 20 dinosaur adults, he will need 20*10=<<20*10=200>>200 pounds of potato salad.
To feed 5 dinosaur children, he will need 5*5=<<5*5=25>>25 pounds of potato salad.
In total, he will need to bring 200+25=<<200+25=225>>225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

Response:
To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for both the adults and the children.

1. **Calculate the amount of potato salad needed for adults:**
   - Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 20 adults at the picnic.
   - Therefore, the total amount of potato salad needed for adults can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total for adults} = \text{Number of adults} \times \text{Amount per adult}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total for adults} = 20 \times 10 \text{ lbs} = 200 \text{ lbs}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of potato salad needed for children:**
   - Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult. Since an adult eats 10 lbs, a child will eat:
     \[
     \text{Amount per child} = \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs}
     \]
   - There are 5 children at the picnic.
   - Therefore, the total amount of potato salad needed for children can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total for children} = \text{Number of children} \times \text{Amount per child}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total for children} = 5 \times 5 \text{ lbs} = 25 \text{ lbs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the picnic:**
   - Now, we add the total amount needed for adults and children:
     \[
     \text{Total potato salad} = \text{Total for adults} + \text{Total for children}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
     \]

Thus, Ted needs to bring a total of **225 pounds of potato salad** to the picnic to ensure that there is enough for everyone.

**Final Answer: 225 lbs**
