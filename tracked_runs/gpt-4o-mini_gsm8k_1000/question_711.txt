Question ID: 244

Question:
Griffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle took 5 of them.  Billy took twice as many as Kyle.  Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, and then Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken.  If in the end Griffin had 27 fries, how many fries did Ginger give Griffin?


Reference Answer:
Griffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle took 5 of them.
Billy took twice as many as Kyle, removing 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 fries.
Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, removing 5-3=<<5-3=2>>2 fries.
If we let X be the number of fries given to Griffin by Ginger, then 24-5-10-2+x=27
Thus, Ginger had given Griffin x=20 fries
#### 20

Response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Count of French Fries**:
   Griffin starts with 24 french fries.

2. **Kyle Takes Fries**:
   Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 24 - 5 = 19
   \]

3. **Billy Takes Fries**:
   Billy takes twice as many fries as Kyle. Since Kyle took 5 fries:
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by Billy} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   Now, we calculate how many fries Griffin has after Billy takes his share:
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 19 - 10 = 9
   \]

4. **Ginger Gives Fries to Griffin**:
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries that Ginger gives to Griffin. After receiving these fries, Griffin's total becomes:
   \[
   \text{Fries with Griffin after Ginger} = 9 + x
   \]

5. **Colby Takes Fries**:
   Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle took. Since Kyle took 5 fries:
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by Colby} = 5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   Now, we calculate how many fries Griffin has after Colby takes his share:
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x
   \]

6. **Final Count of Fries**:
   We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   To find \( x \), we subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of fries that Ginger gave to Griffin is \( \boxed{20} \).
