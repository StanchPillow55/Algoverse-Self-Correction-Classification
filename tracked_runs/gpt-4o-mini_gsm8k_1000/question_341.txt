Question ID: 343

Question:
In his training as a professional athlete, Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach, however, wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. If he took the coach's advice and trained for a month, what is the total distance he covered in June?


Reference Answer:
Tyson's coach wants him to run 1/5 * 5000 meters = <<5000/5=1000>>1000 more meters per day.
When he took the coach's advice, he increased the training distance he runs per day to 5000 meters + 1000 meters = <<5000+1000=6000>>6000 meters.
He covered 6000 meters/day * 30 days/month =<<6000*30=180000>>180000 meters in June on his training sessions.
#### 180000

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many meters Tyson would run each day if he follows his coach's advice and then calculate the total distance he would cover in June.

1. **Determine the increase in distance**:
   Tyson currently runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more than this distance.

   To find out how much more this is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters}
   \]

2. **Calculate the new daily distance**:
   Now, we add this increase to his original distance:
   \[
   \text{New daily distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance for the month of June**:
   June has 30 days. If Tyson runs 6000 meters each day, the total distance he would cover in June is:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{New daily distance} \times \text{Number of days in June}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, if Tyson follows his coach's advice and runs 6000 meters every day for the month of June, the total distance he covers is:
   \[
   \boxed{180000} \text{ meters}
   \]
