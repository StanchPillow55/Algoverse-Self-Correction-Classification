Question ID: 243

Question:
Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month. Every day he has a 15-minute call with his boss, and he's had 300 extra minutes of call this month to other people. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 days?


Reference Answer:
First find the total time Jason spends calling his boss: 15 minutes/call * 30 calls/month = <<15*30=450>>450 minutes
Then subtract the minutes Jason has already used to find how many he has left: 1000 minutes - 450 minutes - 300 minutes = <<1000-450-300=250>>250 minutes
#### 250

Response:
To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he has used this month and then subtract that from his total allowance of 1000 minutes.

1. **Calculate the total minutes used for daily calls with his boss:**
   - Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
   - The month has 30 days.
   - Total minutes used for calls with his boss = 15 minutes/day Ã— 30 days = 450 minutes.

2. **Add the extra minutes used:**
   - Jason has used an additional 300 minutes for calls to other people.
   - Total minutes used = Minutes for boss + Extra minutes = 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes.

3. **Calculate the remaining minutes:**
   - Jason's total phone plan allowance is 1000 minutes.
   - Remaining minutes = Total allowance - Total minutes used = 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes.

Thus, after calculating the total minutes used and subtracting from the total allowance, we find that Jason has 250 minutes left.

**Final Answer: Jason has 250 minutes left.**
