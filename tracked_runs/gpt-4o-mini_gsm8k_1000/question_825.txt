Question ID: 611

Question:
John decides to build a program capable of identifying cancer cells.  He gets initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.  His research ends up taking 10 times that long and every month after those first 5 took 50% more funding per month.  How much did his research cost?


Reference Answer:
The research ended up taking 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 months
So he paid for expensive research for 50-5=<<50-5=45>>45 months
Each month of research at the cheaper stage cost 100,000/5=$<<100000/5=20000>>20,000
So the more expensive research cost 20,000*1.5=$<<20000*1.5=30000>>30,000
So that research cost 45*30,000=$<<45*30000=1350000>>1,350,000
So the total cost was 1,350,000+100,000=$<<1350000+100000=1450000>>1,450,000
#### 1,450,000

Response:
To determine the total cost of John's research, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Funding**: John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months. This means that for the first 5 months, the total funding is:
   \[
   \text{Initial Funding} = 100,000
   \]

2. **Total Duration of Research**: The research ends up taking 10 times longer than the initial 5 months. Therefore, the total duration of the research is:
   \[
   \text{Total Duration} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ months}
   \]

3. **Months Beyond Initial Funding**: Since the initial funding covers the first 5 months, we need to calculate the funding for the remaining months:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Months} = 50 - 5 = 45 \text{ months}
   \]

4. **Funding for Remaining Months**: The problem states that every month after the first 5 months costs 50% more than the previous month. We need to calculate the funding for each of these 45 months.

   - **First Month After Initial Funding**: The first month after the initial funding will cost 50% more than the last month of the initial funding. Since the last month of the initial funding is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000, the cost for the first month after the initial funding is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Month 6} = 20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000
     \]

   - **Subsequent Months**: Each subsequent month will also cost 50% more than the previous month. Therefore, we can express the cost for each month as follows:
     - Month 7: \( 30,000 \times 1.5 = 45,000 \)
     - Month 8: \( 45,000 \times 1.5 = 67,500 \)
     - Month 9: \( 67,500 \times 1.5 = 101,250 \)
     - Month 10: \( 101,250 \times 1.5 = 151,875 \)
     - And so on...

   This forms a geometric series where the first term \( a = 30,000 \) and the common ratio \( r = 1.5 \).

5. **Sum of the Geometric Series**: The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = a \frac{(r^n - 1)}{r - 1}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms. In our case, \( n = 45 \), \( a = 30,000 \), and \( r = 1.5 \).

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   S_{45} = 30,000 \frac{(1.5^{45} - 1)}{1.5 - 1}
   \]

   First, we need to calculate \( 1.5^{45} \):
   \[
   1.5^{45} \approx 11222.741
   \]
   (This value can be computed using a calculator or programming tool.)

   Now substituting back into the sum formula:
   \[
   S_{45} = 30,000 \frac{(11222.741 - 1)}{0.5} = 30,000 \times 22445.482 = 673364460
   \]

6. **Total Cost of Research**: Finally, we add the initial funding to the total cost of the remaining months:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Initial Funding} + S_{45} = 100,000 + 673364460 = 673464460
   \]

Thus, the total cost of John's research is approximately:
\[
\boxed{673464460}
\]

Response:
To determine the total cost of John's research, we will break the problem down into manageable steps.

1. **Initial Funding**: John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months. This means that for the first 5 months, the total funding is:
   \[
   \text{Initial Funding} = 100,000
   \]

2. **Total Duration of Research**: The research ends up taking 10 times longer than initially planned. Since the initial plan was for 5 months, the total duration of the research is:
   \[
   \text{Total Duration} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ months}
   \]

3. **Months Beyond Initial Funding**: Since the initial funding covers the first 5 months, we need to calculate the funding required for the remaining months:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Months} = 50 - 5 = 45 \text{ months}
   \]

4. **Funding Increase**: After the first 5 months, the funding required each month increases by 50%. We need to calculate the monthly funding for the months after the initial 5 months. The funding for the first 5 months is:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Funding for First 5 Months} = \frac{100,000}{5} = 20,000 \text{ per month}
   \]

   For the months after the first 5 months, the funding per month will be:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Funding After 5 Months} = 20,000 + 0.5 \times 20,000 = 20,000 + 10,000 = 30,000 \text{ per month}
   \]

5. **Total Funding for Remaining Months**: Now we can calculate the total funding required for the remaining 45 months:
   \[
   \text{Total Funding for Remaining Months} = 30,000 \times 45
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Funding for Remaining Months} = 1,350,000
   \]

6. **Total Cost of Research**: Finally, we add the initial funding to the funding for the remaining months to find the total cost of the research:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Initial Funding} + \text{Total Funding for Remaining Months}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 100,000 + 1,350,000 = 1,450,000
   \]

Thus, the total cost of John's research is:
\[
\boxed{1,450,000}
\]

Response:
To determine the total cost of John's research, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Funding**: John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months. This means that for these 5 months, the funding is fixed at $100,000.

2. **Total Duration of Research**: The problem states that the research takes 10 times longer than the initial 5 months. Therefore, the total duration of the research is:
   \[
   \text{Total Duration} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ months}
   \]

3. **Months Beyond Initial Funding**: Since the initial funding covers the first 5 months, we need to calculate the funding for the remaining months:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Months} = 50 - 5 = 45 \text{ months}
   \]

4. **Funding for Remaining Months**: The problem states that every month after the first 5 months requires 50% more funding than the previous month. We need to determine how much funding is needed for each of these 45 months.

   - Let's denote the funding for the 6th month as \( x \). Since the funding increases by 50% each month, we can express the funding for the subsequent months as follows:
     - 6th month: \( x \)
     - 7th month: \( x + 0.5x = 1.5x \)
     - 8th month: \( 1.5x + 0.5(1.5x) = 1.5x + 0.75x = 2.25x \)
     - 9th month: \( 2.25x + 0.5(2.25x) = 2.25x + 1.125x = 3.375x \)
     - Continuing this pattern, we can see that the funding for the \( n \)-th month after the 5th month can be expressed as:
       \[
       \text{Funding for month } n = x \cdot (1.5)^{(n-6)}
       \]

5. **Total Funding for Remaining Months**: We need to sum the funding for all 45 months from the 6th to the 50th month. This is a geometric series where:
   - The first term \( a = x \)
   - The common ratio \( r = 1.5 \)
   - The number of terms \( n = 45 \)

   The sum \( S_n \) of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   S_{45} = x \frac{1 - (1.5)^{45}}{1 - 1.5} = x \frac{1 - (1.5)^{45}}{-0.5} = -2x (1 - (1.5)^{45})
   \]

6. **Total Cost of Research**: The total cost of the research is the sum of the initial funding and the funding for the remaining months:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 100,000 + S_{45}
   \]
   Substituting \( S_{45} \):
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 100,000 - 2x (1 - (1.5)^{45})
   \]

7. **Determining \( x \)**: We need to determine the value of \( x \). Since the problem does not provide a specific value for the funding in the 6th month, we cannot calculate a numerical answer without additional information. However, we can express the total cost in terms of \( x \).

8. **Final Expression**: The total cost of John's research can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 100,000 - 2x (1 - (1.5)^{45})
   \]

Since we do not have a specific value for \( x \), we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, if we assume \( x \) is the funding for the 6th month, we can calculate the total cost based on that assumption.

**Final Answer**: The total cost of John's research is \( 100,000 - 2x (1 - (1.5)^{45}) \), where \( x \) is the funding for the 6th month. Without the value of \( x \), we cannot provide a specific numerical answer.
