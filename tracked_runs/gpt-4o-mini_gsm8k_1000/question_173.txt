Question:
Fireman Frank has 200 shoes. If he gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and gains 15 new pairs on Wednesday and 30 pairs on Friday, how many shoes will he have on Sunday if he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday?


Reference Answer:
If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.
When he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.
Since a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.
The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300
On Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120
#### 120

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined in the question and perform the necessary calculations.

1. **Initial Number of Shoes**: Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. **Gains on Monday**: On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, we calculate the total number of shoes he gains on Monday:
   \[
   \text{Shoes gained on Monday} = 5 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes/pair} = 10 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   Now, we add this to his initial number of shoes:
   \[
   \text{Total shoes after Monday} = 200 + 10 = 210 \text{ shoes}
   \]

3. **Gains on Wednesday**: On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes. Again, we calculate the total number of shoes gained:
   \[
   \text{Shoes gained on Wednesday} = 15 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes/pair} = 30 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   We add this to the total number of shoes after Monday:
   \[
   \text{Total shoes after Wednesday} = 210 + 30 = 240 \text{ shoes}
   \]

4. **Gains on Friday**: On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes. We calculate the total number of shoes gained:
   \[
   \text{Shoes gained on Friday} = 30 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes/pair} = 60 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   We add this to the total number of shoes after Wednesday:
   \[
   \text{Total shoes after Friday} = 240 + 60 = 300 \text{ shoes}
   \]

5. **Loss on Saturday**: On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. We subtract this from the total number of shoes after Friday:
   \[
   \text{Total shoes after Saturday} = 300 - 180 = 120 \text{ shoes}
   \]

6. **Final Count on Sunday**: After all the transactions, the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has on Sunday is:
   \[
   \text{Total shoes on Sunday} = 120 \text{ shoes}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]
