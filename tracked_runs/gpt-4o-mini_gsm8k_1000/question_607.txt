Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of fish caught by Naomi**: 
   We know from the problem that Naomi caught 17 fish.

2. **Determine how many fish Darren caught**: 
   The problem states that Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi. We can express this mathematically as:
   \[
   \text{Darren's fish} = \text{Naomi's fish} - 6
   \]
   Substituting the number of fish Naomi caught:
   \[
   \text{Darren's fish} = 17 - 6 = 11
   \]
   So, Darren caught 11 fish.

3. **Calculate how many fish Tommy caught**: 
   According to the problem, Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3
   \]
   Substituting the number of fish Darren caught:
   \[
   \text{Tommy's fish} = 11 + 3 = 14
   \]
   Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

4. **Final Answer**: 
   After working through the problem step by step, we conclude that Tommy caught **14 fish**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]
