Question ID: 1049

Question:
There are 50 books in a small library. Half of them are written in English, and 10% in German. All others are written in Spanish. How many Spanish books are there?


Reference Answer:
Half of the books are in English, which means 50 * 0.5 = <<50*0.5=25>>25 books.
German books make up to 10%, which means there are 10/100 * 50 = <<10/100*50=5>>5 of them.
So as a result there are 50 - 25 - 5 = <<50-25-5=20>>20 Spanish books in the library.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of books**: 
   We know there are a total of 50 books in the library.

2. **Calculate the number of English books**: 
   According to the problem, half of the books are written in English. 
   \[
   \text{Number of English books} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of German books**: 
   The problem states that 10% of the books are written in German. 
   To find 10% of 50, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Number of German books} = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of Spanish books**: 
   We know that all the remaining books are written in Spanish. To find the number of Spanish books, we can subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:
   \[
   \text{Number of Spanish books} = \text{Total books} - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books})
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the number of Spanish books in the library is 
   \[
   \boxed{20}
   \]
