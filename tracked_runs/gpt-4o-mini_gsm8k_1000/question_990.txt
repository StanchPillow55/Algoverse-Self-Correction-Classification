Question ID: 685

Question:
Catherine goes to the grocery store. She buys 1 kilo of apples for $4, 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo, and 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo. How many dollars does she pay in total?


Reference Answer:
1 kilo of apples costs $<<1*4=4>>4.
2 kilos of bananas costs 2 * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
2 kilos of oranges costs 2 * 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.
She pays 4 + 4 + 6= $<<4+4+6=14>>14 in total.
#### 14

Response:
To find out how much Catherine pays in total at the grocery store, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit she buys and then sum those costs.

1. **Cost of Apples**:
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples for $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of Apples} = 1 \text{ kilo} \times 4 \text{ dollars/kilo} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of Bananas**:
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo.
   - Therefore, the total cost for bananas is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of Bananas} = 2 \text{ kilos} \times 2 \text{ dollars/kilo} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of Oranges**:
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo.
   - Therefore, the total cost for oranges is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of Oranges} = 2 \text{ kilos} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kilo} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total Cost**:
   - Now, we sum the costs of all the fruits:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Apples} + \text{Cost of Bananas} + \text{Cost of Oranges}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we calculated:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 4 \text{ dollars} + 4 \text{ dollars} + 6 \text{ dollars} = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Catherine pays at the grocery store is **14 dollars**.

Final answer: **14 dollars**.

Response:
To find out how much Catherine pays in total for her groceries, we will calculate the cost of each type of fruit she buys and then sum those amounts.

1. **Cost of Apples**:
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples for $4.
   - Total cost for apples = \( 1 \, \text{kilo} \times 4 \, \text{dollars/kilo} = 4 \, \text{dollars} \).

2. **Cost of Bananas**:
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas at $2 per kilo.
   - Total cost for bananas = \( 2 \, \text{kilos} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/kilo} = 4 \, \text{dollars} \).

3. **Cost of Oranges**:
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges at $3 per kilo.
   - Total cost for oranges = \( 2 \, \text{kilos} \times 3 \, \text{dollars/kilo} = 6 \, \text{dollars} \).

4. **Total Cost**:
   - Now, we add the costs of all the fruits:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of Apples} + \text{Cost of Bananas} + \text{Cost of Oranges}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4 \, \text{dollars} + 4 \, \text{dollars} + 6 \, \text{dollars} = 14 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Catherine pays at the grocery store is **$14**.

To find the total amount Catherine pays at the grocery store, we will calculate the cost of each type of fruit she buys and then sum those costs.

1. **Cost of Apples**:
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples for $4.
   - Cost of apples = 1 kilo × $4/kilo = $4.

2. **Cost of Bananas**:
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas at $2 per kilo.
   - Cost of bananas = 2 kilos × $2/kilo = $4.

3. **Cost of Oranges**:
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges at $3 per kilo.
   - Cost of oranges = 2 kilos × $3/kilo = $6.

4. **Total Cost**:
   - Now, we add the costs of all the fruits:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Apples} + \text{Cost of Bananas} + \text{Cost of Oranges}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 4 + 4 + 6 = 14.
   \]

Thus, Catherine pays a total of **$14**. 

Final answer: **$14**.
