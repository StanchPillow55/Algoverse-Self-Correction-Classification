Question:
The Llesis family drove and hiked 6 hours to their vacation spot. They drove an average of 50 miles per hour and hiked an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drive. If it took them 1.5 hours to hike, how far was their vacation spot?


Reference Answer:
Half the average speed of Llesis family driving is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour.
Hence, their average speed hiking was 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 miles per hour.
So, they hiked 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 miles.
It took them a total of 6 - 1.5 = <<6-1.5=4.5>>4.5 hours driving.
So, they drove 50 x 4.5 = <<50*4.5=225>>225 miles.
Therefore, their vacation spot was 30 + 225 = <<30+225=255>>255 miles far.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the driving speed**: 
   The problem states that the Llesis family drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

2. **Determine the hiking speed**: 
   The hiking speed is described as 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 
   - Half of the driving speed: \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the hiking speed is: 
   \[
   25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour}.
   \]

3. **Determine the time spent driving**: 
   The total time for the trip is 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking. 
   - Time spent driving: 
   \[
   6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ hours}.
   \]

4. **Calculate the distance driven**: 
   Using the formula for distance, which is speed multiplied by time, we can find the distance they drove:
   \[
   \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles}.
   \]

5. **Calculate the distance hiked**: 
   Similarly, we can calculate the distance they hiked:
   \[
   \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}.
   \]

6. **Calculate the total distance to the vacation spot**: 
   The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}.
   \]

Thus, the distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot is \( \boxed{255} \) miles.
