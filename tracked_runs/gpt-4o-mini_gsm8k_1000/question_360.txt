Question ID: 1292

Question:
Jackie grew 3" over the summer.  She is now 2" shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert.  If Albert is 36" tall, how tall was Jackie before summer?


Reference Answer:
Anne is twice the size of Albert, who is 36", so Anne is 2*36 = <<72=72>>72" tall
Anne is 72" tall and Jackie is 2" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72-2 = <<72-2=70>>70" tall
Jackie is currently 70" tall and grew 3" over summer, so before summer she was 70-3= <<70-3=67>>67" tall
#### 67

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine Jackie's height before she grew 3 inches over the summer. We will follow the information given step by step.

1. **Determine Albert's height**: 
   We know from the problem that Albert is 36 inches tall.

2. **Determine Anne's height**: 
   The problem states that Anne is twice the size of Albert. Therefore, we can calculate Anne's height as follows:
   \[
   \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times \text{Albert's height} = 2 \times 36 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Determine Jackie's height after summer**: 
   The problem states that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. Therefore, we can calculate Jackie's height after summer:
   \[
   \text{Jackie's height after summer} = \text{Anne's height} - 2 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} - 2 \text{ inches} = 70 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Determine Jackie's height before summer**: 
   We know that Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer. To find her height before summer, we subtract the growth from her height after summer:
   \[
   \text{Jackie's height before summer} = \text{Jackie's height after summer} - 3 \text{ inches} = 70 \text{ inches} - 3 \text{ inches} = 67 \text{ inches}
   \]

Thus, Jackie's height before summer was **67 inches**.

Final answer: Jackie was 67 inches tall before summer.
