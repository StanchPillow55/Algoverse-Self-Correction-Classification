Question ID: 1013

Question:
Janet gets a job as a waitress.  She makes $10 an hour from wages and another $15 an hour from tips.  She wants to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment.  If she works 40 hours a week how many weeks will she need to work to save the down payment?


Reference Answer:
She makes 10+15=$<<10+15=25>>25 an hour from working
That means each week she makes 25*40=$<<25*40=1000>>1000
She wants to make 10000*.2=$<<10000*.2=2000>>2000
So she needs to work 2000/1000=<<2000/1000=2>>2 weeks

Response:
To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save for the down payment on a car, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total hourly earnings**: 
   Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips. Therefore, her total earnings per hour can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total hourly earnings} = \text{Wages} + \text{Tips} = 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

2. **Calculate weekly earnings**: 
   Janet works 40 hours a week. To find her weekly earnings, we multiply her total hourly earnings by the number of hours she works in a week:

   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings} = \text{Total hourly earnings} \times \text{Hours per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week}
   \]

3. **Determine the down payment amount**: 
   Janet wants to save up 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. We calculate 20% of $10,000:

   \[
   \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of weeks needed to save the down payment**: 
   To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total down payment by her weekly earnings:

   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Weekly earnings}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks}
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Janet needs to work for **2 weeks** to save the down payment for the car.

Thus, the final answer is:

**2 weeks**
