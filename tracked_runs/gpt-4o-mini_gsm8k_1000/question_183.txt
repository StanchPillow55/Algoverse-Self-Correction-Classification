Question ID: 155

Question:
Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day. Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is two feet long. If Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, how long will they be in feet?


Reference Answer:
First find the total length of the rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = <<300*4=1200>>1200 inches
Then find the total length of the croissants: 120 rolls * 6 inches/roll = <<120*6=720>>720 inches
Then add the length of the rolls and croissants to find the total length in inches: 1200 inches + 720 inches = <<1200+720=1920>>1920 inches
Then divide the total length by 12 inches per foot to find the length in feet: 1920 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1920/12=160>>160 feet
Then find the total length of the baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = <<60*2=120>>120 feet
Then add the length of the other baked goods in feet to find the total length: 120 feet + 160 feet = <<120+160=280>>280 feet

Response:
To find the total length of all the baked goods that Bill bakes, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good and then sum them up. Finally, we will convert the total length into feet.

### Step 1: Calculate the total length of the rolls

Bill bakes 300 rolls, and each roll is 4 inches long. 

To find the total length of the rolls, we multiply the number of rolls by the length of each roll:

\[
\text{Total length of rolls} = \text{Number of rolls} \times \text{Length of each roll}
\]
\[
\text{Total length of rolls} = 300 \times 4 = 1200 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants

Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants, and each croissant is 6 inches long.

To find the total length of the croissants, we multiply the number of croissants by the length of each croissant:

\[
\text{Total length of croissants} = \text{Number of croissants} \times \text{Length of each croissant}
\]
\[
\text{Total length of croissants} = 120 \times 6 = 720 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total length of the baguettes

Bill bakes 60 baguettes, and each baguette is 2 feet long. Since we need to convert feet to inches for consistency, we know that 1 foot = 12 inches. Therefore, each baguette is:

\[
2 \text{ feet} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ inches}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total length of the baguettes:

\[
\text{Total length of baguettes} = \text{Number of baguettes} \times \text{Length of each baguette}
\]
\[
\text{Total length of baguettes} = 60 \times 24 = 1440 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total length of all baked goods

Now we sum the total lengths of rolls, croissants, and baguettes:

\[
\text{Total length} = \text{Total length of rolls} + \text{Total length of croissants} + \text{Total length of baguettes}
\]
\[
\text{Total length} = 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 5: Convert the total length from inches to feet

To convert inches to feet, we divide the total length in inches by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[
\text{Total length in feet} = \frac{\text{Total length in inches}}{12}
\]
\[
\text{Total length in feet} = \frac{3360}{12} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

### Final Answer

The total length of all the baked goods put end to end is **280 feet**.
