Question ID: 701

Question:
Aiden and 12 of his friends are going to see a film at the cinema, and meet up with 7 more friends there. They each save a seat and then buy enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Each seat has enough room to hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks. If drinks and snacks cost $2 each, how much money, in dollars, has the group spent overall on snacks and drinks?


Reference Answer:
Including Aiden, the whole group saves 1 + 12 + 7 = <<1+12+7=20>>20 seats.
In total, the seats can hold 2 drinks * 20 seats = <<2*20=40>>40 drinks.
In total, the seats can hold 3 snacks * 20 seats = <<3*20=60>>60 snacks.
So in total, the group buys 40 drinks + 60 snacks = <<40+60=100>>100 items.
As snacks and drinks cost $2 each, the group has spent 100 items * $2 = $<<100*2=200>>200 overall.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many people are in Aiden's group, how many drinks and snacks they buy, and then calculate the total cost.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of people

Aiden has 12 friends, and they meet up with 7 more friends at the cinema. 

- Aiden: 1
- Friends with Aiden: 12
- Friends met at the cinema: 7

Total number of people:
\[
1 + 12 + 7 = 20
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of drinks and snacks per person

According to the problem, each seat can hold:
- 1 person
- 2 drinks
- 3 snacks

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of drinks and snacks for the group

Since there are 20 people in total, we can calculate the total number of drinks and snacks as follows:

**Total drinks:**
\[
\text{Total drinks} = \text{Number of people} \times \text{Drinks per person} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ drinks}
\]

**Total snacks:**
\[
\text{Total snacks} = \text{Number of people} \times \text{Snacks per person} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ snacks}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of drinks and snacks

The cost of each drink and each snack is $2. Therefore, we can calculate the total cost for drinks and snacks separately and then sum them up.

**Cost of drinks:**
\[
\text{Cost of drinks} = \text{Total drinks} \times \text{Cost per drink} = 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Cost of snacks:**
\[
\text{Cost of snacks} = \text{Total snacks} \times \text{Cost per snack} = 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the overall total cost

Now, we can find the total amount spent on both drinks and snacks:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of drinks} + \text{Cost of snacks} = 80 + 120 = 200 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of money that the group has spent overall on snacks and drinks is:
\[
\boxed{200} \text{ dollars}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of people in the group.**
2. **Calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed.**
3. **Calculate the total cost of the drinks and snacks.**

### Step 1: Determine the total number of people in the group

Aiden has 12 friends, and they meet up with 7 more friends at the cinema. 

- Aiden: 1
- Friends with Aiden: 12
- Friends met at the cinema: 7

Total number of people = Aiden + Friends with Aiden + Friends met at the cinema
\[
\text{Total number of people} = 1 + 12 + 7 = 20
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed

Each person has a seat that can hold:
- 1 person
- 2 drinks
- 3 snacks

Now, we will calculate the total number of drinks and snacks for 20 people.

**Total drinks:**
\[
\text{Total drinks} = \text{Number of people} \times \text{Drinks per person} = 20 \times 2 = 40
\]

**Total snacks:**
\[
\text{Total snacks} = \text{Number of people} \times \text{Snacks per person} = 20 \times 3 = 60
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the drinks and snacks

The cost of each drink and each snack is $2.

**Total cost for drinks:**
\[
\text{Total cost for drinks} = \text{Total drinks} \times \text{Cost per drink} = 40 \times 2 = 80
\]

**Total cost for snacks:**
\[
\text{Total cost for snacks} = \text{Total snacks} \times \text{Cost per snack} = 60 \times 2 = 120
\]

**Total cost for drinks and snacks:**
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for drinks} + \text{Total cost for snacks} = 80 + 120 = 200
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of money the group has spent overall on snacks and drinks is \(\boxed{200}\) dollars.
