Question ID: 1235

Question:
Michael is traveling on the interstate at an average speed of 50km/hr (taking into account all the necessary stops for gas, relaxation, etc.). If he goes on like this for 3 days, and the distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km, what percentage of this distance has he covered?


Reference Answer:
There are 24 hours in each day, so he has been traveling for a total of 3*24 = <<24*3=72>>72 hours
At a rate of 50km/hr he has covered 50*72 = <<50*72=3600>>3600 km
3600km as a percentage of 6000km is (3600/6000)*100% = 60%
#### 60

Response:
To determine the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days at an average speed of 50 km/hr.

### Step 1: Calculate the total travel time in hours
Michael travels for 3 days. To convert days into hours:
\[
\text{Total hours} = 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance traveled
Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled using the formula:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]
Substituting the values we have:
\[
\text{Distance} = 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the total distance covered
The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. We need to find out what percentage of this distance 3600 km represents. The formula for percentage is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100
\]
In this case, the "Part" is the distance Michael has traveled (3600 km), and the "Whole" is the total distance (6000 km):
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100
\]

### Step 4: Perform the calculation
Calculating the fraction:
\[
\frac{3600}{6000} = 0.6
\]
Now, converting this to a percentage:
\[
0.6 \times 100 = 60\%
\]

### Final Answer
Michael has covered **60%** of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

Response:
To determine the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.**
   - Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr.
   - We need to find out how many hours he travels in 3 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Total hours in 3 days} = 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total distance traveled.**
   - Using the formula for distance, which is:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - We can substitute in Michael's speed and the total time:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km}
     \]

3. **Determine the percentage of the total distance covered.**
   - The total distance from Alaska to Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100
     \]

4. **Calculate the percentage.**
   - First, we simplify the fraction:
     \[
     \frac{3600}{6000} = 0.6
     \]
   - Now, multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
     \[
     0.6 \times 100 = 60\%
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Michael has covered **60%** of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

Response:
To determine what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days at an average speed of 50 km/hr.

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled in 3 days.

1. **Calculate the number of hours in 3 days:**
   \[
   \text{Number of hours in 3 days} = 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Average speed} \times \text{Total time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the percentage of the total distance covered.

1. **Identify the total distance between Alaska and Texas:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 6000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Calculate the percentage of the distance covered:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage covered} = \left( 0.6 \right) \times 100 = 60\%
   \]

### Final Answer:
Michael has covered **60%** of the distance between Alaska and Texas.
