Question ID: 325

Question:
Jaime is a computer programmer for a company that currently has employed 100 people. Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. If the number of Junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and they are each paid $2000 per month, calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.


Reference Answer:
The number of junior programmers in the company is 2/5*100 = <<2/5*100=40>>40
The total amount of money that the company pays to the Junior employees is $2000*40 = $<<2000*40=80000>>80000
There are also 100-40 = <<100-40=60>>60 senior programmers in the company.
The senior programmers are paid $2000+$400 = $<<2000+400=2400>>2400 each.
Senior programmers at the company receive 2400*60 = $<<2400*60=144000>>144000 combined.
All the programmers in the company are paid a combined salary of 144000+80000 = <<144000+80000=224000>>224000

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers.**
2. **Calculate the number of senior programmers.**
3. **Calculate the monthly salary for senior programmers.**
4. **Calculate the total monthly salary for all programmers.**

### Step 1: Determine the number of junior programmers

The problem states that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees. The company has a total of 100 employees.

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of senior programmers

Since the total number of employees is 100 and we have found that there are 40 junior programmers, we can find the number of senior programmers by subtracting the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees.

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the monthly salary for senior programmers

The problem states that junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we can calculate the salary for senior programmers as follows:

\[
\text{Salary of senior programmers} = \text{Salary of junior programmers} + 400 = 2000 + 400 = 2400
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total monthly salary for all programmers

Now we can calculate the total monthly salary for junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

**Total salary for junior programmers:**

\[
\text{Total salary for junior programmers} = \text{Number of junior programmers} \times \text{Salary of junior programmers}
\]
\[
= 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

**Total salary for senior programmers:**

\[
\text{Total salary for senior programmers} = \text{Number of senior programmers} \times \text{Salary of senior programmers}
\]
\[
= 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

**Total salary for all programmers:**

\[
\text{Total salary for all programmers} = \text{Total salary for junior programmers} + \text{Total salary for senior programmers}
\]
\[
= 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[
\boxed{224000}
\]
