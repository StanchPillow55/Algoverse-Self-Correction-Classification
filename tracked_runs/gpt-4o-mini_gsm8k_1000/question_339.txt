Question ID: 632

Question:
Max bought stamps at the post office. Some of the stamps had a snowflake design, some had a truck design, and some had a rose design. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. How many stamps did Max buy in all?


Reference Answer:
Max bought 16 + 3 = <<16+3=19>>19 truck stamps.
Max bought 19 â€“ 9 = <<19-9=10>>10 rose stamps.
In total Max bought 16 snowflake + 19 truck + 10 rose stamps = <<16+19+10=45>>45 stamps.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will define variables for the number of each type of stamp Max bought and then set up equations based on the information provided.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the number of snowflake stamps.
   - Let \( T \) be the number of truck stamps.
   - Let \( R \) be the number of rose stamps.

2. **Use the information given:**
   - Max bought 16 snowflake stamps: 
     \[
     S = 16
     \]
   - He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps:
     \[
     T = S + 3
     \]
   - He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps:
     \[
     R = T - 9
     \]

3. **Substitute the value of \( S \) into the equation for \( T \):**
   \[
   T = 16 + 3 = 19
   \]

4. **Now substitute the value of \( T \) into the equation for \( R \):**
   \[
   R = 19 - 9 = 10
   \]

5. **Now we have the number of each type of stamp:**
   - Snowflake stamps \( S = 16 \)
   - Truck stamps \( T = 19 \)
   - Rose stamps \( R = 10 \)

6. **Calculate the total number of stamps:**
   \[
   \text{Total stamps} = S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10
   \]

7. **Perform the addition:**
   \[
   16 + 19 = 35
   \]
   \[
   35 + 10 = 45
   \]

8. **Final answer:**
   Max bought a total of \( \boxed{45} \) stamps.
