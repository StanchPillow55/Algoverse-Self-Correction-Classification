Question ID: 647

Question:
Bill is trying to dig a well in his backyard. He can dig 4 feet/hour through soil and half that fast through clay. If he has to dig through 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay, how long will it take him to dig the well?


Reference Answer:
First find how fast Bill can dig through clay: 4 feet/hour / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 feet/hour
Then find how long he spends digging through clay in total: 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = <<8/2=4>>4 hours
Then find how long he spends digging through soil in total: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = <<24/4=6>>6 hours
Then add the time he spends digging through soil and clay to find the total digging time: 4 hours + 6 hours = <<4+6=10>>10 hours

Response:
To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes him to dig through both the soil and the clay separately, and then sum those times.

1. **Calculate the time to dig through the soil:**
   - Bill digs through soil at a rate of 4 feet per hour.
   - He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
   - We can use the formula for time, which is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values for soil:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time to dig through the clay:**
   - Bill digs through clay at half the speed of soil, which is:
     \[
     \text{Rate}_{\text{clay}} = \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour}
     \]
   - He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
   - Using the same formula for time:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Now we add the time taken to dig through the soil and the clay:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{soil}} + \text{Time}_{\text{clay}} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is **10 hours**. 

Final answer: **10 hours**.
