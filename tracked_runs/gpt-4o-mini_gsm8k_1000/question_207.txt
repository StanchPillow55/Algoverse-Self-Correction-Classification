Question ID: 46

Question:
Candice put 80 post-it notes in her purse before she headed out to her job at the coffee shop.  On her way, she stopped off at the store and purchased a package of Post-it notes;  At work, she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.  If she had 23 post-it notes remaining overall, how many Post-it notes were in the package that she purchased?


Reference Answer:
Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.
Then, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.
And if she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left, then 80+x=220+23
Subtracting 80 from each side of the equation, we see that x=220+23-80=<<220+23-80=163>>163 Post-it notes.
#### 163

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased. We will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Quantity of Post-it Notes**: 
   Candice started with 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

2. **Post-it Notes Used**: 
   At work, she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, the number of Post-it notes she used is 220.

3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: 
   After using some Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. 

4. **Total Post-it Notes After Purchase**: 
   Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. After buying the package, the total number of Post-it notes she had is:
   \[
   80 + x
   \]

5. **Equation Setup**: 
   After using 220 Post-it notes, the number of Post-it notes she has left can be expressed as:
   \[
   (80 + x) - 220
   \]
   We know that this quantity equals the number of Post-it notes remaining, which is 23. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   (80 + x) - 220 = 23
   \]

6. **Solving the Equation**:
   First, simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   x - 140 = 23
   \]
   Now, add 140 to both sides:
   \[
   x = 23 + 140
   \]
   \[
   x = 163
   \]

7. **Conclusion**: 
   The number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is \( \boxed{163} \). 

This solution is verified by checking that if she started with 80, bought 163, used 220, and ended with 23, all calculations are consistent with the problem statement.
