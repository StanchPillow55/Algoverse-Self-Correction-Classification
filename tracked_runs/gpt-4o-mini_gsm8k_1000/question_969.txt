Question ID: 872

Question:
Seven bottles of soda cost $21.00 while 4 bottles of water cost $8. If David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, how much will that cost?


Reference Answer:
One bottle of soda costs $21.00/7 = $<<21/7=3.00>>3.00.
Three bottles of soda cost $3.00 x 3 = $<<3*3=9.00>>9.00.
One bottle of water costs $8.00/4 = $<<8/4=2.00>>2.00.
Two bottles of water cost $2.00x 2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00.
Therefore, 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water cost $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

Response:
To solve the problem, we first need to determine the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water based on the information given.

1. **Calculate the cost of one bottle of soda:**
   - We know that 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00.
   - To find the cost of one bottle of soda, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one bottle of soda} = \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of one bottle of soda is $3.00.

2. **Calculate the cost of one bottle of water:**
   - We know that 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - To find the cost of one bottle of water, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one bottle of water} = \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of one bottle of water is $2.00.

3. **Calculate the total cost for David's purchase:**
   - David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.
   - First, we calculate the cost for the soda:
     \[
     \text{Cost for 3 bottles of soda} = 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00
     \]
   - Next, we calculate the cost for the water:
     \[
     \text{Cost for 2 bottles of water} = 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00
     \]
   - Now, we add the costs of the soda and water together to find the total cost:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The total cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is **$13.00**.
