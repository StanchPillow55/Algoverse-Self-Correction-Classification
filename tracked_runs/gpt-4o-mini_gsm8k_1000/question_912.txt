Question ID: 889

Question:
Joelle has 5 orchids and 4 African daisies on her balcony.  If the orchids have 5 petals and daisies have 10 petals, how many more petals do the daisies have compared to the orchids?


Reference Answer:
The number of petals on orchids is 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25.
The number of petals on daisies is 4 x 10 = <<4*10=40>>40.
Daisy petals outnumber orchid petals by 40 - 25 = <<40-25=15>>15.

Response:
To determine how many more petals the African daisies have compared to the orchids, we will first calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:**
   - Joelle has 5 orchids.
   - Each orchid has 5 petals.
   - Therefore, the total number of petals from the orchids can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total petals from orchids} = \text{Number of orchids} \times \text{Petals per orchid} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ petals}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies:**
   - Joelle has 4 African daisies.
   - Each African daisy has 10 petals.
   - Therefore, the total number of petals from the daisies can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total petals from daisies} = \text{Number of daisies} \times \text{Petals per daisy} = 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ petals}
     \]

3. **Calculate the difference in the number of petals:**
   - Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids:
     \[
     \text{Difference in petals} = \text{Total petals from daisies} - \text{Total petals from orchids} = 40 - 25 = 15
     \]

Thus, the African daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

**Final Answer:**
The daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.
