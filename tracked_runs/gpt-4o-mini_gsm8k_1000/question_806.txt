Question:
Roy has saved 40% more in money earned by chores than his brother Anthony.  Anthony has saved $10.00 more than their sister Eva.   Eva has saved $20.00.  How much money does Roy have?


Reference Answer:
Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva who has $20.00 so he has 10+20 = $<<10+20=30.00>>30.00
Roy has saved 40% more than his brother who has $30.00 so Roy has saved .40*30 = $12.00
All total, Roy has 12.00 more than his brother, so he has 12+30 = $<<12+30=42.00>>42.00

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step and calculate the amounts saved by each person.

1. **Determine Eva's Savings:**
   - We know from the problem that Eva has saved $20.00.

   \[
   \text{Eva's savings} = 20.00
   \]

2. **Calculate Anthony's Savings:**
   - According to the problem, Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva.

   \[
   \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10.00
   \]
   \[
   \text{Anthony's savings} = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
   \]

3. **Calculate Roy's Savings:**
   - The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. First, we need to find out what 40% of Anthony's savings is.

   \[
   \text{40% of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times \text{Anthony's savings}
   \]
   \[
   \text{40% of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00
   \]

   - Now, we add this amount to Anthony's savings to find Roy's total savings.

   \[
   \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + \text{40% of Anthony's savings}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Roy's savings} = 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Therefore, the amount of money Roy has saved is:

   \[
   \boxed{42.00}
   \]
