Question:
Mara added 3 slices of cake to a plate that already had 2 slices on it. She was getting hungrier so she tripled the number of slices she currently has. She ate 2 slices and while she was distracted, her friend stole 5 slices off her plate. What number of cake slices remained on the plate?


Reference Answer:
Mara had 3+2=<<3+2=5>>5 slices of cake.
She was hungry and tripled the amount to 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 slices.
She ate a couple, leaving 15-2=<<15-2=13>>13 slices.
Her friend came and stole some which left Mara to 13-5=<<13-5=8>>8 slices.
#### 8

Response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Slices**: 
   Mara starts with 2 slices of cake on her plate.

   \[
   \text{Initial slices} = 2
   \]

2. **Adding Slices**: 
   Mara adds 3 slices to the plate.

   \[
   \text{New slices} = 2 + 3 = 5
   \]

3. **Tripling the Slices**: 
   Mara then triples the number of slices she currently has.

   \[
   \text{Tripled slices} = 5 \times 3 = 15
   \]

4. **Eating Slices**: 
   Mara eats 2 slices from the plate.

   \[
   \text{Slices after eating} = 15 - 2 = 13
   \]

5. **Friend Stealing Slices**: 
   While Mara is distracted, her friend steals 5 slices from her plate.

   \[
   \text{Slices after friend steals} = 13 - 5 = 8
   \]

Now, we can summarize the calculations:

- Started with 2 slices.
- Added 3 slices: \(2 + 3 = 5\).
- Tripled the slices: \(5 \times 3 = 15\).
- Ate 2 slices: \(15 - 2 = 13\).
- Friend stole 5 slices: \(13 - 5 = 8\).

Thus, the final number of cake slices remaining on the plate is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]
