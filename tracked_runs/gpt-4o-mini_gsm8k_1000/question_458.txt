Question:
Cherrie wants to buy Christmas gifts for her 5 friends. 2 of her friends want 5 gifts and the other 3 friends want 2 gifts for themselves. Cherrie goes ahead and buys them and decides to further surprise them by getting 10 more random gifts. How many gifts did Cherrie buy in total?


Reference Answer:
Two of Cherries friends in total want 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 gifts.
Her other three friends will get 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 gifts in total between them.

Response:
To find out how many gifts Cherrie bought in total, we can break the problem down into parts.

1. **Calculate the number of gifts for the first two friends:**
   - Cherrie has 2 friends who each want 5 gifts.
   - Therefore, the total number of gifts for these 2 friends is:
     \[
     2 \text{ friends} \times 5 \text{ gifts per friend} = 10 \text{ gifts}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of gifts for the other three friends:**
   - Cherrie has 3 friends who each want 2 gifts.
   - Therefore, the total number of gifts for these 3 friends is:
     \[
     3 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ gifts per friend} = 6 \text{ gifts}
     \]

3. **Add the gifts for all friends:**
   - Now, we add the gifts for the first two friends and the gifts for the last three friends:
     \[
     10 \text{ gifts} + 6 \text{ gifts} = 16 \text{ gifts}
     \]

4. **Add the additional random gifts:**
   - Cherrie also buys 10 more random gifts. We need to add these to the total we have so far:
     \[
     16 \text{ gifts} + 10 \text{ random gifts} = 26 \text{ gifts}
     \]

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - Therefore, the total number of gifts that Cherrie bought is:
     \[
     \text{Total gifts} = 26
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{26}
\]
