Question ID: 395

Question:
Erica made 20 Valentine's cards to pass out.  Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each.  She passed out 24 to her classmates, 5 to her family and received 17 from family and friends.  How many Valentine's Day cards does Erica now have?


Reference Answer:
Her dad gave her 2 boxes of 15 cards so 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30
She made 20, was given 30 and received 17 so 20+30+17 = <<20+30+17=67>>67 cards
She passed out 24 and gave 5 cards to family and friends so she gave away 24+5 = <<24+5=29>>29 cards
She had 67 cards and gave away 29 cards so 67-29 = <<67-29=38>>38 cards left

Response:
To determine how many Valentine's Day cards Erica has now, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cards Erica initially had.**
   - Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.
   - Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, with each box containing 15 cards.
   - Therefore, the total number of pre-made cards is:
     \[
     2 \text{ boxes} \times 15 \text{ cards/box} = 30 \text{ cards}
     \]
   - Now, we add the cards Erica made to the pre-made cards:
     \[
     20 \text{ cards (made by Erica)} + 30 \text{ cards (from dad)} = 50 \text{ cards (total initially)}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of cards Erica passed out.**
   - Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family:
     \[
     24 \text{ cards (to classmates)} + 5 \text{ cards (to family)} = 29 \text{ cards (passed out)}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cards Erica received.**
   - Erica received 17 cards from family and friends.

4. **Calculate the total number of cards Erica has now.**
   - We start with the total number of cards she initially had, subtract the cards she passed out, and then add the cards she received:
     \[
     50 \text{ cards (initial)} - 29 \text{ cards (passed out)} + 17 \text{ cards (received)} 
     \]
   - Performing the calculations step-by-step:
     \[
     50 - 29 = 21
     \]
     \[
     21 + 17 = 38
     \]

Thus, the total number of Valentine's Day cards Erica has now is \( \boxed{38} \).
