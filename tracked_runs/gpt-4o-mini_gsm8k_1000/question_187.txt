Question:
John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours in the week.  If he spends 50 dollars on gas and wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, how many 25 dollar pens can he buy after he buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each?


Reference Answer:
He earned $50*6=$<<50*6=300>>300
He has $300 - $100 = $<<300-100=200>>200 to spend
He spends 5 * $10 = $<<5*10=50>>50 on pencils
After buying gas and pencils he has $200 - $50 - $50 = $<<200-50-50=100>>100 to spend on pens
He can buy $100/25=<<100/25=4>>4 pens

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate John's total earnings for the week:**
   \[
   \text{Earnings per hour} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Hours worked} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings per hour} \times \text{Hours worked} = 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine John's expenses:**
   - He spends 50 dollars on gas.
   - He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank.

   We will calculate his total expenses:
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = \text{Gas} + \text{Deposit} = 50 + 100 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate John's remaining money after expenses:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Total expenses} = 300 - 150 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the pencils:**
   - John buys 5 pencils at 10 dollars each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine how much money John has left after buying the pencils:**
   \[
   \text{Money left after pencils} = \text{Remaining money} - \text{Cost of pencils} = 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of one pen} = 25 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of pens} = \frac{\text{Money left after pencils}}{\text{Cost of one pen}} = \frac{100}{25} = 4
   \]

Thus, after buying 5 pencils, John can buy **4 pens**.

**Final Answer: 4**
