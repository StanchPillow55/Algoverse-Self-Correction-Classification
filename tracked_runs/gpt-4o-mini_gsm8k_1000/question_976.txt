Question ID: 472

Question:
Matt wants cookies for a snack, but his dad wants him to eat healthily. He tells Matt he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, how many carrot sticks does he have to eat?


Reference Answer:
First subtract the two cookies Matt gets for cleaning his room from the total number he wants to eat: 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3
Then double the number of cookies to find how many carrots sticks he has to eat: 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6.
#### 6

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to establish a relationship between the number of cookies Matt wants to eat and the number of carrot sticks he needs to eat.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( c \) be the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.
   - According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room.

2. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - The number of cookies Matt can have is given by the expression:
     \[
     \frac{c}{2} + 2
     \]
   - We know that Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{c}{2} + 2 = 5
     \]

3. **Solve for \( c \)**:
   - First, we will isolate \( \frac{c}{2} \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     \frac{c}{2} = 5 - 2
     \]
     \[
     \frac{c}{2} = 3
     \]
   - Next, we will multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( c \):
     \[
     c = 3 \times 2
     \]
     \[
     c = 6
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Matt needs to eat **6 carrot sticks** in order to have a total of 5 cookies.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
