Question:
A plague infects ten people. Every day, each infected person infects six others. How many people are infected after three days?


Reference Answer:
On the first day, the original ten people infect six people each, so 10 * 6 = <<10*6=60>>60 more people are infected.
There are 10 + 60 = <<10+60=70>>70 infected people after the first day.
On the second day, 70 * 6 = <<70*6=420>>420 more people are infected.
There are 70 + 420 = <<70+420=490>>490 infected people after the second day.
On the third day, 490 * 6 = 2940 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 490 + 2940 = 3430 infected people after three days.

Response:
To solve the problem of how many people are infected after three days, we need to analyze the spread of the infection step by step.

1. **Initial Condition**: We start with 10 infected people.

2. **Daily Infection Rate**: Each infected person infects 6 new people every day.

3. **Calculating Daily Infections**:
   - **Day 0**: Initially, there are 10 infected people.
   - **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 new people.
     \[
     \text{New infections on Day 1} = 10 \times 6 = 60
     \]
     Total infected by the end of Day 1:
     \[
     \text{Total infected} = 10 + 60 = 70
     \]

   - **Day 2**: Now, we have 70 infected people (the original 10 plus the 60 new ones). Each of these 70 infected people will infect 6 new people.
     \[
     \text{New infections on Day 2} = 70 \times 6 = 420
     \]
     Total infected by the end of Day 2:
     \[
     \text{Total infected} = 70 + 420 = 490
     \]

   - **Day 3**: Now, we have 490 infected people. Each of these will infect 6 new people.
     \[
     \text{New infections on Day 3} = 490 \times 6 = 2940
     \]
     Total infected by the end of Day 3:
     \[
     \text{Total infected} = 490 + 2940 = 3430
     \]

4. **Final Calculation**: After three days, the total number of infected people is 3430.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3430}
\]
