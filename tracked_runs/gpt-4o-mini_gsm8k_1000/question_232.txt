Question ID: 357

Question:
Morgan's dad said that she had $90 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. A round of mini-golf is $5. The Go-karts cost $10 a ride. How many friends can she invite?


Reference Answer:
The go karts will cost $20 per person because 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20
Each person costs $30 because 5 + 5 + 20 = <<5+5+20=30>>30
Three total people can attend because 90 / 30 = <<90/30=3>>3
She can invite 2 friends because 3 - 1 =<<3-1=2>>2

Response:
To determine how many friends Morgan can invite to her birthday party while staying within her $90 budget, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends based on the activities they will participate in.

### Step 1: Determine the costs for each activity

1. **Cost of mini-golf**: 
   - Each round of mini-golf costs $5.
   - If Morgan invites \( f \) friends, the total number of participants (including Morgan) is \( f + 1 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost for mini-golf is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of mini-golf} = 5 \times (f + 1)
     \]

2. **Cost of arcade tokens**:
   - Each person (Morgan and her friends) gets $5 in arcade tokens.
   - The total cost for arcade tokens is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of arcade tokens} = 5 \times (f + 1)
     \]

3. **Cost of go-kart rides**:
   - Each go-kart ride costs $10, and each person will ride twice.
   - Therefore, the total cost for go-kart rides is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of go-karts} = 10 \times 2 \times (f + 1) = 20 \times (f + 1)
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost

Now we can sum up all the costs:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of mini-golf} + \text{Cost of arcade tokens} + \text{Cost of go-karts}
\]
Substituting the expressions we derived:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 5(f + 1) + 5(f + 1) + 20(f + 1)
\]
Combining the terms:
\[
\text{Total cost} = (5 + 5 + 20)(f + 1) = 30(f + 1)
\]

### Step 3: Set up the budget constraint

Morgan has a budget of $90, so we set up the inequality:
\[
30(f + 1) \leq 90
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( f \)

To solve for \( f \), we first divide both sides of the inequality by 30:
\[
f + 1 \leq 3
\]
Next, we subtract 1 from both sides:
\[
f \leq 2
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion

This means that Morgan can invite at most 2 friends. Therefore, the maximum number of friends she can invite is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
