Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of kids in the park, which includes both girls and boys.

1. **Identify the number of girls**: The problem states that there are 6 girls in the park.

   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 6
   \]

2. **Determine the number of boys**: The problem states that there are twice the number of boys as there are girls. Since we know there are 6 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of kids**: Now that we have the number of girls and boys, we can find the total number of kids in the park by adding the number of girls and boys together:

   \[
   \text{Total number of kids} = \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of boys} = 6 + 12 = 18
   \]

4. **Final answer**: Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 

   \[
   \boxed{18}
   \]
