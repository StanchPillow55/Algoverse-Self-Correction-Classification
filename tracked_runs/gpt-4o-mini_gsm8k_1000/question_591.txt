Response:
To solve the problem, we will start by defining the number of paintings each person has based on the information given.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the number of paintings Samantha has.
   - Let \( H \) be the number of paintings Shelley has.
   - Let \( K \) be the number of paintings Kim has.

2. **Use the information provided:**
   - We know from the problem that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     S = H - 12
     \]
   - We also know that Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, which can be expressed as:
     \[
     H = K + 8
     \]
   - Finally, we are told that Samantha has 27 paintings:
     \[
     S = 27
     \]

3. **Substituting the value of \( S \):**
   Since we know \( S = 27 \), we can substitute this value into the first equation:
   \[
   27 = H - 12
   \]

4. **Solve for \( H \):**
   To find \( H \), we can rearrange the equation:
   \[
   H = 27 + 12
   \]
   \[
   H = 39
   \]

5. **Substituting \( H \) into the second equation:**
   Now that we have \( H = 39 \), we can substitute this value into the second equation to find \( K \):
   \[
   39 = K + 8
   \]

6. **Solve for \( K \):**
   Rearranging this equation gives us:
   \[
   K = 39 - 8
   \]
   \[
   K = 31
   \]

7. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the number of paintings Kim has is:
   \[
   \boxed{31}
   \]
