Question ID: 733

Question:
While walking down the street with his 3 younger siblings, Greg found $20. To be fair to his siblings, he decided to split the money equally. How much money did each of them get?


Reference Answer:
Greg and his 3 siblings equal 3 people + 1 person = <<3+1=4>>4 people.
The 20 dollars were divided equally, so each of them received $20 / 4 people = <<20/4=5>>5 dollars/person

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money each person receives when Greg splits the $20 he found among himself and his 3 younger siblings.

1. **Identify the total number of people sharing the money**: 
   - Greg has 3 younger siblings, so the total number of people is:
     \[
     1 \text{ (Greg)} + 3 \text{ (siblings)} = 4 \text{ people}
     \]

2. **Determine the total amount of money to be split**: 
   - The total amount of money found is $20.

3. **Calculate the amount each person receives**: 
   - To find out how much each person gets, we divide the total amount of money by the total number of people:
     \[
     \text{Amount per person} = \frac{\text{Total amount}}{\text{Number of people}} = \frac{20}{4}
     \]

4. **Perform the division**:
   - Calculating \( \frac{20}{4} \):
     \[
     20 \div 4 = 5
     \]

5. **Conclusion**: 
   - Each person, including Greg and his 3 siblings, receives $5.

Thus, the final answer is that each of them gets **$5**.
