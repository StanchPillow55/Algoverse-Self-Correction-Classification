Question:
Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias that geraniums. How many flowers does he plant total?


Reference Answer:
First find the number of petunias Andy plants: 90 flowers - 40 = <<90-40=50>>50 flowers
Then add the number of each kind of flower he plants to find the total number: 50 flowers + 90 flowers = <<50+90=140>>140 flowers

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of flowers Andy plants, which includes both geraniums and petunias.

1. **Identify the number of geraniums**: 
   According to the problem, Andy plants 90 geraniums. 

   \[
   \text{Number of geraniums} = 90
   \]

2. **Determine the number of petunias**: 
   The problem states that Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. To find the number of petunias, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums.

   \[
   \text{Number of petunias} = \text{Number of geraniums} - 40
   \]

   Substituting the number of geraniums:

   \[
   \text{Number of petunias} = 90 - 40 = 50
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of flowers**: 
   Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together to find the total number of flowers.

   \[
   \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of geraniums} + \text{Number of petunias}
   \]

   Substituting the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Total number of flowers} = 90 + 50 = 140
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total number of flowers that Andy plants is 

   \[
   \boxed{140}
   \]
