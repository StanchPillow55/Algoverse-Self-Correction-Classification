Question:
Marcus ordered 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece, 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each, 3 mini quiches for $4.00 apiece and 13 blueberry muffins that were $1.00 apiece.  At check out, Marcus shows his loyalty card that gives him 10% off of his purchase.  What is Marcus' total bill?


Reference Answer:
5 croissants cost $3.00 each so they cost 5*3 = $<<5*3=15.00>>15.00
4 cinnamon rolls cost $2.50 each so they cost 4*2.5 =$<<4*2.5=10.00>>10.00
3 mini quiches cost $4.00 each so they cost 3*4 = $<<3*4=12.00>>12.00
13 blueberry muffins cost $1.00 each so the cost 13*1 = $<<13*1=13.00>>13.00
All total, his pastries costs 15+10+12+13 = $<<15+10+12+13=50.00>>50.00
His has a 10% coupon for his $50.00 purchase so that saves him .10*50 = $<<10*.01*50=5.00>>5.00
His total bill is $50 minus his discount of $5.00 so 50-5 = $<<50-5=45.00>>45.00

Response:
To find Marcus' total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item he ordered, sum those costs, and then apply the 10% discount from his loyalty card. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the croissants:**
   - Number of croissants: 5
   - Price per croissant: $3.00
   - Total cost for croissants = Number of croissants × Price per croissant
   \[
   \text{Total cost for croissants} = 5 \times 3.00 = 15.00
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the cinnamon rolls:**
   - Number of cinnamon rolls: 4
   - Price per cinnamon roll: $2.50
   - Total cost for cinnamon rolls = Number of cinnamon rolls × Price per cinnamon roll
   \[
   \text{Total cost for cinnamon rolls} = 4 \times 2.50 = 10.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the mini quiches:**
   - Number of mini quiches: 3
   - Price per mini quiche: $4.00
   - Total cost for mini quiches = Number of mini quiches × Price per mini quiche
   \[
   \text{Total cost for mini quiches} = 3 \times 4.00 = 12.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the blueberry muffins:**
   - Number of blueberry muffins: 13
   - Price per blueberry muffin: $1.00
   - Total cost for blueberry muffins = Number of blueberry muffins × Price per blueberry muffin
   \[
   \text{Total cost for blueberry muffins} = 13 \times 1.00 = 13.00
   \]

5. **Sum the total costs:**
   - Total cost = Total cost for croissants + Total cost for cinnamon rolls + Total cost for mini quiches + Total cost for blueberry muffins
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 15.00 + 10.00 + 12.00 + 13.00 = 50.00
   \]

6. **Apply the 10% discount:**
   - Discount = 10% of Total cost
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 0.10 \times 50.00 = 5.00
   \]
   - Total after discount = Total cost - Discount
   \[
   \text{Total after discount} = 50.00 - 5.00 = 45.00
   \]

Thus, Marcus' total bill after applying the discount is **$45.00**.

Final answer: **$45.00**
