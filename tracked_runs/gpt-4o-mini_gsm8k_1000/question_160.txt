Question ID: 413

Question:
Marcy makes homemade candles that she markets as 99% guaranteed not to explode. 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. If she makes 50000 candles, how many of them will both smell like wet dog and explode?


Reference Answer:
First find what percentage of the candles explode: 100% - 99% = 1%
Then multiply the odds of the candles exploding by the odds of them smelling like wet dog to find the probability of both events happening: 1% * 5% = 0.05%
Then multiply that percentage by the number of candles to find the number of them that have both defects: 0.05% * 50000 candles = <<0.05*.01*50000=25>>25 candles
#### 25

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many of Marcy's candles will both smell like wet dog and explode. We will break this down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Marcy makes 50,000 candles.
   - 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles can potentially explode.
   - Among the candles that can explode, 5% have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

2. **Calculating the Number of Candles That Can Explode**:
   Since 1% of the candles can explode, we first calculate how many candles that is:
   \[
   \text{Number of exploding candles} = 1\% \text{ of } 50000 = \frac{1}{100} \times 50000 = 500
   \]

3. **Calculating the Number of Exploding Candles That Smell Like Wet Dog**:
   Next, we need to find out how many of these 500 exploding candles also smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the exploding candles have this defect:
   \[
   \text{Number of exploding candles that smell like wet dog} = 5\% \text{ of } 500 = \frac{5}{100} \times 500 = 25
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
   \[
   \boxed{25}
   \]
