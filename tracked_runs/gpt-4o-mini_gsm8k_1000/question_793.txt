Question ID: 555

Question:
John plans to save money from working.  He gets paid $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week.  If he wants to save $80 how many weeks will it take him?


Reference Answer:
He gets paid 2*5=$<<2*5=10>>10 a day.
So he gets paid 10*4=$<<10*4=40>>40 a week.
That means it would take 80/40=<<80/40=2>>2 weeks to save up the money.

Response:
To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we first need to calculate how much money he earns in a week.

1. **Calculate John's daily earnings:**
   - John earns $2 per hour.
   - He works 5 hours a day.
   - Therefore, his daily earnings can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Daily Earnings} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours Worked per Day} = 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 10 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate John's weekly earnings:**
   - John works 4 days a week.
   - His weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Weekly Earnings} = \text{Daily Earnings} \times \text{Days Worked per Week} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine how many weeks it will take to save $80:**
   - We need to find out how many weeks it will take for John to save $80 with his weekly earnings of $40.
   - We can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Number of Weeks} = \frac{\text{Total Savings Goal}}{\text{Weekly Earnings}} = \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks}
     \]

Thus, it will take John **2 weeks** to save $80.

Final answer: **2 weeks**.

1. **Calculate daily earnings:**
   - John earns $2 per hour.
   - He works 5 hours a day.
   - Daily earnings = hourly wage × hours worked per day
   \[
   \text{Daily earnings} = 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 10 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate weekly earnings:**
   - John works 4 days a week.
   - Weekly earnings = daily earnings × days worked per week
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine how many weeks to save $80:**
   - We need to find out how many weeks it will take for John to save $80.
   - We can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Total savings goal}}{\text{Weekly earnings}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks}
   \]

Thus, it will take John **2 weeks** to save $80.
