Question:
Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes.  In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points.  In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points.  How many total points did he score?


Reference Answer:
He scored 4*.25=<<4*.25=1>>1 point more in the second 20 minutes
So he scored 4+1=<<4+1=5>>5 points in the second 20 minutes
So in total, he scored 4+5=<<4+5=9>>9 points in the 40 minutes
#### 9

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many points Mike scores in total during his 40 minutes of playing ping pong.

1. **Points scored in the first 20 minutes**: 
   - According to the problem, Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes.

2. **Points scored in the second 20 minutes**: 
   - In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.
   - To find out how many points that is, we first calculate 25% of the points scored in the first 20 minutes.

   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 4 = \frac{25}{100} \times 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]

   - Now, we add this additional 1 point to the original 4 points to find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes.

   \[
   \text{Points in second 20 minutes} = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]

3. **Total points scored**: 
   - Now, we add the points scored in both segments of the game to find the total points.

   \[
   \text{Total points} = \text{Points in first 20 minutes} + \text{Points in second 20 minutes} = 4 + 5 = 9
   \]

Thus, the total number of points Mike scored during the 40 minutes of playing ping pong is:

\[
\boxed{9}
\]
