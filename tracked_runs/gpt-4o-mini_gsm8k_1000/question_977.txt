Response:
To find the height of Caroline's fourth child, we will calculate the heights of each child step by step, starting from the first child.

1. **Height of the first child**:
   - The first child is 6 feet tall.
   - Since we need the final answer in inches, we convert feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.
   \[
   \text{Height of first child in inches} = 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Height of the second child**:
   - The second child is two inches taller than the first child.
   \[
   \text{Height of second child} = \text{Height of first child} + 2 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Height of the third child**:
   - The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.
   \[
   \text{Height of third child} = \text{Height of second child} - 5 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Height of the fourth child**:
   - The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.
   \[
   \text{Height of fourth child} = \text{Height of third child} + 3 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now that we have calculated the height of the fourth child, we can state the final answer.

**Final Answer**: The fourth child is 72 inches tall.
