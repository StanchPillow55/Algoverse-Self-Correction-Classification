Question ID: 700

Question:
Hannah's city is having a big display of fireworks for the 4th of July. They're going to set off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. How many fireworks will Hannah see in total?


Reference Answer:
First find the total number of fireworks the city sets off: 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = <<15*20=300>>300 fireworks
Then multiply that number by the proportion of the fireworks Hannah can see: 300 fireworks * 40% = <<300*40*.01=120>>120 fireworks
Then find the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her own backyard: 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = <<3*5=15>>15 fireworks
Then add the number of city fireworks to the number of personal fireworks to find the total number of fireworks: 15 fireworks + 120 fireworks = <<15+120=135>>135 fireworks
#### 135

Response:
To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we need to break the problem down into two parts: the fireworks from the city's display and the fireworks that Hannah will set off in her backyard.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of fireworks from the city's display.

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. We can calculate the total number of fireworks from the city as follows:

\[
\text{Total fireworks from the city} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Fireworks per box}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total fireworks from the city} = 15 \times 20 = 300
\]

### Step 2: Calculate how many of the city's fireworks Hannah can see.

Hannah can see 40% of the total fireworks from the city. To find out how many fireworks this is, we calculate 40% of 300:

\[
\text{Fireworks Hannah sees from the city} = 0.40 \times \text{Total fireworks from the city}
\]

Substituting the total fireworks:

\[
\text{Fireworks Hannah sees from the city} = 0.40 \times 300 = 120
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard.

Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each. We can calculate the total number of fireworks she will set off as follows:

\[
\text{Total fireworks Hannah sets off} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Fireworks per box}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total fireworks Hannah sets off} = 3 \times 5 = 15
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah will see.

Now, we need to add the number of fireworks Hannah sees from the city to the number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard:

\[
\text{Total fireworks Hannah sees} = \text{Fireworks Hannah sees from the city} + \text{Total fireworks Hannah sets off}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total fireworks Hannah sees} = 120 + 15 = 135
\]

### Final Answer

Hannah will see a total of **135 fireworks**.
