Question ID: 397

Question:
Mark has $50 in his bank account. He earns $10 per day at his work. If he wants to buy a bike that costs $300, how many days does Mark have to save his money?


Reference Answer:
Mike has $50 in his bank account, so the amount he needs to save to reach the bike goal is $300 - $50 = $250
He earns $10 per day, so $250 / $10/day = <<250/10=25>>25 days
#### 25

Response:
To determine how many days Mark needs to save his money to buy a bike that costs $300, we can break the problem down into a series of steps.

1. **Identify the total amount needed**: 
   Mark wants to buy a bike that costs $300.

2. **Identify how much money Mark currently has**: 
   Mark currently has $50 in his bank account.

3. **Calculate how much more money Mark needs**: 
   To find out how much more money Mark needs, we subtract the amount he currently has from the cost of the bike:
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = \text{Cost of bike} - \text{Current savings}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = 300 - 50 = 250
   \]
   So, Mark needs an additional $250.

4. **Determine how much Mark earns per day**: 
   Mark earns $10 per day at his work.

5. **Calculate how many days it will take for Mark to save the additional amount needed**: 
   To find out how many days it will take for Mark to save $250, we divide the amount he needs by his daily earnings:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Amount needed}}{\text{Daily earnings}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{250}{10} = 25
   \]

Thus, Mark needs to save for **25 days** to have enough money to buy the bike.

Final answer: Mark has to save for **25 days**.
