Question:
John injured his back and needs to go to physical therapy.  He went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.  Each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time.  If the sessions cost $125 per hour how much did the physical therapy cost?


Reference Answer:
Each week he did 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 hours of physical therapy
So it cost 4*125=$<<4*125=500>>500 per week
This means he spent 500*6=$<<500*6=3000>>3000

Response:
To find the total cost of John’s physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of sessions per week**: John goes to physical therapy twice a week.

2. **Calculate the total number of sessions**: Since he goes for 6 weeks and attends 2 sessions each week, we can calculate the total number of sessions as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total sessions} = \text{Number of weeks} \times \text{Sessions per week} = 6 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ sessions/week} = 12 \text{ sessions}
   \]

3. **Determine the duration of each session**: Each session lasts for 2 hours.

4. **Calculate the total hours of therapy**: To find the total hours John spent in therapy, we multiply the total number of sessions by the duration of each session:
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = \text{Total sessions} \times \text{Hours per session} = 12 \text{ sessions} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 24 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Determine the cost per hour**: The cost of the therapy sessions is given as $125 per hour.

6. **Calculate the total cost**: To find the total cost of therapy, we multiply the total hours by the cost per hour:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total hours} \times \text{Cost per hour} = 24 \text{ hours} \times 125 \text{ dollars/hour}
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   24 \times 125 = 3000
   \]

Thus, the total cost of John’s physical therapy is **$3000**.

Final answer: **$3000**.
