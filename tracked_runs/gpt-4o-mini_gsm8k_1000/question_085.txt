Question ID: 780

Question:
Ava and Emma want to know who is better at the new video game Ava got for her birthday. They are each going to play one level and whoever has the highest score wins. They receive 10 points for every enemy they jump on, 5 points for each berry they collect, and 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level. If Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries, but finishes the level 4 seconds slower, what is the difference between their two scores?


Reference Answer:
For jumping on enemies, Emma earns 8 * 10 = <<8*10=80>>80 fewer points than Ava.
For collecting berries, Emma earns 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 fewer points than Ava.
For finishing the level faster, Emma earns 4 * 30 = <<4*30=120>>120 more points than Ava.
Overall, Emma has 120 â€“ 80 - 15 = <<120-80-15=25>>25 more points than Ava.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma based on the information provided.

Let's define the variables for Emma's performance:
- Let \( e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( t \) be the time in seconds Emma has left on the timer when she finishes the level.

Now, we can express Ava's performance in terms of Emma's performance:
- Ava jumps on \( e + 8 \) enemies (8 more than Emma).
- Ava collects \( b + 3 \) berries (3 more than Emma).
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she has \( t - 4 \) seconds left on the timer.

Next, we can calculate the scores for both players using the scoring rules:
- Points for jumping on enemies: 10 points per enemy.
- Points for collecting berries: 5 points per berry.
- Points for time left on the timer: 30 points per second.

**Score Calculation:**

1. **Emma's Score:**
   \[
   \text{Score}_E = 10e + 5b + 30t
   \]

2. **Ava's Score:**
   \[
   \text{Score}_A = 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t - 4)
   \]

   Now, let's expand Ava's score:
   \[
   \text{Score}_A = 10e + 80 + 5b + 15 + 30t - 120
   \]
   \[
   \text{Score}_A = 10e + 5b + 30t + 80 + 15 - 120
   \]
   \[
   \text{Score}_A = 10e + 5b + 30t - 25
   \]

**Finding the Difference in Scores:**
Now we need to find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E
\]
Substituting the expressions we derived:
\[
\text{Difference} = (10e + 5b + 30t - 25) - (10e + 5b + 30t)
\]
Simplifying this:
\[
\text{Difference} = -25
\]

Thus, the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score is \(-25\). This means Ava's score is 25 points less than Emma's score.

**Final Answer:**
The difference between their two scores is \(-25\).

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B \). 

### Step 1: Define the variables for Emma's score
- Enemies jumped on by Emma: \( E \)
- Berries collected by Emma: \( B \)
- Time left for Emma when she finishes the level: \( T \) seconds

The score for Emma can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} = 10E + 5B + 30T
\]

### Step 2: Define the variables for Ava's score
According to the problem:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: \( E + 8 \)
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma: \( B + 3 \)
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma: \( T - 4 \)

Now we can calculate Ava's score:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4)
\]

### Step 3: Expand Ava's score formula
Now let's expand Ava's score:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120
\]
Combining like terms gives us:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the difference in scores
Now we will find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} - \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}}
\]
Substituting the scores we calculated:
\[
\text{Difference} = (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T)
\]

### Step 5: Simplify the difference
When we simplify the expression:
\[
\text{Difference} = (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T) = -25
\]

### Final Answer
The difference between Ava's and Emma's scores is:
\[
\boxed{-25}
\]

This means Ava's score is 25 points less than Emma's score.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma based on the information given. Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B \). 

### Step 1: Define the scores for Ava and Emma

**Emma's Score:**
- Points from enemies: \( 10E \)
- Points from berries: \( 5B \)
- Points from time left: \( 30T_E \) (where \( T_E \) is the time left for Emma)

Thus, Emma's total score \( S_E \) can be expressed as:
\[
S_E = 10E + 5B + 30T_E
\]

**Ava's Score:**
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so she collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so if Emma has \( T_E \) seconds left, Ava has \( T_E - 4 \) seconds left.

Thus, Ava's total score \( S_A \) can be expressed as:
\[
S_A = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T_E - 4)
\]

### Step 2: Expand Ava's score

Now, let's expand Ava's score:
\[
S_A = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T_E - 120
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
S_A = 10E + 5B + 30T_E + 80 + 15 - 120
\]
\[
S_A = 10E + 5B + 30T_E - 25
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference between their scores

Now, we need to find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:
\[
S_A - S_E = (10E + 5B + 30T_E - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T_E)
\]
The \( 10E \), \( 5B \), and \( 30T_E \) terms cancel out:
\[
S_A - S_E = -25
\]

### Final Answer

The difference between Ava's and Emma's scores is:
\[
\boxed{-25}
\]

This means Ava's score is 25 points lower than Emma's score.
