Question ID: 809

Question:
Dale is selling butterscotch candies to raise money for his club at school. He doesn't have the candies yet and is instead just taking orders. He started off with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell, but he ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies. Then he ordered 100 more. How many does Dale still need to sell to sell all of his candy?


Reference Answer:
Dale starts off selling 100 butterscotch candies that he ordered, but ends up selling 150, 100 - 150 = <<100-150=-50>>-50 candies.
So Dale orders 100 more candies to make up for the deficit and to sell even more, -50 candies + 100 candies = <<100-50=50>>50 candies Dale has left and still needs to sell.
#### 50

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell in order to sell all of his candy.

1. **Initial Order**: Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies.
   
2. **Sales**: Dale sold 150 butterscotch candies. This means he has sold more than he initially ordered.

3. **Additional Order**: After selling 150 candies, Dale ordered 100 more candies.

Now, let's break down the total number of candies Dale has and how many he has sold:

- **Total Candies Ordered**: 
   - Initial order: 100 candies
   - Additional order: 100 candies
   - Total candies = 100 + 100 = 200 candies

- **Candies Sold**: Dale sold 150 candies.

4. **Candies Remaining**: To find out how many candies Dale has left to sell, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies he has.

   \[
   \text{Candies remaining} = \text{Total candies} - \text{Candies sold}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Candies remaining} = 200 - 150 = 50
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

Thus, the final answer is:

**Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies.**
