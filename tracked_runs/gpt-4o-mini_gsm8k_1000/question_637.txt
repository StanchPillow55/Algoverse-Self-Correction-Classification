Question ID: 1176

Question:
A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?


Reference Answer:
The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.
He is left with 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches of chalk.
The next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.
That leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.
The day after that, he will use 2.2 * .2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>.44 inches of chalk.
That will leave him with 2.2 - .44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches of chalk.
Since 1.76 is less than 2 inches, he will recycle this stick in 2 days.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk after using 45% of the original 5-inch piece on Monday.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of chalk used on Monday
The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday.

\[
\text{Amount used on Monday} = 5 \text{ inches} \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday
Now, we subtract the amount of chalk used from the original piece to find out how much is left.

\[
\text{Remaining chalk} = 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the daily usage after Monday
The teacher plans to use only 20% of the chalk each day going forward. We need to calculate how much chalk he will use each day.

\[
\text{Daily usage} = 2.75 \text{ inches} \times 0.20 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate how many days he can use the remaining chalk
To find out how many days the teacher can continue using the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 0.55 inches per day, we divide the remaining chalk by the daily usage.

\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{2.75 \text{ inches}}{0.55 \text{ inches/day}} = 5 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion
The teacher can use the remaining piece of chalk for 5 days before it becomes too small to use (less than 2 inches).

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk after using 45% of it on Monday.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday. We calculate how much chalk this is:
   \[
   \text{Chalk used on Monday} = 0.45 \times 5 \text{ inches} = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Remaining Chalk After Monday**: We subtract the chalk used from the initial length:
   \[
   \text{Remaining chalk} = 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Daily Chalk Usage**: The teacher plans to use only 20% of the chalk each day going forward. We calculate how much chalk he will use each day:
   \[
   \text{Daily usage} = 0.20 \times 2.75 \text{ inches} = 0.55 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Days Before Recycling**: To find out how many days the teacher can continue using the chalk before it becomes smaller than 2 inches, we need to determine how many days it takes for the remaining chalk to reach 2 inches:
   - The teacher can use the chalk until it reaches 2 inches, so we calculate the usable chalk:
   \[
   \text{Usable chalk} = 2.75 \text{ inches} - 2 \text{ inches} = 0.75 \text{ inches}
   \]
   - Now, we find out how many days it takes to use up this 0.75 inches at a rate of 0.55 inches per day:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{0.75 \text{ inches}}{0.55 \text{ inches/day}} \approx 1.36 \text{ days}
   \]

Since the teacher can only use whole days, he can use the chalk for 1 full day before it becomes smaller than 2 inches.

6. **Final Answer**: The teacher has **1 day** before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk after using 45% of it on Monday, given that he typically uses 20% each day.

1. **Determine the initial amount of chalk**: 
   The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Calculate the amount of chalk used on Monday**:
   The teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Amount used on Monday} = 5 \text{ inches} \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday**:
   To find out how much chalk is left after Monday, we subtract the amount used from the initial amount:
   \[
   \text{Remaining chalk} = 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Determine the daily usage going forward**:
   The teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day. We calculate this daily usage based on the remaining chalk:
   \[
   \text{Daily usage} = 2.75 \text{ inches} \times 0.20 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Calculate how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk**:
   To find out how many days the teacher can continue using the chalk before it becomes too small (less than 2 inches), we need to see how many days it takes for the chalk to go from 2.75 inches to 2 inches.

   First, we need to find out how much chalk can be used before it reaches 2 inches:
   \[
   \text{Chalk to be used} = 2.75 \text{ inches} - 2 \text{ inches} = 0.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

   Now, we can determine how many days it will take to use up 0.75 inches at a rate of 0.55 inches per day:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{0.75 \text{ inches}}{0.55 \text{ inches/day}} \approx 1.36 \text{ days}
   \]

   Since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. This means he can use the chalk for 1 full day before it becomes less than 2 inches.

6. **Final answer**:
   After using the chalk for 1 day, the teacher will have to recycle it because it will be less than 2 inches. Therefore, the teacher has **1 day** before he has to recycle this piece of chalk.

**Final Answer**: 1 day.
