Question:
Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. If Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, and Dora is 15 years old, calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.


Reference Answer:
If Dora's age is 15, her father, with eight more than twice Dora's age, is eight more than 15*2 = <<15*2=30>>30 years.
This means Dora's father is 30+8 = <<30+8=38>>38 years old.
Together, Dora and her father have a total age of 38+15 =<<38+15=53>>53.
Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, meaning Dora's mother is 38-4 = 34 years old.
Altogether, Dora's family has a total age of 53+34 = <<53+34=87>>87 years.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify Dora's Age:**
   - We know from the problem that Dora is 15 years old.
   \[
   \text{Dora's age} = 15
   \]

2. **Calculate Dora's Father's Age:**
   - The problem states that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. We can express this mathematically as:
   \[
   \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8
   \]
   - Substituting Dora's age into the equation:
   \[
   \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8
   \]
   - Now, calculate:
   \[
   \text{Father's age} = 30 + 8 = 38
   \]

3. **Calculate Dora's Mother's Age:**
   - The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4
   \]
   - Substituting the father's age into the equation:
   \[
   \text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4
   \]
   - Now, calculate:
   \[
   \text{Mother's age} = 34
   \]

4. **Calculate the Total Combined Age:**
   - Now we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Total age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age}
   \]
   - Substituting the ages we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total age} = 15 + 38 + 34
   \]
   - Now, calculate:
   \[
   \text{Total age} = 15 + 38 = 53
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total age} = 53 + 34 = 87
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:
   \[
   \boxed{87}
   \]
