Question ID: 393

Question:
Carol spends 4 hours writing a song, half that much time recording it, and 90 minutes editing it. What percentage of her total work time did she spend editing?


Reference Answer:
First find how long Carol spent writing the song in minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<4*60=240>>240 minutes
Then find how long she spent recording the song: 240 minutes / 2 = <<240/2=120>>120 minutes
Then add up all her work time to find the total work time: 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = <<240+120+90=450>>450 â€‹minutes
Then divide her editing time by her total work time and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 90 minutes / 450 minutes * 100% = 20%

Response:
To find out what percentage of Carol's total work time she spent editing, we first need to calculate the total time she spent on each activity and then determine the percentage of that total time that was spent editing.

1. **Calculate the time spent on each activity:**
   - Writing the song: 4 hours
   - Recording the song: Half of the writing time, which is:
     \[
     \text{Recording time} = \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{2} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Editing the song: 90 minutes. We need to convert this into hours for consistency:
     \[
     \text{Editing time} = \frac{90 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total work time:**
   Now, we add up all the time spent on each activity:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Writing time} + \text{Recording time} + \text{Editing time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the percentage of time spent editing:**
   To find the percentage of the total time that was spent editing, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Editing time}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{7.5 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\%
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Carol spent **20%** of her total work time editing the song.

Response:
To determine what percentage of Carol's total work time she spent editing, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time spent on each activity**:
   - Writing the song: 4 hours
   - Recording the song: Half of the writing time, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
   - Editing the song: 90 minutes

2. **Convert all times to the same unit**:
   - We will convert everything to hours for consistency.
   - 90 minutes can be converted to hours by dividing by 60:
     \[
     90 \text{ minutes} = \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total work time**:
   - Now we can add the time spent on each activity:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time writing} + \text{Time recording} + \text{Time editing}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the percentage of time spent editing**:
   - The time spent editing is 1.5 hours. To find the percentage of the total time that this represents, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100
     \]
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100
     \]

5. **Perform the calculation**:
   - First, calculate \( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \):
     \[
     \frac{1.5}{7.5} = 0.2
     \]
   - Now multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
     \[
     0.2 \times 100 = 20\%
     \]

6. **Final answer**:
   - Carol spent **20%** of her total work time editing the song.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20\%}
\]

     \[
     90 \text{ minutes} = \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total work time**:
   - Total time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
   - Total time = \( 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} \)
   - Total time = \( 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 \text{ hours} \)

4. **Calculate the percentage of time spent editing**:
   - The time spent editing is 1.5 hours.
   - To find the percentage of total work time spent editing, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total work time}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values:

   - Now multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
     \[
     0.2 \times 100 = 20
     \]

Thus, Carol spent **20%** of her total work time editing.

**Final Answer**: 20%
