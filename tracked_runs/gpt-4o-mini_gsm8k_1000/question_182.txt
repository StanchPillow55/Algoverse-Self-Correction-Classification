Question ID: 311

Question:
In a family of 5, three people eat three eggs each day while the rest eat two eggs each day. If they eat eggs every day, how many eggs will the family consume in a week?


Reference Answer:
Three persons eat 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 eggs each day.
So, 5 - 3 = <<5-3=2>>2 persons eat two eggs in a day.
Thus, 2 x 2 = 4 eggs are consumed by the two other people in a day.
So the family consumes 9 + 4 = <<9+4=13>>13 eggs each day.
Therefore, 13 x 7 = <<13*7=91>>91 eggs will be consumed by the family in a week.
#### 91

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many eggs the family consumes in a week based on the daily consumption of eggs by each family member.

1. **Identify the family members and their egg consumption:**
   - There are 5 members in the family.
   - Three of them eat 3 eggs each day.
   - The remaining two members eat 2 eggs each day.

2. **Calculate the daily egg consumption for each group:**
   - For the three members who eat 3 eggs each:
     \[
     \text{Eggs consumed by three members} = 3 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ eggs/member} = 9 \text{ eggs}
     \]
   - For the two members who eat 2 eggs each:
     \[
     \text{Eggs consumed by two members} = 2 \text{ members} \times 2 \text{ eggs/member} = 4 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total daily egg consumption for the family:**
   - Add the eggs consumed by both groups:
     \[
     \text{Total daily consumption} = 9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs}
     \]

4. **Calculate the weekly egg consumption:**
   - Since the family eats eggs every day, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week (7 days):
     \[
     \text{Total weekly consumption} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - The family will consume a total of **91 eggs** in a week.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{91}
\]
