Response:
To determine how much change Violetta will receive after buying the crayons, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of crayons needed**: Violetta wants crayons in 5 different colors.

2. **Determine the cost per crayon**: Each crayon costs $2.

3. **Calculate the total cost for the crayons**: 
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of crayons} \times \text{Cost per crayon}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

4. **Determine the amount of money Violetta has**: Violetta has prepared $20 for this purchase.

5. **Calculate the change Violetta will receive**: 
   \[
   \text{Change} = \text{Amount prepared} - \text{Total cost}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Change} = 20 - 10 = 10
   \]

Thus, Violetta will receive $10 in change after purchasing the crayons.

**Final Answer**: Violetta will get $10 in change.
