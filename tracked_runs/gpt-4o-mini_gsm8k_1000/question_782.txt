Question ID: 368

Question:
After scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. How many points did Erin have before?


Reference Answer:
Erin now has three times more points than Sara, which is 3*8= <<3*8=24>>24 more points than Sara.
This means Erin has a total of 8+24 = <<8+24=32>>32 points now.
Before, Erin had 32-14= <<32-14=18>>18 points
#### 18

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points. Let's denote Erin's points before scoring 14 as \( E \).

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points become \( E + 14 \).
   - We know that after scoring, Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. Therefore, Sara's total points are 8.

2. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - According to the problem, after scoring, Erin's points are three times Sara's points:
   \[
   E + 14 = 3 \times 8
   \]

3. **Calculating Sara's Points**:
   - We calculate \( 3 \times 8 \):
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]
   - So, we can rewrite the equation as:
   \[
   E + 14 = 24
   \]

4. **Solving for Erin's Points Before Scoring**:
   - To find \( E \), we subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   E = 24 - 14
   \]
   - Performing the subtraction:
   \[
   E = 10
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, given that after scoring those points, she has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Sara's Points**: 
   - Sara scored 8 points.

2. **Determine Erin's Points After Scoring**:
   - Let \( E \) represent the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points.
   - After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points become \( E + 14 \).

3. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   E + 14 = 3 \times \text{(Sara's points)}
   \]
   Substituting Sara's points:
   \[
   E + 14 = 3 \times 8
   \]

4. **Calculate Sara's Points Multiplied by 3**:
   - Calculate \( 3 \times 8 \):
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]
   Thus, we can rewrite the equation:
   \[
   E + 14 = 24
   \]

5. **Solve for Erin's Points Before Scoring**:
   - To find \( E \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation:
   \[
   E = 24 - 14
   \]
   \[
   E = 10
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

Thus, the final answer is that Erin had **10 points** before scoring.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points. We know that after scoring those points, Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Sara's total points**: 
   Sara scored 8 points. Therefore, her total points are:
   \[
   \text{Sara's points} = 8
   \]

2. **Determine Erin's points after scoring**: 
   Let \( E \) represent the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points. After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points become:
   \[
   \text{Erin's total points} = E + 14
   \]

3. **Set up the equation based on the relationship between Erin's and Sara's points**: 
   According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   E + 14 = 3 \times \text{Sara's points}
   \]
   Substituting Sara's points into the equation gives us:
   \[
   E + 14 = 3 \times 8
   \]

4. **Calculate the right side of the equation**:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]
   So, we now have:
   \[
   E + 14 = 24
   \]

5. **Solve for \( E \)**:
   To find \( E \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 14 from both sides:
   \[
   E = 24 - 14
   \]
   \[
   E = 10
   \]

6. **Conclusion**: 
   Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
