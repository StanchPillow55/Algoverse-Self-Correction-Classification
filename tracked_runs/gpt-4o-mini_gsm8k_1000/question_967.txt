Question:
200 pounds of carrots are to be distributed to 40 restaurants in a certain city. Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. How many pounds of carrots will not be used?


Reference Answer:
The restaurants need 40 * 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 lbs. of carrots.
So 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120 lbs. of carrots will not be used.
#### 120

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used after distributing them to the restaurants.

1. **Identify the total amount of carrots**: We start with 200 pounds of carrots.

2. **Determine how many pounds each restaurant will receive**: Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots.

3. **Calculate the total amount of carrots distributed to all restaurants**:
   - There are 40 restaurants.
   - Each restaurant receives 2 pounds.
   - Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total distributed} = \text{Number of restaurants} \times \text{Pounds per restaurant}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total distributed} = 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Calculate the amount of carrots that will not be used**:
   - We subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the total amount of carrots we started with:
     \[
     \text{Carrots not used} = \text{Total carrots} - \text{Total distributed}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Carrots not used} = 200 - 80 = 120 \text{ pounds}
     \]

5. **Final answer**: The amount of carrots that will not be used is 120 pounds.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]
