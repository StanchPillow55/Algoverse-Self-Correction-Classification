Question ID: 849

Question:
A farmer has 900 eggs. He placed them on a tray, which holds 30 eggs each. How much will the farmer earn if he sells it for $2.5 per tray?


Reference Answer:
There are 900 / 30 = <<900/30=30>>30 trays that hold 900 eggs.
So, the farmer will earn 30 x $2.5 = $<<30*2.5=75>>75 if he sells it per tray.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will go through the following steps:

1. **Determine how many trays are needed for the 900 eggs.**
2. **Calculate the total earnings from selling the trays.**

### Step 1: Calculate the number of trays

The farmer has 900 eggs, and each tray holds 30 eggs. To find out how many trays the farmer can fill, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray:

\[
\text{Number of trays} = \frac{\text{Total eggs}}{\text{Eggs per tray}} = \frac{900}{30}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Number of trays} = 30
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings

The farmer sells each tray for $2.5. To find the total earnings from selling all the trays, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of trays} \times \text{Price per tray} = 30 \times 2.5
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 75
\]

### Final Answer

The farmer will earn a total of **$75** from selling the trays of eggs.
