Question ID: 1219

Question:
John is a carpenter. For his friend Ali, he manufactured 4 wooden tables for $20 each and 2 roof frames for $10 each. How much does Ali have to pay John?


Reference Answer:
For the wooden table, Ali should pay: $20 * 4 = $<<20*4=80>>80
For the roof frames, Ali should pay: $10 * 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20
Combining the wooden table and the roof frames, Ali should pay: $20 + $80 = $<<20+80=100>>100
#### 100

Response:
To determine how much Ali has to pay John for the wooden tables and roof frames, we will calculate the total cost for each type of item separately and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate the cost of the wooden tables:**
   - John manufactured 4 wooden tables.
   - Each table costs $20.
   - To find the total cost for the tables, we multiply the number of tables by the cost per table:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for tables} = \text{Number of tables} \times \text{Cost per table} = 4 \times 20
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     4 \times 20 = 80
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for the wooden tables is **$80**.

2. **Calculate the cost of the roof frames:**
   - John manufactured 2 roof frames.
   - Each roof frame costs $10.
   - To find the total cost for the roof frames, we multiply the number of roof frames by the cost per roof frame:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for roof frames} = \text{Number of roof frames} \times \text{Cost per roof frame} = 2 \times 10
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     2 \times 10 = 20
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for the roof frames is **$20**.

3. **Calculate the total amount Ali has to pay John:**
   - Now, we add the total costs of the tables and the roof frames together:
     \[
     \text{Total amount} = \text{Total cost for tables} + \text{Total cost for roof frames} = 80 + 20
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     80 + 20 = 100
     \]
   - Therefore, the total amount that Ali has to pay John is **$100**.

In conclusion, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{100}
\]
