Question:
It takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages of his book before he goes to bed. He reads 18 pages of his book and then decides to go to sleep. How long does James spend reading, in minutes?


Reference Answer:
James would take 18 รท 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 times longer if he read all 18 pages.
This means James would spend 6 ร 10 = <<6*10=60>>60 minutes reading.

Response:
To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how long it takes him to read one page of his book.

1. **Calculate the time taken to read one page:**
   James takes 10 minutes to read 3 pages. To find the time taken to read one page, we can divide the total time by the number of pages:
   \[
   \text{Time per page} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Number of pages}} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \approx 3.33 \text{ minutes per page}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total time spent reading 18 pages:**
   Now that we know it takes approximately 3.33 minutes to read one page, we can calculate the time it takes to read 18 pages:
   \[
   \text{Total time for 18 pages} = \text{Time per page} \times \text{Number of pages} = 3.33 \text{ minutes per page} \times 18 \text{ pages}
   \]
   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   3.33 \times 18 = 59.94 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Round to the nearest minute:**
   Since we typically round to the nearest whole number when dealing with time, we round 59.94 minutes to 60 minutes.

Thus, the total time James spends reading 18 pages is approximately 60 minutes.

**Final Answer:**
James spends 60 minutes reading.
