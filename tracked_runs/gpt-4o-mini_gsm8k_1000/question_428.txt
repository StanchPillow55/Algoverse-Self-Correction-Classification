Question ID: 692

Question:
A certain company is in the business of selling fresh fruit. One crate of such fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. The price for such a crate depends on the price of its individual fruits. One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?


Reference Answer:
The price for apples in the crate would be 12 * 0.5 = $<<12*0.5=6>>6.
Cost of banana is 0.5 * 2 = $<<0.5*2=1>>1.
So the bananas in this crate cost 5 * 1 = $<<5*1=5>>5.
One orange is three times more expensive than a banana, so it costs 1 * 3 = $<<1*3=3>>3.
So for the oranges in the crate, one needs to pay 7 * 3 = $<<7*3=21>>21.
So the whole crate costs 6 + 5 + 21 = $<<6+5+21=32>>32.

Response:
To find the price of a crate of fruit consisting of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges, we first need to determine the individual prices of each type of fruit.

1. **Determine the price of each fruit:**
   - The price of one apple is given as $0.5.
   - The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple:
     \[
     \text{Price of one banana} = 2 \times \text{Price of one apple} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1.0 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana:
     \[
     \text{Price of one orange} = 3 \times \text{Price of one banana} = 3 \times 1.0 = 3.0 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total price for each type of fruit in the crate:**
   - For bananas:
     \[
     \text{Total price for bananas} = \text{Number of bananas} \times \text{Price of one banana} = 5 \times 1.0 = 5.0 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - For apples:
     \[
     \text{Total price for apples} = \text{Number of apples} \times \text{Price of one apple} = 12 \times 0.5 = 6.0 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - For oranges:
     \[
     \text{Total price for oranges} = \text{Number of oranges} \times \text{Price of one orange} = 7 \times 3.0 = 21.0 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total price for the crate:**
   - Now, we sum the total prices for all the fruits:
     \[
     \text{Total price for the crate} = \text{Total price for bananas} + \text{Total price for apples} + \text{Total price for oranges}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total price for the crate} = 5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = 32.0 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the price for the crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32.0}\) dollars.
