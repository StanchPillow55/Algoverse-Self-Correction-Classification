Question ID: 245

Question:
There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. If both aquariums have the same number of fish in them, how many fish are there in each aquarium?


Reference Answer:
The difference between the number of snails is 32 - 4 = <<32-4=28>>28 snails.
There are 28/2 = <<28/2=14>>14 fish in both aquariums.
There are 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 fish in each aquarium.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to analyze the information given step by step.

1. **Identify the number of snails in each aquarium**:
   - Aquarium 1 has 4 snails.
   - Aquarium 2 has 32 snails.

2. **Calculate the difference in the number of snails**:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Number of snails in Aquarium 2} - \text{Number of snails in Aquarium 1} = 32 - 4 = 28
   \]

3. **Let \( x \) be the number of fish in each aquarium**:
   Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( x \).

4. **According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums**:
   The total number of fish in both aquariums is \( x + x = 2x \).

5. **Set up the equation based on the information given**:
   The difference in the number of snails (28) is equal to twice the number of fish (2x):
   \[
   28 = 2x
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{28}{2} = 14
   \]

7. **Conclusion**:
   Each aquarium has 14 fish.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{There are 14 fish in each aquarium.}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, let's define the variables and break down the information given step by step.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( F \) be the number of fish in each aquarium.
   - We know there are 4 snails in the first aquarium and 32 snails in the second aquarium.

2. **Calculate the Difference in Snails**:
   - The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is:
     \[
     32 - 4 = 28
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can express this as:
     \[
     28 = 2F
     \]

4. **Solve for \( F \)**:
   - To find \( F \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     F = \frac{28}{2} = 14
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is \( 14 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{There are 14 fish in each aquarium.}
\]
