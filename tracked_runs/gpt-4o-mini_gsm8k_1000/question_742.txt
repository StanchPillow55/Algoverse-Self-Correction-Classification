Question ID: 530

Question:
After tracking his workout routine for 8 weeks, Josh discovered that he had spent 4 hours working out every week except on some occasions. At one point, he spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks. Another time, he spent 6 hours in one week. What is the total number of hours he has spent working out across the 8 weeks?


Reference Answer:
For 2 weeks, he spent 5 hours each for a total of 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10 hours
In another week, he spent 6 hours; which gives a total of 10+6 = <<10+6=16>>16 hours
2+1 = <<2+1=3>>3 weeks have been accounted for
He tracked 8 weeks so there are 8-3 = <<8-3=5>>5 weeks left
He spent 4 hours each week for 5 weeks for a total of 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20 hours
The total across the 8 weeks is: 16+20 = <<16+20=36>>36 hours

Response:
To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total hours for the weeks without exceptions**:
   Josh worked out for 4 hours each week for 8 weeks. Therefore, the total hours for these weeks is:
   \[
   \text{Total hours without exceptions} = 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Identify the exceptions**:
   - For two consecutive weeks, Josh spent 5 hours each week.
   - In another week, he spent 6 hours.

3. **Calculate the hours for the weeks with exceptions**:
   - For the two consecutive weeks where he spent 5 hours each:
   \[
   \text{Hours for 2 weeks} = 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]
   - For the week where he spent 6 hours:
   \[
   \text{Hours for 1 week} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total hours spent on exceptions**:
   Now, we add the hours from the weeks with exceptions:
   \[
   \text{Total hours for exceptions} = 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total hours spent working out**:
   To find the total hours Josh spent working out, we need to adjust the initial total (32 hours) by subtracting the hours he would have spent during the weeks he worked out 4 hours (for the weeks he worked out more) and adding the hours he actually worked out during those weeks.
   
   Since he worked out 4 hours for 6 weeks (the remaining weeks after accounting for the 3 weeks with exceptions), we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Hours for 6 weeks at 4 hours/week} = 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours}
   \]

   Now, we add the hours from the exceptions:
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = 24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
   \[
   \boxed{40} \text{ hours}
   \]

Response:
To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for his regular workout hours and the exceptions he noted.

1. **Regular Workout Hours**:
   - Josh worked out for 4 hours each week for 8 weeks.
   - The total hours from these regular weeks can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Regular hours} = 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Adjusting for Exceptions**:
   - Josh had two exceptions where he worked out more than the regular hours:
     - For two consecutive weeks, he worked out 5 hours each week.
     - In one week, he worked out 6 hours.

   - Let's calculate the additional hours from these exceptions:
     - For the two consecutive weeks at 5 hours:
       \[
       \text{Additional hours from 5 hours/week} = 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours}
       \]
     - For the week where he worked out 6 hours:
       \[
       \text{Additional hours from 6 hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
       \]

3. **Total Additional Hours**:
   - Now, we sum the additional hours:
     \[
     \text{Total additional hours} = 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculating Total Hours**:
   - Finally, we add the regular hours and the total additional hours to find the overall total:
     \[
     \text{Total hours} = \text{Regular hours} + \text{Total additional hours} = 32 \text{ hours} + 16 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[
\boxed{48} \text{ hours}
\]

Response:
To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total hours for the weeks without exceptions**:
   - Josh worked out for 4 hours each week for 8 weeks.
   - Total hours without exceptions = 4 hours/week × 8 weeks = 32 hours.

2. **Identify the exceptions**:
   - Josh spent 5 hours for two consecutive weeks. This means for those two weeks, he worked out an additional hour each week compared to the usual 4 hours.
   - He also spent 6 hours in one week, which is an additional 2 hours compared to the usual 4 hours.

3. **Calculate the additional hours due to exceptions**:
   - For the two weeks where he worked out 5 hours:
     - Additional hours for these two weeks = (5 hours - 4 hours) × 2 weeks = 1 hour × 2 = 2 hours.
   - For the week where he worked out 6 hours:
     - Additional hours for this week = (6 hours - 4 hours) = 2 hours.

4. **Total additional hours**:
   - Total additional hours = Additional hours from two weeks at 5 hours + Additional hours from one week at 6 hours.
   - Total additional hours = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.

5. **Calculate the final total hours worked out**:
   - Total hours worked out = Total hours without exceptions + Total additional hours.
   - Total hours worked out = 32 hours + 4 hours = 36 hours.

Thus, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is **36 hours**.
