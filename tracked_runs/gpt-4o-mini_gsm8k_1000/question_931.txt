Question ID: 458

Question:
Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots. Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?


Reference Answer:
First find the total number of puppies: 8 puppies + 12 puppies = <<8+12=20>>20 puppies
Then find the total number of puppies with spots: 3 puppies + 4 puppies = <<3+4=7>>7 puppies
Then divide the number of spotted puppies by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of puppies with spots: 7 puppies / 20 puppies * 100% = 35%
#### 35

Response:
To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of puppies.**
   - Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies.
   - Brandon's dog has 12 puppies.
   - Total puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
   \[
   \text{Total puppies} = 8 + 12 = 20
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of puppies with spots.**
   - Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots.
   - Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.
   - Total puppies with spots = Jennifer's spotted puppies + Brandon's spotted puppies
   \[
   \text{Total puppies with spots} = 3 + 4 = 7
   \]

3. **Calculate the percentage of puppies with spots.**
   - The formula for percentage is given by:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   - Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform the calculation.**
   - First, calculate \( \frac{7}{20} \):
   \[
   \frac{7}{20} = 0.35
   \]
   - Now, multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
   \[
   0.35 \times 100 = 35
   \]

Thus, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is \( \boxed{35} \).
