Question ID: 778

Question:
At the local Pick Your Own fruit orchard, you could pick your own peaches for $2.00 per pound, plums were $1.00 per pound and apricots were $3.00 per pound.  If Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches, 8 pounds of plums and 6 pounds of apricots, how much did he spend on fruit?


Reference Answer:
He bought 6 pounds of peaches that are $2.00 per pound so he spent 6*2 = $<<6*2=12.00>>12.00 on peaches
He bought 8 pounds of plums that are $1.00 per pound so he spent 8*1 = $<<8*1=8.00>>8.00 on plums
He bought 6 pounds of apricots that are $3.00 per pound so he spent 6*3 = $<<6*3=18.00>>18.00 on apricots
That day, he spent 12+8+18 = $<<12+8+18=38.00>>38.00 on fruit

Response:
To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of fruit he picked and then sum those costs.

1. **Calculate the cost of peaches:**
   - Price per pound of peaches = $2.00
   - Weight of peaches picked = 6 pounds
   - Total cost for peaches = Price per pound × Weight
   \[
   \text{Total cost for peaches} = 2.00 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 6 \, \text{pounds} = 12.00 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of plums:**
   - Price per pound of plums = $1.00
   - Weight of plums picked = 8 pounds
   - Total cost for plums = Price per pound × Weight
   \[
   \text{Total cost for plums} = 1.00 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 8 \, \text{pounds} = 8.00 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of apricots:**
   - Price per pound of apricots = $3.00
   - Weight of apricots picked = 6 pounds
   - Total cost for apricots = Price per pound × Weight
   \[
   \text{Total cost for apricots} = 3.00 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 6 \, \text{pounds} = 18.00 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Sum the total costs:**
   - Total cost = Total cost for peaches + Total cost for plums + Total cost for apricots
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 12.00 \, \text{dollars} + 8.00 \, \text{dollars} + 18.00 \, \text{dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 38.00 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, Winston spent a total of **$38.00** on fruit.

Final answer: **$38.00**

To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit he picked and then sum those costs.

1. **Calculate the cost of peaches:**
   - Price per pound of peaches = $2.00
   - Pounds of peaches picked = 6
   - Total cost for peaches = Price per pound × Pounds picked
   \[
   \text{Total cost for peaches} = 2.00 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 6 \, \text{pounds} = 12.00 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of plums:**
   - Price per pound of plums = $1.00
   - Pounds of plums picked = 8
   - Total cost for plums = Price per pound × Pounds picked
   \[
   \text{Total cost for plums} = 1.00 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 8 \, \text{pounds} = 8.00 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of apricots:**
   - Price per pound of apricots = $3.00
   - Pounds of apricots picked = 6
   - Total cost for apricots = Price per pound × Pounds picked
   \[
   \text{Total cost for apricots} = 3.00 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 6 \, \text{pounds} = 18.00 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Sum the total costs:**
   - Total cost = Total cost for peaches + Total cost for plums + Total cost for apricots
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 12.00 \, \text{dollars} + 8.00 \, \text{dollars} + 18.00 \, \text{dollars} = 38.00 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, Winston spent a total of **$38.00** on fruit. 

Final answer: **$38.00**

   - Total cost for plums = Price per pound × Pounds picked
   \[
   \text{Total cost for plums} = 1.00 \times 8 = 8.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of apricots:**
   - Price per pound of apricots = $3.00

   - Total cost for apricots = Price per pound × Pounds picked
   \[
   \text{Total cost for apricots} = 3.00 \times 6 = 18.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for all fruits:**
   - Total cost = Total cost for peaches + Total cost for plums + Total cost for apricots
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 12.00 + 8.00 + 18.00 = 38.00
   \]

Therefore, Winston spent a total of **$38.00** on fruit.
