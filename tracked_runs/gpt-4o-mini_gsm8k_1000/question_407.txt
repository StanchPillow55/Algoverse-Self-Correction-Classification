Question ID: 702

Question:
Gissela, Gordy, and Gary are truck drivers.  Gissela has a truck large enough to haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.  And when Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?


Reference Answer:
Gordy's truck can carry 4000+800=<<4000+800=4800>>4800 pounds of gravel.
Thus, Gary's truck can carry 11,600-4000-4800=<<11600-4000-4800=2800>>2800 pounds of gravel.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much gravel Gary's truck can carry. We will start by defining the capacities of each truck based on the information provided.

1. **Gissela's Truck Capacity**: 
   Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
   \[
   G_{\text{Gissela}} = 4000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Gordy's Truck Capacity**: 
   Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Therefore, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:
   \[
   G_{\text{Gordy}} = G_{\text{Gissela}} + 800 = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Combined Capacity of All Trucks**: 
   We know that when Gary joins Gissela and Gordy, the total capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can express this as:
   \[
   G_{\text{Gissela}} + G_{\text{Gordy}} + G_{\text{Gary}} = 11600
   \]

   Substituting the known values for Gissela's and Gordy's truck capacities:
   \[
   4000 + 4800 + G_{\text{Gary}} = 11600
   \]

4. **Calculating Gary's Truck Capacity**: 
   Now we can simplify the equation to find Gary's truck capacity:
   \[
   8800 + G_{\text{Gary}} = 11600
   \]
   To isolate \( G_{\text{Gary}} \), we subtract 8800 from both sides:
   \[
   G_{\text{Gary}} = 11600 - 8800
   \]
   \[
   G_{\text{Gary}} = 2800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the capacity of Gary's truck is **2,800 pounds**.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{2800}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, we will first determine the hauling capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, and then use that information to find out how much Gary's truck can carry.

1. **Determine Gissela's truck capacity:**
   Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

   \[
   \text{Gissela's truck capacity} = 4000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine Gordy's truck capacity:**
   Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Therefore, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

   \[
   \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + 800
   \]
   \[
   \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks:**
   Now we can find the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks:

   \[
   \text{Combined capacity of Gissela and Gordy} = \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Combined capacity of Gissela and Gordy} = 4000 + 4800 = 8800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Determine Gary's truck capacity:**
   We know that the total capacity of all three trucks (Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's) is 11,600 pounds. We can set up the equation:

   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = \text{Combined capacity of Gissela and Gordy} + \text{Gary's truck capacity}
   \]
   \[
   11600 = 8800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity}
   \]

   To find Gary's truck capacity, we can rearrange the equation:

   \[
   \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 - 8800
   \]
   \[
   \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 2800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   Therefore, the capacity of Gary's truck is:

   \[
   \boxed{2800} \text{ pounds}
   \]
