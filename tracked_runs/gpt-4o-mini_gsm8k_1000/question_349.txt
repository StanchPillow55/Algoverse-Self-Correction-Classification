Question:
Chase and Rider can ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days; but on two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. How many times do they ride their bikes a week?


Reference Answer:
Each person rides his bike 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 times for 5 days.
Together, they ride 15+15 = <<15+15=30>>30 times for five days.
Each person rides his bike 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 times for every day of the other two days.
This means each person rides 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 times on each day of the other two days.
The total for the other two days is 12+12 = <<12+12=24>>24
For the whole week the together ride 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 times

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the usual riding frequency:**
   - Chase and Rider ride their bikes **thrice a day** for **5 days**.
   - This means they ride their bikes 3 times each day for those 5 days.

   \[
   \text{Rides on usual days} = 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}
   \]

2. **Identify the riding frequency on the other days:**
   - On the other **2 days**, they ride **twice** the usual amount.
   - The usual amount is 3 rides per day, so twice that would be:

   \[
   \text{Rides on these days} = 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day}
   \]

   - Therefore, for the 2 days, the total rides would be:

   \[
   \text{Rides on these 2 days} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total rides for the week:**
   - Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the rides from the other days:

   \[
   \text{Total rides in a week} = \text{Rides on usual days} + \text{Rides on other days}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total rides in a week} = 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is:

   \[
   \boxed{27}
   \]

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to break down the riding schedule of Chase and Rider step by step.

1. **Determine the usual riding frequency:**
   - Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days.
   - This means they ride:
     \[
     3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}
     \]

2. **Determine the riding frequency on the two other days:**
   - On the two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. Since they usually ride 3 times a day, on these two days they ride:
     \[
     2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day}
     \]
   - Therefore, for the two days, they ride:
     \[
     6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total rides for the week:**
   - Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the rides from the two other days:
     \[
     15 \text{ rides (from usual days)} + 12 \text{ rides (from extra days)} = 27 \text{ rides}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is:
     \[
     \boxed{27}
     \]

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week based on the information provided.

1. **Determine the usual riding frequency:**
   - Chase and Rider ride their bikes **thrice a day** for **5 days**.
   - The number of rides in these 5 days can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Rides in 5 days} = 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}
     \]

2. **Determine the riding frequency on the other two days:**
   - On the other **2 days**, they ride **twice the times they do on usual days**.
   - Since they usually ride 3 times a day, on these two days, they ride:
     \[
     \text{Rides on these days} = 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of rides on these 2 days is:
     \[
     \text{Rides in 2 days} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total rides for the week:**
   - Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the rides from the other two days:
     \[
     \text{Total rides in a week} = \text{Rides in 5 days} + \text{Rides in 2 days}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total rides in a week} = 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is:
     \[
     \boxed{27}
     \]
