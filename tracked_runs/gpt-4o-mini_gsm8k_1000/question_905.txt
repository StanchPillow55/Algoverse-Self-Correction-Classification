Question:
Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000.  He sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses that to pay for part of the bedroom set.  He then has to pay 10% a month for the bedroom set.  How much does he have to pay per month?


Reference Answer:
He has to pay 3000-1000=$<<3000-1000=2000>>2000
So he has to pay 2000*.1=$<<2000*.1=200>>200 per month
#### 200

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the net cost of the new bedroom set after selling the old one.**
2. **Calculate the monthly payment based on the interest rate.**

### Step 1: Calculate the Net Cost

Tom buys a new bedroom set for $3000. He sells his old bedroom set for $1000. To find out how much he actually needs to pay for the new bedroom set after selling the old one, we subtract the amount he received from selling the old set from the cost of the new set.

\[
\text{Net Cost} = \text{Cost of New Bedroom Set} - \text{Sale Price of Old Bedroom Set}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Net Cost} = 3000 - 1000 = 2000
\]

So, Tom needs to pay $2000 for the new bedroom set after selling his old one.

### Step 2: Calculate the Monthly Payment

Tom has to pay 10% interest per month on the remaining amount of $2000. To find the monthly payment, we calculate 10% of $2000.

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \text{Net Cost} \times \text{Interest Rate}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = 2000 \times 0.10 = 200
\]

Thus, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.

### Final Answer

Tom has to pay **$200 per month** for the bedroom set.
