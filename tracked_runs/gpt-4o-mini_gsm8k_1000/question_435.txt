Question:
The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house. The sun is moving at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house. If the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves for 10 hours, how many degrees will there be from the ground to the sun?


Reference Answer:
5 degrees an hour for 10 hours 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 degrees
the pyramid is 32 degrees from the ground so 32+50=<<32+50=82>>82 degrees
#### 82

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the angle between the ground and the sun after it has moved for 10 hours, starting from the tip of the pyramid.

1. **Initial Angle of the Pyramid**: The pyramid is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. This means that the top of the pyramid is 32 degrees above the horizontal ground level.

2. **Sun's Movement**: The sun is moving at a rate of 5 degrees per hour upward from the pyramid. This means that for every hour that passes, the angle between the ground and the sun increases by 5 degrees.

3. **Total Movement of the Sun**: Since the sun moves for 10 hours, we can calculate the total degrees it moves upward:
   \[
   \text{Total movement} = \text{Rate of movement} \times \text{Time} = 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

4. **Final Angle of the Sun**: The final angle of the sun from the ground will be the initial angle of the pyramid plus the total movement of the sun:
   \[
   \text{Final angle} = \text{Initial angle} + \text{Total movement} = 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: After 10 hours, the angle from the ground to the sun will be 82 degrees.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{82 \text{ degrees}}
\]
