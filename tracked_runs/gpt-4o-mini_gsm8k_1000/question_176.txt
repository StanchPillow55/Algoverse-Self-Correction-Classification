Question ID: 609

Question:
Juan wants to add croissants to his bakery menu.  It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.  He wants to start with making 4 dozen a day for a week.  How many pounds of butter will he need to make these croissants?


Reference Answer:
1/4 pound of butter makes 1 dozen croissants and he wants to make 4 dozen so thatâ€™s 4*.25 = <<4*.25=1>>1 pound of butter
He wants to add 4 dozen croissants a day to the menu for a total of 7 days so he needs 1*7 = 7 pounds of butter

Response:
To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need to make croissants for a week, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of butter needed for one dozen croissants**: 
   According to the problem, it takes \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.

2. **Calculate the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants**: 
   Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants, we can multiply the amount of butter needed for 1 dozen by 4:
   \[
   \text{Butter for 4 dozen} = 4 \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound} = 1 \text{ pound}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed for a week**: 
   Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissants every day for a week. A week has 7 days, so we multiply the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen by the number of days in a week:
   \[
   \text{Total butter for a week} = 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of butter Juan will need to make croissants for a week is \( \boxed{7} \) pounds.
