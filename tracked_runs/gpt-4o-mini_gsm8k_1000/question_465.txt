Question ID: 452

Question:
A car is on a road trip and drives 60 mph for 2 hours, and then 30 mph for 1 hour. What is the car's average speed in mph during this trip?


Reference Answer:
The car drives 60*2=<<60*2=120>>120 miles for 2 hours.
The car drives 30*1=<<30*1=30>>30 miles for 1 hour.
It drives a total of 120+30=<<120+30=150>>150 miles.
Let S be the average speed, M be the number of miles, and H the number of hours spent driving.
Then we have, S=M/H, so, S=150 miles/3 hours = <<150/3=50>>50 mph

Response:
To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance traveled during each segment of the trip.**
2. **Calculate the total time taken for the trip.**
3. **Use the formula for average speed.**

### Step 1: Calculate the distance for each segment

**First Segment:**
- Speed = 60 mph
- Time = 2 hours

Distance for the first segment can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]
\[
\text{Distance}_1 = 60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}
\]

**Second Segment:**
- Speed = 30 mph
- Time = 1 hour

Distance for the second segment:
\[
\text{Distance}_2 = 30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance and total time

**Total Distance:**
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}
\]

**Total Time:**
\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the average speed

The average speed can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
\]
Substituting the values we found:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}
\]

### Final Answer
The car's average speed during the trip is **50 mph**.
