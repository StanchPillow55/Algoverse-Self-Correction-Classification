Question ID: 1055

Question:
James has to buy insurance.  Since he had an accident it was 60% more than normal.  The normal cost is $120 a month.  How much does he pay a year?


Reference Answer:
The insurance is 120*.6=$<<120*.6=72>>72 per month more expensive than normal
So he paid 120+72=$<<120+72=192>>192 a month
That means he pays 12*192=$<<12*192=2304>>2304
#### 2304

Response:
To determine how much James pays for insurance per year after the increase due to his accident, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the normal cost of insurance**: 
   The normal cost of insurance is given as $120 per month.

2. **Calculate the increase in cost due to the accident**: 
   The problem states that the cost is 60% more than the normal cost. To find the increase, we first calculate 60% of the normal cost.

   \[
   \text{Increase} = 60\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.60 \times 120
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   0.60 \times 120 = 72
   \]

   So, the increase in cost is $72.

3. **Calculate the new monthly cost**: 
   To find the new monthly cost, we add the increase to the normal cost:

   \[
   \text{New Monthly Cost} = \text{Normal Cost} + \text{Increase} = 120 + 72
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   120 + 72 = 192
   \]

   Thus, the new monthly cost is $192.

4. **Calculate the annual cost**: 
   To find out how much James pays for insurance in a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by the number of months in a year (12 months):

   \[
   \text{Annual Cost} = \text{New Monthly Cost} \times 12 = 192 \times 12
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   192 \times 12 = 2304
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total amount James pays for insurance in a year is **$2304**.

\[
\text{Final Answer: } 2304
\]
