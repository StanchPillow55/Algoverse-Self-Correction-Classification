Question:
Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. How many miles farther did Shandy drive than Matteo?


Reference Answer:
Matteo = 55 * 4 = <<55*4=220>>220 miles
Shandy = 45 * 10 = <<45*10=450>>450 miles
450 - 220 = <<450-220=230>>230 miles
Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.
#### 230

Response:
To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

**Step 1: Calculate Matteo's distance.**

Matteo's speed is 55 miles per hour, and he traveled for 4 hours. We can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

Substituting Matteo's values into the formula:

\[
\text{Distance}_{Matteo} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Distance}_{Matteo} = 220 \, \text{miles}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Shandy's distance.**

Shandy's speed is 45 miles per hour, and she traveled for 10 hours. Using the same distance formula:

\[
\text{Distance}_{Shandy} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Distance}_{Shandy} = 450 \, \text{miles}
\]

**Step 3: Determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo.**

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{Shandy} - \text{Distance}_{Matteo}
\]

Substituting the distances we calculated:

\[
\text{Difference} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Difference} = 230 \, \text{miles}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.
