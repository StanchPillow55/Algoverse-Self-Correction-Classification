Question:
Theo bought a pen for $2 and a piece of paper that cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. She gave the cashier $10. What is the amount of change Theo received?


Reference Answer:
Three times the cost of pen is $2 x 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.
The cost of paper is $6 - $1 = $<<6-1=5>>5.
The total cost for the pen and paper is $2 + $5 = $<<2+5=7>>7.
Theo received $10 - $7 = $<<10-7=3>>3 change.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the total cost of the items Theo bought and then calculate the change she received after paying with a $10 bill.

1. **Identify the cost of the pen**:
   - Theo bought a pen for $2.

2. **Determine the cost of the piece of paper**:
   - The problem states that the piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen.
   - First, we calculate three times the price of the pen:
     \[
     3 \times 2 = 6
     \]
   - Now, we subtract $1 from this amount to find the cost of the paper:
     \[
     6 - 1 = 5
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of the piece of paper is $5.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the items**:
   - Now we add the cost of the pen and the cost of the paper:
     \[
     2 + 5 = 7
     \]
   - The total cost of the pen and the paper is $7.

4. **Calculate the change Theo received**:
   - Theo paid the cashier $10. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
     \[
     10 - 7 = 3
     \]
   - Therefore, the amount of change Theo received is $3.

5. **Final answer**:
   - Theo received **$3** in change.
