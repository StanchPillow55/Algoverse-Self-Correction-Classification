Question:
Antoine's french onion soup recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions. He likes to double that amount. His soup serves 6 people. The onions are currently on sale for $2.00 a pound. He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, that are also on sale for $2.00 a box.  What is the cost per serving? (Round to the nearest integer.)


Reference Answer:
His recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions but he wants to double that amount so he needs 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 pounds of onions
Onions are currently on sale for $2.00 a pound so they will cost 4*2 = $8.00
He needs 2 boxes of stock which are also on sale for $2.00 so they will cost 2*2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00
The onions are $8.00 and the stock is $4.00 for a total of 8+4 = $<<8+4=12.00>>12.00
The soup serves 6 people and the total cost is $12.00 so each serving is 12/6 = $<<12/6=2.00>>2.00 a serving

Response:
To find the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of onions needed**: 
   - The original recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions.
   - Antoine likes to double that amount, so:
     \[
     \text{Total onions needed} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the onions**:
   - The price of onions is $2.00 per pound.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the onions is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of onions} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pound} = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the amount of beef stock needed**:
   - Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock.

4. **Calculate the cost of the beef stock**:
   - The price of beef stock is $2.00 per box.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the beef stock is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of beef stock} = 2 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the ingredients**:
   - Now we add the cost of the onions and the cost of the beef stock:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of onions} + \text{Cost of beef stock} = 8 \text{ dollars} + 4 \text{ dollars} = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Determine the number of servings**:
   - The soup serves 6 people.

7. **Calculate the cost per serving**:
   - To find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:
     \[
     \text{Cost per serving} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of servings}} = \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{6 \text{ servings}} = 2 \text{ dollars/serving}
     \]

8. **Round to the nearest integer**:
   - The cost per serving is already an integer, so no rounding is necessary.

Finally, the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup is:
\[
\boxed{2} \text{ dollars}
\]
