Question ID: 1232

Question:
Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving her friend some pomelos, Eve is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. How many pomelos did Eve give away?


Reference Answer:
Eve is left with 20 x 1/4 = <<20*1/4=5>>5 pieces of pomelos.
So she gave away 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 pieces of pomelos to her friend.
#### 15


=== Turn 1 ===


Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pomelos Eve gave away after starting with 20 pieces.

1. **Identify the initial amount of pomelos**: 
   Eve originally had 20 pomelos.

2. **Determine the amount of pomelos left**: 
   According to the problem, after giving some pomelos away, Eve is left with \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pomelos she originally had. 

   We can calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 20:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
   \]
   So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

3. **Calculate the number of pomelos given away**: 
   To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the number she originally had:
   \[
   \text{Pomelos given away} = \text{Original amount} - \text{Amount left}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Pomelos given away} = 20 - 5 = 15
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the number of pomelos Eve gave away is \( \boxed{15} \).
