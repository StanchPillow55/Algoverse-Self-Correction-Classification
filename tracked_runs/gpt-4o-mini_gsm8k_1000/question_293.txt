Question ID: 706

Question:
The local firefighters are doing a “fill the boot” fundraiser. Their goal is to raise $6300. After the first 3 hours, they have raised $2100.  For how many hours do they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal, assuming an equal amount raised in every hour?


Reference Answer:
The fireman raise 2100 / 3 = $<<2100/3=700>>700 per hour.
They have to fundraise for 6300 / 700 = <<6300/700=9>>9 hours.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many total hours the firefighters need to fundraise in order to reach their goal of $6300, given that they have already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours.

### Step 1: Determine the amount remaining to reach the goal

First, we calculate how much more money they need to raise to reach their goal:

\[
\text{Amount remaining} = \text{Goal} - \text{Amount raised}
\]
\[
\text{Amount remaining} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the rate of fundraising per hour

Next, we need to find out how much money they raised per hour during the first 3 hours. We can do this by dividing the amount raised by the number of hours:

\[
\text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{\text{Amount raised}}{\text{Number of hours}}
\]
\[
\text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many additional hours are needed to raise the remaining amount

Now that we know they raise $700 per hour, we can find out how many additional hours are needed to raise the remaining $4200:

\[
\text{Additional hours needed} = \frac{\text{Amount remaining}}{\text{Amount raised per hour}}
\]
\[
\text{Additional hours needed} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total hours of fundraising

Finally, we need to add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours needed:

\[
\text{Total hours} = \text{Initial hours} + \text{Additional hours needed}
\]
\[
\text{Total hours} = 3 + 6 = 9
\]

### Final Answer

The firefighters need to fundraise for a total of **9 hours** to reach their goal of $6300.
