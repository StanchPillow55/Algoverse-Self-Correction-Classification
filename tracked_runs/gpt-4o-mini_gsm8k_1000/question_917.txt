Question ID: 522

Question:
It's strawberry-picking time on Grandma Concetta's farm.  Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour, while Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony.  Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, and Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy.  In total, how many quarts of strawberries can Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm?


Reference Answer:
Bobby picks one fewer quart of strawberries per hour than the 6 quarts of berries per hour that Tony can pick, for a total of 6-1=<<6-1=5>>5 quarts per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, for a total of 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, or a total of 10-2=8 quarts per hour. Thus, in total, Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick 6+5+10+8=<<6+5+10+8=29>>29 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will first determine the picking rates for each individual based on the information provided.

1. **Determine Tony's picking rate:**
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
   \[
   \text{Tony's rate} = 6 \text{ quarts/hour}
   \]

2. **Determine Bobby's picking rate:**
   - Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony. Therefore, we subtract 1 from Tony's rate.
   \[
   \text{Bobby's rate} = \text{Tony's rate} - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 \text{ quarts/hour}
   \]

3. **Determine Kathy's picking rate:**
   - Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby. Therefore, we multiply Bobby's rate by 2.
   \[
   \text{Kathy's rate} = 2 \times \text{Bobby's rate} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ quarts/hour}
   \]

4. **Determine Ricky's picking rate:**
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy. Therefore, we subtract 2 from Kathy's rate.
   \[
   \text{Ricky's rate} = \text{Kathy's rate} - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ quarts/hour}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total picking rate for all four individuals:**
   - Now we will sum the rates of Tony, Bobby, Kathy, and Ricky.
   \[
   \text{Total rate} = \text{Tony's rate} + \text{Bobby's rate} + \text{Kathy's rate} + \text{Ricky's rate}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total rate} = 6 + 5 + 10 + 8
   \]

6. **Perform the addition:**
   \[
   6 + 5 = 11
   \]
   \[
   11 + 10 = 21
   \]
   \[
   21 + 8 = 29
   \]

Thus, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Kathy, and Ricky can pick per hour is:
\[
\boxed{29}
\]
