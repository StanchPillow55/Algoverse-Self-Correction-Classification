Question ID: 341

Question:
A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the same as a green toad, 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, but 20 pounds more than a red bird. If the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal if the container also weighs 20 pounds.


Reference Answer:
Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, if the weight of the pick frog is 50 pounds, the three animals weigh 3*50 = 150 pounds together.
The pink frog also weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, meaning the weight of the yellow snake is 50+10 = <<50+10=60>>60 pounds.
If you add the weight of the frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, and the yellow snake together, all the animals minus the red bird will have a total weight of 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 pounds.
The pink frog's weight is also 20 pounds more than a red bird, meaning the red bird weighs 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 pounds.
All the animals weigh a total of 30+210 = <<30+210=240>>240 pounds
If the animals are in a container weighing 20 pounds, the total weight of the full container is 240+20 = 260 pounds

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the weights of each animal based on the information provided about the pink frog, and then calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal along with the weight of the container itself.

1. **Weight of the Pink Frog**: 
   - The problem states that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds.

2. **Weight of the Blue Beetle**: 
   - The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle. Therefore, the weight of the blue beetle is also 50 pounds.

3. **Weight of the Green Toad**: 
   - The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad. Therefore, the weight of the green toad is also 50 pounds.

4. **Weight of the Yellow Snake**: 
   - The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. 
   - Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Weight of Yellow Snake} = \text{Weight of Pink Frog} + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ pounds}
     \]

5. **Weight of the Red Bird**: 
   - The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird.
   - We can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Weight of Red Bird} = \text{Weight of Pink Frog} - 20 = 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Now we have the weights of all the animals:
- Pink Frog: 50 pounds
- Blue Beetle: 50 pounds
- Green Toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow Snake: 60 pounds
- Red Bird: 30 pounds

6. **Total Weight of the Animals**: 
   - We need to calculate the total weight of one of each animal:
   \[
   \text{Total Weight of Animals} = \text{Weight of Pink Frog} + \text{Weight of Blue Beetle} + \text{Weight of Green Toad} + \text{Weight of Yellow Snake} + \text{Weight of Red Bird}
   \]
   \[
   = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30
   \]
   \[
   = 240 \text{ pounds}
   \]

7. **Weight of the Container**: 
   - The problem states that the container weighs 20 pounds.

8. **Total Weight of the Container and Animals**: 
   - We now add the weight of the container to the total weight of the animals:
   \[
   \text{Total Weight} = \text{Total Weight of Animals} + \text{Weight of Container}
   \]
   \[
   = 240 + 20 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{260} \text{ pounds}
\]

Response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the weight of the pink frog**: 
   The problem states that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds.

2. **Determine the weight of the blue beetle**: 
   The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle. Therefore, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

3. **Determine the weight of the green toad**: 
   The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad. Thus, the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

4. **Determine the weight of the yellow snake**: 
   The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can calculate the weight of the yellow snake as follows:
   \[
   \text{Weight of yellow snake} = \text{Weight of pink frog} + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Determine the weight of the red bird**: 
   The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. Therefore, we can find the weight of the red bird using the following calculation:
   \[
   \text{Weight of red bird} = \text{Weight of pink frog} - 20 = 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total weight of the animals**:
   Now we will sum the weights of all the animals:
   - Weight of pink frog: 50 pounds
   - Weight of blue beetle: 50 pounds
   - Weight of green toad: 50 pounds
   - Weight of yellow snake: 60 pounds
   - Weight of red bird: 30 pounds

   Total weight of the animals:
   \[
   50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 \text{ pounds}
   \]

7. **Include the weight of the container**: 
   The container weighs 20 pounds. Therefore, we add this to the total weight of the animals:
   \[
   \text{Total weight with container} = \text{Total weight of animals} + \text{Weight of container} = 240 + 20 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

**Final Answer**: The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is **260 pounds**.
