Sarahâ€™s basketball games are 4 quarters that are each 12 minutes long. In the last quarter, there was a tie so the game was extended for five minutes. How long did the entire game last?

Response:
To determine the total duration of Sarah's basketball game, we need to consider the length of the regular game and the additional time added due to the tie in the last quarter.

1. **Calculate the duration of the regular game:**
   - A basketball game consists of 4 quarters.
   - Each quarter lasts 12 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time for the 4 quarters can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total time for 4 quarters} = 4 \text{ quarters} \times 12 \text{ minutes/quarter} = 48 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Add the extra time due to the tie:**
   - The game was extended for an additional 5 minutes because of the tie in the last quarter.
   - We need to add this extra time to the total time calculated for the regular game:

   \[
   \text{Total game time} = \text{Total time for 4 quarters} + \text{Extra time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total game time} = 48 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 53 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - The entire game lasted a total of 53 minutes.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{53 \text{ minutes}}
\]
