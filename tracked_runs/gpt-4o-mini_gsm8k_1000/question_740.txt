Question:
Ashley has an internet connection speed of 20kb per second. Knowing that 1 Mb has 1000 kb, she wants to know her internet connection speed in Mb per hour. What is Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour?


Reference Answer:
With a speed of 20 kb per second, there are 20*60 = <<20*60=1200>>1200 kb per minute.
As 1Mb has 1000kb, the converted speed is 1200/1000=<<1200/1000=1.2>>1.2Mb per minute.
So, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 1.2*60 = <<1.2*60=72>>72Mb per hour.

Response:
To convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to megabits per hour (Mb/h), we will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the conversion factors**:
   - We know that 1 megabit (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobits (kb).
   - We also need to convert seconds to hours. There are 3600 seconds in one hour.

2. **Calculate the speed in megabits per second**:
   - Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb/s. To convert this to megabits per second, we use the conversion factor:
     \[
     \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{\text{Speed in kb/s}}{1000}
     \]
   - Plugging in Ashley's speed:
     \[
     \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s}
     \]

3. **Convert the speed from megabits per second to megabits per hour**:
   - Since there are 3600 seconds in one hour, we multiply the speed in megabits per second by the number of seconds in an hour:
     \[
     \text{Speed in Mb/h} = \text{Speed in Mb/s} \times 3600
     \]
   - Substituting the value we calculated:
     \[
     \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h}
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \times 3600 = 72 \text{ Mb/h}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is **72 megabits per hour (Mb/h)**.

In conclusion, Ashley's internet connection speed in megabits per hour is **72 Mb/h**.

To convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to megabits per hour (Mb/h), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Units**:
   - Ashley's speed is given as 20 kb/s.
   - We know that 1 Mb = 1000 kb.
   - We need to convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/h.

2. **Convert kb/s to Mb/s**:
   - To convert kilobits to megabits, we divide the number of kilobits by 1000.
   \[
   \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{\text{Speed in kb/s}}{1000} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s}
   \]

3. **Convert seconds to hours**:
   - There are 3600 seconds in an hour (60 seconds per minute × 60 minutes per hour).
   - To find out how many megabits Ashley can download in one hour, we multiply her speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour.
   \[
   \text{Speed in Mb/h} = \text{Speed in Mb/s} \times \text{Number of seconds in an hour}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total megabits per hour**:
   \[
   \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \times 3600 = 72 \text{ Mb/h}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Ashley's internet connection speed is **72 megabits per hour (Mb/h)**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{72 \text{ Mb/h}}
\]

1. **Convert kilobits to megabits**: 
   Since 1 megabit (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobits (kb), we can convert 20 kb/s to megabits per second (Mb/s) using the conversion factor:
   \[
   \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{\text{Speed in kb/s}}{1000} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s}
   \]

2. **Convert seconds to hours**: 
   There are 3600 seconds in one hour. To find the speed in megabits per hour (Mb/h), we multiply the speed in megabits per second by the number of seconds in an hour:
   \[
   \text{Speed in Mb/h} = \text{Speed in Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ seconds} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s}
   \]

3. **Calculate the final speed**:
   \[
   \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \times 3600 = 72 \text{ Mb/h}
   \]

Thus, Ashley’s internet connection speed is **72 megabits per hour**.

Final answer: **72 Mb/h**.
