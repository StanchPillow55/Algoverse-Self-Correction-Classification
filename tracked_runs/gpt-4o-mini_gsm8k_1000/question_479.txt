Question:
Nate's dog can dig six holes a day. He digs for 14 days while Nate is on vacation. When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. How many weeks does it take him to fill in all the holes?


Reference Answer:
First find the number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation: 14 days * 6 holes/day = <<14*6=84>>84 holes
Then find the net number of holes Nate fill in each day: 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = <<9-6=3>>3 holes/day
Then divide the total number of holes by the daily decrease in the number of holes to find the number of days Nate spends filling in holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = <<84/3=28>>28 days
Then divide the number of days by the number of days per week to convert the answer to weeks: 28 days / 7 days/week = <<28/7=4>>4 weeks

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's vacation.**
   - The dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = holes per day Ã— number of days
   \[
   \text{Total holes dug} = 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Determine the rate at which Nate fills in the holes and the rate at which the dog continues to dig.**
   - Nate fills in 9 holes per day.
   - The dog digs 6 new holes every night.
   - Therefore, the net effect of Nate's work each day is:
   \[
   \text{Net holes filled per day} = \text{holes filled by Nate} - \text{holes dug by the dog}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Net holes filled per day} = 9 \text{ holes} - 6 \text{ holes} = 3 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes.**
   - Nate needs to fill in a total of 84 holes.
   - Since he fills in a net of 3 holes per day, we can find the number of days required to fill all the holes:
   \[
   \text{Days required} = \frac{\text{Total holes}}{\text{Net holes filled per day}} = \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days}
   \]

4. **Convert the number of days into weeks.**
   - There are 7 days in a week, so we convert the total days into weeks:
   \[
   \text{Weeks required} = \frac{\text{Days required}}{7} = \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7} = 4 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Thus, it takes Nate **4 weeks** to fill in all the holes.

**Final Answer: 4 weeks**
