Question ID: 913

Question:
Benny threw bologna at his balloons.  He threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon and three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.  If Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons, and twenty of the balloons were red, then how many of the balloons in the bundle were yellow?


Reference Answer:
If Benny had twenty red balloons in the bundle, and he threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, then he threw 2*20=40 pieces of bologna at red balloons in the bundle.
If he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at balloons in the bundle, then he threw 58-40=<<58-40=18>>18 pieces of bologna at yellow balloons.
If he threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, then he had 18/3=<<18/3=6>>6 yellow balloons.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many yellow balloons Benny had, given that he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at a combination of red and yellow balloons.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be the number of red balloons.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.

2. **Given information:**
   - Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
   - Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
   - The total number of red balloons \( r = 20 \).
   - The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.

3. **Set up the equation:**
   Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon, we can express the total pieces of bologna thrown as:
   \[
   2r + 3y = 58
   \]

4. **Substitute the known value:**
   We know \( r = 20 \), so we substitute this into the equation:
   \[
   2(20) + 3y = 58
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   40 + 3y = 58
   \]

5. **Solve for \( y \):**
   To isolate \( y \), we first subtract 40 from both sides:
   \[
   3y = 58 - 40
   \]
   \[
   3y = 18
   \]
   Now, divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   y = \frac{18}{3} = 6
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   The number of yellow balloons in the bundle is \( y = 6 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
