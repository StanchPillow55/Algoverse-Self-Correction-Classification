Question ID: 384

Question:
Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. How much land did he have at first?


Reference Answer:
Mr. Ruther is left with 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of his land.
Since 2/5 is equal to 12.8 hectares, then 1/5 is equal to 12.8/2 = <<12.8/2=6.4>>6.4 hectares.
Hence, Mr. Ruther had 6.4 x 5 = <<6.4*5=32>>32 hectares of land at first.

Response:
To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the problem using algebra.

1. **Define the Variables**:
   Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first (in hectares).

2. **Understanding the Problem**:
   Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land. This means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. According to the problem, the amount of land he has left is 12.8 hectares.

3. **Set Up the Equation**:
   Since \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his total land \( x \) is equal to 12.8 hectares, we can write the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   To isolate \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \) to get rid of the fraction:
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Right Side**:
   First, calculate \( 12.8 \times 5 \):
   \[
   12.8 \times 5 = 64
   \]
   Now, divide by 2:
   \[
   \frac{64}{2} = 32
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   Therefore, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first is:
   \[
   x = 32 \text{ hectares}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]
