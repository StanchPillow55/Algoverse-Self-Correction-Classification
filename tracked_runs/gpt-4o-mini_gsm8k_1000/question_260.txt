Question ID: 906

Question:
Tim has a box with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. If he uses 3 blue shoeboxes and 1/3 red of his shoeboxes to go fishing, how many red and blue shoe boxes are left in Tim's box?


Reference Answer:
If Tim uses 3 blue shoeboxes, he remains with 7-3=<<7-3=4>>4 blue shoe boxes in the box.
Tim also uses 1/3 of the red shoeboxes, a total of 1/3*9=<<1/3*9=3>>3 red shoe boxes.
Tim remains with 9-3=<<9-3=6>>6 red shoeboxes.
The total number of red and blue shoe boxes left in Tim's box is 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many blue and red shoeboxes Tim has left after he uses some for fishing.

1. **Identify the initial quantities of shoeboxes:**
   - Blue shoeboxes: 7
   - Red shoeboxes: 9

2. **Determine how many blue shoeboxes Tim uses:**
   - Tim uses 3 blue shoeboxes.

3. **Calculate the remaining blue shoeboxes:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining blue shoeboxes} = \text{Initial blue shoeboxes} - \text{Used blue shoeboxes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining blue shoeboxes} = 7 - 3 = 4
   \]

4. **Determine how many red shoeboxes Tim uses:**
   - Tim uses \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his red shoeboxes.
   - To find \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the red shoeboxes, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Used red shoeboxes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining red shoeboxes:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining red shoeboxes} = \text{Initial red shoeboxes} - \text{Used red shoeboxes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining red shoeboxes} = 9 - 3 = 6
   \]

6. **Summarize the results:**
   - Remaining blue shoeboxes: 4
   - Remaining red shoeboxes: 6

Finally, we can state the answer clearly:

**Final Answer:**
Tim has 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes left in his box.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many blue and red shoeboxes Tim has left after he uses some of them for fishing.

### Step 1: Identify the initial quantities of shoeboxes
- Blue shoeboxes: 7
- Red shoeboxes: 9

### Step 2: Determine how many blue shoeboxes Tim uses
Tim uses 3 blue shoeboxes for fishing. 

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining blue shoeboxes
To find out how many blue shoeboxes are left, we subtract the number of blue shoeboxes used from the initial quantity:

\[
\text{Remaining blue shoeboxes} = \text{Initial blue shoeboxes} - \text{Used blue shoeboxes}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining blue shoeboxes} = 7 - 3 = 4
\]

### Step 4: Determine how many red shoeboxes Tim uses
Tim uses \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his red shoeboxes. To find out how many red shoeboxes that is, we calculate:

\[
\text{Used red shoeboxes} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Initial red shoeboxes}
\]
\[
\text{Used red shoeboxes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the remaining red shoeboxes
Now, we subtract the number of red shoeboxes used from the initial quantity:

\[
\text{Remaining red shoeboxes} = \text{Initial red shoeboxes} - \text{Used red shoeboxes}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining red shoeboxes} = 9 - 3 = 6
\]

### Step 6: Summarize the results
After Tim goes fishing, the remaining quantities of shoeboxes are:
- Remaining blue shoeboxes: 4
- Remaining red shoeboxes: 6

### Final Answer
Tim has 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes left in his box.

   - To find out how many red shoeboxes that is, we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
     \]
   - So, Tim uses 3 red shoeboxes.

4. **Calculate the remaining blue shoeboxes:**
   - Initial blue shoeboxes: 7
   - Blue shoeboxes used: 3
   - Remaining blue shoeboxes:
     \[
     7 - 3 = 4
     \]

5. **Calculate the remaining red shoeboxes:**
   - Initial red shoeboxes: 9
   - Red shoeboxes used: 3
   - Remaining red shoeboxes:
     \[
     9 - 3 = 6
     \]

6. **Final counts of shoeboxes:**
   - Remaining blue shoeboxes: 4
   - Remaining red shoeboxes: 6

Thus, after Tim goes fishing, he has 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes left.

**Final Answer:**
Tim has 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes left.
