Question ID: 7

Question:
Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2 GB/minute, but 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. How load does it take to download the file?


Reference Answer:
First find how many gigabytes are in 40% of the file: 200 GB * 40% = <<200*40*.01=80>>80 GB
Then divide that number by the download rate to find the time until Windows restarts: 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<80/2=40>>40 minutes
Then find the time to download the whole file after the restart: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<200/2=100>>100 minutes
Then add the time to download 40% of the file, to download the whole file, and to wait for Windows to update: 40 minutes + 100 minutes + 20 minutes = <<40+100+20=160>>160 minutes

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how much of the file is downloaded before the restart:**
   - Carla is downloading a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute.
   - She gets 40% of the way through the download before the restart.
   - To find out how much of the file that is, we calculate:
     \[
     0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to download 80 GB:**
   - Since she downloads at a rate of 2 GB/minute, we can find the time taken to download 80 GB:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Amount downloaded}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Account for the restart time:**
   - After downloading 80 GB, Windows forces a restart that takes 20 minutes. So, we add this time to the total time:
     \[
     \text{Total time so far} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Determine how much of the file is left to download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB left to download.

5. **Calculate the time taken to download the remaining 120 GB:**
   - Again, using the download rate of 2 GB/minute:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total time for the entire download:**
   - Now we add the time taken before the restart and the time taken after the restart:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 60 \text{ minutes (before restart)} + 60 \text{ minutes (after restart)} = 120 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it takes to download the file is:

\[
\boxed{120 \text{ minutes}}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how much of the file is downloaded before the restart:**
   - Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB/minute.
   - She is 40% of the way through the download when the restart occurs.
   - The total size of the file is 200 GB.
   - To find out how much of the file she has downloaded before the restart, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Downloaded before restart} = 200 \, \text{GB} \times 0.40 = 80 \, \text{GB}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to download 80 GB:**
   - Since Carla downloads at a rate of 2 GB/minute, we can find the time taken to download 80 GB using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Amount downloaded}}{\text{Download rate}} = \frac{80 \, \text{GB}}{2 \, \text{GB/min}} = 40 \, \text{minutes}
     \]

3. **Account for the restart time:**
   - After downloading 80 GB, Windows forces a restart that takes 20 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time spent before restarting the download is:
     \[
     \text{Total time before restart} = 40 \, \text{minutes} + 20 \, \text{minutes} = 60 \, \text{minutes}
     \]

4. **Determine how much of the file is left to download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning, and she still needs to download the remaining part of the file:
     \[
     \text{Remaining file} = 200 \, \text{GB} - 80 \, \text{GB} = 120 \, \text{GB}
     \]

5. **Calculate the time taken to download the remaining 120 GB:**
   - Again, using the download rate of 2 GB/minute, we find the time taken to download the remaining 120 GB:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{120 \, \text{GB}}{2 \, \text{GB/min}} = 60 \, \text{minutes}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total time for the entire download:**
   - The total time taken to download the file includes the time before the restart and the time after the restart:
     \[
     \text{Total download time} = 60 \, \text{minutes} + 60 \, \text{minutes} = 120 \, \text{minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file is **120 minutes**.

Final answer: **120 minutes**.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the time taken for each part of the download process.

1. **Determine how much of the file is downloaded before the restart:**
   - Carla is downloading a 200 GB file.
   - She can download at a rate of 2 GB/minute.
   - 40% of the way through the download means she has downloaded:
     \[
     0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to download the first 80 GB:**
   - The time taken to download 80 GB at a rate of 2 GB/minute is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Amount downloaded}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Account for the forced restart:**
   - After downloading 80 GB, Windows forces a restart that takes 20 minutes. 

4. **Calculate the total time spent before restarting the download:**
   - Total time before restarting the download is:
     \[
     40 \text{ minutes (download)} + 20 \text{ minutes (restart)} = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Determine the remaining file size to download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning. Therefore, she needs to download the entire 200 GB file again.

6. **Calculate the time taken to download the entire file again:**
   - The time taken to download the full 200 GB at a rate of 2 GB/minute is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 100 \text{ minutes}
     \]

7. **Calculate the total time for the entire download process:**
   - The total time for the entire download process, including the initial download and the restart, is:
     \[
     60 \text{ minutes (before restart)} + 100 \text{ minutes (restart download)} = 160 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Carla to download the file is:

\[
\boxed{160 \text{ minutes}}
\]
