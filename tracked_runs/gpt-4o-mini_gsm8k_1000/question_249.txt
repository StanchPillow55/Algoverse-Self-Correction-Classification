Question:
Will buys 15 oranges. When he gets home, he asks his 2 sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old. The oldest son is 8 years old, the youngest is half as old as the oldest. How many oranges are left unwashed?


Reference Answer:
The older son washes 8 oranges, so the younger son washes 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 oranges.
Together they wash 8 oranges + 4 oranges =<<8+4=12>>12 oranges
There are 15 oranges - 12 oranges = <<15-12=3>>3 oranges left unwashed.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many oranges Will's sons will wash based on their ages, and then find out how many oranges remain unwashed.

1. **Determine the ages of the sons:**
   - The oldest son is 8 years old.
   - The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son. Therefore, the youngest son is:
     \[
     \text{Youngest son's age} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ years old}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of oranges washed by both sons:**
   - The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 8 oranges.
   - The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 4 oranges.
   - Therefore, the total number of oranges washed is:
     \[
     \text{Total washed} = \text{Oldest son's oranges} + \text{Youngest son's oranges} = 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of unwashed oranges:**
   - Will initially bought 15 oranges.
   - To find the number of unwashed oranges, we subtract the number of washed oranges from the total number of oranges:
     \[
     \text{Unwashed oranges} = \text{Total oranges} - \text{Total washed} = 15 - 12 = 3 \text{ oranges}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - The number of oranges left unwashed is:
     \[
     \boxed{3}
     \]
