Question ID: 629

Question:
James gets a job selling used cars.  He sold 10 cars that cost $25,000 each.  The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars.  He got a 10% commission on the profits.  How much did he make?


Reference Answer:
He sold the car for 25000*10=$<<25000*10=250000>>250,000
Each car was bought for 25,000*.3=$<<25000*.3=7500>>7500
So they bought the cars for 7500*10=$<<7500*10=75000>>75,000
That means the cars had a profit of 250,000-75,000=$<<250000-75000=175000>>175,000
So his commission was 175,000*.1=$<<175000*.1=17500>>17,500
#### 17500

Response:
To determine how much James made from selling the cars, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sales revenue from selling the cars.**
2. **Determine the total cost to the company for acquiring the cars.**
3. **Calculate the profit made by the company.**
4. **Determine James's commission based on the profit.**

### Step 1: Calculate Total Sales Revenue

James sold 10 cars, each priced at $25,000. Therefore, the total sales revenue is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total Sales Revenue} = \text{Number of Cars} \times \text{Price per Car}
\]
\[
\text{Total Sales Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
\]

### Step 2: Determine Total Cost to the Company

The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire each car. First, we need to calculate the cost of acquiring one car:

\[
\text{Cost per Car} = 30\% \times \text{Price per Car} = 0.30 \times 25,000 = 7,500
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for acquiring all 10 cars:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Cars} \times \text{Cost per Car}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Profit Made by the Company

Profit is calculated as the total sales revenue minus the total cost:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Sales Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
\]
\[
\text{Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
\]

### Step 4: Determine James's Commission

James earns a 10% commission on the profits. We calculate his commission as follows:

\[
\text{Commission} = 10\% \times \text{Profit} = 0.10 \times 175,000
\]
\[
\text{Commission} = 17,500
\]

### Final Answer

James made a total of **$17,500** from his commission on the sales of the cars.

To determine how much James made from selling the cars, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**
   James sold 10 cars at a price of $25,000 each. Therefore, the total revenue from the sales is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Cars} \times \text{Price per Car}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost to the company for acquiring the cars.**
   The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire each car. We first calculate the cost for one car and then for all 10 cars:

   \[
   \text{Cost per Car} = 30\% \times \text{Price per Car} = 0.30 \times 25,000 = 7,500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Cars} \times \text{Cost per Car}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total profit from the sales.**
   Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost:

   \[
   \text{Total Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **Calculate James's commission on the profit.**
   James earns a 10% commission on the total profit. We calculate his commission as follows:

   \[
   \text{Commission} = 10\% \times \text{Total Profit} = 0.10 \times 175,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Commission} = 17,500
   \]

5. **Final answer.**
   Therefore, the total amount James made from his commission on the sales is:

   \[
   \text{James's Earnings} = 17,500
   \]

Thus, James made **$17,500** from selling the cars.
