Question ID: 979

Question:
Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother.  What is the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now?


Reference Answer:
His dad will be 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 years old when Emil is 24.
His brother will be 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 years old then.
Emil will turn 24 in 24 - 19 = <<24-19=5>>5 years.
The age of his father now is 48 - 5= <<48-5=43>>43.
His brother is 12 - 5 = <<12-5=7>>7 years old right now.
The sum of his dad's and his brother's ages now is 43 + 7 = <<43+7=50>>50.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother based on the information given about their ages when Emil turns 24.

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24**:
   Emil is currently 19 years old. Therefore, he will turn 24 in:
   \[
   24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Calculate Emil's dad's age when Emil turns 24**:
   Let \( D \) be the current age of Emil's dad. In 5 years, Emil's dad will be:
   \[
   D + 5
   \]
   According to the problem, when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad:
   \[
   24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5)
   \]

   To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   48 = D + 5
   \]
   Now, we can solve for \( D \):
   \[
   D = 48 - 5 = 43
   \]
   So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

3. **Calculate Emil's brother's age when Emil turns 24**:
   Let \( B \) be the current age of Emil's brother. In 5 years, Emil's brother will be:
   \[
   B + 5
   \]
   According to the problem, when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother:
   \[
   24 = 2(B + 5)
   \]

   Again, we can eliminate the fraction by dividing both sides by 2:
   \[
   12 = B + 5
   \]
   Now, we can solve for \( B \):
   \[
   B = 12 - 5 = 7
   \]
   So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

4. **Calculate the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now**:
   Now that we have the current ages:
   - Emil's dad: 43 years old
   - Emil's brother: 7 years old

   The sum of their ages is:
   \[
   43 + 7 = 50
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is:
   \[
   \boxed{50}
   \]
