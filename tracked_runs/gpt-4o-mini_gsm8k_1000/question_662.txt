Question ID: 162

Question:
If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, how much would a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?


Reference Answer:
When the price of the bag of marble increase by 20%, the price increases by 20/100*20 = $<<20/100*20=4>>4
If the price increases after every two months, in 36 months, it will increase 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 times.
If each increase is $4, the total amount the price of the bag of marbles will have increased by after 36 months is 18*$4 = $<<18*4=72>>72
After the total increase of the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, the total cost will be $20+$72 = $<<20+72=92>>92

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how the price of a bag of marbles changes over a period of 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

### Step 1: Determine the original price and the increase per period

The original price of the bag of marbles is:
\[
\text{Original Price} = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. First, we calculate 20% of the original price:
\[
\text{Increase per period} = 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of periods in 36 months

Since the price increases every two months, we need to find out how many two-month periods are in 36 months:
\[
\text{Number of periods} = \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total increase over 36 months

Now, we calculate the total increase over 18 periods:
\[
\text{Total Increase} = \text{Increase per period} \times \text{Number of periods} = 4 \text{ dollars/period} \times 18 \text{ periods} = 72 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the final price after 36 months

To find the final price after 36 months, we add the total increase to the original price:
\[
\text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} + \text{Total Increase} = 20 \text{ dollars} + 72 \text{ dollars} = 92 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is:
\[
\boxed{92 \text{ dollars}}
\]
