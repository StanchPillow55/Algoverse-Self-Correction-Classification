Question ID: 396

Question:
Jenny is dividing up a pizza with 12 slices. She gives 1/3 to Bill and 1/4 to Mark. If Jenny eats 2 slices, how many slices are left?


Reference Answer:
First find how many slices 1/3 of the pizza is by multiplying 1/3 by the total number of slices: 12 slices * 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 slices
Do the same thing to find how many slices 1/4 of the pizza is: 12 slices * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 slices
Then subtract the slices each of the three people ate to find the remaining number of slices: 12 slices - 4 slices - 3 slices - 2 slices = <<12-4-3-2=3>>3 slices

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many slices of pizza are left after Jenny gives some to Bill and Mark, and after she eats some herself. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Total Slices of Pizza**: 
   Jenny starts with a pizza that has 12 slices.

2. **Slices Given to Bill**:
   Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the pizza to Bill. To find out how many slices this is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Slices given to Bill} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Slices Given to Mark**:
   Next, Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pizza to Mark. We calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Slices given to Mark} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Total Slices Given Away**:
   Now we add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
   \[
   \text{Total slices given away} = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices}
   \]

5. **Slices Remaining After Giving Away**:
   We subtract the total slices given away from the original total:
   \[
   \text{Slices remaining after giving away} = 12 - 7 = 5 \text{ slices}
   \]

6. **Slices Eaten by Jenny**:
   Jenny eats 2 slices. We need to subtract these slices from the remaining slices:
   \[
   \text{Slices left after Jenny eats} = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices}
   \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of slices left after Jenny has given some to Bill and Mark and eaten some herself is:
   \[
   \boxed{3}
   \]
