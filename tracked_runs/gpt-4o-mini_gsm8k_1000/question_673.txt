Response:
To determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul currently has.**
   - Paul has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes.
   - We add these two amounts together:
     \[
     \text{Total cupcakes} = \text{Chocolate cupcakes} + \text{Toffee cupcakes} = 8 + 40
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     8 + 40 = 48
     \]
   - So, Paul currently has 48 cupcakes.

2. **Determine how many cupcakes Paul needs to buy.**
   - Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party.
   - To find out how many more cupcakes he needs, we subtract the number of cupcakes he currently has from the total he needs:
     \[
     \text{Cupcakes needed} = \text{Total cupcakes needed} - \text{Total cupcakes currently owned} = 63 - 48
     \]
   - Performing the subtraction:
     \[
     63 - 48 = 15
     \]
   - Therefore, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes.

3. **Final answer:**
   - Paul should buy **15 more cupcakes** to have enough for the birthday party.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]
