Question ID: 376

Question:
There are 40 pupils in a class. Half of the class likes blue. One-fourth of the remaining likes green and the rest likes yellow. How many pupils like the color yellow?


Reference Answer:
There are 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 pupils who like blue.
So, there are now 40 - 20 = <<40-20=20>>20 pupils who like either green or yellow.
Hence, 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 pupils like green.
Thus, 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 pupils like yellow.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many pupils like blue.**
2. **Calculate the number of pupils remaining after accounting for those who like blue.**
3. **Find out how many of the remaining pupils like green.**
4. **Calculate how many pupils like yellow.**

Let's go through each step in detail.

### Step 1: Determine how many pupils like blue.

The problem states that half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils in total, we can calculate the number of pupils who like blue as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pupils who like blue} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of pupils remaining.

After accounting for the pupils who like blue, we need to find out how many pupils are left. We subtract the number of pupils who like blue from the total number of pupils:

\[
\text{Remaining pupils} = 40 - 20 = 20
\]

### Step 3: Find out how many of the remaining pupils like green.

According to the problem, one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. We can calculate this as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pupils who like green} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]

### Step 4: Calculate how many pupils like yellow.

Now, we need to find out how many pupils like yellow. We do this by subtracting the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:

\[
\text{Number of pupils who like yellow} = \text{Total pupils} - (\text{Pupils who like blue} + \text{Pupils who like green})
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Number of pupils who like yellow} = 40 - (20 + 5) = 40 - 25 = 15
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]
