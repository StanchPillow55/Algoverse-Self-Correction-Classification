Question ID: 881

Question:
In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. In how many years will her age be thrice her present age?


Reference Answer:
Melanie's present age is 18 - 10 = <<18-10=8>>8.
Thrice Melanie's present age is 8 x 3 = <<8*3=24>>24.
So, she will be thrice her present age in 24 - 8 = 16 years.
#### 16

Response:
To solve the problem, we first need to determine Melanie's current age based on the information given.

1. **Determine Melanie's current age**:
   We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, we can calculate her current age by subtracting 10 from 18:

   \[
   \text{Current Age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **Define Melanie's present age**:
   Let \( x \) be Melanie's current age. From our calculation, we have:

   \[
   x = 8
   \]

3. **Set up the equation for thrice her present age**:
   We need to find out in how many years Melanie's age will be thrice her present age. Thrice her present age is:

   \[
   3x = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Let \( y \) be the number of years from now when Melanie will be 24 years old**:
   In \( y \) years, Melanie's age will be:

   \[
   x + y = 8 + y
   \]

   We want this to equal 24:

   \[
   8 + y = 24
   \]

5. **Solve for \( y \)**:
   To find \( y \), we can rearrange the equation:

   \[
   y = 24 - 8
   \]
   \[
   y = 16
   \]

Thus, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

6. **Final answer**:
   The number of years until Melanie's age is thrice her present age is:

   \[
   \boxed{16}
   \]
