Question ID: 85

Question:
Gene is sewing a quilt out of old souvenir t-shirts. He has one shirt from each vacation he has been on. Every shirt is its own quilt block. Each row is made of blocks from a different year of vacations. He goes on four vacations a year and has been vacationing since he was 23 years old. He is now 34. How many quilt blocks does he have in total?


Reference Answer:
Gene has been on 34 - 23 = <<34-23=11>>11 years of vacations, so he has 11 rows of blocks.
He goes on 4 vacations a year, so he has been on 4 * 11 = <<4*11=44>>44 vacations.
Gene has 1 shirt from each vacation, so he has 44 * 1 = <<44*1=44>>44 quilt blocks in all.
#### 44

Response:
To determine how many quilt blocks Gene has, we need to calculate the total number of vacations he has taken from the age of 23 to 34, and then multiply that by the number of shirts (or quilt blocks) he has from each vacation.

1. **Calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing:**
   - Gene is currently 34 years old.
   - He started vacationing at the age of 23.
   - The number of years he has been vacationing is:
     \[
     34 - 23 = 11 \text{ years}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of vacations:**
   - Gene goes on 4 vacations each year.
   - Therefore, the total number of vacations he has taken over the 11 years is:
     \[
     11 \text{ years} \times 4 \text{ vacations/year} = 44 \text{ vacations}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of quilt blocks:**
   - Since each vacation corresponds to one quilt block (one shirt), the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is equal to the total number of vacations.
   - Thus, the total number of quilt blocks is:
     \[
     44 \text{ quilt blocks}
     \]

Finally, we conclude that Gene has a total of **44 quilt blocks**.

Response:
To find out how many quilt blocks Gene has, we need to determine how many vacations he has taken since he started vacationing at the age of 23 until he is now 34.

1. **Calculate the number of years he has been vacationing:**
   - Current age: 34 years
   - Starting age: 23 years
   - Number of years vacationing = Current age - Starting age
   \[
   34 - 23 = 11 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of vacations taken:**
   - Gene goes on 4 vacations each year.
   - Total vacations = Number of years vacationing Ã— Vacations per year
   \[
   11 \text{ years} \times 4 \text{ vacations/year} = 44 \text{ vacations}
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of quilt blocks:**
   - Each vacation corresponds to one quilt block.
   - Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.
   \[
   \text{Total quilt blocks} = 44
   \]

Thus, Gene has a total of **44 quilt blocks**.
