Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many hot dogs Luke ate:**
   - According to the problem, Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

   \[
   \text{Hot dogs eaten by Luke} = 2
   \]

2. **Calculate how many hot dogs Thomas ate:**
   - The problem states that Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke. 
   - Since Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can calculate the number of hot dogs Thomas ate as follows:

   \[
   \text{Hot dogs eaten by Thomas} = 3 \times \text{Hot dogs eaten by Luke} = 3 \times 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate how many hot dogs John ate:**
   - The problem states that John ate half the amount Thomas ate. 
   - Since Thomas ate 6 hot dogs, we can calculate the number of hot dogs John ate as follows:

   \[
   \text{Hot dogs eaten by John} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Hot dogs eaten by Thomas} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3
   \]

4. **Determine how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke:**
   - Now we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. We can do this by subtracting the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate:

   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Hot dogs eaten by John} - \text{Hot dogs eaten by Luke} = 3 - 2 = 1
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]
