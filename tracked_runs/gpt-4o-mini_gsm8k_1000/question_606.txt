Question ID: 189

Question:
Three friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets to the fair. They also spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. They also went on 2 different rides which costs $33 for each ride. If they agreed to split all the costs evenly, how much did each of them pay?


Reference Answer:
They spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $<<20.25-4.5=15.75>>15.75 on food.
They spent $33 x 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66 for the rides.
They spent a total of $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.
So each of them paid $102/3 = $<<102/3=34>>34.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the total costs incurred by the three friends and then determining how much each person pays.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the tickets
The total cost for the tickets is given as:
\[
\text{Cost of tickets} = 20.25
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of food
The problem states that they spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of food as follows:
\[
\text{Cost of food} = \text{Cost of tickets} - 4.50
\]
Substituting the value of the cost of tickets:
\[
\text{Cost of food} = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the rides
They went on 2 different rides, and the cost for each ride is $33. Therefore, the total cost for the rides is:
\[
\text{Cost of rides} = 2 \times 33 = 66
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost
Now, we will sum up all the costs:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of tickets} + \text{Cost of food} + \text{Cost of rides}
\]
Substituting the values we calculated:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 20.25 + 15.75 + 66
\]
Calculating this step by step:
1. \(20.25 + 15.75 = 36\)
2. \(36 + 66 = 102\)

Thus, the total cost is:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 102
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the cost per person
Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by the number of friends:
\[
\text{Cost per person} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{3} = \frac{102}{3}
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
\text{Cost per person} = 34
\]

### Final Answer
Each friend paid:
\[
\boxed{34}
\]
