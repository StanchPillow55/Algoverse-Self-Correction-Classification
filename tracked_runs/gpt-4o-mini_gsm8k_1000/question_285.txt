Question ID: 1075

Question:
Jenny goes to the florist to buy some flowers. Roses cost $2 each and $15 for a dozen. If she bought 15 roses and arrived with five 5 dollar bills and they only have quarters for change, how many quarters does she leave with?


Reference Answer:
Jenny has $25 because 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25
She buys 1 dozen roses and 3 single roses because 15 - 12 - 3 = <<15-12-3=0>>0
She spends $6 on the single roses because 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6
She spends $21 on roses because 15 + 6 = <<15+6=21>>21
She gets $4 in change because 25 - 21 = <<25-21=4>>4
She gets 16 quarters because 4 x 4 = <<4*4=16>>16
#### 16

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Jenny spends on the roses, how much money she has, and how much change she receives in quarters.

1. **Calculate the cost of the roses:**
   - Jenny buys 15 roses.
   - The cost of one rose is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 15 roses is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 15 \text{ roses} \times 2 \text{ dollars/rose} = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine how much money Jenny has:**
   - Jenny arrives with five $5 bills.
   - The total amount of money she has is:
     \[
     \text{Total money} = 5 \text{ bills} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bill} = 25 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate how much more money Jenny needs:**
   - The cost of the roses is $30, but she only has $25.
   - Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
     \[
     \text{Additional amount needed} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 25 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine if she can buy the roses:**
   - Since Jenny does not have enough money to buy the 15 roses (she is short by $5), she cannot complete the purchase as planned.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since Jenny cannot buy the roses, she does not spend any money and leaves with all her original money.
   - Therefore, she leaves with $25.

6. **Convert the remaining money into quarters:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - To find out how many quarters are in $25, we can calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of quarters} = \frac{25 \text{ dollars}}{0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter}} = 100 \text{ quarters}
     \]

Thus, Jenny leaves with **100 quarters**.

Final answer: **100 quarters**.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Jenny spends on the roses, how much money she has initially, and how much change she receives in quarters.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of 15 roses

Jenny has two pricing options for roses:
- **Individual price**: $2 per rose
- **Dozen price**: $15 for 12 roses

Since Jenny is buying 15 roses, we can calculate the cost using both pricing options.

1. **Cost for 12 roses**: 
   \[
   12 \text{ roses} \times 2 \text{ dollars/rose} = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   or 
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost for the remaining 3 roses**:
   \[
   3 \text{ roses} \times 2 \text{ dollars/rose} = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total cost for 15 roses**:
   \[
   15 \text{ dollars} + 6 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 2: Determine how much money Jenny has

Jenny arrives with five $5 bills:
\[
5 \text{ bills} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bill} = 25 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how much more money Jenny needs

Jenny needs to pay $30 for the roses, but she only has $25. Therefore, she is short:
\[
30 \text{ dollars} - 25 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Determine how much change she receives

Since Jenny cannot pay the full amount of $30 with only $25, she cannot complete the purchase. Therefore, she does not receive any change because she does not buy the roses.

### Step 5: Calculate the number of quarters she leaves with

Since Jenny did not buy any roses, she leaves with all the money she arrived with. She has $25 in cash, which we need to convert into quarters.

1. **Convert dollars to quarters**:
   \[
   1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ quarters}
   \]
   Therefore, for $25:
   \[
   25 \text{ dollars} \times 4 \text{ quarters/dollar} = 100 \text{ quarters}
   \]

### Final Answer

Jenny leaves with **100 quarters**.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Jenny spends on the roses, how much money she has initially, and how much change she receives in quarters.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the roses

Jenny buys 15 roses. We know that:
- The cost of one rose is $2.
- The cost of a dozen (12 roses) is $15.

First, we can calculate the cost of 15 roses using the price per rose:
\[
\text{Cost of 15 roses} = 15 \text{ roses} \times 2 \text{ dollars/rose} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much money Jenny has

Jenny arrives with five $5 bills. To find out how much money she has:
\[
\text{Total money} = 5 \text{ bills} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bill} = 25 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the change Jenny receives

Now we need to find out how much change Jenny will receive after buying the roses. We subtract the cost of the roses from the amount of money she has:
\[
\text{Change} = \text{Total money} - \text{Cost of roses} = 25 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = -5 \text{ dollars}
\]

This means that Jenny does not have enough money to buy the 15 roses, as she is short by $5.

### Step 4: Determine how many quarters she leaves with

Since Jenny cannot afford the 15 roses, she does not make the purchase. Therefore, she leaves with the same amount of money she arrived with, which is $25. 

To find out how many quarters are in $25, we convert dollars to quarters:
\[
\text{Number of quarters} = \frac{25 \text{ dollars}}{0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter}} = 100 \text{ quarters}
\]

### Final Answer

Since Jenny does not buy the roses and leaves with her original amount of money, she leaves with:
\[
\boxed{100} \text{ quarters}
\]
