Question ID: 520

Question:
Martha is knitting winter wear for her 3 grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of them. It takes 2 skeins of wool to make a hat, 4 for a scarf, 12 for a sweater, 1 for a pair of mittens, and 2 for a pair of socks. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?


Reference Answer:
A full outfit for each child will require 2 skeins per hat + 4 skeins per scarf + 12 skeins per sweater + 1 skein per pair of mittens + 2 skeins per pair of socks = <<2+4+12+1+2=21>>21 skeins of wool.
So to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 3 * 21 = <<3*21=63>>63 skeins of wool.

Response:
To determine how many skeins of wool Martha needs to buy for her 3 grandchildren, we will first calculate the total amount of wool required for one child and then multiply that by the number of children (3).

### Step 1: Calculate the wool needed for one child

1. **Hat**: 
   - Wool needed = 2 skeins

2. **Scarf**: 
   - Wool needed = 4 skeins

3. **Sweater**: 
   - Wool needed = 12 skeins

4. **Mittens**: 
   - Wool needed = 1 skein

5. **Socks**: 
   - Wool needed = 2 skeins

Now, we will sum these amounts to find the total wool needed for one child.

\[
\text{Total wool for one child} = \text{Hat} + \text{Scarf} + \text{Sweater} + \text{Mittens} + \text{Socks}
\]

\[
\text{Total wool for one child} = 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

- \(2 + 4 = 6\)
- \(6 + 12 = 18\)
- \(18 + 1 = 19\)
- \(19 + 2 = 21\)

So, the total wool needed for one child is **21 skeins**.

### Step 2: Calculate the total wool needed for all 3 children

Now, we multiply the total wool needed for one child by the number of children (3):

\[
\text{Total wool for 3 children} = 21 \times 3
\]

Calculating this:

\[
21 \times 3 = 63
\]

### Final Answer

Martha will need to buy a total of **63 skeins of wool** to make the winter wear for her 3 grandchildren.
