Question:
Benny saw a 10-foot shark with 2 6-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?


Reference Answer:
First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 6 inches/remora * 2 remoras = <<6*2=12>>12 inches
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1=1>>1 foot
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1 foot / 10 feet * 100% = 10%
#### 10

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine what percentage the combined length of the remoras is of the shark's body length.

1. **Convert the shark's length to inches**:
   The shark is 10 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert feet to inches:
   \[
   10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the combined length of the remoras**:
   Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras. Therefore, we can calculate the total length of the remoras:
   \[
   2 \text{ remoras} \times 6 \text{ inches/remora} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the percentage of the shark's length that the remoras represent**:
   To find the percentage, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Here, the "part" is the combined length of the remoras (12 inches), and the "whole" is the length of the shark (120 inches):
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform the division**:
   \[
   \frac{12}{120} = 0.1
   \]

5. **Convert to percentage**:
   \[
   0.1 \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

Thus, the combined length of the remoras is **10%** of the shark's body length.

**Final Answer**: 10%

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine what percentage of the shark's body length is represented by the combined length of the remoras.

### Step 1: Convert all measurements to the same unit

1. **Shark's Length**: The shark is 10 feet long. We can convert this to inches since the remoras are measured in inches.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
   \[
   10 \text{ feet} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Remoras' Length**: Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras.
   - The combined length of the remoras is:
   \[
   2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the percentage

Now we need to find out what percentage the combined length of the remoras (12 inches) is of the shark's length (120 inches).

The formula for percentage is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100
\]
In this case, the "Part" is the combined length of the remoras (12 inches), and the "Whole" is the length of the shark (120 inches).

Substituting the values into the formula:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100
\]

### Step 3: Perform the calculation

1. Calculate the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{12}{120} = 0.1
   \]

2. Convert to percentage:
   \[
   0.1 \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

### Final Answer

The combined length of the remoras is **10%** of the shark's body length.

Response:
To find the percentage of the shark's body length that is represented by the combined length of the remoras, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert all measurements to the same unit**: Since the shark's length is given in feet and the remoras' lengths are given in inches, we will convert the shark's length from feet to inches.

   - There are 12 inches in a foot. Therefore, to convert the shark's length:
     \[
     \text{Length of shark in inches} = 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Calculate the combined length of the remoras**: Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras. Thus, we can calculate their total length:
   \[
   \text{Combined length of remoras} = 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the percentage of the shark's length that the remoras represent**: To find the percentage, we will use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform the division**:
   \[
   \frac{12}{120} = 0.1
   \]

5. **Multiply by 100 to convert to percentage**:
   \[
   0.1 \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

Thus, the combined length of the remoras is **10%** of the shark's body length.

**Final Answer**: 10%
