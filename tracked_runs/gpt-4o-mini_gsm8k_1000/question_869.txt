Question ID: 1300

Question:
Josh runs a car shop and services 3 cars a day.  He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday.  He gets paid $4 per car.  How much does he make in 2 weeks?


Reference Answer:
He runs 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 days a week
That means he serves 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 cars a week
So he makes 15*4=$<<15*4=60>>60 a week
So he makes 60*2=$<<60*2=120>>120 in 2 weeks
#### 120

Response:
To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of days Josh works in 2 weeks.**
   - A week has 7 days.
   - Josh is closed on Sunday and Wednesday, which means he works 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday).
   - In 2 weeks, the total number of days is \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days.
   - Since he is closed on 2 days each week, in 2 weeks he will be closed for \(2 \times 2 = 4\) days.
   - Therefore, the number of days he works in 2 weeks is:
     \[
     14 - 4 = 10 \text{ days}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of cars serviced in 2 weeks.**
   - Josh services 3 cars each day he works.
   - Over 10 days, the total number of cars he services is:
     \[
     10 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ cars/day} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. **Calculate Josh's earnings for servicing the cars.**
   - He earns $4 for each car serviced.
   - Therefore, his total earnings for servicing 30 cars is:
     \[
     30 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 120 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   - Josh makes a total of $120 in 2 weeks.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]
