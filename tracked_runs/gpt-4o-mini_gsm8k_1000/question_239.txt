Question:
Boris has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, how many fewer apples does Beck have than Boris now?


Reference Answer:
Boris has 100 apples, but gives 10 away, so now he has 100 apples - 10 apples = <<100-10=90>>90 apples.
Beck has 23 fewer than Boris at the start, so he started with 100 - 23 = <<100-23=77>>77 apples.
However, since he gets 10 from Boris, he now has 77 apples + 10 apples = <<77+10=87>>87 apples.
Thus Beck has 90 - 87 = <<90-87=3>>3 apples fewer than Boris.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of apples Beck has initially.**
2. **Calculate the number of apples each person has after Boris gives Beck 10 apples.**
3. **Find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the transaction.**

### Step 1: Determine the number of apples Beck has initially.

We know that Boris has 100 apples. The problem states that Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. 

To find the number of apples Beck has, we subtract 23 from the number of apples Boris has:

\[
\text{Beck's apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77
\]

So, Beck initially has 77 apples.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of apples after Boris gives Beck 10 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. We need to calculate how many apples each person has after this transaction.

- **Boris's new total:**
\[
\text{Boris's new total} = \text{Boris's initial total} - 10 = 100 - 10 = 90
\]

- **Beck's new total:**
\[
\text{Beck's new total} = \text{Beck's initial total} + 10 = 77 + 10 = 87
\]

### Step 3: Find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now.

Now we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the transaction:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Boris's new total} - \text{Beck's new total} = 90 - 87 = 3
\]

### Final Answer

Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
