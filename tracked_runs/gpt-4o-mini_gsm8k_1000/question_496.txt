Question:
Russell orders his favorite bagels online.  Each pack of bagels costs $10.00 and has 9 bagels in the pack.  If he orders 4 packs of bagels, he will receive a 10% discount.  After ordering 4 bags, how much will each single bagel cost?


Reference Answer:
He orders 4 packs of bagels and each pack costs $10.00 so that's 4*10 = $<<4*10=40.00>>40.00
He orders 4 packs at $40.00 and receives a 10% discount so his discount is 40*.10 = $4.00
The bagels cost $40.00 and he has a $4.00 discount making his total 40-4 = $<<40-4=36.00>>36.00
Each pack of bagels has 9 bagels per pack and he orders 4 packs so that's 9*4 = <<9*4=36>>36 bagels
His order total was $36.00 and there are 36 bagels so each bagel costs 36/36 = $<<36/36=1.00>>1.00

Response:
To find out how much each single bagel costs after Russell orders 4 packs of bagels with a discount, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the bagels before the discount**:
   - Each pack costs $10.00.
   - Russell orders 4 packs.
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = \text{Cost per pack} \times \text{Number of packs} = 10.00 \times 4 = 40.00
   \]

2. **Calculate the discount**:
   - The discount is 10% of the total cost before the discount.
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 0.10 \times \text{Total cost before discount} = 0.10 \times 40.00 = 4.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost after applying the discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \text{Total cost before discount} - \text{Discount} = 40.00 - 4.00 = 36.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of bagels**:
   - Each pack contains 9 bagels.
   - Russell orders 4 packs.
   \[
   \text{Total number of bagels} = \text{Number of bagels per pack} \times \text{Number of packs} = 9 \times 4 = 36
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost per bagel**:
   - To find the cost per bagel, divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels.
   \[
   \text{Cost per bagel} = \frac{\text{Total cost after discount}}{\text{Total number of bagels}} = \frac{36.00}{36} = 1.00
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that each single bagel costs **$1.00**.
