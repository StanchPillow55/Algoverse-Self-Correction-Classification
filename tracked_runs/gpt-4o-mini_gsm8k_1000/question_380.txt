Question ID: 309

Question:
Helena is a mad scientist testing her latest creation, the Lots-of-Limbs Serum. The serum will make the drinker grow an extra arm every three days and an extra leg every five days. After fifteen days, how many new limbs will Helena’s serum cause a person to grow if they drink it?


Reference Answer:
At one new arm every 3 days, after 15 days, a person who drank Helena’s serum would grow 15 / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 extra arms.
At one new leg every 5 days, after 15 days, the person would grow 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 extra legs.
In all, someone who drank Helena’s serum would grow 5 + 3 = <<5+3=8>>8 new limbs after 15 days.
#### 8

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many extra arms and legs a person will grow after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum for fifteen days.

1. **Determine the growth of arms:**
   - The serum causes the drinker to grow an extra arm every 3 days.
   - To find out how many arms are grown in 15 days, we divide the total number of days by the number of days it takes to grow one arm:
     \[
     \text{Number of arms} = \frac{15 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ days/arm}} = 5 \text{ arms}
     \]

2. **Determine the growth of legs:**
   - The serum causes the drinker to grow an extra leg every 5 days.
   - To find out how many legs are grown in 15 days, we divide the total number of days by the number of days it takes to grow one leg:
     \[
     \text{Number of legs} = \frac{15 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ days/leg}} = 3 \text{ legs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of new limbs:**
   - Each arm and leg counts as a limb. Therefore, we add the number of arms and legs together to find the total number of new limbs:
     \[
     \text{Total limbs} = \text{Number of arms} + \text{Number of legs} = 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ limbs}
     \]

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs.

**Final Answer: 8 limbs**
