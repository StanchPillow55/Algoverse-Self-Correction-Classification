Question ID: 847

Question:
Brenda invested $300 into a scheme that accumulates simple interest at the rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year. How much in total will she have after 3 years?


Reference Answer:
Three-quarters of $300 is (3/4)*$300 = $<<(3/4)*300=225>>225
After 3 years, interest of $225*3 = $<<225*3=675>>675 has been accumulated
She now has a total of $300+$675 = $<<300+675=975>>975
#### 975

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years when she invests $300 at a simple interest rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year.

### Step 1: Understand the interest rate
The problem states that the interest rate is "three-quarters of the original amount per year." This means we need to calculate what three-quarters of the original investment ($300) is.

\[
\text{Interest Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Interest Rate} = 0.75 \times 300 = 225
\]

This means that Brenda earns $225 in interest each year.

### Step 2: Calculate the total interest over 3 years
Since the interest is simple interest, it is calculated only on the original principal amount and does not compound. Therefore, the total interest earned over 3 years can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total Interest} = \text{Annual Interest} \times \text{Number of Years}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount after 3 years
To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to add the total interest earned to the original investment:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = \text{Original Investment} + \text{Total Interest}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975
\]

### Final Answer
Brenda will have a total of **$975** after 3 years.
