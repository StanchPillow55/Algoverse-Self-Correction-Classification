Question ID: 164

Question:
Jackie is trying to decide whether to do her taxes herself or hire an accountant. If she does the taxes herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, losing $35/hour in missed income. The accountant charges $90. How much more money will she have if she hires the accountant?


Reference Answer:
First find the total lost revenue if Jackie does her taxes herself: $35/hour * 3 hours = $<<35*3=105>>105
Then subtract the accountant's charge to find how much money Janet saves: $105 - $90 = $<<105-90=15>>15
#### 15

Response:
To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to calculate the total costs and missed income for both options.

### Step 1: Calculate the lost income if Jackie does her taxes herself.

Jackie will miss 3 hours of freelance work. The income she loses per hour is $35. Therefore, the total lost income can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Lost Income} = \text{Hours Missed} \times \text{Income per Hour}
\]
\[
\text{Lost Income} = 3 \, \text{hours} \times 35 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 105 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of doing taxes herself.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, her total cost is simply the lost income, which we calculated in Step 1:

\[
\text{Total Cost (Doing Taxes Herself)} = \text{Lost Income} = 105 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of hiring an accountant.

The accountant charges a flat fee of $90. Therefore, the total cost of hiring the accountant is:

\[
\text{Total Cost (Hiring Accountant)} = 90 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Compare the costs of both options.

Now we will compare the total costs of both options to see how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself.

1. **Cost of doing taxes herself**: $105
2. **Cost of hiring the accountant**: $90

### Step 5: Calculate the difference in costs.

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the cost of doing the taxes herself:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Cost of Doing Taxes Herself} - \text{Cost of Hiring Accountant}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 105 \, \text{dollars} - 90 \, \text{dollars} = 15 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Jackie will have **$15 more** if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself.

Response:
To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to calculate the total costs and missed income for both scenarios.

1. **Calculating the missed income if Jackie does her taxes herself:**
   - Jackie will lose 3 hours of freelance work.
   - Her income from freelance work is $35 per hour.
   - Therefore, the total missed income is:
     \[
     \text{Missed Income} = \text{Hours Lost} \times \text{Income per Hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \times 35 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 105 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculating the total cost if Jackie does her taxes herself:**
   - The total cost of doing her taxes herself is just the missed income, which we calculated as $105.

3. **Calculating the total cost if Jackie hires an accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90.
   - Therefore, the total cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

4. **Comparing the two scenarios:**
   - If Jackie does her taxes herself, she effectively "loses" $105.
   - If she hires the accountant, she pays $90.
   - To find out how much more money she has by hiring the accountant, we can compare the missed income with the accountant's fee:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Missed Income} - \text{Accountant's Fee} = 105 \, \text{dollars} - 90 \, \text{dollars} = 15 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Jackie will have } \$15 \text{ more if she hires the accountant.}
\]

Response:
To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to compare the costs and lost income associated with both options.

1. **Calculate the lost income if Jackie does her taxes herself:**
   - Jackie will miss 3 hours of freelance work.
   - She earns $35 per hour.
   - Lost income = Hours missed Ã— Hourly rate
   \[
   \text{Lost income} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 35 \text{ dollars/hour} = 105 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost if Jackie does her taxes herself:**
   - The total cost of doing taxes herself is simply the lost income, which we calculated as $105.

3. **Calculate the cost of hiring an accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90.

4. **Compare the costs:**
   - If Jackie does her taxes herself, she effectively "loses" $105.
   - If she hires the accountant, she pays $90.

5. **Calculate the difference in money:**
   - To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the accountant's fee from the lost income:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Lost income} - \text{Accountant's fee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 105 \text{ dollars} - 90 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Jackie will have **$15 more** if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself.

**Final Answer: Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.**
