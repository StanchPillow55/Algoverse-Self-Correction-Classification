Question ID: 11

Question:
Toula went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 3 dozen donuts which cost $68 per dozen, 2 dozen mini cupcakes which cost $80 per dozen, and 6 dozen mini cheesecakes for $55 per dozen. How much was the total cost?


Reference Answer:
The total charge for the doughnuts was 3 x $68 = $<<3*68=204>>204.
The total charge for the mini cupcakes was 2 x $80 = $<<2*80=160>>160.
The total charge for the mini cheesecakes was 6 x $55 = $<<6*55=330>>330.
Therefore the total amount Toula paid for the pastries was $204 + $160 + $330 = $<<204+160+330=694>>694.

Response:
To find the total cost of the pastries that Toula bought, we will calculate the cost for each type of pastry separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the cost of the donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen of donuts is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = Number of dozens × Cost per dozen
   \[
   \text{Total cost for donuts} = 3 \text{ dozen} \times 68 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 204 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen of mini cupcakes is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = Number of dozens × Cost per dozen
   \[
   \text{Total cost for mini cupcakes} = 2 \text{ dozen} \times 80 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen of mini cheesecakes is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = Number of dozens × Cost per dozen
   \[
   \text{Total cost for mini cheesecakes} = 6 \text{ dozen} \times 55 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 330 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Now, we will sum the total costs of all the pastries.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for donuts} + \text{Total cost for mini cupcakes} + \text{Total cost for mini cheesecakes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 204 \text{ dollars} + 160 \text{ dollars} + 330 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 694 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost of all the pastries that Toula bought is **$694**.

   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen of donuts is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = Number of dozens × Cost per dozen
   \[

   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen of mini cupcakes is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = Number of dozens × Cost per dozen
   \[
   \text{Total cost for mini cupcakes} = 2 \, \text{dozen} \times 80 \, \text{dollars/dozen} = 160 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen of mini cheesecakes is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = Number of dozens × Cost per dozen
   \[
   \text{Total cost for mini cheesecakes} = 6 \, \text{dozen} \times 55 \, \text{dollars/dozen} = 330 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Now, we will sum the costs of all the pastries.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of donuts} + \text{Cost of mini cupcakes} + \text{Cost of mini cheesecakes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 204 \, \text{dollars} + 160 \, \text{dollars} + 330 \, \text{dollars} = 694 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total cost of the pastries that Toula bought is **$694**.
