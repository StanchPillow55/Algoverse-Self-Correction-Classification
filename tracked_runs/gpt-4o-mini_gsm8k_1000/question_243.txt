Question ID: 1180

Question:
A company sold 4000 gallons of milk in jars to Mr. Marcellus' store at the cost of $3.5 per gallon. However, Mr. Marcellus later realized 2/5 of the amount of milk he purchased had passed the expiry date and could not be sold. He returned the sour milk to the company and ordered a refund. Calculate how much he got in refunds.


Reference Answer:
If he purchased 4000 gallons, the number of gallons expired is 2/5 * 4000 gallons = <<2/5*4000=1600>>1600 gallons.
If each gallon costs $3.5, and he returned 1600 gallons for refund, the total amount he got from the refund is $3.5/gallon * 1600 gallons = $<<3.5*1600=5600>>5600
#### 5600

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned to the company and then determine how much he will receive as a refund based on the cost per gallon.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of milk purchased
Mr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk.

### Step 2: Determine how much milk was expired
According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the milk purchased had passed the expiry date. We can calculate the amount of expired milk as follows:

\[
\text{Expired milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Expired milk} = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the refund amount
Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the expired milk that Mr. Marcellus will return. The cost per gallon of milk is $3.5. Therefore, the total refund can be calculated by multiplying the number of gallons of expired milk by the cost per gallon:

\[
\text{Refund} = \text{Expired milk} \times \text{Cost per gallon}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Refund} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Refund} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Mr. Marcellus received a refund of **$5600**.
