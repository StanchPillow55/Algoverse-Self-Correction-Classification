Question ID: 991

Question:
Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time?


Reference Answer:
Bill saw the Comet for the second time when he was 30 years * 3= <<30*3=90>>90 years old.
Comet Halley can be seen every 75 years, so Bill saw the comet for the first time when he was 90 years - 75 years = <<90-75=15>>15 years old.
#### 15

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

2. **Determine the Age of Bill's Dad When He Saw the Comet**:
   - Bill's dad saw the comet at age 30.

3. **Calculate the Age of Bill's Dad When Bill Saw the Comet a Second Time**:
   - Since the comet appears every 75 years, the next time Bill's dad would see the comet after his first sighting would be:
     \[
     30 + 75 = 105 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Determine Bill's Age When He Saw the Comet a Second Time**:
   - We know that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he first saw it.
   - Bill's dad was 30 years old when he first saw the comet. Therefore, three times that age is:
     \[
     3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years old}
     \]
   - This means Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old.

5. **Calculate the Time Between the First and Second Sightings of the Comet**:
   - The time between the first and second sightings of the comet is 75 years (the period of the comet's orbit).

6. **Determine Bill's Age When He Saw the Comet for the First Time**:
   - Let \( x \) be Bill's age when he first saw the comet.
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and this was 75 years after the first sighting, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     x + 75 = 90
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 90 - 75 = 15
     \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   - Bill was **15 years old** when he saw the comet for the first time.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]
