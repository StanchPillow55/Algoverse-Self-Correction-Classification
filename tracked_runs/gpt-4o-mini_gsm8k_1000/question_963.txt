Question ID: 1315

Question:
There are some oranges in a basket. Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange and Jane spends 4 minutes doing the same. If Ana and Jane start picking oranges from this basket to peel at the same time, how many more oranges will Ana have peeled than Jane after an hour?


Reference Answer:
There are 60 minutes in an hour. Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes so she will peel 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 oranges in an hour
Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes so she will peel 60/4 = <<60/4=15>>15 oranges in an hour
Ana will have peeled 20-15 = <<20-15=5>>5 more oranges
#### 5

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many oranges Ana and Jane can peel in one hour, and then find the difference between the number of oranges they each peel.

1. **Determine the peeling rates of Ana and Jane:**
   - Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange.
   - Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange.

2. **Calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour:**
   - One hour is equal to 60 minutes.

   **For Ana:**
   - The number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is calculated by dividing the total time by the time it takes her to peel one orange:
   \[
   \text{Number of oranges peeled by Ana} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
   \]

   **For Jane:**
   - The number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is calculated similarly:
   \[
   \text{Number of oranges peeled by Jane} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
   \]

3. **Calculate the difference in the number of oranges peeled:**
   - Now, we find out how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Number of oranges peeled by Ana} - \text{Number of oranges peeled by Jane}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - After one hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
