Question ID: 275

Question:
Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?


Reference Answer:
The first scene has twice the number of lines as his solo song, so it has 2 * 54 = <<2*54=108>>108 lines.
A third of them are Sean’s lines, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = <<108/3=36>>36 lines.
The second scene has 54 + 6 = <<54+6=60>>60 lines.
Four fifths of the second scene’s lines are Sean’s, so he has to memorize 4 * 60 / 5 = 4 * 12 = <<4*60/5=48>>48 lines.
Sean has to memorize his entire solo song, so he has to memorize 54 + 36 + 48 = <<54+36+48=138>>138 lines in all.

Response:
To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Solo Song Lines**:
   - The solo song has **54 lines**.

2. **First Scene Lines**:
   - The first scene has **twice the number of lines** as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the number of lines in the first scene is:
     \[
     2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - Only **one-third** of these lines are Sean's lines. Thus, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the first scene is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
     \]

3. **Second Scene Lines**:
   - The second scene has **six more lines** than the solo song. Therefore, the number of lines in the second scene is:
     \[
     54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - **Four-fifths** of these lines are Sean's lines. Thus, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the second scene is:
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
     \]

4. **Total Lines to Memorize**:
   - Now, we will add the lines Sean has to memorize from all parts:
     - Lines from the solo song: **54 lines**
     - Lines from the first scene: **36 lines**
     - Lines from the second scene: **48 lines**
   - Therefore, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is:
     \[
     54 + 36 + 48
     \]
   - Calculating this step-by-step:
     \[
     54 + 36 = 90
     \]
     \[
     90 + 48 = 138
     \]

Thus, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is **138 lines**.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{138}
\]
