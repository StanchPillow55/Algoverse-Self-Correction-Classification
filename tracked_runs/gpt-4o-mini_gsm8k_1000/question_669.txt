Question ID: 1203

Question:
Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is. How high is the roof from the second floor's floor in inches?


Reference Answer:
Mattison's two-story house is 60 x 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches high.
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 60 x 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 inches high.
Hence, the roof is 420 - 180 = <<420-180=240>>240 inches high from the second floor's floor.
#### 240

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Mattison's height**: 
   Mattison's height is given as 60 inches.

2. **Calculate the height of the two-story house**: 
   The height of the two-story house is 7 times Mattison's height. 
   \[
   \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the height of the first floor**: 
   The height of the first floor is given as thrice Mattison's height.
   \[
   \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Calculate the height of the second floor**: 
   To find the height of the second floor, we need to subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house.
   \[
   \text{Height of the second floor} = \text{Height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Height of the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Determine the height from the second floor's floor to the roof**: 
   The height from the floor of the second floor to the roof is the same as the height of the second floor, which we calculated to be 240 inches.

Thus, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is:
\[
\boxed{240} \text{ inches}
\]
