Question:
Adam bought himself some new trousers for $30. His mother gave him $6 for this purpose, and his father gave him twice as much. How much money did Adam have to contribute from his savings?


Reference Answer:
Adam's father gave him $6 * 2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.
So considering the price Adam needed to pay $30 - $12 - $6 = $<<30-12-6=12>>12 for his trousers from his savings.
#### 12

Response:
To determine how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings for the trousers, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total cost of the trousers**: 
   Adam bought trousers for $30.

2. **Calculate the amount given by his mother**: 
   Adam's mother gave him $6.

3. **Calculate the amount given by his father**: 
   Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Amount from father} = 2 \times \text{Amount from mother} = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]
   So, Adam's father gave him $12.

4. **Calculate the total amount Adam received from his parents**: 
   We add the amounts given by his mother and father:
   \[
   \text{Total from parents} = \text{Amount from mother} + \text{Amount from father} = 6 + 12 = 18
   \]
   Adam received a total of $18 from his parents.

5. **Determine how much Adam contributed from his savings**: 
   To find out how much Adam had to contribute, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the total cost of the trousers:
   \[
   \text{Amount Adam contributed} = \text{Total cost of trousers} - \text{Total from parents} = 30 - 18 = 12
   \]

Thus, Adam had to contribute **$12** from his savings to buy the trousers.

Final answer: **$12**
