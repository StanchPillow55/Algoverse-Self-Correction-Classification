Question ID: 1108

Question:
My mom went to a gardening shop. She bought a set of pots for $19 and a sack of garden soil for $26. At checkout, she used a coupon for $7 off. How much money did my mom spend at the gardening shop?


Reference Answer:
The total cost of the pots and a sack of garden soil is $19 + $26 = $<<19+26=45>>45.
So, my mom spent $45 - $7 = $<<45-7=38>>38 at the gardening store.

Response:
To find out how much money your mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items before the coupon discount.**
   - The cost of the pots is $19.
   - The cost of the sack of garden soil is $26.

   We can find the total cost by adding these two amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of pots} + \text{Cost of soil}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 19 + 26
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 45
   \]

2. **Apply the coupon discount.**
   - Your mom used a coupon for $7 off the total cost.

   To find the final amount spent after applying the coupon, we subtract the coupon value from the total cost:

   \[
   \text{Final amount spent} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Coupon value}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final amount spent} = 45 - 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final amount spent} = 38
   \]

3. **State the final answer.**
   - Therefore, the total amount of money your mom spent at the gardening shop is **$38**.

Final answer: **$38**.
