Question ID: 574

Question:
A food truck only sells grilled cheeses.  They source their bread for $3.00 a loaf and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  They spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches.  If they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, what is their net profit?


Reference Answer:
They spend $3.00 on bread and $30.00 on cheese and condiments for a total of 3+30 = $<<3+30=33.00>>33.00
They sell 10 sandwiches at $7.00 apiece for a total of 10*7 = $<<10*7=70.00>>70.00
They made $70.00 and spent $33.00 for a net profit of 70-33 = $<<70-33=37.00>>37.00 per 10 sandwiches

Response:
To find the net profit for the food truck selling grilled cheeses, we need to calculate both the total revenue from selling the sandwiches and the total costs incurred in making them. Then, we can subtract the total costs from the total revenue to find the net profit.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Revenue

The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. 

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Sandwiches} \times \text{Price per Sandwich}
\]
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 7.00 = 70.00
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Costs

#### Cost of Bread
The cost of one loaf of bread is $3.00, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Since they are making 10 sandwiches, they will need 1 loaf of bread.

\[
\text{Cost of Bread} = 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00
\]

#### Cost of Cheeses and Condiments
The food truck spends $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches.

\[
\text{Cost of Cheeses and Condiments} = 30.00
\]

#### Total Costs
Now, we can sum the costs of bread and the cheeses and condiments:

\[
\text{Total Costs} = \text{Cost of Bread} + \text{Cost of Cheeses and Condiments}
\]
\[
\text{Total Costs} = 3.00 + 30.00 = 33.00
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Net Profit

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total costs from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Costs}
\]
\[
\text{Net Profit} = 70.00 - 33.00 = 37.00
\]

### Final Answer
The net profit for the food truck after selling 10 grilled cheese sandwiches is **$37.00**.
