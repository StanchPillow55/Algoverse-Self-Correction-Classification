Question:
The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 in exchange for the first tooth Sharon lost.  Then, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 for each of the next three teeth Sharon lost.  And for each of the last 2 teeth Sharon lost, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth.  How much money did the tooth fairy leave Sharon, in dollars?


Reference Answer:
She got $1.00 on three teeth so she got 1*3 = $<<1*3=3.00>>3.00
On the next two, she got 1/2 the amount of $1.00 so she received 1*.5 = $<<1*.5=0.50>>0.50
She received $0.50 on 2 teeth so she received .50*2 = $<<.50*2=1.00>>1.00
When you add her first tooth that was $5.00, $3.00 for the next 3 and $1.00 on the next 2 she made 5+3+1 = $<<5+3+1=9.00>>9.00

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break down the amounts Sharon received for each of her lost teeth step by step.

1. **First Tooth**: 
   - The tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00 for her first tooth.
   - Amount received: **$5.00**

2. **Next Three Teeth**: 
   - For each of the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00.
   - Amount received for these three teeth:
     \[
     3 \text{ teeth} \times 1 \text{ dollar/tooth} = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Last Two Teeth**: 
   - For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth.
   - Since Sharon received $1.00 for each of the last three teeth, half of that amount is:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{2} = 0.50 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Amount received for these two teeth:
     \[
     2 \text{ teeth} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/tooth} = 1 \text{ dollar}
     \]

4. **Total Amount Received**:
   - Now, we will sum up all the amounts Sharon received:
     - Amount from the first tooth: $5.00
     - Amount from the next three teeth: $3.00
     - Amount from the last two teeth: $1.00
   - Total amount:
     \[
     5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is **$9.00**.

Final answer: **$9.00**

Response:
To find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Tooth**: Sharon received $5.00 for her first tooth.

   \[
   \text{Total after first tooth} = 5.00
   \]

2. **Next Three Teeth**: For each of the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each. 

   \[
   \text{Amount for next three teeth} = 3 \times 1.00 = 3.00
   \]

   Adding this to the total:

   \[
   \text{Total after first four teeth} = 5.00 + 3.00 = 8.00
   \]

3. **Last Two Teeth**: For the last two teeth, Sharon received half the amount she received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of those three teeth, half of that is:

   \[
   \text{Amount for last two teeth} = 2 \times \left(\frac{1.00}{2}\right) = 2 \times 0.50 = 1.00
   \]

   Adding this to the total:

   \[
   \text{Total after all teeth} = 8.00 + 1.00 = 9.00
   \]

Finally, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:

\[
\boxed{9.00}
\]
