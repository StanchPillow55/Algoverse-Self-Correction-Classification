Question ID: 1083

Question:
The bananas at the supermarket cost $0.80 each, or a bunch for $3.00.  Jenny buys 10 bunches that average 4 bananas per bunch. How much money, in dollars, did she save by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually?


Reference Answer:
Ten bunches makes 10*3=$<<10*3=30>>30.
There are 10*4=<<10*4=40>>40 bananas.
40 bananas would cost 40*0.80=$<<40*0.80=32>>32 individually.
She saved 32-30=<<32-30=2>>2 dollars

Response:
To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought.**
   - Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch averages 4 bananas.
   - Total number of bananas = Number of bunches × Average number of bananas per bunch
   \[
   \text{Total number of bananas} = 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.**
   - The cost of one banana is $0.80.
   - Total cost for 40 bananas = Number of bananas × Cost per banana
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 40 bananas} = 40 \text{ bananas} \times 0.80 \text{ dollars/banana} = 32 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.**
   - The cost of one bunch is $3.00.
   - Total cost for 10 bunches = Number of bunches × Cost per bunch
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 10 bunches} = 10 \text{ bunches} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars/bunch} = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the savings by comparing the two costs.**
   - Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
   \[
   \text{Savings} = 32 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually is \(\boxed{2}\) dollars.
