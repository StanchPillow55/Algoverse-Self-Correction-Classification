Question ID: 1216

Question:
A bus has a capacity of 200 people. When it departed Chengli city, it had 20 people. On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. On the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. If the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station, calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.


Reference Answer:
If the number of passengers increased by 3/4 times the number that entered the bus on the first station, 3/4 * 40 people = <<3/4*40=30>>30 people entered the bus on the second station.
After the second station, the number of people on the bus was 20 people initially on the bus + 40 who entered at the first station + 30 who entered at the second station= <<20+40+30=90>>90 people.
The number of people doubled at the third station, which is 90 people * 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 people.
If the bus has a capacity of 200, the number of people required to fill the bus is 200 people - 180 people = <<200-180=20>>20 people
#### 20

Response:
To solve the problem, we will go through it step by step, keeping track of the number of passengers on the bus at each stage.

1. **Initial Passengers**: The bus starts with 20 people.

   \[
   \text{Initial passengers} = 20
   \]

2. **First Stop**: At the first stop, 40 people enter the bus.

   \[
   \text{Passengers after first stop} = 20 + 40 = 60
   \]

3. **Second Stop**: At the second stop, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first stop (which was 40) enter the bus.

   \[
   \text{People entering at second stop} = \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
   \]

   Now we add these 30 people to the current number of passengers:

   \[
   \text{Passengers after second stop} = 60 + 30 = 90
   \]

4. **Third Stop**: At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubles.

   \[
   \text{Passengers after third stop} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

5. **Bus Capacity**: The bus has a total capacity of 200 people. We need to find out how many more people are needed to fill the bus to its capacity.

   \[
   \text{Remaining spaces on the bus} = 200 - 180 = 20
   \]

Thus, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]
