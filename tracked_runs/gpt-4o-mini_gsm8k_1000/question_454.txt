Question ID: 184

Question:
Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?


Reference Answer:
There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.
#### 25


=== Turn 1 ===


Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine two probabilities: the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Step 1: Probability of Rolling a Number Greater Than 3

A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. 

**Count of favorable outcomes:**
- Numbers greater than 3: 4, 5, 6 (3 outcomes)

**Total outcomes when rolling a die:**
- Total outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (6 outcomes)

**Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
\[
P(\text{greater than 3}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 2: Probability of Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.

**Count of favorable outcomes for one roll:**
- Even numbers: 2, 4, 6 (3 outcomes)

**Probability of rolling an even number:**
\[
P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the product of the probabilities of rolling an even number on each roll:

\[
P(\text{two even numbers}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 3: Comparing the Two Probabilities

Now we need to compare the two probabilities:
- Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: \( \frac{1}{2} \)
- Probability of rolling two even numbers: \( \frac{1}{4} \)

To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers, we can calculate the difference in probabilities:

\[
\text{Difference} = P(\text{greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers}) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4}
\]

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}
\]

Now we can subtract:

\[
\text{Difference} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 4: Expressing the Difference as a Percentage

To express the difference as a percentage, we take the difference and divide it by the probability of rolling two even numbers, then multiply by 100:

\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{P(\text{two even numbers})} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}} \right) \times 100 = 1 \times 100 = 100\%
\]

### Final Answer

Jerry is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Step 1: Probability of rolling a number greater than 3

A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.

- **Total outcomes**: 6 (the numbers 1 through 6)
- **Favorable outcomes**: 3 (the numbers 4, 5, and 6)

The probability \( P(A) \) of rolling a number greater than 3 is calculated as follows:

\[
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

To express this as a percentage:

\[
P(A) = \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\%
\]

### Step 2: Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.

- **Total outcomes**: 6 (the numbers 1 through 6)
- **Favorable outcomes for one roll**: 3 (the numbers 2, 4, and 6)

The probability \( P(B) \) of rolling an even number on one roll is:

\[
P(B) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row \( P(B \text{ and } B) \) is the product of the probabilities of each roll:

\[
P(B \text{ and } B) = P(B) \times P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To express this as a percentage:

\[
P(B \text{ and } B) = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\%
\]

### Step 3: Comparing the probabilities

Now we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by subtracting the probability of rolling two even numbers from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:

\[
\text{Difference} = P(A) - P(B \text{ and } B) = 50\% - 25\% = 25\%
\]

### Final Answer

Jerry is **25%** more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine two probabilities: 

1. The probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die.
2. The probability that Jerry rolls two even numbers in a row.

### Step 1: Probability of rolling a number greater than 3

A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.

- Total outcomes when rolling a die = 6 (the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
- Favorable outcomes (numbers greater than 3) = 3 (the numbers 4, 5, and 6)

The probability \( P(\text{greater than 3}) \) is calculated as follows:

\[
P(\text{greater than 3}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 2: Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. 

- Total outcomes when rolling a die = 6
- Favorable outcomes for one roll (even numbers) = 3 (the numbers 2, 4, and 6)

The probability of rolling an even number in one roll \( P(\text{even}) \) is:

\[
P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row \( P(\text{two evens}) \) is:

\[
P(\text{two evens}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 3: Comparing the probabilities

Now we need to find out how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. We can express this as a ratio of the two probabilities:

\[
\text{Likelihood ratio} = \frac{P(\text{greater than 3})}{P(\text{two evens})} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1/2}{1/4} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{1} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Step 4: Expressing the likelihood as a percentage

To express how much more likely it is in percentage terms, we can calculate:

\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \text{Likelihood ratio} - 1 \right) \times 100\%
\]

Since the likelihood ratio is 2, we have:

\[
\text{Percentage increase} = (2 - 1) \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\%
\]

### Final Answer

Jerry is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
