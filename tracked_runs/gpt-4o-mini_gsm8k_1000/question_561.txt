Question ID: 172

Question:
There are four birds at the Caboose. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. If Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, what's the total age of the four birds?


Reference Answer:
If Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, same as Sally four, their total age 8+8 = <<8+8=16>>16 years.
Granny red is two times as old as Sally four, meaning Granny red is 2*8 = <<2*8=16>>16 years old.
Sally Thirtytwo, Sally four, and Sally red are 16+16 = <<32=32>>32 years old.
Sally two is three years older than Granny red, meaning Sally two is 16+3= <<16+3=19>>19 years old.
The four birds have a total age of 32+19 = <<32+19=51>>51 years old.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of each of the four birds: Sally Two, Granny Red, Sally Four, and Sally Thirtytwo. We will use the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Sally Thirtytwo**:
   - We are told that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
   \[
   \text{Age of Sally Thirtytwo} = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Determine the age of Sally Four**:
   - The problem states that Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.
   \[
   \text{Age of Sally Four} = \text{Age of Sally Thirtytwo} = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Determine the age of Granny Red**:
   - We know that Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
   \[
   \text{Age of Granny Red} = 2 \times \text{Age of Sally Four} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years}
   \]

4. **Determine the age of Sally Two**:
   - The problem states that Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
   \[
   \text{Age of Sally Two} = \text{Age of Granny Red} + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19 \text{ years}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total age of the four birds**:
   - Now we have the ages of all four birds:
     - Sally Two: 19 years
     - Granny Red: 16 years
     - Sally Four: 8 years
     - Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years
   - We can now sum these ages to find the total age.
   \[
   \text{Total Age} = \text{Age of Sally Two} + \text{Age of Granny Red} + \text{Age of Sally Four} + \text{Age of Sally Thirtytwo}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Age} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8
   \]

6. **Perform the addition**:
   \[
   19 + 16 = 35
   \]
   \[
   35 + 8 = 43
   \]
   \[
   43 + 8 = 51
   \]

Thus, the total age of the four birds is:
\[
\boxed{51} \text{ years}
\]
