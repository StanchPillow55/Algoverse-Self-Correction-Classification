Question:
Mrs. Jameson's bamboo in the backyard grows up to 30 inches a day. Today, its height is 20 feet. In how many days will its height be 600 inches?


Reference Answer:
Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, then 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 inches.
So, the bamboo needs to grow 600 - 240 = <<600-240=360>>360 inches more.
Therefore, it will take 360/30 = <<360/30=12>>12 days for its height to be 600 inches.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from its current height to a target height. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Convert the current height from feet to inches**:
   - We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.
   - Mrs. Jameson's bamboo is currently 20 feet tall.
   - To convert feet to inches, we multiply the height in feet by 12:
     \[
     20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - So, the current height of the bamboo is 240 inches.

2. **Determine the target height**:
   - The target height is given as 600 inches.

3. **Calculate the height increase needed**:
   - We need to find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach the target height:
     \[
     \text{Height increase needed} = \text{Target height} - \text{Current height}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Height increase needed} = 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Determine the growth rate**:
   - The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day.

5. **Calculate the number of days required to reach the target height**:
   - To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches at a rate of 30 inches per day, we divide the total height increase needed by the daily growth rate:
     \[
     \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Height increase needed}}{\text{Growth rate}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of days} = \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days}
     \]

6. **Final answer**:
   - It will take 12 days for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from 20 feet (240 inches) to 600 inches.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
