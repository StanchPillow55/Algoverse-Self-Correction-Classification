Question:
Dora wants to buy a skipping rope that costs $6, a board game that costs $11, and a playground ball that costs $2. She has saved $2 from her allowance, and her mother gave her $16. How much more money does Dora need to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball?

The total cost of the skipping rope, the game, and the ball is $6 + $11 + $2 = $<<6+11+2=19>>19.
The total amount of money from the allowance and her mother is $2 + $16 = $<<2+16=18>>18.

Response:
To determine how much more money Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, board game, and playground ball, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy.**
   - Cost of the skipping rope: $6
   - Cost of the board game: $11
   - Cost of the playground ball: $2

   We will add these amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of skipping rope} + \text{Cost of board game} + \text{Cost of playground ball}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6 + 11 + 2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 19
   \]

   So, the total cost of the items is $19.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Dora has.**
   - Money saved from allowance: $2
   - Money given by her mother: $16

   We will add these amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total money} = \text{Money saved} + \text{Money from mother}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 2 + 16
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 18
   \]

   So, Dora has a total of $18.

3. **Determine how much more money Dora needs.**
   To find out how much more money Dora needs, we will subtract the total amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

   \[
   \text{Additional money needed} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total money}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Additional money needed} = 19 - 18
   \]
   \[
   \text{Additional money needed} = 1
   \]

Thus, Dora needs **$1** more to buy the skipping rope, board game, and playground ball.

**Final Answer: $1**
