Question:
Jake is shopping at a clothing store. The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Then, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price. The original price of the shoes is $40. What is the total amount of money Jake spends at the store?


Reference Answer:
The cost of a T-shirt after 50% is taken off of the original price is $8 * 0.50 = $<<8*0.50=4>>4
The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $<<8+4=12>>12
The amount of money taken off from the original price of the shoes is $40 * 0.40 = $<<40*0.4=16>>16
The cost of the shoes after the sale is $40 - $16 = $<<40-16=24>>24
The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $12 + $24 = $<<12+24=36>>36

Response:
To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately, and then sum those amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the T-shirts

1. **Original price of each T-shirt**: $8
2. **Number of T-shirts Jake buys**: 2

Since there is a buy one get one 50% off deal, we need to calculate the cost of the first T-shirt and then apply the discount to the second T-shirt.

- **Cost of the first T-shirt**: $8
- **Discount on the second T-shirt**: 50% of $8

To calculate the discount:
\[
\text{Discount on second T-shirt} = 0.50 \times 8 = 4
\]

Thus, the cost of the second T-shirt after the discount is:
\[
\text{Cost of second T-shirt} = 8 - 4 = 4
\]

Now, we can find the total cost for both T-shirts:
\[
\text{Total cost for T-shirts} = \text{Cost of first T-shirt} + \text{Cost of second T-shirt} = 8 + 4 = 12
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the shoes

1. **Original price of the shoes**: $40
2. **Discount on the shoes**: 40%

To calculate the discount:
\[
\text{Discount on shoes} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
\]

Thus, the cost of the shoes after the discount is:
\[
\text{Cost of shoes after discount} = 40 - 16 = 24
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent

Now we can find the total amount Jake spends at the store by adding the total cost of the T-shirts and the cost of the shoes:
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost for T-shirts} + \text{Cost of shoes} = 12 + 24 = 36
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is **$36**.
