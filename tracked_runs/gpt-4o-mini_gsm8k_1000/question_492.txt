Question ID: 28

Question:
Henry made two stops during his 60-mile bike trip. He first stopped after 20 miles. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. How many miles did he travel between his first and second stops?


Reference Answer:
He traveled 20 miles + 15 miles = <<20+15=35>>35 miles not counting the distance between stops.
Henry traveled 60 miles - 35 miles = <<60-35=25>>25 miles between his first and second stop.
#### 25

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops during his 60-mile bike trip.

1. **Identify the first stop:**
   - Henry made his first stop after traveling 20 miles.
   - Therefore, the distance to the first stop is:
     \[
     \text{Distance to first stop} = 20 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Identify the second stop:**
   - The second stop was made 15 miles before the end of the trip.
   - Since the total trip is 60 miles, we can calculate the distance from the start to the second stop:
     \[
     \text{Distance to second stop} = 60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the distance traveled between the first and second stops:**
   - To find the distance between the first and second stops, we subtract the distance to the first stop from the distance to the second stop:
     \[
     \text{Distance between stops} = \text{Distance to second stop} - \text{Distance to first stop}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \text{Distance between stops} = 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
     \[
     \boxed{25} \text{ miles}
     \]
