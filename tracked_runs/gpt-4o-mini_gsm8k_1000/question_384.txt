Question ID: 43

Question:
According to its nutritional info, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories?


Reference Answer:
If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat
If each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving
We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams
If I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of chips you can eat without exceeding your daily calorie target of 2000 calories, given that you have already consumed 1800 calories.

### Step 1: Calculate Remaining Calories
First, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume:

\[
\text{Remaining Calories} = \text{Daily Calorie Target} - \text{Calories Consumed}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Remaining Calories} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 2: Determine Calories per Serving
Next, we know that each serving of chips contains 250 calories. Since the bag has 5 servings, we can confirm the total calories in the bag:

\[
\text{Total Calories in Bag} = \text{Calories per Serving} \times \text{Number of Servings}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Total Calories in Bag} = 250 \times 5 = 1250 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Calories per Gram
Now, we need to find out how many calories are in each gram of chips. The total weight of the bag is 300 grams. Therefore, the calories per gram can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Calories per Gram} = \frac{\text{Total Calories in Bag}}{\text{Total Weight of Bag}}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Calories per Gram} = \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.1667 \text{ calories/gram}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate How Many Grams You Can Eat
Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. We can use the calories per gram to find this:

\[
\text{Grams of Chips} = \frac{\text{Remaining Calories}}{\text{Calories per Gram}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Grams of Chips} = \frac{200}{4.1667} \approx 48 \text{ grams}
\]

### Final Answer
You can eat approximately **48 grams** of chips without exceeding your daily calorie target of 2000 calories.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many grams of chips you can eat given your daily calorie target and your current calorie consumption.

1. **Determine Remaining Calories**:
   You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:
   \[
   \text{Remaining calories} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Calories per Serving of Chips**:
   According to the nutritional information, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. Since the bag contains 5 servings, the total calories in the entire bag are:
   \[
   \text{Total calories in bag} = 250 \text{ calories/serving} \times 5 \text{ servings} = 1250 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Calculate Calories per Gram**:
   The bag weighs 300 grams and contains 1250 calories. Therefore, the number of calories per gram of chips is:
   \[
   \text{Calories per gram} = \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} \approx 4.1667 \text{ calories/gram}
   \]

4. **Determine Grams You Can Eat**:
   Now, we need to find out how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Grams of chips} = \frac{\text{Remaining calories}}{\text{Calories per gram}} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{4.1667 \text{ calories/gram}} \approx 48 \text{ grams}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, you can eat approximately **48 grams** of chips.

Final Answer: **48 grams**
