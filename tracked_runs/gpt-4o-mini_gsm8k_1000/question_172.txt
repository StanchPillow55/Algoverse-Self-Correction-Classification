Question ID: 250

Question:
Each class in a school has 20 students. There are 3 classes. The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. The first class has 15 girls. The second class has 12 girls. How many boys are in the third class?


Reference Answer:
The school has 60 students because 3 x 20 = <<3*20=60>>60
The school has 30 girls because 60 x .5 = <<60*.5=30>>30
The third class has 3 girls because 30 - 15 - 12 = <<30-15-12=3>>3
The third class has 17 boys because 20 - 3 = <<20-3=17>>17
#### 17

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of students in the school.**
   Each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes:
   \[
   \text{Total students} = 20 \text{ students/class} \times 3 \text{ classes} = 60 \text{ students}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of boys and girls in the school.**
   The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 50\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.5 \times 60 = 30 \text{ boys}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.5 \times 60 = 30 \text{ girls}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of girls in the first and second classes.**
   - First class has 15 girls.
   - Second class has 12 girls.

   Now, we can find the total number of girls in the first two classes:
   \[
   \text{Total girls in first and second classes} = 15 + 12 = 27 \text{ girls}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of girls in the third class.**
   Since there are a total of 30 girls in the school, we can find the number of girls in the third class:
   \[
   \text{Girls in third class} = \text{Total girls} - \text{Girls in first and second classes} = 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ girls}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of boys in each class.**
   Each class has 20 students. We already know the number of girls in the third class, so we can find the number of boys in the third class:
   \[
   \text{Boys in third class} = \text{Total students in third class} - \text{Girls in third class} = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ boys}
   \]

6. **Final answer.**
   The number of boys in the third class is:
   \[
   \boxed{17}
   \]
