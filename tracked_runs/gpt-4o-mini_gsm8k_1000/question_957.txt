Question ID: 1002

Question:
Lisa and Peter are selling chocolate bars door to door. Lisa sold three and a half boxes of chocolate bars, and Peter sold four and a half boxes. They sold 64 chocolate bars together. How many chocolate bars are in a box?


Reference Answer:
Let B stand for the number of chocolate bars in a box.
Lisa sold 3 1/2 * B bars.
Peter sold 4 1/2 * B bars.
Together, they sold 3 1/2 * B + 4 1/2 * B = 8B = 64 bars.
Therefore, there are B = 64 / 8 = <<64/8=8>>8 chocolate bars in a box.
#### 8

Response:
To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first determine how many boxes of chocolate bars Lisa and Peter sold in total and then relate that to the total number of chocolate bars sold.

1. **Identify the number of boxes sold by each person**:
   - Lisa sold \(3.5\) boxes.
   - Peter sold \(4.5\) boxes.

2. **Calculate the total number of boxes sold**:
   \[
   \text{Total boxes sold} = \text{Boxes sold by Lisa} + \text{Boxes sold by Peter}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total boxes sold} = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 \text{ boxes}
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of chocolate bars sold**:
   We know that together they sold \(64\) chocolate bars.

4. **Set up the equation to find the number of chocolate bars per box**:
   Let \(x\) be the number of chocolate bars in one box. Then, the total number of chocolate bars sold can also be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total chocolate bars} = \text{Total boxes sold} \times \text{Number of chocolate bars per box}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   64 = 8 \times x
   \]

5. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by \(8\):
   \[
   x = \frac{64}{8} = 8
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in one box is \(8\).

Final answer: **8 chocolate bars per box**.
