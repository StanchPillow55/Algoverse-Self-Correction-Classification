Question ID: 45

Question:
Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job. A blog article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and  2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.


Reference Answer:
If she wrote five articles on Monday, then on Tuesday she wrote 2/5* 5 = 2 more articles.
The total number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is 5+2 = <<5+2=7>>7
On Wednesday, the number of articles was twice the number she wrote on Tuesday, so it was 2*7 = <<2*7=14>>14 articles.
Over the three days, she wrote 5+7 +14 = <<5+7+14=26>>26 articles.
If each article takes her 4 hours to research and write about, she spent 4*26 = <<4*26=104>>104 hours on all the articles.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of articles Meredith wrote each day and then the total hours she spent writing those articles.

1. **Calculate the number of articles written on each day:**
   - **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
   - **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than she wrote on Monday. To find out how many articles she wrote on Tuesday, we first calculate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the articles written on Monday:
     \[
     \text{Articles on Tuesday} = 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5
     \]
     \[
     = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
     \]

   - **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday:
     \[
     \text{Articles on Wednesday} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
     \]

2. **Total number of articles written over the three days:**
   - Articles on Monday: 5
   - Articles on Tuesday: 7
   - Articles on Wednesday: 14
   - Total articles:
     \[
     \text{Total articles} = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \text{ articles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent writing articles:**
   - Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total time spent on writing all articles is:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Total articles} \times \text{Time per article}
     \]
     \[
     = 26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Meredith spent a total of **104 hours** writing articles over the three days.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{104}
\]
