Question:
John orders some pizzas to share with his friends.  There are 20 friends in total, and John wants to make sure each can have 4 slices.  Pizzas are only sold sliced into 8 portions.  How many Pizzas does John need to order?


Reference Answer:
John's 20 friends each need 4 slices, so that means 4*20= <<4*20=80>>80 slices are needed
Each pizza has 8 slices, so to get 80 slices in total 80/8= <<80/8=10>>10 pizzas are needed

Response:
To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of slices needed**:
   - John has 20 friends, and he wants each friend to have 4 slices.
   - Therefore, the total number of slices needed can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total slices needed} = \text{Number of friends} \times \text{Slices per friend}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total slices needed} = 20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Determine how many slices are in each pizza**:
   - Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions (slices).

3. **Calculate the number of pizzas needed**:
   - To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:

   \[
   \text{Number of pizzas needed} = \frac{\text{Total slices needed}}{\text{Slices per pizza}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of pizzas needed} = \frac{80}{8} = 10
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure that each of his 20 friends can have 4 slices.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]
