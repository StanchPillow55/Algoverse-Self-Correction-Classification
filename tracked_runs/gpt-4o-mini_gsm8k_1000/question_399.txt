Response:
To determine how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the bolts.**
   - Each bolt costs $0.03.
   - David wants to buy 16 bolts.
   - The total cost can be calculated by multiplying the cost of one bolt by the number of bolts:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost per Bolt} \times \text{Number of Bolts}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 0.03 \times 16
     \]

   Now, let's perform the multiplication:
   \[
   0.03 \times 16 = 0.48
   \]
   So, the total cost for 16 bolts is $0.48.

2. **Subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has.**
   - David starts with $12.48.
   - We need to subtract the total cost of the bolts from this amount:
     \[
     \text{Money Left} = \text{Initial Amount} - \text{Total Cost}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Money Left} = 12.48 - 0.48
     \]

   Now, let's perform the subtraction:
   \[
   12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00
   \]

3. **State the final answer.**
   - After buying the bolts, David has $12.00 left.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12.00}
\]
