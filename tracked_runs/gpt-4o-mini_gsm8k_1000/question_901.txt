Question:
Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. After that, she runs 5 miles per hour. How many miles can she run in 7 hours?


Reference Answer:
For the first 3 hours, Rosie runs 10 miles per hour, so she runs 10*3=<<10*3=30>>30 miles.
However, she still has 7-3=<<7-3=4>>4 hours left to room.
For the next 4 hours, she runs 5 miles per hour, so she runs 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 miles.
In total she runs 30+20=<<30+20=50>>50 miles.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to break it down into two parts based on the different speeds at which Rosie runs.

1. **Calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.**

   We can use the formula for distance:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]

   For the first part:
   - Speed = 10 miles per hour
   - Time = 3 hours

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Determine how much time is left after running for 3 hours.**

   Rosie runs for a total of 7 hours. After running for 3 hours, the remaining time is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours.**

   Again, using the distance formula:
   - Speed = 5 miles per hour
   - Time = 4 hours

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

4. **Add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie runs in 7 hours.**

   Now we sum the distances from both parts:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Thus, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:
\[
\boxed{50} \, \text{miles}
\]
