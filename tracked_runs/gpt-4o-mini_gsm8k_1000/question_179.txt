Question ID: 650

Question:
On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. At the till she got $2 off because she had a voucher. The next day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, but the store also offered a 10% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 20 pomegranates. What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?


Reference Answer:
On Tuesday, the pomegranates cost Clara 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranates = $<<20*20=400>>400
Using the voucher, she paid $400 - $2 = $<<400-2=398>>398
On Wednesday, the pomegranates cost Sheila 20 pomegranates * $30 = $<<20*30=600>>600.
She then got a discount of 10/100 * $600 = $<<10/100*600=60>>60
Sheila ended up paying $600 - $60 = $<<600-60=540>>540
The difference is therefore $540 - $398 = $<<540-398=142>>142

Response:
To solve the problem, we will calculate the total cost of pomegranates for both Clara and Sheila, and then find the difference between the two amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate Clara's Total Cost

1. **Price per pomegranate**: $20
2. **Number of pomegranates**: 20
3. **Total cost before discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Price per pomegranate} \times \text{Number of pomegranates} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
4. **Discount from voucher**: $2
5. **Total cost after discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount} = 400 - 2 = 398
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Sheila's Total Cost

1. **New price per pomegranate**: $30
2. **Number of pomegranates**: 20
3. **Total cost before discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Price per pomegranate} \times \text{Number of pomegranates} = 30 \times 20 = 600
   \]
4. **Discount offered**: 10%
5. **Amount of discount**:
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = \text{Total cost} \times \frac{10}{100} = 600 \times 0.10 = 60
   \]
6. **Total cost after discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount amount} = 600 - 60 = 540
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Difference in Prices

Now we find the difference between the total prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Sheila's total cost} - \text{Clara's total cost} = 540 - 398 = 142
\]

### Final Answer

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is \(\boxed{142}\).
