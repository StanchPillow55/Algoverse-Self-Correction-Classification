Question ID: 95

Question:
Out of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. How many girls are not in the girl scout?


Reference Answer:
There are 200 x 2/5 = <<200*2/5=80>>80 boys in Grade 5.
So, 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120 are girls.
Out of the 120 girls, 120 x 2/3 = <<120*2/3=80>>80 are in the girl scout.
Therefore, 120 - 80 = <<120-80=40>>40 girls are not in the girl scout.
#### 40

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls:**
   We know that there are 200 Grade 5 students in total. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of these students are boys.

   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = \frac{400}{5} = 80
   \]

   Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
   \]

2. **Determine how many girls are in the girl scout:**
   We are told that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout.

   \[
   \text{Number of girls in girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = \frac{240}{3} = 80
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of girls not in the girl scout:**
   To find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

   \[
   \text{Number of girls not in girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   The number of girls who are not in the girl scout is \( \boxed{40} \).
