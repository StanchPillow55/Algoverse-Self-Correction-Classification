Question ID: 676

Question:
Three people invested $1200 in a joint savings account.  After Dylan's investment of 2/5 of the total amount, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount.  Skyler's investment accounted for the rest. How much money was Skyler's investment?


Reference Answer:
Dylan's investment was 2/5 * $1200 = $<<2/5*1200=480>>480
Frances and Skylers' investment was $1200 - $480 = $<<1200-480=720>>720
Frances invested 2/3 * $720 = $<<2/3*720=480>>480
Dylan's and Frances's total investments were $480 + $480 = $<<480+480=960>>960
Skyler invested $1200 - $960 = $<<1200-960=240>>240
#### 240

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Skyler invested after Dylan and Frances made their investments. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Investment**: The total amount invested in the joint savings account is $1200.

2. **Dylan's Investment**: Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount.
   \[
   \text{Dylan's Investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200
   \]
   Calculating Dylan's investment:
   \[
   \text{Dylan's Investment} = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment**: After Dylan's investment, we need to find the remaining amount in the account.
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720
   \]

4. **Frances's Investment**: Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Frances's Investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720
   \]
   Calculating Frances's investment:
   \[
   \text{Frances's Investment} = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount After Frances's Investment**: Now we find the remaining amount after Frances's investment.
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = 720 - 480 = 240
   \]

6. **Skyler's Investment**: Skyler's investment is the remaining amount after Dylan and Frances's investments.
   \[
   \text{Skyler's Investment} = 240
   \]

Thus, the amount of money that Skyler invested is \( \boxed{240} \).
