Question:
The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100. How much do both cars cost?


Reference Answer:
The red car is 40/100 * 100 = $<<40/100*100=40>>40 cheaper than the blue car.
That means, that the red car costs 100 - 40 = $<<100-40=60>>60.
So both cars cost 100 + 60 = $<<100+60=160>>160.
#### 160

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of both the red car and the blue car based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the price of the blue car**: 
   The problem states that the price of the blue car is $100.

2. **Calculate the price of the red car**:
   The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. To find the price of the red car, we first need to calculate what 40% of the blue car's price is.

   \[
   \text{40% of the blue car's price} = 0.40 \times 100 = 40
   \]

   This means that the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car.

3. **Determine the price of the red car**:
   To find the price of the red car, we subtract the discount from the price of the blue car:

   \[
   \text{Price of the red car} = \text{Price of the blue car} - \text{Discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price of the red car} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

4. **Summarize the costs**:
   - Price of the blue car: $100
   - Price of the red car: $60

5. **Final answer**:
   The cost of the blue car is $100, and the cost of the red car is $60.

Thus, the final answer is:
- Blue car: $100
- Red car: $60

3. **Determine the price of the red car**:  
   Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we subtract the amount we just calculated from the blue car's price:

   \[
   \text{Price of the red car} = \text{Price of the blue car} - \text{40% of the blue car's price}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price of the red car} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

4. **Summarize the costs**:

   - Price of the red car: $60

5. **Final answer**:  
   The cost of the blue car is $100, and the cost of the red car is $60.

Thus, the final answer is:
- Blue car: $100
- Red car: $60
