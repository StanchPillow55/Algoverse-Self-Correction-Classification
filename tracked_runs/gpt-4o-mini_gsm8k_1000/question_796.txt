Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many friends Amy has based on the information given about Lily's friends.

1. **Identify the number of friends Lily has**: 
   - According to the problem, Lily made 50 friends.

2. **Determine how many friends Amy has**:
   - The problem states that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. 
   - Since Lily has 50 friends, we can calculate the number of friends Amy has by adding 20 to Lily's number of friends:
     \[
     \text{Number of friends Amy has} = \text{Number of friends Lily has} + 20
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of friends Amy has} = 50 + 20 = 70
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together**:
   - To find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily has to the number of friends Amy has:
     \[
     \text{Total number of friends} = \text{Number of friends Lily has} + \text{Number of friends Amy has}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total number of friends} = 50 + 70 = 120
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of friends that Lily and Amy have together is \( \boxed{120} \).
