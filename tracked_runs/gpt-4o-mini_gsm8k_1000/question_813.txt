Question ID: 916

Question:
Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance by their mother. The two girls decided to combine their allowance to surprise their father on his birthday. They bought a cake which costs $11. They also bought 1 dozen balloons which were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons. The remaining money was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?


Reference Answer:
There are 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pairs of balloons in 1 dozen.
The cost for buying a dozen balloons was $0.5 x 6 = $<<0.5*6=3>>3.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream was $7 x 2 = $<<7*2=14>>14.
The total cost of their purchases is $11 + $3 +$14 = $<<11+3+14=28>>28.
So their mother gave each of them $28/2 = $<<28/2=14>>14.

Response:
Let's denote the amount of allowance that Julia and Nadine each received from their mother as \( x \). Since they both received the same amount, together they have a total of \( 2x \).

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the cake
The cost of the cake is given as $11.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the balloons
The problem states that balloons are sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons. Therefore, the cost for 1 dozen (12) balloons can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of 1 dozen balloons} = \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the ice cream
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is given as $7 each. Therefore, the total cost for the ice cream is:

\[
\text{Cost of ice cream} = 2 \times 7 = 14
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total expenditure
Now, we can calculate the total amount spent by Julia and Nadine:

\[
\text{Total expenditure} = \text{Cost of cake} + \text{Cost of balloons} + \text{Cost of ice cream}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total expenditure} = 11 + 3 + 14 = 28
\]

### Step 5: Set up the equation
Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, we can set up the equation based on their total allowance:

\[
2x = 28
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( x \)
To find the amount of allowance each girl received, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
x = \frac{28}{2} = 14
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them **$14**.
