Question ID: 926

Question:
Colby loves going to the movies and every month his parents give him $150 to spend at the movies. Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10. Tickets for any other day cost $7. Popcorn costs $8 and boxes of candy cost $2. It is the last day of the month and it's a Friday. He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. How many movies can he see if he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month?


Reference Answer:
He has spent $50 on Fri/Sat movies because 5 x 10 = <<50=50>>50
He has spent $56 on movies the rest of the day because 8 x 7 = <<8*7=56>>56
He has spent $16 on popcorn because 2 x 8 = <<16=16>>16
He has spent $8 on candy because 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8
He has spent 130 in total because 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = <<50+56+16+8=130>>130
He plans to spend $10 on popcorn and candy because 8 + 2 = <<8+2=10>>10
He has $10 left to spend because 150 - 130 - 10 = <<150-130-10=10>>10
He can see 1 movie because 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Colby has already spent this month and how much he has left to spend on the last day of the month, which is a Friday. We will then calculate how many additional movies he can see, given the costs of tickets, popcorn, and candy.

### Step 1: Calculate Colby's total spending so far

1. **Movies on Fridays and Saturdays:**
   - Colby saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays.
   - Cost per ticket on these days: $10.
   - Total cost for these movies:
     \[
     5 \text{ movies} \times 10 \text{ dollars/movie} = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Movies on other days:**
   - Colby saw 8 movies on other days.
   - Cost per ticket on these days: $7.
   - Total cost for these movies:
     \[
     8 \text{ movies} \times 7 \text{ dollars/movie} = 56 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Popcorn:**
   - Colby had 2 tubs of popcorn.
   - Cost per tub of popcorn: $8.
   - Total cost for popcorn:
     \[
     2 \text{ tubs} \times 8 \text{ dollars/tub} = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Candy:**
   - Colby had 4 boxes of candy.
   - Cost per box of candy: $2.
   - Total cost for candy:
     \[
     4 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate total spending

Now, we will sum all the expenses:
\[
\text{Total spending} = \text{Cost of movies on Fridays/Saturdays} + \text{Cost of movies on other days} + \text{Cost of popcorn} + \text{Cost of candy}
\]
\[
\text{Total spending} = 50 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} + 16 \text{ dollars} + 8 \text{ dollars} = 130 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate remaining budget

Colbyâ€™s monthly allowance is $150. We will subtract his total spending from this amount to find out how much he has left:
\[
\text{Remaining budget} = 150 \text{ dollars} - 130 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Determine costs for the last day

On the last day, Colby wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy:
- Cost of popcorn: $8
- Cost of candy: $2
- Total cost for popcorn and candy:
\[
\text{Total cost for popcorn and candy} = 8 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate remaining budget after popcorn and candy

Now we will subtract the cost of popcorn and candy from his remaining budget:
\[
\text{Remaining budget after popcorn and candy} = 20 \text{ dollars} - 10 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate how many movies he can see

With the remaining budget of $10, we will determine how many additional movies he can see. Since it is a Friday, the cost of a ticket is $10:
\[
\text{Number of movies} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost per ticket}} = \frac{10 \text{ dollars}}{10 \text{ dollars/movie}} = 1 \text{ movie}
\]

### Final Answer

Colby can see **1 movie** on the last day of the month.

Response:
To determine how many movies Colby can see on the last day of the month, we need to calculate his total spending for the month and see how much money he has left.

1. **Initial Budget**: Colby has $150 for the month.

2. **Movies Already Seen**:
   - **Friday/Saturday Movies**: 5 movies at $10 each.
   - **Other Day Movies**: 8 movies at $7 each.

   Let's calculate the total cost for the movies:

   - Cost for Friday/Saturday movies:
     \[
     5 \text{ movies} \times 10 \text{ dollars/movie} = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - Cost for other day movies:
     \[
     8 \text{ movies} \times 7 \text{ dollars/movie} = 56 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - Total cost for all movies:
     \[
     50 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} = 106 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Popcorn and Candy**:
   - Colby had 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each:
     \[
     2 \text{ tubs} \times 8 \text{ dollars/tub} = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - Colby had 4 boxes of candy at $2 each:
     \[
     4 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - Total cost for popcorn and candy:
     \[
     16 \text{ dollars} + 8 \text{ dollars} = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total Spending for the Month**:
   - Total spent on movies, popcorn, and candy:
     \[
     106 \text{ dollars} + 24 \text{ dollars} = 130 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Remaining Budget**:
   - Colby started with $150 and has spent $130:
     \[
     150 \text{ dollars} - 130 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Cost of a Movie on Friday**: Since it is a Friday, the cost of a movie is $10.

7. **How Many More Movies Can He See?**:
   - With $20 remaining, we can calculate how many more movies he can see:
     \[
     \text{Number of movies} = \frac{20 \text{ dollars}}{10 \text{ dollars/movie}} = 2 \text{ movies}
     \]

**Final Answer**: Colby can see **2 more movies** on the last day of the month.

To determine how many movies Colby can see on the last day of the month, we need to calculate his total spending for the month and how much money he has left.

1. **Monthly Budget**: Colby has $150 to spend.

2. **Expenses Already Incurred**:
   - **Movies on Fridays/Saturdays**: Colby saw 5 movies.
     - Cost for these movies: \(5 \text{ movies} \times 10 \text{ dollars/movie} = 50 \text{ dollars}\)
   - **Movies on Other Days**: Colby saw 8 movies.
     - Cost for these movies: \(8 \text{ movies} \times 7 \text{ dollars/movie} = 56 \text{ dollars}\)
   - **Popcorn**: Colby had 2 tubs of popcorn.
     - Cost for popcorn: \(2 \text{ tubs} \times 8 \text{ dollars/tub} = 16 \text{ dollars}\)
   - **Candy**: Colby had 4 boxes of candy.
     - Cost for candy: \(4 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 8 \text{ dollars}\)

3. **Total Expenses**:
   - Total spent on movies: \(50 + 56 = 106 \text{ dollars}\)
   - Total spent on snacks: \(16 + 8 = 24 \text{ dollars}\)
   - Total expenses for the month: \(106 + 24 = 130 \text{ dollars}\)

4. **Remaining Budget**:
   - Remaining money: \(150 - 130 = 20 \text{ dollars}\)

5. **Cost of Additional Items**:
   - Colby wants to buy 1 popcorn and 1 box of candy for the last day.
     - Cost for 1 popcorn: \(8 \text{ dollars}\)
     - Cost for 1 box of candy: \(2 \text{ dollars}\)
     - Total cost for snacks on the last day: \(8 + 2 = 10 \text{ dollars}\)

6. **Money Left After Snacks**:
   - Money left after buying snacks: \(20 - 10 = 10 \text{ dollars}\)

7. **Movies Colby Can See**:
   - On Fridays, each movie costs \(10 \text{ dollars}\).
   - With \(10 \text{ dollars}\) left, Colby can see:
     \[
     \frac{10 \text{ dollars}}{10 \text{ dollars/movie}} = 1 \text{ movie}
     \]

Thus, Colby can see **1 movie** on the last day of the month. 

**Final Answer**: 1 movie.
