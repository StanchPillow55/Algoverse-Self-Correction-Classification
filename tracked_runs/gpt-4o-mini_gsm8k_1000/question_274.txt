Question ID: 812

Question:
Rose is out picking flowers for a vase she wants to fill.  She starts off by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each.  She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?


Reference Answer:
Rose picks 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 petals worth of the 5 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 petals worth of the 6 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 petals worth of the 4 petal flowers.
Finally, Rose picks 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 petals worth of the 7 petal flowers.
Rose carries 15+24+20+42=<<15+24+20+42=101>>101 petals worth of flowers back to the vase.
But the wind blows 5+6+4+7=<<5+6+4+7=22>>22 petals worth of flowers away.
So Rose has 101-22=<<101-22=79>>79 petals worth remaining

Response:
To find the total number of petals on the flowers that Rose puts in the vase, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower before any are dropped:**

   - **First type of flower:** Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each.
     \[
     \text{Total petals from first type} = 3 \text{ flowers} \times 5 \text{ petals/flower} = 15 \text{ petals}
     \]

   - **Second type of flower:** Rose picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.
     \[
     \text{Total petals from second type} = 4 \text{ flowers} \times 6 \text{ petals/flower} = 24 \text{ petals}
     \]

   - **Third type of flower:** Rose picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each.
     \[
     \text{Total petals from third type} = 5 \text{ flowers} \times 4 \text{ petals/flower} = 20 \text{ petals}
     \]

   - **Fourth type of flower:** Rose picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each.
     \[
     \text{Total petals from fourth type} = 6 \text{ flowers} \times 7 \text{ petals/flower} = 42 \text{ petals}
     \]

2. **Sum the total number of petals from all types of flowers:**
   \[
   \text{Total petals before dropping} = 15 + 24 + 20 + 42
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total petals before dropping} = 101 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of flowers dropped:**
   Rose drops 1 flower from each type. Therefore, she drops:
   - 1 flower from the first type (5 petals)
   - 1 flower from the second type (6 petals)
   - 1 flower from the third type (4 petals)
   - 1 flower from the fourth type (7 petals)

   Now, we calculate the total number of petals lost due to the dropped flowers:
   \[
   \text{Total petals dropped} = 5 + 6 + 4 + 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total petals dropped} = 22 \text{ petals}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of petals in the vase after dropping the flowers:**
   \[
   \text{Total petals in vase} = \text{Total petals before dropping} - \text{Total petals dropped}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total petals in vase} = 101 - 22
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total petals in vase} = 79 \text{ petals}
   \]

Thus, the total number of petals in the vase is \( \boxed{79} \).
