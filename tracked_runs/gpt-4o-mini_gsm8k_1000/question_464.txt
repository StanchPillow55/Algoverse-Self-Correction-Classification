Question:
Fishio posted her selfie on Instagram. She received 2000 likes on the photo after 1 week. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. If she received 20000 more new likes recently, how many Instagram likes are there?


Reference Answer:
After receiving 2000 likes on her photo on Instagram on the first week, Fishio received 70*2000 = <<70*2000=140000>>140000 new likes on the photo after three more weeks.
The total number of likes in the four weeks is 140000+2000 = <<140000+2000=142000>>142000
If Fishio received 20000 more likes recently, the number of likes on the photo is 142000+20000=<<142000+20000=162000>>162000
#### 162000

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Likes**: Fishio received 2000 likes on her selfie after 1 week. We can denote this initial number of likes as:
   \[
   L_0 = 2000
   \]

2. **Likes After Three Weeks**: The problem states that three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   L_3 = 70 \times L_0 = 70 \times 2000
   \]
   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   L_3 = 140000
   \]

3. **New Likes Received**: The problem also states that she received 20000 more new likes recently. We can denote the new likes as:
   \[
   L_{\text{new}} = 20000
   \]

4. **Total Likes Calculation**: To find the total number of likes after receiving the new likes, we add the likes after three weeks to the new likes:
   \[
   L_{\text{total}} = L_3 + L_{\text{new}} = 140000 + 20000
   \]
   Performing the addition:
   \[
   L_{\text{total}} = 160000
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the total number of Instagram likes on Fishio's selfie is:
   \[
   \boxed{160000}
   \]

Response:
To solve the problem step by step, let's break down the information provided and perform the necessary calculations.

1. **Initial Likes**: Fishio received 2000 likes on her selfie after 1 week. We can denote this initial number of likes as:
   \[
   L_0 = 2000
   \]

2. **Likes After Three Weeks**: The problem states that three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   L_3 = 70 \times L_0 = 70 \times 2000
   \]
   Now, let's perform the multiplication:
   \[
   L_3 = 70 \times 2000 = 140000
   \]

3. **New Likes Received**: The problem also mentions that she received 20,000 more new likes recently. We can denote the new likes as:
   \[
   L_{\text{new}} = 20000
   \]

4. **Total Likes Calculation**: To find the total number of likes after receiving the new likes, we add the likes after three weeks to the new likes:
   \[
   L_{\text{total}} = L_3 + L_{\text{new}} = 140000 + 20000
   \]
   Now, let's perform the addition:
   \[
   L_{\text{total}} = 140000 + 20000 = 160000
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the total number of Instagram likes on Fishio's selfie is:
   \[
   \boxed{160000}
   \] 

This concludes the solution, and the final answer is 160,000 likes.
