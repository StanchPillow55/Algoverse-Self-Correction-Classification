Question ID: 284

Question:
Alani's family decided that the children should write stories of any kind. They were then required to read all of the stories they'd written to the family at the end of the weekend. Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, her brother Braylen wrote 40 stories, and her sister Margot wrote 60 stories. If they each doubled the number of stories they'd written in the first week in the second week, calculate the total number of stories they wrote altogether.


Reference Answer:
In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, and if she doubled the number in the second week, the total number of stories in the second week is 20*2 = <<20*2=40>>40.
In total, Alani had written 40+20 = <<40+20=60>>60 stories in the two weeks.
Braylen also wrote 40 stories in the first week, and on doubling that number in the second week the number became 2*40 =<<40*2=80>>80
His total number of stories in the two weeks is 80+40 = <<80+40=120>>120
Together, Alani and her brother Braylen had written 120+60 = <<120+60=180>>180 stories.
When Margot doubled the number of stories she wrote in the first week in the second week, she wrote 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 stories in the second week.
In total, she wrote 60+120= <<60+120=180>>180 stories.
Altogether, the three siblings wrote 180+180 = <<180+180=360>>360 stories in the two weeks.

Response:
To find the total number of stories that Alani, Braylen, and Margot wrote altogether over the two weeks, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of stories each child wrote in the first week.**
   - Alani wrote 20 stories.
   - Braylen wrote 40 stories.
   - Margot wrote 60 stories.

2. **Calculate the number of stories each child wrote in the second week.**
   - Since each child doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week, we will multiply the number of stories they wrote in the first week by 2.
   - Alani's second week stories: \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \)
   - Braylen's second week stories: \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \)
   - Margot's second week stories: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \)

3. **Calculate the total number of stories written by each child over the two weeks.**
   - Total stories for Alani: \( 20 + 40 = 60 \)
   - Total stories for Braylen: \( 40 + 80 = 120 \)
   - Total stories for Margot: \( 60 + 120 = 180 \)

4. **Calculate the overall total number of stories written by all three children.**
   - Total stories: \( 60 + 120 + 180 \)

Now, let's perform the final addition:
\[
60 + 120 = 180
\]
\[
180 + 180 = 360
\]

Thus, the total number of stories written altogether by Alani, Braylen, and Margot over the two weeks is **360**.

**Final Answer: 360**
