Question ID: 356

Question:
Dean's mother gave him $28 to go to the toy store. Dean bought 6 toy cars and 5 teddy bears. Each toy car cost $2 and each teddy bear cost $1. His mother then feels generous and decides to give him an extra $10. How much money does Dean have left?


Reference Answer:
The cost of the toy cars is 6 cars × $2/car = $<<6*2=12>>12.
The cost of the teddy bears is 5 bears × $1/bear = $<<5*1=5>>5.
The total cost of the toys is $12 + $5 = $<<12+5=17>>17.
Adding the two amounts of money his mother gave him, we find that Dean has $28 + $10 = $<<28+10=38>>38 to spend.
Dean has $38 − $17 = $21 left.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the toy cars.**
   - Dean bought 6 toy cars, and each toy car costs $2.
   - Total cost for toy cars = Number of toy cars × Cost per toy car
   \[
   \text{Total cost for toy cars} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the teddy bears.**
   - Dean bought 5 teddy bears, and each teddy bear costs $1.
   - Total cost for teddy bears = Number of teddy bears × Cost per teddy bear
   \[
   \text{Total cost for teddy bears} = 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of all toys.**
   - Total cost = Total cost for toy cars + Total cost for teddy bears
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how much money Dean has after his purchases.**
   - Dean started with $28 and spent $17 on toys.
   - Money left after purchases = Initial amount - Total cost
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Add the extra money given by his mother.**
   - Dean's mother gives him an extra $10.
   - Total money Dean has now = Money left + Extra money
   \[
   \text{Total money now} = 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Final answer.**
   - The amount of money Dean has left after his purchases and the extra money from his mother is:
   \[
   \boxed{21} \text{ dollars}
   \]
