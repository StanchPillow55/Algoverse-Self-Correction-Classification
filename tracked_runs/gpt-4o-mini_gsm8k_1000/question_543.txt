Response:
To find out how many cookies Rachel has left after her brother ate some, we can break the problem down into a series of steps.

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies Rachel initially has:**
   - Rachel bought 23 cookies.
   - Janet gave her 42 cookies.
   - To find the total, we add these two amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total cookies} = \text{Cookies bought} + \text{Cookies given}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cookies} = 23 + 42
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cookies} = 65
   \]

2. **Determine how many cookies Rachel's brother ate:**
   - Rachel's brother ate 44 cookies.

3. **Calculate the number of cookies left after her brother ate some:**
   - To find out how many cookies are left, we subtract the number of cookies eaten by her brother from the total number of cookies Rachel had:

   \[
   \text{Cookies left} = \text{Total cookies} - \text{Cookies eaten}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cookies left} = 65 - 44
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cookies left} = 21
   \]

Thus, after Rachel's brother ate 44 cookies, Rachel has **21 cookies left**.

Final answer: **21 cookies**.
