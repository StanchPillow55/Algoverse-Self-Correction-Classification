Question ID: 354

Question:
Annabelle is saving for a phone that costs $400. She already has $80 in her savings. Her first job, where she earns $10 per hour, pays her for 20 hours of work. She is also paid for 15 hours of work at her second job, where she earns $5 an hour. In dollars, how much money does Annabelle still need to save?


Reference Answer:
Subtracting Annabelle’s initial savings shows that she still needs to save $400 – $80 = $<<400-80=320>>320.
From her first job, she earns $10 * 20 hours = $<<10*20=200>>200.
From her second job, she earns $5 * 15 hours = $<<5*15=75>>75.
She therefore still needs to save $320 – $200 – $75 = $<<320-200-75=45>>45.

Response:
To determine how much money Annabelle still needs to save for the phone, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount Annabelle currently has in savings.**
   - She already has $80 in her savings.

2. **Calculate her earnings from her first job.**
   - Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job and works for 20 hours.
   - Earnings from the first job = Hourly wage × Hours worked
   \[
   \text{Earnings from first job} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate her earnings from her second job.**
   - Annabelle earns $5 per hour at her second job and works for 15 hours.
   - Earnings from the second job = Hourly wage × Hours worked
   \[
   \text{Earnings from second job} = 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate her total earnings from both jobs.**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from first job + Earnings from second job
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 275 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate Annabelle's total savings.**
   - Total savings = Current savings + Total earnings
   \[
   \text{Total savings} = 80 \, \text{dollars} + 275 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

6. **Determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save.**
   - The cost of the phone is $400.
   - Amount still needed = Cost of phone - Total savings
   \[
   \text{Amount still needed} = 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, Annabelle still needs to save **$45** to buy the phone.

Final answer: **$45**

Response:
To determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save for the phone, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Annabelle's total earnings from her jobs.**

   - From her first job:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from first job} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

   - From her second job:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from second job} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked} = 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Add the earnings from both jobs to find her total earnings.**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from first job} + \text{Earnings from second job} = 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 275 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate Annabelle's total savings.**
   - She already has $80 in savings, so:
   \[
   \text{Total savings} = \text{Current savings} + \text{Total earnings} = 80 \, \text{dollars} + 275 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how much more money she needs to save to buy the phone.**
   - The cost of the phone is $400, so:
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = \text{Cost of phone} - \text{Total savings} = 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, Annabelle still needs to save **$45** to buy the phone.

**Final Answer: $45**
