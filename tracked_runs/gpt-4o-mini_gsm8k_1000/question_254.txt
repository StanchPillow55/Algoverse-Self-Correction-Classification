Question ID: 716

Question:
John makes himself a 6 egg omelet with 2 oz of cheese and an equal amount of ham.  Eggs are 75 calories each.  Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.  Ham is 40 calories per ounce.  How many calories is the omelet?


Reference Answer:
The eggs contributed 6*75=<<6*75=450>>450 calories
He eats 2*120=<<2*120=240>>240 calories of cheese
He eats 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80 calories of ham
So in total he eats 450+240+80=<<450+240+80=770>>770 calories
#### 770

Response:
To find the total number of calories in John's omelet, we need to calculate the calories contributed by the eggs, cheese, and ham separately, and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the calories from the eggs
John uses 6 eggs, and each egg has 75 calories.

\[
\text{Calories from eggs} = \text{Number of eggs} \times \text{Calories per egg}
\]
\[
\text{Calories from eggs} = 6 \times 75 = 450 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the calories from the cheese
John uses 2 ounces of cheese, and each ounce of cheese has 120 calories.

\[
\text{Calories from cheese} = \text{Number of ounces of cheese} \times \text{Calories per ounce of cheese}
\]
\[
\text{Calories from cheese} = 2 \times 120 = 240 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the calories from the ham
John also uses 2 ounces of ham, and each ounce of ham has 40 calories.

\[
\text{Calories from ham} = \text{Number of ounces of ham} \times \text{Calories per ounce of ham}
\]
\[
\text{Calories from ham} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 4: Sum all the calories
Now we add the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham together to find the total calories in the omelet.

\[
\text{Total calories} = \text{Calories from eggs} + \text{Calories from cheese} + \text{Calories from ham}
\]
\[
\text{Total calories} = 450 + 240 + 80
\]
\[
\text{Total calories} = 770 \text{ calories}
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of calories in John's omelet is **770 calories**.

Response:
To find the total number of calories in John's 6 egg omelet with cheese and ham, we will calculate the calories contributed by each ingredient separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the calories from the eggs
John uses 6 eggs, and each egg contains 75 calories.

\[
\text{Calories from eggs} = \text{Number of eggs} \times \text{Calories per egg}
\]
\[
\text{Calories from eggs} = 6 \times 75 = 450 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the calories from the cheese
John uses 2 ounces of cheese, and each ounce of cheese contains 120 calories.

\[
\text{Calories from cheese} = \text{Number of ounces of cheese} \times \text{Calories per ounce of cheese}
\]
\[
\text{Calories from cheese} = 2 \times 120 = 240 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the calories from the ham
John uses an equal amount of ham, which is also 2 ounces. Each ounce of ham contains 40 calories.

\[
\text{Calories from ham} = \text{Number of ounces of ham} \times \text{Calories per ounce of ham}
\]
\[
\text{Calories from ham} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 4: Sum the calories from all ingredients
Now, we will add the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham to find the total calories in the omelet.

\[
\text{Total calories} = \text{Calories from eggs} + \text{Calories from cheese} + \text{Calories from ham}
\]
\[
\text{Total calories} = 450 + 240 + 80
\]
\[
\text{Total calories} = 770 \text{ calories}
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of calories in John's 6 egg omelet with cheese and ham is **770 calories**.

Response:
To find the total calories in John's omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate calories from the eggs:**
   - John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg has 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs = Number of eggs × Calories per egg
   \[
   \text{Total calories from eggs} = 6 \times 75 = 450 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Calculate calories from the cheese:**
   - John uses 2 oz of cheese.
   - Cheese has 120 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from cheese = Amount of cheese (in oz) × Calories per ounce
   \[
   \text{Total calories from cheese} = 2 \times 120 = 240 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Calculate calories from the ham:**
   - John uses 2 oz of ham (equal amount to cheese).
   - Ham has 40 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from ham = Amount of ham (in oz) × Calories per ounce
   \[
   \text{Total calories from ham} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ calories}
   \]

4. **Sum all the calories:**
   - Total calories in the omelet = Total calories from eggs + Total calories from cheese + Total calories from ham
   \[
   \text{Total calories in omelet} = 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 \text{ calories}
   \]

Thus, the total number of calories in John's omelet is **770 calories**.
