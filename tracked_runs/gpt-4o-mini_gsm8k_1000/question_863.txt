Question ID: 803

Question:
Kris is trying to earn a video game achievement for playing a total of 30 hours. If Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks then plays for 2 hours every day for a week, how many hours does she still need to play to earn the achievement?


Reference Answer:
Two weeks is the same as 2 weeks * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 days.
So playing for half an hour every day means Kris will have played for 0.5 hours * 14 days = <<0.5*14=7>>7 hours.
Playing for 2 hours every day for another week will be an additional 2 hours * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 hours.
She therefore still needs to play 30 – 7 – 14 = <<30-7-14=9>>9 hours.

Response:
To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we will first calculate the total hours she has already played based on the given information.

1. **Calculate the hours played in the first 2 weeks:**
   - Kris plays for half an hour every day.
   - There are 14 days in 2 weeks.
   - Total hours played in 2 weeks = (0.5 hours/day) × (14 days) = 7 hours.

2. **Calculate the hours played in the following week:**
   - Kris plays for 2 hours every day for 7 days.
   - Total hours played in this week = (2 hours/day) × (7 days) = 14 hours.

3. **Calculate the total hours played:**
   - Total hours played = Hours from the first 2 weeks + Hours from the following week
   - Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

4. **Determine how many more hours are needed to reach 30 hours:**
   - Kris needs a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement.
   - Hours still needed = Total hours needed - Total hours played
   - Hours still needed = 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours.

Thus, Kris still needs to play **9 hours** to earn the achievement.

Final answer: **9 hours**.
