Question ID: 1151

Question:
Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours. If Sid then traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours, what's the average speed he was traveling?


Reference Answer:
After traveling 110 miles at first, Sid traveled 110 + 140 = <<110+140=250>>250 miles in total
Since he spends 3 hours traveling after the first 2 hours, he traveled 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 hours
On average, Sid traveled 250 miles / 5 hours = <<250/5=50>>50 miles per hour.

Response:
To find Sid's average speed over the entire trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance traveled.**
   - Sid first traveled 110 miles.
   - Then he traveled an additional 140 miles.
   - Therefore, the total distance \( D \) is:
     \[
     D = 110 \text{ miles} + 140 \text{ miles} = 250 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time taken.**
   - Sid first took 2 hours for the first part of the trip.
   - Then he took 3 hours for the second part of the trip.
   - Therefore, the total time \( T \) is:
     \[
     T = 2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the average speed.**
   - Average speed \( S \) is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. The formula for average speed is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{T}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we calculated:
     \[
     S = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

Thus, the average speed Sid was traveling is \( \boxed{50} \) miles per hour.
