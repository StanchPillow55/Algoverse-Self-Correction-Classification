Question ID: 257

Question:
Each solid 10-foot section of a redwood tree weighs 400 pounds. Termites ate 30% of this redwood's wood. If the redwood is 200 feet tall, how much does it weigh?


Reference Answer:
First find how many 10-foot sections are in the redwood: 200 feet / 10 feet/section = <<200/10=20>>20 sections
Then multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = <<20*400=8000>>8000 pounds
Then find the amount of the wood the termites ate: 8000 pounds * 30% = <<8000*30*.01=2400>>2400 pounds
Then subtract that amount from the total weight of the wood: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = <<8000-2400=5600>>5600 pounds

Response:
To determine the weight of the redwood tree after termites have eaten 30% of it, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall tree.**
   \[
   \text{Number of sections} = \frac{\text{Total height of the tree}}{\text{Height of each section}} = \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the tree before termites.**
   Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the tree can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Number of sections} \times \text{Weight per section} = 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine the weight of the wood eaten by termites.**
   Since termites ate 30% of the wood, we can calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten:
   \[
   \text{Weight eaten by termites} = 0.30 \times \text{Total weight} = 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining weight of the tree after the termites have eaten part of it.**
   To find the remaining weight, we subtract the weight eaten by the termites from the total weight:
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight} = \text{Total weight} - \text{Weight eaten by termites} = 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **State the final answer.**
   The weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of it is:
   \[
   \boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}
   \]
