Question ID: 653

Question:
Sally has realized she did not receive a full wage this week. Her bank account, which held $200 at the start of the week, now holds $420. She has received no other money into her bank account this week. If her weekly wage should be $300, how many dollars were withheld from Sally’s wage?


Reference Answer:
The wage she received was $420 – $200 = $<<420-200=220>>220
This means her wage was $300 – $220 = $<<300-220=80>>80 short
#### 80

Response:
To determine how much money was withheld from Sally's wage, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial amount in the bank account**: 
   Sally started the week with $200 in her bank account.

2. **Identify the final amount in the bank account**: 
   At the end of the week, her bank account holds $420.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money that has entered the bank account**: 
   To find out how much money has been added to her account during the week, we subtract the initial amount from the final amount:
   \[
   \text{Money added} = \text{Final amount} - \text{Initial amount} = 420 - 200 = 220
   \]

4. **Identify Sally's expected weekly wage**: 
   Sally's expected wage for the week is $300.

5. **Determine how much of her wage was actually received**: 
   Since we found that $220 was added to her account, this amount represents the wage she actually received.

6. **Calculate the amount withheld from her wage**: 
   To find out how much was withheld, we subtract the amount she received from her expected wage:
   \[
   \text{Withheld amount} = \text{Expected wage} - \text{Actual wage received} = 300 - 220 = 80
   \]

Thus, the amount withheld from Sally's wage is **$80**.

Final answer: **$80**.
