Question ID: 201

Question:
John wins an award at work.  The award has a 1 time monetary reward of $5000 and a 5% raise in salary.  If he makes 2000 a week, every week of the year and he got the award on the first day of the year how much money did he make that year?


Reference Answer:
He makes 2000*52=$<<2000*52=104000>>104,000 a year
So the raise is worth .05*104,000=$<<.05*104000=5200>>5200
So he makes 104,000+5200=$<<104000+5200=109200>>109,200 from his salary
So in total he made 109,200+5,000=$<<109200+5000=114200>>114,200
#### 114,200

Response:
To determine how much money John made in the year after receiving the award, we need to consider both the monetary reward and the increase in his salary due to the raise.

### Step 1: Calculate John's annual salary before the raise

John earns $2000 per week. To find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his weekly salary by the number of weeks in a year:

\[
\text{Annual Salary} = \text{Weekly Salary} \times \text{Number of Weeks in a Year}
\]

\[
\text{Annual Salary} = 2000 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 52 \, \text{weeks/year} = 104000 \, \text{dollars/year}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the raise

John receives a 5% raise on his current salary. To find the amount of the raise, we calculate 5% of his current annual salary:

\[
\text{Raise} = \text{Annual Salary} \times 0.05
\]

\[
\text{Raise} = 104000 \, \text{dollars} \times 0.05 = 5200 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate John's new annual salary after the raise

Now, we add the raise to his original annual salary to find his new salary:

\[
\text{New Annual Salary} = \text{Annual Salary} + \text{Raise}
\]

\[
\text{New Annual Salary} = 104000 \, \text{dollars} + 5200 \, \text{dollars} = 109200 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate total earnings for the year

John also receives a one-time monetary reward of $5000. Therefore, his total earnings for the year will be the sum of his new annual salary and the award:

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{New Annual Salary} + \text{Award}
\]

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = 109200 \, \text{dollars} + 5000 \, \text{dollars} = 114200 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total amount of money John made that year is:

\[
\boxed{114200} \, \text{dollars}
\]
