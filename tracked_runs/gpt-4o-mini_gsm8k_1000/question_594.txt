Question ID: 477

Question:
Nine of the kids in Gina's class are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts and 3 are allergic to both. If there are 32 kids in her class, how many aren't allergic to anything?


Reference Answer:
First subtract the number of kids who are allergic to each item from the total number of kids: 32 kids - 6 kids - 9 kids = <<32-6-9=17>>17 kids
Then add the number of kids who were double-counted because they're allergic to both things: 17 kids + 3 kids = <<17+3=20>>20 kids
#### 20

Response:
To solve the problem, we will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens (dairy or peanuts) and then subtract that from the total number of kids in the class to find out how many are not allergic to anything.

1. **Identify the sets:**
   - Let \( A \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
   - Let \( B \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

   From the problem, we have:
   - \( |A| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
   - \( |B| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
   - \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

2. **Calculate the number of kids allergic to at least one allergen:**
   We can use the formula for the union of two sets:
   \[
   |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
   \]
   So, there are 12 kids who are allergic to at least one of the allergens (either dairy or peanuts).

3. **Determine the number of kids not allergic to anything:**
   The total number of kids in the class is given as 32. To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one allergen from the total number of kids:
   \[
   \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = \text{Total kids} - |A \cup B|
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the number of kids in Gina's class who aren't allergic to anything is \( \boxed{20} \).
