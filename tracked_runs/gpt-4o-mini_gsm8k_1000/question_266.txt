Question ID: 883

Question:
Elaina is holding the final concert in her tour. To celebrate her final concert, she makes the concert twice as long as her usual concerts. At the end of the concert, she also performs a 15-minute encore. If the runtime of this final concert is 65 minutes then how long, in minutes, do her usual concerts run for?


Reference Answer:
The concert, minus the encore, lasted for 65-minute concert â€“ 15-minute encore = <<65-15=50>>50 minutes.
This is twice as long as her usual concerts so her usual concert must have a runtime of 50 minutes / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.

Response:
To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run, we can break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total runtime of the final concert**: We know that the final concert lasts 65 minutes.

2. **Identify the encore duration**: The encore at the end of the concert lasts for 15 minutes.

3. **Determine the runtime of the main concert**: Since the encore is part of the total concert time, we can find the length of the main concert by subtracting the encore duration from the total concert time:
   \[
   \text{Main concert duration} = \text{Total concert duration} - \text{Encore duration}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \text{Main concert duration} = 65 \text{ minutes} - 15 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Relate the main concert duration to usual concert duration**: The problem states that this final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts. Let \( x \) represent the duration of her usual concerts in minutes. Therefore, we can express the relationship as:
   \[
   2x = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**: To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the duration of Elaina's usual concerts is \( \boxed{25} \) minutes.
