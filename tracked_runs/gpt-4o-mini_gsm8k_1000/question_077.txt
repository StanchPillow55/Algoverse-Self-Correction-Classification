Question:
It rained 2 inches on Monday and is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice of Monday’s total on Tuesday. How many inches of rain will there be on Tuesday?

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much it will rain on Tuesday based on the information given about Monday's rainfall.

1. **Identify Monday's Rainfall**: 
   - It rained 2 inches on Monday.

2. **Determine Tuesday's Rainfall**: 
   - The problem states that Tuesday's rainfall is expected to be "1 more inch than twice of Monday’s total."
   - We need to calculate "twice of Monday’s total" first. Since Monday's total is 2 inches, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Twice of Monday's total} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Add 1 Inch to Tuesday's Rainfall**:
   - Now we need to add 1 inch to the result from the previous step:
     \[
     \text{Tuesday's rainfall} = 4 \text{ inches} + 1 \text{ inch} = 5 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the total amount of rain expected on Tuesday is:
     \[
     \boxed{5} \text{ inches}
     \] 

This concludes the reasoning and calculations for the problem. The final answer is 5 inches of rain on Tuesday.
