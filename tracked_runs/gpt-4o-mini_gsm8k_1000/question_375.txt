Question ID: 459

Question:
A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?


Reference Answer:
The farmer is buying 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pounds of sugar cubes.
He is buying 4 * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 pounds of carrots.
He is buying 42 * 75 = <<42*75=3150>>3150 pounds of hay bales.
He is buying 20 * 65 = <<20*65=1300>>1300 pounds of oat sacks.
The weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = <<2+48+3150+1300=4500>>4500 pounds.
Thus, the farmer needs 4500 / 2250 = <<4500/2250=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.

Response:
To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed he buys and then sum these weights to find the overall total. Finally, we will divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.

### Step 1: Calculate the total weight of each type of feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes**:
   - The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \( 2 \times 1 \text{ lb} = 2 \text{ lb} \)

2. **Carrots**:
   - The farmer buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight of carrots = \( 4 \times 12 \text{ lb} = 48 \text{ lb} \)

3. **Hay**:
   - The farmer buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of hay = \( 42 \times 75 \text{ lb} = 3150 \text{ lb} \)

4. **Oats**:
   - The farmer buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = \( 20 \times 65 \text{ lb} = 1300 \text{ lb} \)

### Step 2: Sum the total weights of all the feed.

Now we add the total weights of all the feed types together:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of sugar cubes} + \text{Weight of carrots} + \text{Weight of hay} + \text{Weight of oats}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight} = 2 \text{ lb} + 48 \text{ lb} + 3150 \text{ lb} + 1300 \text{ lb}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

\[
2 + 48 = 50
\]
\[
50 + 3150 = 3200
\]
\[
3200 + 1300 = 4500
\]

So, the total weight of all the feed is **4500 pounds**.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of trips required.

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

\[
\text{Number of trips} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Truck capacity}} = \frac{4500 \text{ lb}}{2250 \text{ lb/trip}}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Number of trips} = 2
\]

### Final Answer

The farmer needs to make **2 trips** to transport all the feed.
