Question:
Ducks need to eat 3.5 pounds of insects each week to survive. If there is a flock of ten ducks, how many pounds of insects do they need per day?


Reference Answer:
The flock needs 35 pounds per week because 10 x 3.5 = <<10*3.5=35>>35
They need 5 pounds per day because 35 / 7 = <<35/7=5>>5
#### 5

Response:
To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weekly food requirement for the flock**:
   Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for ten ducks, we multiply the weekly requirement per duck by the number of ducks:

   \[
   \text{Total weekly requirement} = \text{Number of ducks} \times \text{Weekly requirement per duck}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weekly requirement} = 10 \text{ ducks} \times 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck} = 35 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Convert the weekly requirement to a daily requirement**:
   There are 7 days in a week, so to find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we divide the total weekly requirement by the number of days in a week:

   \[
   \text{Daily requirement} = \frac{\text{Total weekly requirement}}{\text{Number of days in a week}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Daily requirement} = \frac{35 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Final Answer**:
   The flock of ten ducks needs **5 pounds of insects per day**.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{5} \text{ pounds/day}
\]
