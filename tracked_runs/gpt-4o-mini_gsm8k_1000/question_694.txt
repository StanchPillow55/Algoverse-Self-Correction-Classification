Question ID: 214

Question:
Jerry has two pools, both with leaks emptying them out at 4 gallons/minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?


Reference Answer:
First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons
Let b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16
Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8
#### 8

Response:
Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as \( S \) gallons. Therefore, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago would be \( 2S \) gallons, since it had twice as much water as the small pool.

Both pools have leaks that empty them at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. In 4 minutes, the total amount of water lost from each pool can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Water lost in 4 minutes} = 4 \text{ gallons/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ gallons}
\]

Now, let's calculate the current amounts of water in both pools:

1. **Current amount of water in the small pool:**
   \[
   \text{Current water in small pool} = S - 16
   \]

2. **Current amount of water in the big pool:**
   \[
   \text{Current water in big pool} = 2S - 16
   \]

According to the problem, now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
2S - 16 = 4(S - 16)
\]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Expand the right side:
   \[
   2S - 16 = 4S - 64
   \]

2. Rearranging the equation to isolate \( S \):
   \[
   2S - 4S = -64 + 16
   \]
   \[
   -2S = -48
   \]

3. Divide both sides by -2:
   \[
   S = 24
   \]

Now that we have \( S \), we can find the current amount of water in the small pool:

\[
\text{Current water in small pool} = S - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8 \text{ gallons}
\]

Thus, the small pool currently has **8 gallons** of water.

Finally, we can state the final answer:

\[
\text{The small pool has } \boxed{8} \text{ gallons of water now.}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, we will denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as \( S \) gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago as \( B \) gallons. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
   \[
   B = 2S
   \]

2. Both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Therefore, in 4 minutes, each pool loses water:
   - The small pool loses \( 4 \text{ gallons/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ gallons} \).
   - The big pool also loses \( 16 \text{ gallons} \).

Now, we can express the current amounts of water in both pools:

- The current amount of water in the small pool is:
  \[
  S_{\text{current}} = S - 16
  \]

- The current amount of water in the big pool is:
  \[
  B_{\text{current}} = B - 16
  \]

Substituting \( B = 2S \) into the equation for the big pool:
\[
B_{\text{current}} = 2S - 16
\]

According to the problem, now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[
B_{\text{current}} = 4S_{\text{current}}
\]

Substituting the expressions we derived for \( B_{\text{current}} \) and \( S_{\text{current}} \):
\[
2S - 16 = 4(S - 16)
\]

Now, we will simplify the right side:
\[
2S - 16 = 4S - 64
\]

Next, we will rearrange the equation to isolate \( S \):
\[
2S - 4S = -64 + 16
\]
\[
-2S = -48
\]
\[
S = 24
\]

Now that we have found \( S \), we can determine the current amount of water in the small pool:
\[
S_{\text{current}} = S - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8
\]

Thus, the small pool currently has \( 8 \) gallons of water.

Finally, we state the answer:
\[
\text{The small pool has } 8 \text{ gallons of water now.}
\]
