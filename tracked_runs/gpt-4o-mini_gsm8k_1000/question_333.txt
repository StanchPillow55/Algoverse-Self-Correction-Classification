Question ID: 1282

Question:
John invited 20 people to a birthday party.  Each guest will eat 2 hot dogs.  He already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party.  If a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, how much does he need to spend on hot dogs?


Reference Answer:
He needs 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 hot dogs
So he needs another 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 hot dogs
So he needs to buy 36/6=<<36/6=6>>6 packs of hotdogs
That means he needs to spend 6*2=$<<6*2=12>>12
#### 12

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of guests**: 
   John invited 20 people to the party.

2. **Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed**: 
   Each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
   \[
   \text{Total hot dogs needed} = \text{Number of guests} \times \text{Hot dogs per guest} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]

3. **Account for the hot dogs already available**: 
   John has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. We need to subtract these from the total needed:
   \[
   \text{Hot dogs to buy} = \text{Total hot dogs needed} - \text{Hot dogs available} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]

4. **Determine how many packs of hot dogs are needed**: 
   Each pack contains 6 hot dogs. To find out how many packs John needs to buy, we divide the number of hot dogs he needs by the number of hot dogs per pack:
   \[
   \text{Packs needed} = \frac{\text{Hot dogs to buy}}{\text{Hot dogs per pack}} = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ packs}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost**: 
   Each pack of hot dogs costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the packs needed is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Packs needed} \times \text{Cost per pack} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Finally, after completing all calculations and reasoning, we find that John needs to spend a total of **$12** on hot dogs.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
