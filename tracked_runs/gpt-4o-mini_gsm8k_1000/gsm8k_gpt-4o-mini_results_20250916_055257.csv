The problem states that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. Therefore, we can calculate Marcus's age as follows:
The problem also states that Marcus is half of Leo's age. We can express this relationship mathematically:
We already calculated Marcus's age to be 21, so we can set up the equation:
To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\text{Number of rows for red tulips} = \frac{\text{Total red tulips}}{\text{Red tulips per row}} = \frac{36}{6}
So, Jackson will plant **6 rows of red tulips**.

To solve the problem, we need to determine Jackie's height before she grew 3 inches over the summer. We will follow the information given step by step.
The problem states that Anne is twice the size of Albert. Therefore, we can calculate Anne's height as follows:
3. **Determine Jackie's height after summer**:
The problem states that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. Therefore, we can calculate Jackie's height after summer:
\text{Jackie's height after summer} = \text{Anne's height} - 2 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} - 2 \text{ inches} = 70 \text{ inches}

To find out how much each single bagel costs after Russell orders 4 packs of bagels with a discount, we can follow these steps:
1. **Calculate the total cost of the bagels before the discount**:
\text{Total cost before discount} = \text{Cost per pack} \times \text{Number of packs} = 10.00 \times 4 = 40.00
2. **Calculate the discount**:

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, given that Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day and his brother eats half that amount.
### Step 1: Determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day.
Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we can calculate the number of pretzels his brother eats in a day as follows:
\text{Brother's daily pretzel consumption} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Edgar's daily pretzel consumption}
Substituting Edgar's daily consumption:

To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total yield from both the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum these yields.

To solve the problem, we need to determine how high the bouncy ball goes on its second bounce after being dropped from a height.
### Step 1: Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony. Each story is 24 feet high, and since he is on the third floor, we can calculate the height as follows:
### Step 2: Calculate the height of the first bounce.
The ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, the height of the first bounce can be calculated as follows:

A rectangle has 2 short sides and Robert wants them to be 10 feet wide so 2*10= <<2*10=20>>20 feet wide
Together, he will need 30 feet and 20 feet of fencing so 30+20 = <<30+20=50>>50 feet of fencing
He needs 2 wooden slats per 1 foot of fencing and he is building 50 feet of fencing so he needs 50*2 = <<2*50=100>>100 wooden slats
#### 100",1,0.6,Confirmation,0.6,0.6,"Key reasoning steps:
To determine how many wooden slats Robert will need for his garden fence, we first need to calculate the total perimeter of the rectangular area that he is enclosing.
1. **Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden:**
According to the problem, Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing he builds. Since we have calculated the perimeter to be 50 feet, we can find the total number of slats needed by multiplying the perimeter by the number of slats per foot:
\text{Total slats} = \text{Perimeter} \times \text{Slats per foot} = 50 \text{ ft} \times 2 \text{ slats/ft} = 100 \text{ slats}
Therefore, the total number of wooden slats Robert will need for his fence is:

Faraday sells sunflowers for $2 each and earned $26 from selling sunflowers. To find out how many individual sunflowers he sold, we can use the formula:
\text{Number of sunflowers sold} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from sunflowers}}{\text{Price per sunflower}}
\text{Number of sunflowers sold} = \frac{26}{2} = 13

2. **Time Frame**: Jason has three weeks to break in the shoes. We need to convert this time frame into days. Since there are 7 days in a week, we calculate the total number of days in three weeks:
3. **Walking Days**: Jason can walk 4 days a week. To find out how many walking days he has in three weeks, we calculate:
4. **Daily Walking Time**: Now, we need to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day to accumulate a total of 240 minutes over the 12 walking days. We do this by dividing the total time required by the number of walking days:
