Question ID: 1211

Question:
For one medical dosage, Saanvi had to combine 14 mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. How many mL of medicine would be in 8 doses?


Reference Answer:
First medicine = <<14=14>>14 mL
Second medicine = 3 * 14 = <<3*14=42>>42 mL
One dose = 14 + 42 = <<14+42=56>>56 mL
Eight doses = 8 * 56 = <<8*56=448>>448 mL
Eight doses of Saanvi's medicine contained 448 mL of medicine.
#### 448

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the total volume of medicine Saanvi uses for one dosage and then calculate the total volume for 8 doses.

### Step 1: Determine the volume of the second medicine

Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. 

First, we calculate the amount of the second medicine:

\[
\text{Amount of second medicine} = 3 \times \text{Amount of first medicine}
\]
\[
\text{Amount of second medicine} = 3 \times 14 \, \text{mL} = 42 \, \text{mL}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total volume of medicine for one dosage

Now, we add the volumes of both medicines to find the total volume for one dosage:

\[
\text{Total volume for one dosage} = \text{Amount of first medicine} + \text{Amount of second medicine}
\]
\[
\text{Total volume for one dosage} = 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total volume for 8 doses

Now that we know the total volume for one dosage, we can find the total volume for 8 doses:

\[
\text{Total volume for 8 doses} = 8 \times \text{Total volume for one dosage}
\]
\[
\text{Total volume for 8 doses} = 8 \times 56 \, \text{mL}
\]
\[
\text{Total volume for 8 doses} = 448 \, \text{mL}
\]

### Final Answer

The total volume of medicine in 8 doses is:

\[
\boxed{448 \, \text{mL}}
\]
