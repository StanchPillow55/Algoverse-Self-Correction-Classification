Question ID: 977

Question:
Pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside.  Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles.  While on vacation, if she will be outside 4 hours a day over 8 days, how many bottles of sunscreen will she need to pack?


Reference Answer:
She will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days so that's 4*8 = <<4*8=32>>32 hours
She applies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour and she'll be outside for 32 hours so she needs 1*32 = <<1*32=32>>32 ounces of sunscreen
Her bottle holds 8 ounces of sunscreen and she needs 32 ounces so she will need to pack 32/8 = 4 bottles of sunscreen

Response:
To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need to pack for her vacation, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen needed per day**:
   Pamela applies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour. If she is outside for 4 hours a day, the total amount of sunscreen she uses in one day is:
   \[
   \text{Sunscreen per day} = \text{hours outside} \times \text{sunscreen per hour} = 4 \text{ hours} \times 1 \text{ ounce/hour} = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen needed for the entire vacation**:
   Pamela will be outside for 4 hours a day over 8 days. Therefore, the total amount of sunscreen she will need for the entire vacation is:
   \[
   \text{Total sunscreen} = \text{sunscreen per day} \times \text{number of days} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Determine how many bottles of sunscreen are needed**:
   Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles Pamela needs, we divide the total amount of sunscreen required by the amount in each bottle:
   \[
   \text{Number of bottles} = \frac{\text{Total sunscreen}}{\text{ounces per bottle}} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, Pamela will need to pack **4 bottles of sunscreen** for her vacation.

Final Answer: **4 bottles**
