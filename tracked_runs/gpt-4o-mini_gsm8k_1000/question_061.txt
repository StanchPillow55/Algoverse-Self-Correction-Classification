Question ID: 975

Question:
Richard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 60 cherries. If Robert has 30 cherries, and has 10 more than Richard, how many more cherries does Robert have than Jerry?


Reference Answer:
Since Robert has 30, then 60 - 30 = <<30=30>>30 cherries are left to be shared by Richard and Jerry.
Richard has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 cherries since Robert has 10 more cherries than him.
Jerry has 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 cherries.
So Robert has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 more cherries than Jerry.
#### 20

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cherries Richard and Jerry have based on the information given about Robert.

1. **Understanding the problem**:
   - Total cherries = 60
   - Robert has 30 cherries.
   - Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.

2. **Finding Richard's cherries**:
   Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   R = R_{Robert} - 10
   \]
   where \( R_{Robert} = 30 \) (the number of cherries Robert has).
   Substituting the value of \( R_{Robert} \):
   \[
   R = 30 - 10 = 20
   \]
   So, Richard has 20 cherries.

3. **Finding Jerry's cherries**:
   Now we can find out how many cherries Jerry has. We know the total number of cherries shared among Richard, Jerry, and Robert is 60. We can express this as:
   \[
   R + J + R_{Robert} = 60
   \]
   where \( J \) is the number of cherries Jerry has. Substituting the known values:
   \[
   20 + J + 30 = 60
   \]
   Simplifying this equation:
   \[
   50 + J = 60
   \]
   To find \( J \), we subtract 50 from both sides:
   \[
   J = 60 - 50 = 10
   \]
   So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

4. **Finding how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry**:
   Now we need to find how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:
   \[
   R_{Robert} - J = 30 - 10 = 20
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]
