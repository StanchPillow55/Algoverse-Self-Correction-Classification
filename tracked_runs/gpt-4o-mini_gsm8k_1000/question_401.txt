Response:
To determine how many punches Joe throws during a fight, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the duration of the fight in minutes**:
   - The fight lasts for 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the total duration of the fight is:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Number of rounds} \times \text{Duration of each round} = 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of punches thrown**:
   - Joe throws an average of 25 punches per minute.
   - To find the total number of punches thrown during the entire fight, we multiply the number of punches per minute by the total duration of the fight:
     \[
     \text{Total punches} = \text{Punches per minute} \times \text{Total time} = 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Perform the multiplication**:
   \[
   \text{Total punches} = 25 \times 15 = 375
   \]

Thus, Joe throws a total of **375 punches** during the fight.

**Final Answer**: Joe threw 375 punches.
