Question ID: 501

Question:
Mariah’s grandma was teaching her to knit. Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. There are 364 yards in a skein of yarn. How many yards of yarn did they use altogether?


Reference Answer:
Mariah’s grandma used 1/2 a skein of yarn. We should multiply this by (2/2) to have a common denominator, so 1/2 * 2/2 = 2/4.
Now that there are common denominators, we can add the 1/4 skein of yarn Mariah used + 2/4 skein of yarn her grandma used = 3/4 of a skein of yarn.
3/4 of a skein of yarn * 364 yards = 364 / 4 = <<3/4*364=273>>273 yards.

Response:
To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used in yards and then add those amounts together.

1. **Determine the amount of yarn Mariah used:**
   - Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.
   - Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used as follows:
   \[
   \text{Yards used by Mariah} = \frac{1}{4} \times 364
   \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of yarn Grandma used:**
   - Grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn.
   - We calculate the amount of yarn Grandma used:
   \[
   \text{Yards used by Grandma} = \frac{1}{2} \times 364
   \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182 \text{ yards}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of yarn used:**
   - Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma:
   \[
   \text{Total yards used} = \text{Yards used by Mariah} + \text{Yards used by Grandma}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total yards used} = 91 + 182
   \]
   - Performing the addition:
   \[
   91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total amount of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma is \( \boxed{273} \) yards.
