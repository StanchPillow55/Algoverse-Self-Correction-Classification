Question ID: 1148

Question:
Chatty prepared three dozen eggs for her four children's Easter activity. Assuming each child gets the same number of eggs, how many eggs does each child receive?


Reference Answer:
Chatty prepared 3 dozen x 12 eggs/dozen = <<3*12=36>>36 eggs.
Since all four children receive the same number of eggs, each child gets 36 eggs / 4 children = <<36/4=9>>9 eggs/child
#### 9

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many eggs each of Chatty's four children will receive when she has prepared three dozen eggs.

1. **Understanding the quantity of eggs**: 
   - One dozen equals 12 eggs. 
   - Therefore, three dozen eggs can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs}
     \]

2. **Dividing the eggs among the children**:
   - Chatty has 4 children, and we need to divide the total number of eggs (36) equally among them.
   - To find out how many eggs each child receives, we perform the division:
     \[
     \text{Number of eggs per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of eggs}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{36}{4}
     \]

3. **Calculating the division**:
   - Now we calculate \( \frac{36}{4} \):
     \[
     \frac{36}{4} = 9
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Each child receives 9 eggs.

Thus, the final answer is that each child receives **9 eggs**.
