Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of Pomeranians**:
   Jana has a total of 27 puppies. According to the problem, two thirds of these puppies are Pomeranians.

   To find the number of Pomeranians, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of Pomeranians} = \frac{2}{3} \times 27
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 27 = \frac{2 \times 27}{3} = \frac{54}{3} = 18
   \]
   So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

2. **Determine the number of girl Pomeranians**:
   Next, we know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls. We need to calculate how many of the 18 Pomeranians are girls.

   To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of girl Pomeranians} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = \frac{18}{3} = 6
   \]
   Thus, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

3. **Final answer**:
   After completing the calculations, we find that the number of girl Pomeranians that Jana has is:
   \[
   \boxed{6}
   \]
