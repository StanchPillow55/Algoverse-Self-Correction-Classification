Question ID: 512

Question:
Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. If her gym teacher tells her to run 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km, how many milliliters of water will Hannah need to drink?


Reference Answer:
First find the total number of kilometers Hannah runs: 8 laps * .25 km/lap = <<8*.25=2>>2 km
Then multiply the number of kilometers she runs by the amount of water she needs per kilometer to find the total amount of water she needs: 60 ml/km * 2 km = <<60*2=120>>120 ml
#### 120

Response:
To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Hannah will run**: 
   - Each lap is 0.25 km.
   - Hannah is required to run 8 laps.
   - Therefore, the total distance in kilometers is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Number of laps} \times \text{Distance per lap}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 8 \, \text{laps} \times 0.25 \, \text{km/lap} = 2 \, \text{km}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of water needed**:
   - Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs.
   - Now we can calculate the total amount of water she needs for the total distance she will run:

   \[
   \text{Total water needed} = \text{Total distance} \times \text{Water per kilometer}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total water needed} = 2 \, \text{km} \times 60 \, \text{ml/km} = 120 \, \text{ml}
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is:

   \[
   \boxed{120 \, \text{ml}}
   \] 

This means Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water after running 8 laps of 0.25 km each.

Response:
To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we can break the problem down into several steps.

1. **Calculate the total distance Hannah will run**:
   - Each lap is 0.25 km.
   - Hannah is required to run 8 laps.
   - To find the total distance, we multiply the number of laps by the distance of each lap:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \text{Number of laps} \times \text{Distance per lap} = 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = 2 \text{ km}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of water needed for the total distance**:
   - Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs.
   - Since we calculated that she will run a total of 2 km, we can find the total amount of water needed by multiplying the distance by the amount of water per kilometer:
     \[
     \text{Total water needed} = \text{Total distance} \times \text{Water per km} = 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total water needed} = 120 \text{ ml}
     \]

3. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Hannah will need to drink **120 ml** of water for her run.

In conclusion, after calculating the total distance she will run and the corresponding amount of water needed, we find that Hannah needs to drink **120 ml** of water.
