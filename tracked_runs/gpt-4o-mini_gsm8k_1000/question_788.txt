Question ID: 864

Question:
George, a grade six teacher, ordered 600 burritos for the sixth-grade class picnic. If there were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given ten burritos, with Mr. George eating 20 of them, calculate the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic?


Reference Answer:
The total number of burritos eaten by the students is 50*10 = <<50*10=500>>500
If Mr George also ate 20, the total number of burritos eaten at the picnic is 500+20 = <<500+20=520>>520
There were 600-520 = <<600-520=80>>80 leftover burritos.
#### 80

Response:
To find the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.**
   - There are 50 students at the picnic.
   - Each student is given 10 burritos.
   - Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is:
     \[
     \text{Total burritos consumed by students} = \text{Number of students} \times \text{Burritos per student} = 50 \times 10 = 500
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by Mr. George.**
   - Mr. George eats 20 burritos.
   - Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by Mr. George is:
     \[
     \text{Total burritos consumed by Mr. George} = 20
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed at the picnic.**
   - To find the total number of burritos consumed, we add the burritos consumed by the students and the burritos consumed by Mr. George:
     \[
     \text{Total burritos consumed} = \text{Total burritos consumed by students} + \text{Total burritos consumed by Mr. George} = 500 + 20 = 520
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of leftover burritos.**
   - George ordered a total of 600 burritos for the picnic.
   - To find the number of leftover burritos, we subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered:
     \[
     \text{Total leftover burritos} = \text{Total burritos ordered} - \text{Total burritos consumed} = 600 - 520 = 80
     \]

Thus, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:

\[
\boxed{80}
\]
