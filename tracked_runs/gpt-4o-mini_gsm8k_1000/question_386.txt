Question ID: 1210

Question:
To kick off summer, Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends.  They fill up 10 packs of balloons that have 30 balloons per pack.  By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left.  How many balloons did they throw?


Reference Answer:
They started off with 10 packs of balloons that had 30 balloons each for a total of 10*30 = <<10*30=300>>300 balloons
They started with 300 balloons and had 12 left which means they threw 300-12 = <<300-12=288>>288 balloons
#### 288

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many balloons were thrown during the water balloon fight. We will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of balloons filled.**
   Jolene filled up 10 packs of balloons, with each pack containing 30 balloons. Therefore, the total number of balloons can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total balloons} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Balloons per pack}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total balloons} = 10 \times 30 = 300
   \]

2. **Determine how many balloons were left at the end.**
   According to the problem, there were 12 balloons left after the water balloon fight.

3. **Calculate the number of balloons thrown.**
   To find out how many balloons were thrown, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons filled:

   \[
   \text{Balloons thrown} = \text{Total balloons} - \text{Balloons left}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Balloons thrown} = 300 - 12 = 288
   \]

Thus, the total number of balloons that were thrown during the water balloon fight is:

\[
\boxed{288}
\]
