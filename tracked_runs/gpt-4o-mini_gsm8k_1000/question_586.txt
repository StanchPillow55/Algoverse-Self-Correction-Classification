Question ID: 1048

Question:
Ben bought a car for $20000 in 2007. The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. Find the price of the car in the year 2010.


Reference Answer:
The price of the car depreciates of 20000 * 21% = $<<20000*21*.01=4200>>4200 per year.
Ben had the car for 2010 - 2007 = <<2010-2007=3>>3 years.
The price of the car depreciates 4200 * 3 = $<<4200*3=12600>>12600 from 2007 to 2010.
So the price of the car in the year 2010 is $20000 - $12600 = $<<20000-12600=7400>>7400.

Response:
To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car's value over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

### Step 1: Understand the depreciation formula

The value of the car after each year can be calculated using the formula for exponential decay:

\[
V = P \times (1 - r)^t
\]

Where:
- \( V \) is the value of the car after \( t \) years.
- \( P \) is the initial price of the car.
- \( r \) is the depreciation rate (as a decimal).
- \( t \) is the number of years since the purchase.

### Step 2: Identify the variables

From the problem:
- \( P = 20000 \) (the initial price of the car)
- \( r = 0.21 \) (the depreciation rate of 21%)
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) (the number of years from 2007 to 2010)

### Step 3: Substitute the values into the formula

Now we can substitute the values into the formula:

\[
V = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( (1 - 0.21) \)

First, calculate \( 1 - 0.21 \):

\[
1 - 0.21 = 0.79
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( (0.79)^3 \)

Next, we need to calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):

\[
(0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79
\]

Calculating step by step:

1. \( 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.6241 \)
2. \( 0.6241 \times 0.79 = 0.492039 \)

So, \( (0.79)^3 \approx 0.492039 \).

### Step 6: Calculate the value of the car

Now substitute this back into the equation for \( V \):

\[
V = 20000 \times 0.492039
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
V \approx 20000 \times 0.492039 \approx 9840.78
\]

### Final Answer

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately **$9840.78**.

Response:
To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car's value over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

### Step 1: Understand the Depreciation Formula
The formula for the value of an asset after depreciation is given by:

\[
V = P(1 - r)^t
\]

Where:
- \( V \) is the value of the asset after \( t \) years.
- \( P \) is the initial purchase price of the asset.
- \( r \) is the rate of depreciation (as a decimal).
- \( t \) is the number of years.

### Step 2: Identify the Variables
From the problem:
- \( P = 20000 \) (the initial price of the car)
- \( r = 0.21 \) (the depreciation rate of 21%)
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) (the number of years from 2007 to 2010)

### Step 3: Substitute the Values into the Formula
Now we can substitute the values into the formula:

\[
V = 20000(1 - 0.21)^3
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( (1 - 0.21) \)
First, calculate \( 1 - 0.21 \):

\[
1 - 0.21 = 0.79
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( (0.79)^3 \)
Next, we need to calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):

\[
(0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79
\]

Calculating step by step:

1. \( 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.6241 \)
2. \( 0.6241 \times 0.79 = 0.492039 \)

Thus, \( (0.79)^3 \approx 0.492039 \).

### Step 6: Calculate the Value of the Car
Now we can find the value of the car:

\[
V = 20000 \times 0.492039
\]

Calculating this:

\[
V \approx 20000 \times 0.492039 \approx 9840.78
\]

### Final Answer
The price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately **$9840.78**.

Response:
To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car's value over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

### Step 1: Understand the depreciation formula

The value of the car after each year can be calculated using the formula for exponential decay:

\[
V = P(1 - r)^t
\]

Where:
- \( V \) is the value of the car after \( t \) years.
- \( P \) is the initial price of the car.
- \( r \) is the depreciation rate (as a decimal).
- \( t \) is the number of years.

### Step 2: Identify the values

From the problem:
- Initial price \( P = 20000 \)
- Depreciation rate \( r = 21\% = 0.21 \)
- Time period \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years

### Step 3: Plug the values into the formula

Now we can substitute the values into the formula:

\[
V = 20000(1 - 0.21)^3
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( (1 - 0.21) \)

First, calculate \( 1 - 0.21 \):

\[
1 - 0.21 = 0.79
\]

### Step 5: Raise \( 0.79 \) to the power of 3

Now we calculate \( 0.79^3 \):

\[
0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79
\]

Calculating step-by-step:

1. \( 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.6241 \)
2. \( 0.6241 \times 0.79 \approx 0.492039 \)

So, \( 0.79^3 \approx 0.492039 \).

### Step 6: Multiply by the initial price

Now we multiply this result by the initial price of the car:

\[
V \approx 20000 \times 0.492039
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
V \approx 9840.78
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately **$9840.78**.
