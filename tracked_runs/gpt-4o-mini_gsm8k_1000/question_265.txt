Question ID: 273

Question:
Terri is knitting a sweater with two sleeves, a collar, and a decorative rosette. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete, the collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, and the rosette takes twice as many as the collar. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. How many stitches does each sleeve take?


Reference Answer:
The collar takes 900 / 10 = <<900/10=90>>90 stitches.
The rosette takes 2 * 90 = <<2*90=180>>180 stitches.
The body, collar, and rosette together take 900 + 90 + 180 = <<900+90+180=1170>>1170 stitches.
Thus, the sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = <<1800-1170=630>>630 stitches.
Thus, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = <<630/2=315>>315 stitches.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to break down the components of the sweater and their respective stitch counts.

1. **Body of the Sweater**: 
   - The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.

2. **Collar**: 
   - The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches of the body.
   - Calculation for the collar:
     \[
     \text{Stitches for collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches}
     \]

3. **Rosette**: 
   - The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   - Calculation for the rosette:
     \[
     \text{Stitches for rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches}
     \]

4. **Total Stitches for the Sweater**: 
   - The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is given as 1800 stitches. 
   - We can now calculate the total stitches used so far:
     \[
     \text{Total stitches used} = \text{Body} + \text{Collar} + \text{Rosette}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total stitches used} = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \text{ stitches}
     \]

5. **Remaining Stitches for the Sleeves**: 
   - To find out how many stitches are left for the sleeves, we subtract the total stitches used from the total stitches for the sweater:
     \[
     \text{Remaining stitches} = 1800 - 1170 = 630 \text{ stitches}
     \]

6. **Sleeves**: 
   - There are two sleeves, and we need to find out how many stitches each sleeve takes. Let \( x \) be the number of stitches for each sleeve. Since there are two sleeves, we have:
     \[
     2x = 630
     \]
   - To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     x = \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches}
     \]

Thus, each sleeve takes **315 stitches**.

### Final Answer:
Each sleeve takes **315 stitches**.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to break down the components of the sweater and their respective stitch counts.

1. **Body of the Sweater**: 
   - The body takes 900 stitches.

2. **Collar**: 
   - The collar takes a tenth of the body stitches. 
   - Therefore, the number of stitches for the collar is:
     \[
     \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches}
     \]

3. **Rosette**: 
   - The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. 
   - Thus, the number of stitches for the rosette is:
     \[
     \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches}
     \]

4. **Total Stitches for the Sweater**: 
   - The total number of stitches for the entire sweater is given as 1800 stitches. 
   - We can now calculate the total stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
     \[
     \text{Total stitches for body, collar, and rosette} = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \text{ stitches}
     \]

5. **Stitches for the Sleeves**: 
   - Let \( S \) be the number of stitches for each sleeve. Since there are two sleeves, the total stitches for the sleeves would be \( 2S \).
   - We know that the total stitches for the whole sweater is 1800, so we can set up the equation:
     \[
     1170 + 2S = 1800
     \]

6. **Solving for \( S \)**:
   - First, we subtract 1170 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2S = 1800 - 1170
     \]
     \[
     2S = 630
     \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 2 to find \( S \):
     \[
     S = \frac{630}{2} = 315
     \]

Thus, each sleeve takes **315 stitches**.

### Final Answer:
Each sleeve takes 315 stitches.
