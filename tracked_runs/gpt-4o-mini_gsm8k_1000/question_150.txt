Question:
In a student council election, candidate A got 20% of the votes while candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. The rest of the votes was given to candidate C. If there were 100 voters, how many votes did candidate C get?


Reference Answer:
Candidate A got 100 x 20/100 = <<100*20/100=20>>20 votes.
Candidate B got 20 x 50/100 = <<20*50/100=10>>10 more votes than candidate A.
Thus, candidate B got 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 votes.
Candidate A and B have 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 votes together.
Therefore, candidate C got 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50 votes.
#### 50

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many votes each candidate received and then find out how many votes candidate C received.

1. **Determine the total number of votes**: 
   We know there are 100 voters in total.

2. **Calculate the votes for candidate A**: 
   Candidate A received 20% of the total votes. 
   \[
   \text{Votes for A} = 20\% \times 100 = \frac{20}{100} \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the votes for candidate B**: 
   Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. First, we need to calculate 50% of candidate A's votes.
   \[
   50\% \text{ of A's votes} = 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ votes}
   \]
   Now, we add this to candidate A's votes to find candidate B's total votes.
   \[
   \text{Votes for B} = \text{Votes for A} + 50\% \text{ of A's votes} = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the votes for candidate C**: 
   To find the number of votes candidate C received, we subtract the votes of candidates A and B from the total number of votes.
   \[
   \text{Votes for C} = \text{Total votes} - (\text{Votes for A} + \text{Votes for B})
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \text{Votes for C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes}
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Candidate C received 50 votes.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]
