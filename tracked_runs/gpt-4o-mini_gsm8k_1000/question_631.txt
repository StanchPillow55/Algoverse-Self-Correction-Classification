Question ID: 167

Question:
Seth is twice as old as Brooke. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. How old is Seth?


Reference Answer:
To solve this problem, we can set up an equation where x represents Brooke’s age and 2x represents Seth’s age and noting that in two years, the sum of their ages is (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28.
Then we add all the values together, 3x + 4 = 28.
And we subtract 4 from each side, 3x +4 - 4 = 28 – 4.
Then we divide each side by 3x/3 = 24/3.
We find that x = <<8=8>>8, or Brooke’s age is 8.
Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth is 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.

Response:
Let's define the ages of Seth and Brooke using variables.

Let:
- \( S \) be Seth's current age.
- \( B \) be Brooke's current age.

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke:
   \[
   S = 2B
   \]

2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28:
   \[
   (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
   \]

Now, let's simplify the second equation:
\[
S + 2 + B + 2 = 28
\]
\[
S + B + 4 = 28
\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides gives:
\[
S + B = 24
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation. Replace \( S \) in the second equation with \( 2B \):
\[
2B + B = 24
\]
Combining like terms gives:
\[
3B = 24
\]
Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( B \):
\[
B = 8
\]

Now that we have Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
\[
S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

Thus, Seth's current age is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]

To verify, let's check both conditions:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (True)
2. In 2 years, their ages will be \( 16 + 2 = 18 \) and \( 8 + 2 = 10 \). The sum is \( 18 + 10 = 28 \) (True)

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming that Seth is indeed \( \boxed{16} \) years old.
