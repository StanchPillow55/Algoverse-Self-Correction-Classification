Question ID: 1120

Question:
John visits his parents twice a month.  It takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph.  Considering the round trip, how many miles a month does he drive when visiting his parents?


Reference Answer:
His parents live 70*2=<<70*2=140>>140 miles away
So he drives 140*2=<<140*2=280>>280 miles a round trip
280*2 = <<280*2=560>>560 miles a month
#### 560

Response:
To determine how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the distance to his parents' house**: 
   We know that John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 miles per hour (mph). We can use the formula for distance, which is:

   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

   So, the distance to his parents' house is 140 miles.

2. **Calculate the round trip distance**: 
   Since John makes a round trip (to his parents' house and back), we need to double the one-way distance:

   \[
   \text{Round Trip Distance} = 2 \times 140 \, \text{miles} = 280 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance for the month**: 
   John visits his parents twice a month. Therefore, we multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits:

   \[
   \text{Total Monthly Distance} = 2 \times 280 \, \text{miles} = 560 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Thus, the total distance John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:

\[
\boxed{560} \, \text{miles}
\]
