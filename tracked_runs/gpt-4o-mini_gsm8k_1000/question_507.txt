Question ID: 541

Question:
Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125. In April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half in order to hit his target. How much does he have to save for each day in the second half of the month?


Reference Answer:
Let the amount he has to save for each day of the second half of April be y
Since y is twice as much what he saved in each day of the first half, he saved y/2 in each day of the first half
April has 30 days, 15 days in each half, so he is saving (15*(y/2)) in the 1st half, (15*y) in the 2nd half to give (15*(y/2))+(15*y)=$1125
Solving the equation gives 15(3y/2) = $1125
45y/2 = $1125
y = $1125*(2/45)
y = $<<50=50>>50

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Elvis saves each day in the first half of April and how that relates to his savings in the second half of the month.

1. **Understanding the Month**: April has 30 days. The first half consists of the first 15 days (April 1 to April 15), and the second half consists of the last 15 days (April 16 to April 30).

2. **Setting Up the Savings Equation**:
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month.
   - In the first half (15 days), his total savings will be:
     \[
     \text{Savings in first half} = 15x
     \]
   - In the second half, he saves twice as much each day as he does in the first half. Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half.
   - His total savings in the second half (15 days) will be:
     \[
     \text{Savings in second half} = 15(2x) = 30x
     \]

3. **Total Savings Calculation**:
   - The total savings for the entire month is the sum of the savings from both halves:
     \[
     \text{Total Savings} = \text{Savings in first half} + \text{Savings in second half} = 15x + 30x = 45x
     \]

4. **Setting the Total Savings Equal to the Target**:
   - Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we set up the equation:
     \[
     45x = 1125
     \]

5. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:
     \[
     x = \frac{1125}{45}
     \]
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     x = 25
     \]

6. **Calculating the Daily Savings for the Second Half**:
   - Since \( x = 25 \), the amount he saves each day in the second half is:
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 25 = 50
     \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Elvis has to save **$50** each day in the second half of the month.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]
