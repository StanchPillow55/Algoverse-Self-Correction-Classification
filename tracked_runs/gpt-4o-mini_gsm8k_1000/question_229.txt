Question ID: 1144

Question:
The ratio of men to women on a bus is 5:9. If the total number of passengers on the bus is 84, and 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, how many women have remained on the bus?


Reference Answer:
The total ratio representing the number of women on the bus is 5+9=<<5+9=14>>14
The fraction from the ratio representing the number of women is 9/14, and since the total number of passengers representing the full ratio is 84, there are 9/14*84=<<9/14*84=54>>54 women on the bus.
If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus becomes 54-20=<<54-20=34>>34

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the ratio of men to women**: The ratio of men to women on the bus is given as 5:9. This means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women.

2. **Set up the ratio in terms of a variable**: Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

3. **Calculate the total number of passengers**: The total number of passengers on the bus is the sum of men and women:
   \[
   5x + 9x = 14x
   \]
   We know that the total number of passengers is 84, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   14x = 84
   \]

4. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   \[
   x = \frac{84}{14} = 6
   \]

5. **Find the number of men and women**:
   - Number of men:
   \[
   5x = 5 \times 6 = 30
   \]
   - Number of women:
   \[
   9x = 9 \times 6 = 54
   \]

6. **Determine how many women alight from the bus**: According to the problem, 20 women alight from the bus.

7. **Calculate the remaining number of women**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining women} = \text{Initial number of women} - \text{Number of women alighting}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining women} = 54 - 20 = 34
   \]

8. **Final answer**: The number of women remaining on the bus after 20 women alight is \(34\).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{34}
\]
