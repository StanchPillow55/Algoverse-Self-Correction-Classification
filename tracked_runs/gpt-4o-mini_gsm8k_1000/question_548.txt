A man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. How many sandwiches does this family eat in one week?

Response:
To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to first calculate the total number of sandwiches consumed by each family member in one day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

1. **Calculate the daily consumption for each family member:**
   - The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
   - The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
   - The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

2. **Add the daily consumption of all family members:**
   \[
   \text{Total daily sandwiches} = \text{sandwiches by man} + \text{sandwiches by wife} + \text{sandwiches by son}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total daily sandwiches} = 5 + 4 + 2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total daily sandwiches} = 11
   \]

3. **Calculate the total sandwiches consumed in one week:**
   Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total daily sandwiches by 7:
   \[
   \text{Total weekly sandwiches} = \text{Total daily sandwiches} \times 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weekly sandwiches} = 11 \times 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weekly sandwiches} = 77
   \]

Thus, the family eats a total of **77 sandwiches** in one week.

Final answer: **77 sandwiches**.
