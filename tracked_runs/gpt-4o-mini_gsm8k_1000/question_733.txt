Response:
To find out how many matches Joey played in one week, we will break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Matches played on Monday**: 
   - Joey played 2 matches on Monday.

2. **Matches played on Friday**: 
   - Joey played 1 match on Friday.

3. **Matches played on Saturday**: 
   - The problem states that on Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, we can calculate the matches played on Saturday as follows:
   \[
   \text{Matches on Saturday} = 2 \times \text{Matches on Monday} = 2 \times 2 = 4
   \]

4. **Total matches played in the week**: 
   - Now we will add up all the matches Joey played during the week:
   \[
   \text{Total matches} = \text{Matches on Monday} + \text{Matches on Friday} + \text{Matches on Saturday}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total matches} = 2 + 1 + 4
   \]

5. **Calculating the total**:
   \[
   \text{Total matches} = 2 + 1 + 4 = 7
   \]

Thus, Joey played a total of **7 matches** in one week.

Final answer: **7 matches**.
