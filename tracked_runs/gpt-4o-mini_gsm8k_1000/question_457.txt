Response:
To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket for the Fast and the Furious movies, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of tickets Deepa purchased**:
   - Deepa has seen each of the 9 Fast and the Furious movies 3 times.
   - Therefore, the total number of tickets she purchased can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total tickets} = \text{Number of movies} \times \text{Number of times seen}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total tickets} = 9 \times 3 = 27
     \]

2. **Calculate the average price per ticket**:
   - We know that Deepa spent a total of $216 on these tickets.
   - To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets purchased:
     \[
     \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Total tickets}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27}
     \]

3. **Perform the division**:
   - Now we calculate \( \frac{216}{27} \):
     \[
     216 \div 27 = 8
     \]

Thus, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is **$8**.

Final answer: **$8**
