Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of days Andrew will spend traveling to Rochester by bus and returning by car.

1. **Traveling to Rochester by Bus:**
   - According to the problem, it takes Andrew 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus.

2. **Traveling back from Rochester by Car:**
   - The problem states that it takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus. Since it takes 6 days by bus, we calculate the time taken by car as follows:
     \[
     \text{Days by car} = \frac{6 \text{ days}}{2} = 3 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Total Travel Time:**
   - To find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we add the days spent traveling to Rochester by bus and the days spent returning by car:
     \[
     \text{Total days} = \text{Days by bus} + \text{Days by car} = 6 \text{ days} + 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ days}
     \]

Thus, the total number of days Andrew will travel is \( \boxed{9} \).
