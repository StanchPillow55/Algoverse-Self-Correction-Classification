Question ID: 195

Question:
A pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. How much will 8 pens cost?


Reference Answer:
A pen costs $1.20 + $0.30 = $<<1.20+0.30=1.50>>1.50.
So, 8 pens cost $1.50 x 8 = $<<8*1.5=12>>12.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of one pen based on the information provided about the costs of a pencil and an eraser.

1. **Identify the costs of the pencil and eraser:**
   - The cost of a pencil is \( \$1.20 \).
   - The cost of an eraser is \( \$0.30 \).

2. **Calculate the combined cost of the pencil and eraser:**
   \[
   \text{Combined cost} = \text{Cost of pencil} + \text{Cost of eraser}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Combined cost} = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
   \]

3. **Determine the cost of one pen:**
   According to the problem, the cost of a pen is equal to the combined cost of the pencil and eraser. Therefore, the cost of one pen is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of one pen} = 1.50
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of 8 pens:**
   To find the total cost for 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \text{Cost of one pen} \times 8
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 1.50 \times 8
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 12.00
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   The total cost for 8 pens is \( \$12.00 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12.00}
\]
