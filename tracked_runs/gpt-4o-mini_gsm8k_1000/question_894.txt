Question ID: 326

Question:
Some people got on a bus at the terminal. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. Then at the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. If there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop, how many people got on the bus at the terminal?


Reference Answer:
There were 20 - 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 people on the bus before 8 people got in at the second stop.
There were a total of 12 + 7 =<<12+7=19>>19 people at the second stop before 7 people went down.
So, 19 - 5 = <<19-5=14>>14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

Response:
Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. **Initial Count**: At the terminal, there are \( x \) people on the bus.

2. **First Bus Stop**: At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. Therefore, the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
   \[
   x + 5
   \]

3. **Second Bus Stop**: At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. We need to account for both of these changes:
   - First, 7 people get off, so we subtract 7 from the current total:
     \[
     (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2
     \]
   - Then, 8 people get on, so we add 8 to the current total:
     \[
     (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6
     \]

4. **Total at the Third Stop**: We know that there are a total of 20 people heading to the third stop. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]

5. **Solving for \( x \)**: To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x = 20 - 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 14
   \]

Thus, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( \boxed{14} \).
