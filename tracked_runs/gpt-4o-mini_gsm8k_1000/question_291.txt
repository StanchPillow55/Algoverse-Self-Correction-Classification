Question ID: 679

Question:
If 6 potatoes makes 36 hash browns, how many hash browns can you make out of 96 potatoes?


Reference Answer:
First find the number of hash browns per potato: 36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = <<36/6=6>>6 hash browns/potato
Then multiply that number by the number of potatoes to find the total number of hash browns: 6 hash browns/potato * 96 potatoes = <<6*96=576>>576 hash browns
#### 576

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, given that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns.

**Step 1: Determine the number of hash browns per potato.**

First, we find out how many hash browns can be made from one potato. We know that:

- 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

To find the number of hash browns per potato, we divide the total number of hash browns by the number of potatoes:

\[
\text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of hash browns from 96 potatoes.**

Now that we know each potato produces 6 hash browns, we can calculate the total number of hash browns from 96 potatoes:

\[
\text{Total hash browns} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total hash browns} = 96 \times 6 = 576
\]

**Final Answer:**

Therefore, from 96 potatoes, you can make **576 hash browns**.
