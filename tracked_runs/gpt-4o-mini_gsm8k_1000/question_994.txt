Question:
For his 30th birthday, Elvira chose a new computer with many accessories as a gift. She has a budget of €1500 donated by her whole family and thinks that she will be able to keep a little money to afford a garment. She goes to a computer store and chooses a machine that costs €1090 with a screen, keyboard and mouse. She also takes a scanner for €157, a CD burner worth €74 and a printer for €102. How much money will she have left for her clothing?


Reference Answer:
First, let’s look at the total cost of computer equipment: 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = <<1090+157+74+102=1423>>1423 euros
Let us now calculate what is left for the garment: 1500 - 1423 = <<1500-1423=77>>77 euros

Response:
To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing after purchasing her computer and accessories, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total budget**: Elvira has a total budget of €1500.

2. **List the costs of the items she wants to buy**:
   - Computer: €1090
   - Scanner: €157
   - CD burner: €74
   - Printer: €102

3. **Calculate the total cost of all items**:
   We will add the costs of the computer, scanner, CD burner, and printer together.

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of computer} + \text{Cost of scanner} + \text{Cost of CD burner} + \text{Cost of printer}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102
   \]

   Now, we will perform the addition step-by-step:

   - First, add the cost of the computer and the scanner:
     \[
     1090 + 157 = 1247
     \]

   - Next, add the cost of the CD burner:
     \[
     1247 + 74 = 1321
     \]

   - Finally, add the cost of the printer:
     \[
     1321 + 102 = 1423
     \]

   Thus, the total cost of all items is €1423.

4. **Calculate the remaining budget for clothing**:
   To find out how much money Elvira has left for clothing, we subtract the total cost of the items from her total budget.

   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = \text{Total budget} - \text{Total cost}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 1500 - 1423
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   1500 - 1423 = 77
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing after purchasing the computer and accessories.

Thus, the final answer is:

**€77**
