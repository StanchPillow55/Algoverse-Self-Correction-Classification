Response:
To find the total number of children participating in the mass drills, we can break the problem down into manageable steps.

1. **Determine the number of children in one row:**
   Each row consists of 8 children.

2. **Determine the number of rows per school:**
   There are 7 rows for each school.

3. **Calculate the total number of children in one school:**
   To find the total number of children in one school, we multiply the number of children per row by the number of rows:
   \[
   \text{Total children in one school} = \text{Number of children per row} \times \text{Number of rows}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total children in one school} = 8 \times 7 = 56
   \]

4. **Determine the number of schools:**
   There are 5 different schools participating in the drill.

5. **Calculate the total number of children across all schools:**
   To find the total number of children in all schools, we multiply the total number of children in one school by the number of schools:
   \[
   \text{Total children in all schools} = \text{Total children in one school} \times \text{Number of schools}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total children in all schools} = 56 \times 5 = 280
   \]

Thus, the total number of children that can be in the drill is \( \boxed{280} \).
