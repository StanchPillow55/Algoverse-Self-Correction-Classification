Question ID: 570

Question:
Peter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. How many total action figures will he have by the end of the week?


Reference Answer:
There are 7 days in a week so if he wishes to spend an equal amount of $70 each day that would be $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10
For four days (Sunday through Wednesday) he will spend 4*$10 = $<<4*10=40>>40
He will spend $40 on wooden action figures of $5 each which gives $40/$5 = <<40/5=8>>8 wooden action figures
For the remaining 3 days he will spend 3*$10 = $<<3*10=30>>30
He will spend $30 on plastic action figures of $2 each which gives $30/$2 = <<30/2=15>>15 plastic action figures
Altogether, he will have 8+15 = <<8+15=23>>23 action figures.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount Peter has**: 
   Peter has $70.

2. **Determine the number of days in a week**: 
   There are 7 days in a week.

3. **Calculate the amount Peter can spend each day**: 
   Since he wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week, we divide the total amount by the number of days:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent per day} = \frac{70}{7} = 10
   \]
   So, Peter can spend $10 each day.

4. **Calculate the spending from Sunday through Wednesday**: 
   From Sunday to Wednesday, there are 4 days. During these days, he buys wooden action figures that cost $5 each. The total amount he spends from Sunday to Wednesday is:
   \[
   \text{Total spent from Sunday to Wednesday} = 10 \times 4 = 40
   \]

5. **Determine how many wooden action figures he buys**: 
   Since each wooden action figure costs $5, we can find out how many he buys:
   \[
   \text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{40}{5} = 8
   \]

6. **Calculate the spending from Thursday to Saturday**: 
   From Thursday to Saturday, there are 3 days. During these days, he buys plastic action figures that cost $2 each. The total amount he spends from Thursday to Saturday is:
   \[
   \text{Total spent from Thursday to Saturday} = 10 \times 3 = 30
   \]

7. **Determine how many plastic action figures he buys**: 
   Since each plastic action figure costs $2, we can find out how many he buys:
   \[
   \text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]

8. **Calculate the total number of action figures**: 
   Now we add the number of wooden action figures and plastic action figures to find the total:
   \[
   \text{Total action figures} = \text{Number of wooden action figures} + \text{Number of plastic action figures} = 8 + 15 = 23
   \]

Thus, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is \( \boxed{23} \).
