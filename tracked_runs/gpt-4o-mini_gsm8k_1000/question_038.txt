Question ID: 348

Question:
A factory used to make tractors, but now makes silos. When they made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. Now, they sell 5 silos a day, and make $220 per silo. What percentage more are they making per day now?


Reference Answer:
They used to make $1,000 a day because 10 x 100 = <<10*100=1000>>1,000
They now make 1,100 a day because 5 x 220 = <<5*220=1100>>1,100
They make 10% more per day because 1000 +(1000 x (X/100)) = 1,100 if X = 10
#### 10

Response:
To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue from tractors to silos, we will first calculate the daily revenue from both products and then find the percentage increase.

### Step 1: Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.

The factory sold 10 tractors a day at a price of $100 per tractor. 

\[
\text{Daily Revenue from Tractors} = \text{Number of Tractors Sold} \times \text{Price per Tractor}
\]
\[
\text{Daily Revenue from Tractors} = 10 \times 100 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the daily revenue from silos.

Now, the factory sells 5 silos a day at a price of $220 per silo.

\[
\text{Daily Revenue from Silos} = \text{Number of Silos Sold} \times \text{Price per Silo}
\]
\[
\text{Daily Revenue from Silos} = 5 \times 220 = 1100 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the increase in daily revenue.

Now, we find the increase in daily revenue by subtracting the revenue from tractors from the revenue from silos.

\[
\text{Increase in Revenue} = \text{Daily Revenue from Silos} - \text{Daily Revenue from Tractors}
\]
\[
\text{Increase in Revenue} = 1100 - 1000 = 100 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase in revenue.

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in Revenue}}{\text{Daily Revenue from Tractors}} \right) \times 100
\]
\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
\]

### Final Answer

The factory is making **10% more** per day now by selling silos compared to when they were selling tractors.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the daily revenue from both the tractors and the silos, and then determine the percentage increase in revenue.

1. **Calculate the daily revenue from tractors:**
   - Number of tractors sold per day = 10
   - Price per tractor = $100
   - Daily revenue from tractors = Number of tractors × Price per tractor
   \[
   \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \times 100 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily revenue from silos:**
   - Number of silos sold per day = 5
   - Price per silo = $220
   - Daily revenue from silos = Number of silos × Price per silo
   \[
   \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \times 220 = 1100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the increase in daily revenue:**
   - Increase in revenue = Daily revenue from silos - Daily revenue from tractors
   \[
   \text{Increase in revenue} = 1100 - 1000 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage increase in revenue:**
   - Percentage increase = (Increase in revenue / Daily revenue from tractors) × 100%
   \[
   \text{Percentage increase} = \left(\frac{100}{1000}\right) \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

Thus, the factory is making **10% more** per day now compared to when they were making tractors.

**Final Answer:** 10% more

Response:
To find out how much more the factory is making per day now compared to when they were making tractors, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily revenue from tractors:**
   - Number of tractors sold per day = 10
   - Revenue per tractor = $100
   - Daily revenue from tractors = Number of tractors × Revenue per tractor
   \[
   \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \times 100 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily revenue from silos:**
   - Number of silos sold per day = 5
   - Revenue per silo = $220
   - Daily revenue from silos = Number of silos × Revenue per silo
   \[
   \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \times 220 = 1100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the increase in daily revenue:**
   - Increase in revenue = Daily revenue from silos - Daily revenue from tractors
   \[
   \text{Increase in revenue} = 1100 - 1000 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage increase in daily revenue:**
   - Percentage increase = (Increase in revenue / Daily revenue from tractors) × 100%
   \[
   \text{Percentage increase} = \left(\frac{100}{1000}\right) \times 100\% = 10\%
   \]

Thus, the factory is making **10% more** per day now than when they were making tractors.

**Final Answer:** 10% more per day.
