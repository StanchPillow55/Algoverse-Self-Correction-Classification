Question:
Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. If Cindy has four pets, how many total pets do the three have?


Reference Answer:
Marcia has 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 pets.
Jan has 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 pets
In total, the three have 4 + 6 + 18 = <<4+6+18=28>>28 pets.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of pets Cindy has:**
   - According to the problem, Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Determine the number of pets Marcia has:**
   - The problem states that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. 
   - Since Cindy has 4 pets, we can calculate Marcia's pets as follows:
     \[
     \text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
     \]

3. **Determine the number of pets Jan has:**
   - The problem states that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   - Since we found that Marcia has 6 pets, we can calculate Jan's pets as follows:
     \[
     \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times \text{Marcia's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - Now we need to find the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have together. We will add the number of pets each person has:
     \[
     \text{Total pets} = \text{Jan's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Cindy's pets}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total pets} = 18 + 6 + 4
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total pets} = 28
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have together is \( \boxed{28} \).
