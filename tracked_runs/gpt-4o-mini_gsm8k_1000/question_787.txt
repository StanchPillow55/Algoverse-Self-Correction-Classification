Question ID: 226

Question:
James is counting his Pokemon cards. He has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. If he loses 8 of the water type and buys 14 grass type, what's the percentage chance (rounded to the nearest integer) that a randomly picked card will be a water type?


Reference Answer:
First find the final number of grass type Pokemon: 20 grass type + 14 grass type = <<20+14=34>>34 grass type
Then find the final number of water type Pokemon: 40 water type - 8 water type = <<40-8=32>>32 water type
Then add the number of each type of Pokemon to find the total number: 34 Pokemon + 32 Pokemon + 30 Pokemon = <<34+32+30=96>>96 Pokemon
Then divide the number of water type Pokemon by the total number of Pokemon and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 32 water type / 96 Pokemon * 100% = 33.333...%, which rounds down to 33%

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial counts of each type of Pokemon card.**
   - Fire type: 30
   - Grass type: 20
   - Water type: 40

2. **Calculate the total number of cards before any changes.**
   \[
   \text{Total cards} = \text{Fire type} + \text{Grass type} + \text{Water type} = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90
   \]

3. **Account for the changes in the number of cards.**
   - James loses 8 water type cards:
     \[
     \text{New water type count} = 40 - 8 = 32
     \]
   - James buys 14 grass type cards:
     \[
     \text{New grass type count} = 20 + 14 = 34
     \]

4. **Calculate the new total number of cards after the changes.**
   \[
   \text{New total cards} = \text{Fire type} + \text{New grass type} + \text{New water type} = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96
   \]

5. **Determine the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type.**
   - The number of water type cards is now 32.
   - The total number of cards is now 96.
   - The probability (or percentage chance) of picking a water type card is given by:
   \[
   \text{Probability of water type} = \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} = \frac{32}{96}
   \]

6. **Convert the probability to a percentage.**
   \[
   \text{Percentage chance} = \left(\frac{32}{96}\right) \times 100
   \]
   First, simplify \(\frac{32}{96}\):
   \[
   \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \quad (\text{since } 32 \text{ and } 96 \text{ can both be divided by } 32)
   \]
   Now calculate the percentage:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.3333
   \]
   \[
   0.3333 \times 100 \approx 33.33
   \]

7. **Round to the nearest integer.**
   \[
   \text{Rounded percentage chance} = 33
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{33}
\]
