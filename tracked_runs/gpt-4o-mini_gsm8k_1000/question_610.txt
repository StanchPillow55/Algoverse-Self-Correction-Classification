Question ID: 1199

Question:
Fred was preparing for a party to be held in four days.  So, he made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day and put them in the refrigerator cooler.  But later that evening, his children discovered the delicious nectar and robbed the cooler, drinking 4 of those gallons of root beer.  On the second day, his wife Barbie also discovered the root beer and accidentally spilled 7 gallons. On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie visited Fred's house and helped himself to the root beer, further reducing the amount remaining by 5 gallons.  On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party.  If Fred and the others shared the remaining root beer equally, how much was available for each to drink during the party?


Reference Answer:
Fred started with 24 gallons, but on day 1, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24-4=<<24-4=20>>20 gallons of root beer.
On day two, Barbie spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20-7=<<20-7=13>>13 gallons of root beer.
On day three, Ronnie helped himself to 5 gallons, leaving 13-5=<<13-5=8>>8 gallons of root beer for the party.
Three guests joined Fred for the party, resulting in 3+1=<<3+1=4>>4 party goers.
If the 4 party-goers split the root beer equally, each person gets 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 gallons

Response:
To solve the problem, we will track the amount of root beer Fred has after each day and then determine how much each person can drink at the party.

1. **Initial Amount of Root Beer:**
   Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.

   \[
   \text{Initial amount} = 24 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **After the Children Drank Some:**
   Later that evening, Fred's children drank 4 gallons.

   \[
   \text{Amount after children} = 24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After Barbie Spilled Some:**
   On the second day, Fred's wife Barbie accidentally spilled 7 gallons.

   \[
   \text{Amount after Barbie} = 20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **After Ronnie Took Some:**
   On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons.

   \[
   \text{Amount after Ronnie} = 13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Amount Available for the Party:**
   On the fourth day, there are 8 gallons of root beer left. There are 3 people (Fred and 2 others) at the party.

   \[
   \text{Total people} = 3
   \]

   To find out how much root beer each person can drink, we divide the remaining amount by the number of people.

   \[
   \text{Amount per person} = \frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons}
   \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   Each person can drink approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer during the party.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Each person can drink } \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons of root beer.}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, we will track the amount of root beer Fred has after each event leading up to the party.

1. **Initial amount of root beer**: Fred made 24 gallons on the first day.
   \[
   \text{Initial amount} = 24 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **After children drank some**: The children drank 4 gallons.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after children} = 24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After wife spilled some**: Barbie spilled 7 gallons.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after spill} = 20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **After friend drank some**: Ronnie drank 5 gallons.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after friend} = 13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Number of people at the party**: There are 3 guests plus Fred, making a total of 4 people.
   \[
   \text{Total people} = 3 + 1 = 4
   \]

6. **Amount of root beer available per person**: We divide the remaining root beer by the number of people.
   \[
   \text{Root beer per person} = \frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{4} = 2 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, each person at the party can drink **2 gallons** of root beer.

**Final Answer**: Each person can drink 2 gallons of root beer.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will track the amount of root beer Fred has over the four days, accounting for the losses each day.

1. **Initial Amount**: Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.

2. **Day 1**: 
   - Amount before children drank: 24 gallons
   - Amount drunk by children: 4 gallons
   - Remaining after Day 1: 
     \[
     24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Day 2**:
   - Amount before spill: 20 gallons
   - Amount spilled by Barbie: 7 gallons
   - Remaining after Day 2: 
     \[
     20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Day 3**:
   - Amount before friend drank: 13 gallons
   - Amount drunk by Ronnie: 5 gallons
   - Remaining after Day 3: 
     \[
     13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
     \]

5. **Day 4**:
   - Amount before the party: 8 gallons
   - Number of people at the party: 3 (Fred and 2 others)
   - Amount of root beer available for each person:
     \[
     \frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons}
     \]

Thus, each person at the party can drink approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer.

**Final Answer**: Each person can drink approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer.
