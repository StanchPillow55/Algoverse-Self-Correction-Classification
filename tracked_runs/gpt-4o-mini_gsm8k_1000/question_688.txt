Question:
Kelian has two recipes for preparing dishes, one having 20 instructions and the second one having twice as many instructions as the first one. How many instructions does Kelian have to read to prepare the two dishes?


Reference Answer:
The second recipe has 2 * 20 instructions = <<2*20=40>>40 instructions.
The total for the two dishes is 40 instructions + 20 instructions = <<40+20=60>>60 instructions.
#### 60


=== Turn 1 ===


Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of instructions Kelian has to read to prepare two dishes, given the number of instructions for each recipe.

1. **Identify the number of instructions in the first recipe:**
   - The first recipe has 20 instructions.

2. **Determine the number of instructions in the second recipe:**
   - The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one.
   - Therefore, the number of instructions in the second recipe is:
     \[
     2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ instructions}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of instructions for both recipes:**
   - To find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read, we add the number of instructions from both recipes:
     \[
     \text{Total instructions} = \text{Instructions from first recipe} + \text{Instructions from second recipe}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total instructions} = 20 + 40 = 60
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of instructions Kelian has to read to prepare the two dishes is:
     \[
     \boxed{60}
     \]
