Question ID: 84

Question:
A football team played 22 games. They won 8 more than they lost. How many did they win?


Reference Answer:
Let L be the number of losses.
The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.
The team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.
So, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14
So L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.
Therefore, the team won 22 â€“ 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many games the football team won, given that they played a total of 22 games and won 8 more games than they lost.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( W \) be the number of games won.
- Let \( L \) be the number of games lost.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22:
   \[
   W + L = 22
   \]
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost:
   \[
   W = L + 8
   \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the second equation into the first equation. 

Substituting \( W \) in the first equation:
\[
(L + 8) + L = 22
\]

Now, combine like terms:
\[
2L + 8 = 22
\]

Next, we will isolate \( L \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[
2L = 22 - 8
\]
\[
2L = 14
\]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{14}{2} = 7
\]

Now that we have the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won using the second equation:
\[
W = L + 8
\]
Substituting \( L = 7 \):
\[
W = 7 + 8 = 15
\]

Thus, the football team won \( W = 15 \) games.

To summarize:
- The team played a total of 22 games.
- They lost 7 games and won 15 games.
- The number of games won is 15, which is indeed 8 more than the number of games lost (7).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]
