Question ID: 1277

Question:
Mia and Emma are currently 16 years apart in age. If Mia, who is younger than Emma, is 40 years old, what's the average of their ages?


Reference Answer:
If Mia is 40 years old, Emma is 40+16 = <<40+16=56>>56 years old.
The sum of their ages is 56+40 = <<56+40=96>>96 years
The average age of the two is 96/2 = <<96/2=48>>48 years
#### 48

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine Emma's age given that Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age.

1. **Identify Mia's Age**: 
   - Mia's age = 40 years.

2. **Determine Emma's Age**: 
   - Since Mia is younger than Emma and they are 16 years apart, we can express Emma's age as:
     \[
     \text{Emma's age} = \text{Mia's age} + 16
     \]
   - Substituting Mia's age into the equation:
     \[
     \text{Emma's age} = 40 + 16 = 56 \text{ years}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Average of Their Ages**: 
   - The average age is calculated by adding their ages together and dividing by the number of individuals (which is 2 in this case).
   - First, we find the sum of their ages:
     \[
     \text{Sum of ages} = \text{Mia's age} + \text{Emma's age} = 40 + 56 = 96
     \]
   - Now, we calculate the average:
     \[
     \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Sum of ages}}{2} = \frac{96}{2} = 48
     \]

4. **Final Answer**: 
   - The average of Mia's and Emma's ages is \( \boxed{48} \).
