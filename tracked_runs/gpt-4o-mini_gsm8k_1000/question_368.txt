Question ID: 993

Question:
An airport has only 2 planes that fly multiple times a day. Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?


Reference Answer:
The second plane flies half as much as the first, so the first plane makes 44 flights * 2 = <<44*2=88>>88 flights a day.
If 3/4 of the first plane’s flights are to Greece, then flights to France or Germany make up 1 – 3/4 = 1/4 of the total daily flights.
Therefore, 88 daily flights / 4 = <<88/4=22>>22 flights to France or Germany.
Splitting these flights equally means the first plane makes 22 flights / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 flights to France in one day.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Flights of the First Plane:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day.
   - According to the problem, three-quarters of these flights go to Greece. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4}x
     \]

2. **Remaining Flights:**
   - The remaining flights, which are not to Greece, can be calculated as:
     \[
     x - \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}x
     \]
   - These remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is:
     \[
     \text{Flights to France} = \text{Flights to Germany} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{4}x \right) = \frac{1}{8}x
     \]

3. **Understanding the Flights of the Second Plane:**
   - The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips. According to the problem, these 44 trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     44 = \frac{1}{2}x
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     x = 44 \times 2 = 88
     \]

5. **Calculating Flights to France:**
   - Now that we know the total number of flights \( x \) for the first plane is 88, we can find the number of flights to France:
     \[
     \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}x = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11
     \]

Thus, the total number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:

\[
\boxed{11}
\]
