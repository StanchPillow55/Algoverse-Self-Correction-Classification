Question ID: 1196

Question:
Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens and also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red. If each pack has 5 pens, how many pens does Alain have?


Reference Answer:
Alain has a total of 5 x 5= <<5*5=25>>25 red pens.
And he has a total of 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 packs of black pens.
So, the total number of black pens he has is 10 x 5 = <<10*5=50>>50.
Therefore, the total number of pens he has is 50 + 25= <<50+25=75>>75.
#### 75

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pens Alain has in total, considering both the red pens and the black pens.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of red pens.**

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of red pens as follows:

\[
\text{Total red pens} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Pens per pack}
\]
\[
\text{Total red pens} = 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of black pens.**

According to the problem, Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since we already calculated that there are 25 red pens, we can find the number of black pens:

\[
\text{Total black pens} = 2 \times \text{Total red pens}
\]
\[
\text{Total black pens} = 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pens.**

Now, we need to find the total number of pens Alain has by adding the number of red pens and black pens together:

\[
\text{Total pens} = \text{Total red pens} + \text{Total black pens}
\]
\[
\text{Total pens} = 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Alain has a total of 75 pens.
