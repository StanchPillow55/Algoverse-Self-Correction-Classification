Question ID: 1102

Question:
Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.  She ended up returning one item that cost $15.00.  After she returned the item, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00 and a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00.  She put both of these purchases on her credit card.  What is the new balance on her credit card?


Reference Answer:
She charged $85.00 on her card and just returned a $15.00 purchase so right now, her credit card has 85-15 = $<<85-15=70.00>>70.00 balance
The frying pan is 20% off of $20.00 so .20*20.00 = $<<20*.01*20=4.00>>4.00
The frying pan costs $20.00 and the discount price is $4.00 so the new price is 20-4=$<<20-4=16.00>>16.00
The towel set is 10% off of $30.00 so .10*30 = $<<10*.01*30=3.00>>3.00
The towel set costs $30.00 and the discount price is $3.00 so the new price is 30-3= $<<30-3=27.00>>27.00
Her new purchases total 16+27 = $$<<16+27=43.00>>43.00
After the return, her card balance was $70.00 and she just added $43.00 in purchases so her new balance is 70+43 = $<<70+43=113.00>>113.00

Response:
To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card after her transactions, we will follow these steps:

1. **Initial Charge**: Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.

2. **Return of Item**: She returned one item that cost $15.00. We need to subtract this amount from the initial charge.
   \[
   \text{New Balance after Return} = \text{Initial Charge} - \text{Cost of Returned Item}
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Balance after Return} = 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

3. **Purchase of Frying Pan**: The frying pan costs $20.00 but is on sale for 20% off. We need to calculate the sale price.
   - First, calculate the discount:
   \[
   \text{Discount on Frying Pan} = 20\% \text{ of } 20.00 = 0.20 \times 20.00 = 4.00
   \]
   - Now, subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
   \[
   \text{Sale Price of Frying Pan} = 20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]

4. **Purchase of Towels**: The set of towels costs $30.00 but is on sale for 10% off. We will calculate the sale price similarly.
   - First, calculate the discount:
   \[
   \text{Discount on Towels} = 10\% \text{ of } 30.00 = 0.10 \times 30.00 = 3.00
   \]
   - Now, subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
   \[
   \text{Sale Price of Towels} = 30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]

5. **Total of New Purchases**: Now we will add the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels to find the total amount of new purchases.
   \[
   \text{Total New Purchases} = \text{Sale Price of Frying Pan} + \text{Sale Price of Towels}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total New Purchases} = 16.00 + 27.00 = 43.00
   \]

6. **Final Balance on Credit Card**: Now we will add the total of the new purchases to the balance after the return.
   \[
   \text{Final Balance} = \text{New Balance after Return} + \text{Total New Purchases}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Balance} = 70.00 + 43.00 = 113.00
   \]

Thus, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is \(\boxed{113.00}\).
