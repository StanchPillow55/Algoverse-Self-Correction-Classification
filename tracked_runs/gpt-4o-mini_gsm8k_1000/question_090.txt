Question ID: 1301

Question:
Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. How many cookies does he have now?


Reference Answer:
Randy originally has 9+4+5 = <<9+4+5=18>>18 cookies in total.
He has 18-3 = <<18-3=15>>15 cookies left.
He has 15-2 = <<15-2=13>>13 cookies left.
He has 13-2 = <<13-2=11>>11 cookies left.
Randy bakes 4*3 = <<4*3=12>>12 cookies.
Randy has 11+12 = <<11+12=23>>23 cookies.

Response:
To determine how many cookies Randy has now, we will follow the steps of the problem systematically, keeping track of the number of cookies of each flavor at each stage.

1. **Initial Count of Cookies**:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4
   - Sugar cookies: 5

   Total cookies initially = 9 (oatmeal) + 4 (chocolate chip) + 5 (sugar) = 18 cookies.

2. **Cookies Eaten for Snack**:
   Randy eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
   - 1 oatmeal cookie
   - 1 chocolate chip cookie
   - 1 sugar cookie

   After eating these cookies:
   - Oatmeal cookies left: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip cookies left: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar cookies left: 5 - 1 = 4

   So, the counts after the snack are:
   - Oatmeal: 8
   - Chocolate chip: 3
   - Sugar: 4

3. **Cookies Eaten for Lunch**:
   Randy eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
   - Oatmeal cookies left: 8 - 2 = 6

   The counts after lunch are:
   - Oatmeal: 6
   - Chocolate chip: 3
   - Sugar: 4

4. **Cookies Given to Friends**:
   Randy gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
   - Sugar cookies left: 4 - 2 = 2

   The counts after giving cookies to friends are:
   - Oatmeal: 6
   - Chocolate chip: 3
   - Sugar: 2

5. **Cookies Baked for Dinner**:
   Randy bakes 4 cookies of each flavor:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

   The final counts after baking are:
   - Oatmeal: 10
   - Chocolate chip: 7
   - Sugar: 6

6. **Final Count of Cookies**:
   Now, we sum the final counts of cookies:
   Total cookies = 10 (oatmeal) + 7 (chocolate chip) + 6 (sugar) = 23 cookies.

Thus, the final answer is that Randy has **23 cookies** now.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will track the number of cookies Randy has after each action he takes. We will start with the initial quantities of each type of cookie and then adjust these quantities step by step based on the actions described.

1. **Initial Cookie Counts**:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4
   - Sugar cookies: 5

2. **Randy eats 3 cookies (one of each flavor)**:
   - He eats 1 oatmeal cookie, 1 chocolate chip cookie, and 1 sugar cookie.
   - After eating:
     - Oatmeal cookies: \(9 - 1 = 8\)
     - Chocolate chip cookies: \(4 - 1 = 3\)
     - Sugar cookies: \(5 - 1 = 4\)

   Current counts:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 8
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3
   - Sugar cookies: 4

3. **Randy eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch**:
   - After eating 2 more oatmeal cookies:
     - Oatmeal cookies: \(8 - 2 = 6\)

   Current counts:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 6
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3
   - Sugar cookies: 4

4. **Randy gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends**:
   - After giving away 2 sugar cookies:
     - Sugar cookies: \(4 - 2 = 2\)

   Current counts:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 6
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3
   - Sugar cookies: 2

5. **Randy bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner**:
   - He bakes 4 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies.
   - After baking:
     - Oatmeal cookies: \(6 + 4 = 10\)
     - Chocolate chip cookies: \(3 + 4 = 7\)
     - Sugar cookies: \(2 + 4 = 6\)

   Final counts:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 10
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 7
   - Sugar cookies: 6

6. **Total Cookies**:
   To find the total number of cookies Randy has now, we sum the counts of each type:
   \[
   \text{Total cookies} = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Randy has **23 cookies** now.
