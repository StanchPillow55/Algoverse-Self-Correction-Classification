Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money each girl raised and then find the total amount raised by all of them.

1. **Determine how much Alexandra raised**:
   - According to the problem, Alexandra raised $430.

2. **Determine how much Kim raised**:
   - Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra. Therefore, we can calculate Kim's amount as follows:
   \[
   \text{Kim's amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + 320 = 430 + 320 = 750
   \]

3. **Determine how much Sarah raised**:
   - The problem states that Sarah raised $300.

4. **Determine how much Maryam raised**:
   - Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah. Thus, we can calculate Maryam's amount as follows:
   \[
   \text{Maryam's amount} = \text{Sarah's amount} + 400 = 300 + 400 = 700
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount raised by all the girls**:
   - Now we have the amounts raised by each girl:
     - Alexandra: $430
     - Kim: $750
     - Sarah: $300
     - Maryam: $700
   - We can find the total by adding these amounts together:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700
   \]

6. **Perform the addition**:
   - First, add Alexandra's and Kim's amounts:
   \[
   430 + 750 = 1180
   \]
   - Next, add Sarah's amount:
   \[
   1180 + 300 = 1480
   \]
   - Finally, add Maryam's amount:
   \[
   1480 + 700 = 2180
   \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   - The total amount of money raised by all the girls is:
   \[
   \boxed{2180}
   \]

1. **Identify how much Alexandra raised**:
   - According to the problem, Alexandra raised $430.

2. **Calculate how much Kim raised**:
   - Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra.
   - Therefore, we can calculate Kim's amount as follows:
     \[
     \text{Kim's amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + 320 = 430 + 320 = 750
     \]

3. **Identify how much Sarah raised**:
   - The problem states that Sarah raised $300.

4. **Calculate how much Maryam raised**:
   - Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah.
   - Therefore, we can calculate Maryam's amount as follows:
     \[
     \text{Maryam's amount} = \text{Sarah's amount} + 400 = 300 + 400 = 700
     \]

5. **Now we have the amounts raised by each girl**:
   - Alexandra: $430
   - Kim: $750
   - Sarah: $300
   - Maryam: $700

6. **Calculate the total amount raised by all the girls**:
   - We will sum the amounts raised by each girl:
     \[
     \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700
     \]

7. **Perform the addition**:
   - First, add Alexandra's and Kim's amounts:
     \[
     430 + 750 = 1180
     \]
   - Next, add Sarah's amount:
     \[
     1180 + 300 = 1480
     \]
   - Finally, add Maryam's amount:
     \[
     1480 + 700 = 2180
     \]
