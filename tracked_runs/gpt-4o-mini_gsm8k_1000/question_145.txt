Question ID: 9

Question:
Eliza's rate per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. She also receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. If Eliza worked for 45 hours this week, how much are her earnings for this week?


Reference Answer:
Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.
Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.
So, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.
Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.

Response:
To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular hours and overtime hours, and then apply the appropriate rates for each.

1. **Identify Regular and Overtime Hours**:
   - Eliza works a total of 45 hours this week.
   - The first 40 hours are considered regular hours.
   - The hours worked beyond 40 hours are considered overtime hours.
   - Therefore, the overtime hours she worked are:
     \[
     \text{Overtime Hours} = \text{Total Hours} - \text{Regular Hours} = 45 - 40 = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate Regular Earnings**:
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
     \[
     \text{Regular Earnings} = \text{Regular Hours} \times \text{Regular Rate} = 40 \times 10 = 400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate Overtime Earnings**:
   - Eliza's overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.
   - Therefore, her overtime rate is:
     \[
     \text{Overtime Rate} = 1.2 \times \text{Regular Rate} = 1.2 \times 10 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]
   - For the 5 hours of overtime, her earnings are:
     \[
     \text{Overtime Earnings} = \text{Overtime Hours} \times \text{Overtime Rate} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate Total Earnings**:
   - To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we add her regular earnings and her overtime earnings:
     \[
     \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Regular Earnings} + \text{Overtime Earnings} = 400 + 60 = 460 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Eliza's total earnings for the week are \(\boxed{460}\) dollars.
