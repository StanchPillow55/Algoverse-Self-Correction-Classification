Question ID: 54

Question:
The Doubtfire sisters are driving home with 7 kittens adopted from the local animal shelter when their mother calls to inform them that their two house cats have just had kittens. She says that Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, while Trixie, the other cat, has had 12. How many kittens does the Doubtfire family now have?


Reference Answer:
Patchy has just had 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 kittens
Since Trixie's kittens are 12, both cats have 21 +12 = <<21+12=33>>33 kittens.
Combining the adopted kittens with those from the two cats, the Doubtfire family now has 7 + 33 = <<7+33=40>>40 kittens.
#### 40

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family has after considering the kittens they adopted and the kittens born to their house cats.

1. **Identify the number of adopted kittens**:
   The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter.

   \[
   \text{Number of adopted kittens} = 7
   \]

2. **Determine the number of kittens from Patchy**:
   According to the problem, Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Therefore, we calculate the number of kittens Patchy had as follows:

   \[
   \text{Kittens from Patchy} = 3 \times \text{Number of adopted kittens} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

3. **Determine the number of kittens from Trixie**:
   The problem states that Trixie has had 12 kittens.

   \[
   \text{Kittens from Trixie} = 12
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of kittens**:
   Now, we add the number of adopted kittens, the kittens from Patchy, and the kittens from Trixie to find the total number of kittens in the Doubtfire family.

   \[
   \text{Total number of kittens} = \text{Number of adopted kittens} + \text{Kittens from Patchy} + \text{Kittens from Trixie}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Total number of kittens} = 7 + 21 + 12
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition step-by-step:

   - First, add the adopted kittens and the kittens from Patchy:

   \[
   7 + 21 = 28
   \]

   - Next, add the kittens from Trixie:

   \[
   28 + 12 = 40
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is:

   \[
   \boxed{40}
   \]
