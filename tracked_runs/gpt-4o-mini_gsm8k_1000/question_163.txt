Question ID: 681

Question:
Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max has. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, and Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. If Katarina has 68 cookies, how many cookies do they have in total?


Reference Answer:
Max’s has a total of 68+5 = <<68+5=73>>73 cookies.
Cookie Monster’s total amount of cookies is 73-12 = <<73-12=61>>61.
Summer’s total cookie amount is 73+23 = <<73+23=96>>96.
Total amount of cookies 68+73+61+96 = <<68+73+61+96=298>>298.

Response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of cookies Katarina has:**
   - We are given that Katarina has 68 cookies.

2. **Determine the number of cookies Max has:**
   - The problem states that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. We can express this relationship mathematically as:
     \[
     K = M - 5
     \]
     where \( K \) is the number of cookies Katarina has and \( M \) is the number of cookies Max has.
   - Since we know \( K = 68 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:
     \[
     68 = M - 5
     \]
   - To find \( M \), we add 5 to both sides:
     \[
     M = 68 + 5 = 73
     \]
   - So, Max has 73 cookies.

3. **Determine the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has:**
   - The problem states that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. We can express this relationship as:
     \[
     M = C + 12
     \]
     where \( C \) is the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
   - We already found \( M = 73 \), so we substitute this value into the equation:
     \[
     73 = C + 12
     \]
   - To find \( C \), we subtract 12 from both sides:
     \[
     C = 73 - 12 = 61
     \]
   - So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

4. **Determine the number of cookies Summer has:**
   - The problem states that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. We can express this relationship as:
     \[
     S = M + 23
     \]
     where \( S \) is the number of cookies Summer has.
   - We already found \( M = 73 \), so we substitute this value into the equation:
     \[
     S = 73 + 23 = 96
     \]
   - So, Summer has 96 cookies.

5. **Calculate the total number of cookies:**
   - Now we have the number of cookies for each person:
     - Katarina: 68 cookies
     - Max: 73 cookies
     - Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
     - Summer: 96 cookies
   - To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:
     \[
     \text{Total} = K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
     \]

   - Performing the addition step by step:
     \[
     68 + 73 = 141
     \]
     \[
     141 + 61 = 202
     \]
     \[
     202 + 96 = 298
     \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The total number of cookies they have is \( \boxed{298} \).
