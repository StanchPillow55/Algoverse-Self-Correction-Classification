Response:
To determine how much money Raymond has left, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial amount of money Raymond had.**
   - Raymond started with $21.

2. **Calculate the amount he saved from his allowance.**
   - Raymond saved $11 from his allowance.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Raymond has after saving.**
   - To find the total amount after saving, we add the amount he saved to the initial amount:
   \[
   \text{Total after saving} = \text{Initial amount} + \text{Saved amount} = 21 + 11 = 32
   \]

4. **Identify the amounts he spent.**
   - Raymond spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle.

5. **Calculate the total amount spent.**
   - To find the total amount spent, we add the amounts spent on the comic book and the puzzle:
   \[
   \text{Total spent} = \text{Amount on comic book} + \text{Amount on puzzle} = 5 + 19 = 24
   \]

6. **Calculate the remaining amount of money.**
   - To find out how much money Raymond has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the total amount after saving:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total after saving} - \text{Total spent} = 32 - 24 = 8
   \]

Thus, after performing all calculations and reasoning through the steps, we find that Raymond has **$8** left.

Final answer: **$8**
