Question ID: 1201

Question:
There are 66 fish in the fish tank. One-third of the fish have red stripes, and 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. Altogether, how many fish have red stripes and blue stripes?


Reference Answer:
One-third of the fish in the fish tank have red stripes, a total of 1/3*66 = <<1/3*66=22>>22 fish
The number of fish in the fish tank with no red stripes is 66-22 =<<66-22=44>>44
5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, a total of 5/11*44 = <<5/11*44=20>>20 fish
Altogether, the number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is 20+22 = <<20+22=42>>42 fish
#### 42

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of fish with red stripes**:
   - We know there are 66 fish in total.
   - One-third of the fish have red stripes. We can calculate this by multiplying the total number of fish by \(\frac{1}{3}\):
     \[
     \text{Number of red-striped fish} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
     \]

2. **Calculate the remaining fish**:
   - After accounting for the fish with red stripes, we need to find the number of remaining fish:
     \[
     \text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
     \]

3. **Determine the number of fish with blue stripes**:
   - We are told that \(\frac{5}{11}\) of the remaining fish have blue stripes. We can calculate this by multiplying the number of remaining fish by \(\frac{5}{11}\):
     \[
     \text{Number of blue-striped fish} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44
     \]
   - First, we calculate \(\frac{5}{11} \times 44\):
     \[
     \frac{5 \times 44}{11} = \frac{220}{11} = 20
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of fish with red and blue stripes**:
   - Now we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:
     \[
     \text{Total fish with red and blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is:
     \[
     \boxed{42}
     \]
