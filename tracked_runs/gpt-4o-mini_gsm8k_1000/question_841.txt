Question ID: 352

Question:
After Andrea saved some money, she then spent the rest of her money on an $11 sweater and gave her brother $4. If she had $36 in the beginning, how much did Andrea save?


Reference Answer:
Andrea spent and gave her brother a total of $11 + $4 = $<<11+4=15>>15.
So, she saved $36 - $15 = $<<36-15=21>>21.
#### 21

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Andrea saved before spending on the sweater and giving money to her brother.

1. **Identify the total amount Andrea had initially**: 
   - Andrea started with $36.

2. **Identify the expenses**: 
   - She spent $11 on a sweater.
   - She gave her brother $4.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent**:
   \[
   \text{Total spent} = \text{Cost of sweater} + \text{Amount given to brother} = 11 + 4 = 15
   \]

4. **Determine how much money Andrea had left after her expenses**:
   - We subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she had:
   \[
   \text{Amount left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total spent} = 36 - 15 = 21
   \]

5. **Determine how much Andrea saved**:
   - Since we know that after spending, Andrea has $21 left, we can conclude that this amount represents the money she did not spend. Therefore, the amount she saved is the difference between her initial amount and the amount she has left after spending:
   \[
   \text{Amount saved} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Amount left} = 36 - 21 = 15
   \]

Thus, the amount Andrea saved is **$15**.

Final answer: **$15**.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent**:
   - Total spent = Cost of sweater + Amount given to brother
   - Total spent = $11 + $4 = $15

4. **Calculate the amount of money left after spending**:
   - Amount left = Initial amount - Total spent
   - Amount left = $36 - $15 = $21

5. **Determine how much Andrea saved**:
   - Since we know that after spending $15, Andrea has $21 left, we can conclude that the amount she saved is the difference between her initial amount and the amount she has left after spending.
   - Amount saved = Initial amount - Amount left
   - Amount saved = $36 - $21 = $15
