Question ID: 1047

Question:
Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?


Reference Answer:
Let B be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the third set.
In the second set, he retrieved 2B balls.
In the first set, he retrieved 2B + 4 balls.
In total, he retrieved B + 2B + 2B + 4 = 5B + 4 = 19 balls.
Thus, 5B = 19 - 4 = 15 balls.
Therefore, in the third set, Rory retrieved B = 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 balls.
Hence, in the second set, he retrieved 2B = 3 * 2 = 6 balls.
In the first set he retrieved 2(3) + 4 balls = 10

Response:
Let \( x \) be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set. 

According to the problem:

1. In the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set can be expressed as:
   \[
   x + 4
   \]

2. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Thus, the number of balls retrieved in the third set can be expressed as:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of tennis balls retrieved across all three sets. The total is given as 19 balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we will combine the terms on the left side of the equation. First, we can rewrite \( x + 4 \) and \( x \) as:
\[
x + 4 + x = 2x + 4
\]

Now, we can add \( \frac{x}{2} \) to this:
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}
\]

To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \( 2x \) and \( \frac{x}{2} \) is 2. We can rewrite \( 2x \) as \( \frac{4x}{2} \):
\[
\frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{4x + x}{2} + 4 = \frac{5x}{2} + 4
\]

Now, we can substitute this back into our equation:
\[
\frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

Next, we will isolate \( \frac{5x}{2} \) by subtracting 4 from both sides:
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 19 - 4
\]
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 15
\]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 2:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Now, we can solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x \), which is the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
\text{First set} = x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Finally, we can verify our solution by calculating the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets:
- First set: \( 10 \)
- Second set: \( 6 \)
- Third set: \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)

Adding these together:
\[
10 + 6 + 3 = 19
\]

Since this matches the total given in the problem, our solution is confirmed.

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set of the match is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]

Response:
Let \( x \) be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.

According to the problem:

1. In the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{First set} = x + 4
   \]

2. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Third set} = \frac{x}{2}
   \]

3. The total number of tennis balls retrieved in all three sets is 19:
   \[
   (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

Now, we will combine the terms on the left side of the equation. First, we can rewrite the equation:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we need a common denominator to combine \( 2x \) and \( \frac{x}{2} \). The common denominator is 2:
\[
2x = \frac{4x}{2}
\]

Now we can rewrite the equation:
\[
\frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

Combining the fractions:
\[
\frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

Next, we isolate the term with \( x \) by subtracting 4 from both sides:
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 19 - 4
\]
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 15
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of tennis balls retrieved in each set:

- Second set: \( x = 6 \)
- First set: \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \)
- Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)

Finally, we can verify the total:
\[
10 + 6 + 3 = 19
\]

Thus, the calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]

Response:
Let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in each set:

- Let \( x \) be the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set.
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls (four more than in the second set).
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls (half as many as in the second set).

According to the problem, the total number of tennis balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. We can set up the following equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[
   x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19
   \]
   This gives:
   \[
   4x + 8 + x = 38
   \]

3. Combine the \( x \) terms:
   \[
   5x + 8 = 38
   \]

4. Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   5x = 30
   \]

5. Divide by 5:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of tennis balls retrieved in each set:

- Second set: \( x = 6 \)
- First set: \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \)
- Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)

Finally, let's verify the total:
\[
10 + 6 + 3 = 19
\]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]
