Question ID: 306

Question:
A bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning and half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. How many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon?


Reference Answer:
60 x 2/3 = <<60*2/3=40>>40 loaves of bread are sold in the morning.
60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon and evening.
Therefore, 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.
#### 10

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of loaves produced**:  
   The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

2. **Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning**:  
   According to the problem, two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning.  
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales**:  
   To find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales, we subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning from the total number of loaves produced.  
   \[
   \text{Loaves left} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]

4. **Determine how many loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening**:  
   The problem states that half of what is left (20 loaves) is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. First, we need to calculate half of the loaves left.  
   \[
   \text{Half of loaves left} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon**:  
   Since the loaves sold in the afternoon and evening are equal, we divide the 10 loaves by 2 to find the number sold in the afternoon.  
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that **5 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon**.

   \[
   \text{Loaves left} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]

4. **Determine how many loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening**:  
   The problem states that half of what is left (20 loaves) is sold equally in the afternoon and evening.  
   First, we calculate half of the remaining loaves:  
   \[
   \text{Half of loaves left} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon**:  
   Since the loaves sold in the afternoon and evening are equal, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of the 10 loaves calculated above.  
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
   \]

6. **Final answer**:  
   The number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is \( \boxed{5} \).

3. **Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales**:  
   After selling 40 loaves in the morning, we need to find out how many loaves are left.  
   \[
   \text{Loaves left} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]

4. **Determine how many loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening**:

   \]

5. **Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon**:  
   Since the 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, we divide this number by 2 to find out how many are sold in the afternoon:  
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that **5 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon**.
