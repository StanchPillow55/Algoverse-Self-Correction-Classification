Question ID: 110

Question:
Marcell and Beatrice are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, so they unroll as many as they can find. Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Beatrice's was two roll-ups wide and 24 rolls up long while Marcell's was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. If they both ate their entire amount, how many did they eat on average?


Reference Answer:
Beatrice ate 48 because 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48.
Marcell ate 42 because 14 x 3 = <<14*3=42>>42
In total they ate 90 because 48 + 42 = <<48+42=90>>90
On average they ate 45 because 90 / 2 = <<90/2=45>>45
#### 45

Response:
To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate in total and then calculate the average, we will first determine the total number of roll-ups each person consumed.

1. **Calculate Beatrice's total roll-ups:**
   - Beatrice's roll-up dimensions are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
   - To find the total number of roll-ups Beatrice has, we multiply the width by the length:
     \[
     \text{Total roll-ups for Beatrice} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} = 2 \times 24 = 48
     \]

2. **Calculate Marcell's total roll-ups:**
   - Marcell's roll-up dimensions are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
   - Similarly, we calculate the total number of roll-ups Marcell has:
     \[
     \text{Total roll-ups for Marcell} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} = 3 \times 14 = 42
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of roll-ups eaten by both:**
   - Now, we add the total roll-ups eaten by Beatrice and Marcell:
     \[
     \text{Total roll-ups} = \text{Total for Beatrice} + \text{Total for Marcell} = 48 + 42 = 90
     \]

4. **Calculate the average number of roll-ups eaten:**
   - To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of participants (which is 2):
     \[
     \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total roll-ups}}{\text{Number of participants}} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
     \]

Thus, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is \( \boxed{45} \).
