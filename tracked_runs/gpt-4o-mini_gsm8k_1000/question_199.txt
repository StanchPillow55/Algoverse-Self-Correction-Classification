Question ID: 793

Question:
Jamie earns $20 per hour for 8 hours of work each day. Should she need to work additional hours, she is paid a special hourly rate that is 150% of her regular hourly rate. Last Tuesday, she worked 11 hours. How much was she paid, in dollars, for her work that day?


Reference Answer:
The first 8 hours pay 20*8=<<20*8=160>>160.
The overtime hourly rate is 1.50*20=$<<1.50*20=30>>30/hr.
She worked 11-8=<<11-8=3>>3 overtime hours
Then the additional 3 hours pay 3*30=<<3*30=90>>90.
She was paid 160+90=<<160+90=250>>250.

Response:
To determine how much Jamie was paid for her work last Tuesday, we need to break down her earnings based on her regular hourly rate and the special hourly rate for any overtime hours.

1. **Calculate Jamie's regular hourly rate:**
   Jamie earns $20 per hour.

2. **Determine the number of regular hours she worked:**
   Jamie worked a total of 11 hours last Tuesday. However, her regular work hours are 8 hours. Therefore, the number of regular hours she worked is:
   \[
   \text{Regular hours} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of overtime hours:**
   Overtime hours are the hours worked beyond the regular 8 hours. Since Jamie worked 11 hours, the number of overtime hours is:
   \[
   \text{Overtime hours} = 11 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate Jamie's earnings for regular hours:**
   For the regular 8 hours, Jamie earns:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from regular hours} = \text{Regular hours} \times \text{Regular hourly rate}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Earnings from regular hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the special hourly rate for overtime:**
   The special hourly rate for overtime is 150% of her regular hourly rate. To find this, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Special hourly rate} = 1.5 \times \text{Regular hourly rate} = 1.5 \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars/hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate Jamie's earnings for overtime hours:**
   For the 3 overtime hours, Jamie earns:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from overtime hours} = \text{Overtime hours} \times \text{Special hourly rate}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Earnings from overtime hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ dollars/hour} = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Calculate total earnings for the day:**
   Now, we add her earnings from regular hours and overtime hours to find her total earnings for the day:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from regular hours} + \text{Earnings from overtime hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 160 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Jamie was paid a total of **$250** for her work last Tuesday.

Final answer: **$250**
