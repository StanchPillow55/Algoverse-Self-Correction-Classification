Question ID: 750

Question:
Candy has a chair rental business. During the weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day; but during weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. If this continues, how many chairs in total will Candy be able to rent out in two 4-week months?


Reference Answer:
During weekdays, a total of 60 x 5 = <<60*5=300>>300 chairs are rented.
During the weekends, a total of 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200 chairs are rented.
In a week, 300 + 200 = <<300+200=500>>500 chairs are rented.
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, 500 x 4 = <<500*4=2000>>2000 chairs are rented in a month.
Thus, a total of 2000 x 2 = <<2000*2=4000>>4000 chairs are rented in two months.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented out by Candy over two 4-week months, taking into account the different rental rates for weekdays and weekends.

### Step 1: Determine the number of weekdays and weekends in two 4-week months.

A 4-week month consists of:
- 4 weeks × 7 days/week = 28 days

Since we have two 4-week months:
- 2 months × 28 days/month = 56 days

Now, we need to determine how many of these days are weekdays and how many are weekends. In a typical week:
- There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday)
- There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday)

### Step 2: Calculate the number of weekdays and weekends in 56 days.

To find the number of complete weeks in 56 days:
- 56 days ÷ 7 days/week = 8 weeks

Now we can calculate the total number of weekdays and weekends:
- Total weekdays in 8 weeks = 8 weeks × 5 weekdays/week = 40 weekdays
- Total weekends in 8 weeks = 8 weeks × 2 weekend days/week = 16 weekend days

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of chairs rented.

Now we can calculate the total number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends.

**Chairs rented on weekdays:**
- Chairs rented per weekday = 60
- Total chairs rented on weekdays = 40 weekdays × 60 chairs/weekday = 2400 chairs

**Chairs rented on weekends:**
- Chairs rented per weekend day = 100
- Total chairs rented on weekends = 16 weekend days × 100 chairs/weekend day = 1600 chairs

### Step 4: Calculate the total chairs rented over the two months.

Now we add the total chairs rented on weekdays and weekends:
\[
\text{Total chairs rented} = \text{Total chairs on weekdays} + \text{Total chairs on weekends}
\]
\[
\text{Total chairs rented} = 2400 + 1600 = 4000
\]

### Final Answer:
Candy will be able to rent out a total of **4000 chairs** in two 4-week months.
