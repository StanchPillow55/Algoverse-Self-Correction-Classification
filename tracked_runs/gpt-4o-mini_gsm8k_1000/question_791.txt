Question ID: 772

Question:
Tatiana is deciding how much of her weekend she wants to spend playing soccer. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. She is dividing her time between soccer, video games, and reading. If she reads for 3 hours and plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, what percentage of her weekend does she spend playing soccer?


Reference Answer:
She has 12 hours for her activities because 7 + 5 = <<7+5=12>>12
After reading, she has 9 hours left because 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9
She spends 3 hours playing video games because 9 x (1/3) = <<9*(1/3)=3>>3
After video games she has 6 hours left for soccer because 9 - 3 = <<6=6>>6
The proportion of time spend on soccer is .5 because 6 / 12 = <<6/12=.5>>.5
The percentage of time spent on soccer is 50 because .5 x 100 = <<50=50>>50
#### 50

Response:
To determine what percentage of Tatiana's weekend she spends playing soccer, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time available over the weekend.**
   - Saturday: 7 hours
   - Sunday: 5 hours
   - Total time = 7 hours + 5 hours = 12 hours

2. **Determine the time spent reading.**
   - Tatiana reads for 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the remaining time after reading.**
   - Remaining time = Total time - Time spent reading
   - Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

4. **Determine the time spent playing video games.**
   - Tatiana plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time.
   - Time spent on video games = (1/3) * Remaining time
   - Time spent on video games = (1/3) * 9 hours = 3 hours

5. **Calculate the time spent playing soccer.**
   - To find the time spent playing soccer, we subtract the time spent reading and playing video games from the total time.
   - Time spent on soccer = Total time - Time spent reading - Time spent on video games
   - Time spent on soccer = 12 hours - 3 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

6. **Calculate the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer.**
   - Percentage of time spent on soccer = (Time spent on soccer / Total time) * 100%
   - Percentage of time spent on soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100% = 0.5 * 100% = 50%

Thus, Tatiana spends **50%** of her weekend playing soccer.

Final answer: **50%**
