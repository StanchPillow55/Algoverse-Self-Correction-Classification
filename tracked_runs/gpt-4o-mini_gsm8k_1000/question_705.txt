Question ID: 92

Question:
Emily has 4 kids named Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. If James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey, how old is Jackson?


Reference Answer:
James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = <<10+1=11>>11 years old
Amy is 2 years younger than Corey so is 11 - 2 = 9 years old
Amy is also 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = <<9-5=4>>4 years old

Response:
To solve the problem, let's define the ages of each child based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
   - Amy's age can be expressed as \( J + 5 \) (since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson).
   - Corey's age can be expressed as \( (J + 5) + 2 = J + 7 \) (since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey).
   - James's age is given as 10 years old.

2. **Relate James's Age to Corey's Age**:
   - We know that James is 1 year younger than Corey. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:
   \[
   \text{James's age} = \text{Corey's age} - 1
   \]
   Substituting James's age:
   \[
   10 = (J + 7) - 1
   \]

3. **Solve for Jackson's Age**:
   - Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   10 = J + 7 - 1
   \]
   \[
   10 = J + 6
   \]
   Now, isolate \( J \):
   \[
   J = 10 - 6
   \]
   \[
   J = 4
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Jackson's age is \( 4 \) years old.

5. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify the ages of all the kids:
     - Jackson: \( J = 4 \)
     - Amy: \( J + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9 \)
     - Corey: \( J + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \)
     - James: \( 10 \) (given)
   - Check the relationships:
     - Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( 9 - 4 = 5 \) (correct)
     - Corey is 2 years older than Amy: \( 11 - 9 = 2 \) (correct)
     - James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( 11 - 10 = 1 \) (correct)

All relationships hold true, confirming our solution.

**Final Answer**: Jackson is \( 4 \) years old.
