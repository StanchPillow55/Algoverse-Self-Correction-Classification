Question ID: 573

Question:
Katina has $3000 in her savings account. If she removes $100 from the account every month, how much money will be remaining within the account after 2 years?


Reference Answer:
A year has 12 months, and since she withdraws money from the account every month, after 2 years, she will have withdrawn money for 2*12= <<24=24>>24 months.
Since she withdraws money from the account every month, after 24 months, she would have withdrawn 24*$100 = $<<24*100=2400>>2400.
The total amount of money remaining in the account after two years is $3000-$2400= $<<3000-2400=600>>600
#### 600

Response:
To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial amount in the savings account**: 
   Katina starts with $3000.

2. **Determine how much she withdraws each month**: 
   Katina withdraws $100 every month.

3. **Calculate the total number of months in 2 years**: 
   Since there are 12 months in a year, in 2 years there are:
   \[
   2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount withdrawn over 2 years**: 
   If she withdraws $100 each month for 24 months, the total amount withdrawn is:
   \[
   100 \text{ dollars/month} \times 24 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining balance in the savings account**: 
   To find out how much money will be left in the account after 2 years, we subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount:
   \[
   3000 \text{ dollars} - 2400 \text{ dollars} = 600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, after 2 years, the amount remaining in Katina's savings account will be:

\[
\boxed{600} \text{ dollars}
\]
