Question ID: 1285

Question:
The recent floods in Mamouâ€™s country have left many families without food or shelter. To help, Mamou has volunteered to distribute 1,360 meals to the affected families. She gave out 64 meals on Friday, 30 meals on Saturday, and 48 meals on Sunday. How many meals does she have left to distribute?


Reference Answer:
On Friday, Saturday and Sunday, Mamou distributed a total of 64 meals + 30 meals + 48 meals = <<64+30+48=142>>142 meals
The remaining meals are 1,360 meals - 142 meals = <<1360-142=1218>>1,218 meals

Response:
To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to start with the total number of meals she has and subtract the number of meals she has already distributed over the three days.

1. **Total meals**: Mamou starts with 1,360 meals.

2. **Meals distributed**:
   - On Friday, she distributed 64 meals.
   - On Saturday, she distributed 30 meals.
   - On Sunday, she distributed 48 meals.

3. **Calculate the total meals distributed**:
   We need to add the meals distributed on each day together:
   \[
   \text{Total meals distributed} = \text{Meals on Friday} + \text{Meals on Saturday} + \text{Meals on Sunday}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total meals distributed} = 64 + 30 + 48
   \]

   Now, let's perform the addition step-by-step:
   - First, add Friday and Saturday:
     \[
     64 + 30 = 94
     \]
   - Next, add the result to the meals distributed on Sunday:
     \[
     94 + 48 = 142
     \]

   So, the total number of meals distributed over the three days is 142 meals.

4. **Calculate the remaining meals**:
   Now we subtract the total meals distributed from the initial total:
   \[
   \text{Remaining meals} = \text{Total meals} - \text{Total meals distributed}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining meals} = 1360 - 142
   \]

   Let's perform this subtraction:
   - Start with 1360 and subtract 142:
     \[
     1360 - 142 = 1218
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1218}
\]
