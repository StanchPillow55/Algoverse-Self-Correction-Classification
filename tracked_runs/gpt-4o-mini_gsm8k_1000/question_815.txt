Question ID: 255

Question:
Ten stalls have 20 cows each. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally, putting an equal number of the new cows into each of the twenty stalls. How many cows are in 8 of the stalls?


Reference Answer:
When Mr. Sylas puts an equal number of the cows he bought into the stalls, each stall gets 40/10 = <<40/10=4>>4 new cows.
Each of the stalls gets four cows, meaning a total of 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 cows are placed into eight of the stalls.
Since each stall had 20 cows before Mr. Sylas added four into each of the stalls, the total number of cows in eight of the stalls was 8*20= <<8*20=160>>160 cows.
There are 160+32 = <<160+32=192>>192 cows in eight stalls after Mr. Sylas adds four into each of the stalls.
#### 192

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of cows in the stalls**: 
   - There are 10 stalls, and each stall has 20 cows.
   - Therefore, the total number of cows in all stalls initially is:
     \[
     \text{Total initial cows} = 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of new cows Mr. Sylas buys**:
   - Mr. Sylas buys 40 new cows.

3. **Calculate the total number of cows after Mr. Sylas adds the new cows**:
   - The total number of cows after adding the new cows is:
     \[
     \text{Total cows after purchase} = 200 \text{ initial cows} + 40 \text{ new cows} = 240 \text{ cows}
     \]

4. **Determine how many stalls there are**:
   - There are 20 stalls in total.

5. **Calculate how many cows are placed in each stall**:
   - The total number of cows (240) will be divided equally among the 20 stalls. Therefore, the number of cows in each stall is:
     \[
     \text{Cows per stall} = \frac{240 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 12 \text{ cows/stall}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total number of cows in 8 stalls**:
   - To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by the number of stalls:
     \[
     \text{Cows in 8 stalls} = 12 \text{ cows/stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 96 \text{ cows}
     \]

Finally, the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
\[
\boxed{96}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of cows in the stalls**:
   - There are 10 stalls, and each stall has 20 cows.
   - Therefore, the total number of cows in all stalls initially is:
     \[
     \text{Total initial cows} = \text{Number of stalls} \times \text{Cows per stall} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ cows}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of new cows Mr. Sylas buys**:
   - Mr. Sylas buys 40 new cows.

3. **Calculate the total number of cows after the purchase**:
   - The total number of cows after Mr. Sylas buys the new cows is:
     \[
     \text{Total cows after purchase} = \text{Total initial cows} + \text{New cows} = 200 + 40 = 240 \text{ cows}
     \]

4. **Distribute the new cows equally among the stalls**:
   - There are 20 stalls in total, and Mr. Sylas will distribute the 40 new cows equally among these stalls.
   - The number of new cows per stall is:
     \[
     \text{New cows per stall} = \frac{\text{New cows}}{\text{Number of stalls}} = \frac{40}{20} = 2 \text{ cows per stall}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of cows in each stall after distribution**:
   - Each stall originally had 20 cows, and now each stall receives an additional 2 cows.
   - Therefore, the total number of cows in each stall after the distribution is:
     \[
     \text{Total cows per stall} = \text{Original cows per stall} + \text{New cows per stall} = 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ cows per stall}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total number of cows in 8 stalls**:
   - To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by the number of stalls:
     \[
     \text{Total cows in 8 stalls} = \text{Cows per stall} \times \text{Number of stalls} = 22 \times 8 = 176 \text{ cows}
     \]

Finally, the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
\[
\boxed{176}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of cows in the stalls**:
   - There are 10 stalls, and each stall has 20 cows.
   - Total number of cows in all stalls = Number of stalls Ã— Cows per stall
   \[
   \text{Total cows} = 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows}
   \]

2. **Add the new cows that Mr. Sylas buys**:
   - Mr. Sylas buys 40 additional cows.
   - Total number of cows after the purchase = Initial cows + New cows
   \[
   \text{Total cows after purchase} = 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows}
   \]

3. **Distribute the new cows equally among the stalls**:
   - There are 20 stalls in total.
   - To find out how many cows will be in each stall after distributing the new cows, we divide the total number of cows by the number of stalls.
   \[
   \text{Cows per stall} = \frac{\text{Total cows}}{\text{Number of stalls}} = \frac{240 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 12 \text{ cows/stall}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of cows in 8 of the stalls**:
   - Since each stall now has 12 cows, we can find the total number of cows in 8 stalls by multiplying the number of cows per stall by the number of stalls we are considering.
   \[
   \text{Cows in 8 stalls} = 12 \text{ cows/stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 96 \text{ cows}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
   \[
   \boxed{96}
   \]
