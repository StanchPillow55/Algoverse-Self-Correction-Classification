Question ID: 104

Question:
Poppy is solving a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, then her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. How many jigsaw pieces are left to be placed?


Reference Answer:
Poppy has placed 1000 pieces / 4 = <<1000/4=250>>250 pieces.
This means there are 1000 – 250 = <<1000-250=750>>750 pieces remaining.
Her mom therefore places 750 / 3 = <<750/3=250>>250 pieces.
This leaves a total of 750 – 250 = <<750-250=500>>500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.
#### 500

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Total Pieces in the Puzzle**: 
   Poppy has a total of 1000 pieces in her jigsaw puzzle.

2. **Pieces Placed by Poppy**: 
   Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board. To find out how many pieces this is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]

3. **Remaining Pieces After Poppy's Placement**: 
   After Poppy places 250 pieces, we need to find out how many pieces are left. We subtract the number of pieces Poppy placed from the total:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

4. **Pieces Placed by Poppy's Mom**: 
   Poppy's mom then places a third of the remaining pieces. We need to calculate how many pieces this is:
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Mom} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]

5. **Remaining Pieces After Mom's Placement**: 
   Now we find out how many pieces are left after Poppy's mom places her pieces. We subtract the number of pieces placed by her mom from the remaining pieces:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 750 - 250 = 500
   \]

6. **Final Answer**: 
   The number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:
   \[
   \boxed{500}
   \] 

Thus, after Poppy and her mom have placed their pieces, there are 500 pieces remaining to be placed in the puzzle.
