Question ID: 1175

Question:
In the first half of a soccer match, team A scores 4 goals while team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A. In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. What's the total number of goals scored in the match?


Reference Answer:
In the first half, team B scores 4 goals - 2 goals = <<4-2=2>>2 goals.
The total number of goals scored in the first half is 2 goals + 4 goals = <<2+4=6>>6 goals
During the second half, team B scores 4 goals * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 goals.
Team A 1/4 * 8 goals = <<1/4*8=2>>2 goals in the second half.
The total number of goals in the second half is 8 goals + 2 goals = <<8+2=10>>10 goals
The total number of goals in the match is 6 goals + 10 goals = <<6+10=16>>16 goals

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the goals scored by each team in both halves of the match.

### Step 1: Goals Scored in the First Half

- **Team A** scores 4 goals in the first half.
- **Team B** scores 2 goals fewer than Team A. Therefore, the goals scored by Team B can be calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Goals by Team B} = \text{Goals by Team A} - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2
  \]

### Summary of First Half Goals:
- Team A: 4 goals
- Team B: 2 goals

### Step 2: Goals Scored in the Second Half

Next, we need to determine how many goals Team B scores in the second half. According to the problem, Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half:
\[
\text{Goals by Team B in the second half} = 4 \times \text{Goals by Team B in the first half} = 4 \times 2 = 8
\]

Now, we need to find out how many goals Team A scores in the second half. The problem states that Team A scores \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Thus, we can calculate Team A's goals in the second half as follows:
\[
\text{Goals by Team A in the second half} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Goals by Team B in the second half} = \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2
\]

### Summary of Second Half Goals:
- Team A: 2 goals
- Team B: 8 goals

### Step 3: Total Goals Scored in the Match

Now, we can calculate the total goals scored by each team throughout the match by adding the goals from both halves.

**Total Goals by Team A:**
\[
\text{Total Goals by Team A} = \text{Goals in the first half} + \text{Goals in the second half} = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

**Total Goals by Team B:**
\[
\text{Total Goals by Team B} = \text{Goals in the first half} + \text{Goals in the second half} = 2 + 8 = 10
\]

### Final Calculation of Total Goals in the Match:
\[
\text{Total Goals in the Match} = \text{Total Goals by Team A} + \text{Total Goals by Team B} = 6 + 10 = 16
\]

### Final Answer:
The total number of goals scored in the match is \( \boxed{16} \).
