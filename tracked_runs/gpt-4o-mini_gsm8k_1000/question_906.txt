Question ID: 876

Question:
Amy is taking a history test. She correctly answers 80% of the multiple-choice questions, 90% of the true/false questions, and 60% of the long-answer questions. The multiple-choice and true/false questions are worth 1 point each, and the long answer questions are worth 5 points each. How many points does Amy score if there are 10 multiple-choice questions, 20 true/false questions, and 5 long answer questions?


Reference Answer:
First find the number of multiple-choice questions Amy gets right: 80% * 10 questions = <<80*.01*10=8>>8 questions
Then find the number of true/false questions she gets right: 90% * 20 questions = <<90*.01*20=18>>18 questions
Now add those two numbers to find the number of 1-point questions she answered correctly: 8 questions + 18 questions = <<8+18=26>>26 questions. This is also the number of points she got, since each question is worth 1 point.
Now find the number of 5-point questions Amy answered correctly: 5 questions * 60% = <<5*60*.01=3>>3 questions
Now multiply that number by the number of points per question: 3 questions * 5 points/question = <<3*5=15>>15 points
Now add the points from the 1-point and 5-point questions: 26 points + 15 points = <<26+15=41>>41 points
#### 41

Response:
To find out how many points Amy scores on her history test, we will calculate the points she earns from each type of question separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate points from multiple-choice questions

- **Total multiple-choice questions**: 10
- **Percentage answered correctly**: 80%

To find the number of questions Amy answered correctly, we calculate:
\[
\text{Correct answers (MC)} = 10 \times 0.80 = 8
\]

Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, the total points from multiple-choice questions is:
\[
\text{Points from MC} = 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate points from true/false questions

- **Total true/false questions**: 20
- **Percentage answered correctly**: 90%

To find the number of questions Amy answered correctly, we calculate:
\[
\text{Correct answers (TF)} = 20 \times 0.90 = 18
\]

Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, the total points from true/false questions is:
\[
\text{Points from TF} = 18 \times 1 = 18 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate points from long-answer questions

- **Total long-answer questions**: 5
- **Percentage answered correctly**: 60%

To find the number of questions Amy answered correctly, we calculate:
\[
\text{Correct answers (LA)} = 5 \times 0.60 = 3
\]

Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, the total points from long-answer questions is:
\[
\text{Points from LA} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 4: Sum all points

Now, we add the points from all types of questions:
\[
\text{Total points} = \text{Points from MC} + \text{Points from TF} + \text{Points from LA}
\]
\[
\text{Total points} = 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 \text{ points}
\]

### Final Answer

Amy scores a total of **41 points** on her history test.

Response:
To determine Amy's total score on her history test, we will break down the problem into several steps, calculating her scores for each type of question separately and then summing them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the score from multiple-choice questions

1. **Total multiple-choice questions**: 10
2. **Percentage answered correctly**: 80%
3. **Number of correct answers**: 
   \[
   \text{Correct answers} = 10 \times 0.80 = 8
   \]
4. **Points per correct answer**: 1 point
5. **Total points from multiple-choice questions**:
   \[
   \text{Points from multiple-choice} = 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ points}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the score from true/false questions

1. **Total true/false questions**: 20
2. **Percentage answered correctly**: 90%
3. **Number of correct answers**:
   \[
   \text{Correct answers} = 20 \times 0.90 = 18
   \]
4. **Points per correct answer**: 1 point
5. **Total points from true/false questions**:
   \[
   \text{Points from true/false} = 18 \times 1 = 18 \text{ points}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the score from long-answer questions

1. **Total long-answer questions**: 5
2. **Percentage answered correctly**: 60%
3. **Number of correct answers**:
   \[
   \text{Correct answers} = 5 \times 0.60 = 3
   \]
4. **Points per correct answer**: 5 points
5. **Total points from long-answer questions**:
   \[
   \text{Points from long-answer} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ points}
   \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total score

Now, we will sum the points from all types of questions:
\[
\text{Total score} = \text{Points from multiple-choice} + \text{Points from true/false} + \text{Points from long-answer}
\]
\[
\text{Total score} = 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 \text{ points}
\]

### Final Answer

Amy scores a total of **41 points** on her history test.

Response:
To determine Amy's total score on her history test, we need to calculate the points she earns from each type of question based on the percentages of correct answers she provided. We will break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Points from Multiple-Choice Questions

1. **Total Multiple-Choice Questions**: 10
2. **Percentage Correct**: 80%

To find the number of questions Amy answered correctly, we calculate:
\[
\text{Correct Answers} = \text{Total Questions} \times \left(\frac{\text{Percentage Correct}}{100}\right)
\]
\[
\text{Correct Answers} = 10 \times \left(\frac{80}{100}\right) = 10 \times 0.8 = 8
\]

Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, the total points from multiple-choice questions is:
\[
\text{Points from Multiple-Choice} = \text{Correct Answers} \times 1 = 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Points from True/False Questions

1. **Total True/False Questions**: 20
2. **Percentage Correct**: 90%

Using the same formula:
\[
\text{Correct Answers} = 20 \times \left(\frac{90}{100}\right) = 20 \times 0.9 = 18
\]

Each true/false question is also worth 1 point, so the total points from true/false questions is:
\[
\text{Points from True/False} = \text{Correct Answers} \times 1 = 18 \times 1 = 18 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Points from Long-Answer Questions

1. **Total Long-Answer Questions**: 5
2. **Percentage Correct**: 60%

Again, applying the formula:
\[
\text{Correct Answers} = 5 \times \left(\frac{60}{100}\right) = 5 \times 0.6 = 3
\]

Each long-answer question is worth 5 points, so the total points from long-answer questions is:
\[
\text{Points from Long-Answer} = \text{Correct Answers} \times 5 = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Score

Now we sum the points from all types of questions:
\[
\text{Total Score} = \text{Points from Multiple-Choice} + \text{Points from True/False} + \text{Points from Long-Answer}
\]
\[
\text{Total Score} = 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 \text{ points}
\]

### Final Answer

Amy scores a total of **41 points** on her history test.
