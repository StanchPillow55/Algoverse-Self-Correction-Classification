Question:
John and Jack have 30 minutes to walk to school together. It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is. It takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. How much longer do they have to get to school without being late?


Reference Answer:
John and Jack arrive at the library with 30 - 6 = <<30-6=24>>24 minutes left to reach the fire station.
They then arrive at the fire station and have 24 - 13 = <<24-13=11>>11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much time John and Jack have left to reach school after walking to the library and the fire station.

1. **Total Time Available**: John and Jack have a total of 30 minutes to walk to school.

2. **Time to the Library**: It takes them 6 minutes to walk to the library.

3. **Time from the Library to the Fire Station**: After reaching the library, it takes them another 13 minutes to walk to the fire station.

4. **Total Time Spent Walking to the Fire Station**:
   - Time to the library: 6 minutes
   - Time from the library to the fire station: 13 minutes
   - Total time spent = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

5. **Time Remaining to Get to School**:
   - Total time available: 30 minutes
   - Time spent walking to the fire station: 19 minutes
   - Time remaining = Total time available - Time spent walking
   - Time remaining = 30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

Thus, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

**Final Answer**: They have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.
