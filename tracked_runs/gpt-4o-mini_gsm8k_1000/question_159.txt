Question ID: 1240

Question:
Elly is organizing her books on the new bookcases her parents bought her. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. If she has 110 books, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?


Reference Answer:
The bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.
The 2 middle shelves can hold a total of 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.
The top shelf can hold 20 â€“ 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 books.
Each bookcase can hold a total of 20 books + 20 books + 15 books = <<20+20+15=55>>55 books.
To hold all of her books, she needs 110 / 55 = <<110/55=2>>2 bookcases.

Response:
To determine how many bookcases Elly needs to hold all her books, we first need to calculate the total capacity of one bookcase based on the information provided about the shelves.

1. **Middle Shelves Capacity**:
   - Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
   - There are 2 middle shelves.
   - Total capacity of the middle shelves = \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) books.

2. **Bottom Shelf Capacity**:
   - The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf.
   - Therefore, the bottom shelf can hold \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) books.

3. **Top Shelf Capacity**:
   - The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf.
   - Since the bottom shelf holds 20 books, the top shelf can hold \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) books.

4. **Total Capacity of One Bookcase**:
   - Now, we can find the total capacity of one bookcase by adding the capacities of all the shelves:
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = \text{Middle shelves} + \text{Bottom shelf} + \text{Top shelf}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 \text{ books}
   \]

5. **Calculating the Number of Bookcases Needed**:
   - Elly has a total of 110 books.
   - To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
   \[
   \text{Number of bookcases} = \frac{\text{Total books}}{\text{Capacity of one bookcase}} = \frac{110}{55} = 2
   \]

Since 110 books can be perfectly accommodated in 2 bookcases, we conclude that Elly needs **2 bookcases** to hold all her books.

**Final Answer**: Elly needs 2 bookcases.
