Question ID: 1096

Question:
Billy is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes. He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. If he takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off, and helps people on all the other days. How many people does he help? (Remember there are 31 days in March.)


Reference Answer:
First find the number of days between March 1st and April 19th: 31 days + 19 days = <<31+19=50>>50 days
Then subtract the percentage of time Billy takes off from 100% to find the percentage of time he works: 100% - 20% = 80%
Then multiply that number by 80% to find the number of days Billy works: 50 days * 80% = <<50*80*.01=40>>40 days
Then find how many people Billy can help per day: 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = <<2*3=6>>6 people/day
Then multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works to find the total number of people he helps: 6 people/day * 40 days = <<6*40=240>>240 people

Response:
To determine how many people Billy helps with their taxes, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**
2. **Determine how many days Billy takes off.**
3. **Calculate the number of days he actually works.**
4. **Calculate the total number of people he helps.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of days

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Now, we add these two periods together:

\[
\text{Total days} = 31 \text{ (March)} + 19 \text{ (April)} = 50 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many days Billy takes off

Billy takes 20% of the total days off. We calculate 20% of 50 days:

\[
\text{Days off} = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of days he actually works

To find out how many days Billy works, we subtract the days he takes off from the total days:

\[
\text{Days worked} = 50 \text{ (total days)} - 10 \text{ (days off)} = 40 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of people he helps

Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. Therefore, the number of people he helps in one day is:

\[
\text{People helped per day} = 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ people}
\]

Now, we multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works:

\[
\text{Total people helped} = 6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people}
\]

### Final Answer

Billy helps a total of **240 people** with their taxes.
