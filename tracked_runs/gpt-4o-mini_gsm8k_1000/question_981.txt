Question ID: 1261

Question:
Alicia's clothes have to be sent to the dry cleaners weekly.  Her weekly drop-off includes 5 blouses, 2 pants and 1 skirt.  If they charge her $5.00 per blouse, $6.00 per skirt and $8.00 per pair of pants, how much does she spend on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks?


Reference Answer:
The blouses cost $5.00 each to dry clean and she has 5 so that's 5*5 = $<<5*5=25.00>>25.00
The one skirt she has costs $6.00 to dry clean
The pants cost $8.00 to dry clean and she has 2 pairs so that's 8*2 = $<<8*2=16.00>>16.00
In one week she spends 25+6+16 = $<<25+6+16=47.00>>47.00 on dry cleaning
Over 5 weeks, she will spend 5*47 = $<<5*47=235.00>>235.00 on dry cleaning

Response:
To determine how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we first need to calculate her weekly dry-cleaning costs based on the number of items she sends to the cleaners and their respective prices.

### Step 1: Calculate the weekly cost

Alicia's weekly drop-off includes:
- 5 blouses
- 2 pairs of pants
- 1 skirt

Now, we will calculate the cost for each type of clothing item:

1. **Cost for blouses**:
   - Price per blouse = $5.00
   - Number of blouses = 5
   - Total cost for blouses = \( 5 \text{ blouses} \times 5 \text{ dollars/blouse} = 25 \text{ dollars} \)

2. **Cost for pants**:
   - Price per pair of pants = $8.00
   - Number of pairs of pants = 2
   - Total cost for pants = \( 2 \text{ pants} \times 8 \text{ dollars/pant} = 16 \text{ dollars} \)

3. **Cost for skirt**:
   - Price per skirt = $6.00
   - Number of skirts = 1
   - Total cost for skirt = \( 1 \text{ skirt} \times 6 \text{ dollars/skirt} = 6 \text{ dollars} \)

### Step 2: Add up the weekly costs

Now, we will sum the costs of all the items to find the total weekly cost:

\[
\text{Total weekly cost} = \text{Total cost for blouses} + \text{Total cost for pants} + \text{Total cost for skirt}
\]

\[
\text{Total weekly cost} = 25 \text{ dollars} + 16 \text{ dollars} + 6 \text{ dollars} = 47 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 5 weeks

To find out how much Alicia spends in 5 weeks, we multiply the total weekly cost by 5:

\[
\text{Total cost for 5 weeks} = \text{Total weekly cost} \times 5
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for 5 weeks} = 47 \text{ dollars/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 235 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Alicia spends a total of **$235.00** on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.

Response:
To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we first need to calculate her weekly dry-cleaning cost and then multiply that by 5.

1. **Calculate the cost for each type of clothing:**
   - **Blouses:** 
     - Cost per blouse = $5.00
     - Number of blouses = 5
     - Total cost for blouses = 5 blouses × $5.00/blouse = $25.00

   - **Pants:** 
     - Cost per pair of pants = $8.00
     - Number of pants = 2
     - Total cost for pants = 2 pants × $8.00/pant = $16.00

   - **Skirt:** 
     - Cost per skirt = $6.00
     - Number of skirts = 1
     - Total cost for skirts = 1 skirt × $6.00/skirt = $6.00

2. **Calculate the total weekly cost:**
   - Total weekly cost = Total cost for blouses + Total cost for pants + Total cost for skirts
   - Total weekly cost = $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

3. **Calculate the total cost for 5 weeks:**
   - Total cost for 5 weeks = Total weekly cost × 5 weeks
   - Total cost for 5 weeks = $47.00 × 5 = $235.00

Thus, Alicia spends a total of **$235.00** on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks. 

Final answer: **$235.00**

Response:
To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we first need to calculate her weekly dry-cleaning costs.

1. **Calculate the cost for blouses:**
   - Number of blouses: 5
   - Cost per blouse: $5.00
   - Total cost for blouses = Number of blouses × Cost per blouse
   \[
   \text{Total cost for blouses} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost for pants:**
   - Number of pants: 2
   - Cost per pair of pants: $8.00
   - Total cost for pants = Number of pants × Cost per pair of pants
   \[
   \text{Total cost for pants} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost for skirts:**
   - Number of skirts: 1
   - Cost per skirt: $6.00
   - Total cost for skirts = Number of skirts × Cost per skirt
   \[
   \text{Total cost for skirts} = 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weekly cost:**
   - Total weekly cost = Total cost for blouses + Total cost for pants + Total cost for skirts
   \[
   \text{Total weekly cost} = 25 + 16 + 6 = 47 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 5 weeks:**
   - Total cost for 5 weeks = Total weekly cost × Number of weeks
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 5 weeks} = 47 \times 5 = 235 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks is **$235.00**.
