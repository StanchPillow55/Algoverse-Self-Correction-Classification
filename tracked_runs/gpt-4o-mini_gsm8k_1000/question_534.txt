Question ID: 564

Question:
In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night before going to sleep. In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. If she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, how many pages did she read in two weeks?


Reference Answer:
Every night, Judy reads 15 minutes/1.5 minutes = <<15/1.5=10>>10 sets of 2 pages.
So, she read 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 pages every night in the first week.
In the first week, she reads a total of 20 x 7 = <<20*7=140>>140 pages.
Therefore, she read a total of 140 + 100 = <<140+100=240>>240 pages in two weeks.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pages Judy read in total over the two weeks.

### Step 1: Calculate the total reading time in the first week.

Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights in the first week. We can calculate the total reading time as follows:

\[
\text{Total reading time in the first week} = 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many pages she read in the first week.

We know that Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we can set up the following calculation:

\[
\text{Pages per minute} = \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute}
\]

Now, we can calculate how many pages she read in 105 minutes:

\[
\text{Pages read in the first week} = \text{Pages per minute} \times \text{Total reading time in minutes}
\]
\[
\text{Pages read in the first week} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \times 105 \text{ minutes}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Pages read in the first week} = \frac{4 \times 105}{3} = \frac{420}{3} = 140 \text{ pages}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total pages read in the second week.

According to the problem, Judy read a total of 100 pages in the second week.

### Step 4: Calculate the total pages read over the two weeks.

Now, we can find the total number of pages Judy read over the two weeks by adding the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:

\[
\text{Total pages read} = \text{Pages read in the first week} + \text{Pages read in the second week}
\]
\[
\text{Total pages read} = 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

\[
\boxed{240}
\]
