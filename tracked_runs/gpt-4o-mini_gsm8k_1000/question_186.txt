Question ID: 586

Question:
Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. How many ml of water does she need to drink?


Reference Answer:
First find the total calories burned on aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = <<2*500=1000>>1000 calories
Then add the calories burned running to find the total calories burned: 600 calories + 1000 calories = <<600+1000=1600>>1600 calories
Finally, divide that number by the ratio of calories burned to water drunk to find how many water Hannah needs to drink: 1600 calories * 100 ml/200 calories = <<1600*100/200=800>>800 ml

Response:
To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total number of calories she burns during her workouts.

1. **Calculate calories burned during aerobics:**
   - Hannah does aerobics for 2 hours.
   - The calories burned per hour during aerobics is 500 calories/hour.
   - Total calories burned during aerobics:
     \[
     \text{Calories burned during aerobics} = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 500 \, \text{calories/hour} = 1000 \, \text{calories}
     \]

2. **Calculate calories burned while running:**
   - Hannah runs for 1 hour.
   - The calories burned per hour while running is 600 calories/hour.
   - Total calories burned while running:
     \[
     \text{Calories burned while running} = 1 \, \text{hour} \times 600 \, \text{calories/hour} = 600 \, \text{calories}
     \]

3. **Calculate total calories burned:**
   - Now, we add the calories burned from both activities:
     \[
     \text{Total calories burned} = \text{Calories burned during aerobics} + \text{Calories burned while running}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total calories burned} = 1000 \, \text{calories} + 600 \, \text{calories} = 1600 \, \text{calories}
     \]

4. **Calculate the amount of water needed:**
   - Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.
   - First, we find out how many 200-calorie portions are in 1600 calories:
     \[
     \text{Number of 200-calorie portions} = \frac{1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories/portion}} = 8 \, \text{portions}
     \]
   - Since she needs 100 ml of water for each 200-calorie portion, we calculate the total amount of water needed:
     \[
     \text{Total water needed} = 8 \, \text{portions} \times 100 \, \text{ml/portion} = 800 \, \text{ml}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is:
     \[
     \boxed{800 \, \text{ml}}
     \]
