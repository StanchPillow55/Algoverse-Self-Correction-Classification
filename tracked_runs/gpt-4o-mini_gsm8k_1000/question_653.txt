Question:
Last week the IRS received 5168 tax reports. On Monday and Tuesday they received a total of 1907 reports. On Thursday and Friday they received a total of 2136 reports. How many reports did they receive on Wednesday?


Reference Answer:
Mon/Tues = 1907
Thur/Fri = 2136
Mon, Tues, Thur, Fri = 1907 + 2136 = <<1907+2136=4043>>4043
5168 - 4043 = <<5168-4043=1125>>1125 reports
The IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday of last week.

Response:
To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Reports Received**: We know that the IRS received a total of 5168 tax reports last week.

2. **Reports Received on Monday and Tuesday**: The problem states that the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday is 1907.

3. **Reports Received on Thursday and Friday**: The problem also states that the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday is 2136.

4. **Calculating Reports Received on Wednesday**: 
   - We can find the number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total reports received for the week.

   Let's denote:
   - Reports on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
   - Reports on Thursday and Friday = 2136
   - Reports on Wednesday = \( W \)

   The equation we can set up is:
   \[
   W = \text{Total Reports} - (\text{Reports on Monday and Tuesday} + \text{Reports on Thursday and Friday})
   \]

   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   W = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
   \]

5. **Calculating the Sum of Reports on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday**:
   - First, we need to calculate \( 1907 + 2136 \):
   \[
   1907 + 2136 = 4043
   \]

6. **Substituting Back into the Equation**:
   Now we can substitute this sum back into our equation for \( W \):
   \[
   W = 5168 - 4043
   \]

7. **Final Calculation**:
   Now we perform the subtraction:
   \[
   W = 5168 - 4043 = 1125
   \]

Thus, the number of reports received on Wednesday is \( \boxed{1125} \).
