Question ID: 1173

Question:
A regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12. There's currently a special size box for the same price that has 20% more pods. How many dishwashing cycles with the new box can you run for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle?


Reference Answer:
If the regular box has 100 pods and the special one has 20% more, then the new box has 100 * 20% = 20 more pods
If the new one has 20 more pods than the regular one, the new box has a total of 20+100 = <<20+100=120>>120 pods
If the cost of the regular box ($12) is the same as the new box, then the new box also costs $12
If the new box has 120 pods and the price for the box is $12, then each pod costs $12/120 = $<<12/120=0.10>>0.10
If 1 pod costs $0.10 and is used in 1 cycle, then each cycle costs = $<<1*0.10=0.10>>0.10
If 1 cycle costs $0.10, then for $1 I could run $1/$0.1 = 10 cycles

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run with the new box of dishwasher pods that has 20% more pods than the regular box.

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the regular box:**
   The regular box contains 100 dishwasher pods.

2. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box. To find out how many pods this is, we calculate 20% of 100 pods:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ pods}
   \]
   Now, we add this to the original 100 pods:
   \[
   \text{Total pods in the special box} = 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods}
   \]

3. **Determine the cost per pod:**
   The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:
   \[
   \text{Cost per pod} = \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}
   \]

4. **Calculate how many cycles can be run for $1:**
   Since each cycle uses 1 pod, we can determine how many cycles can be run for $1 by dividing $1 by the cost per pod:
   \[
   \text{Number of cycles for } \$1 = \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ cycles}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that you can run **10 dishwashing cycles** with the new box for $1.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many dishwasher pods are in the special size box and then calculate how many cycles can be run for $1.

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - The regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box.
   - To find 20% of 100, we calculate:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of pods in the special size box is:
     \[
     100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost per pod:**
   - The cost of the special size box is $12 for 120 pods.
   - To find the cost per pod, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pod} = \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}
     \]

3. **Calculate how many cycles can be run for $1:**
   - Since each cycle uses 1 pod, the number of cycles that can be run for $1 is the amount of money divided by the cost per pod:
     \[
     \text{Number of cycles for } \$1 = \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ cycles}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that you can run **10 dishwashing cycles** for $1 with the new box.

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special box has 20% more pods than the regular box.
   - To find 20% of 100, we calculate:
     \[

     \]
   - Therefore, the number of pods in the special box is:
     \[
     100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost per pod:**
   - The special box costs $12 for 120 pods.
   - To find the cost per pod, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pod} = \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}
     \]

3. **Calculate how many pods can be bought for $1:**
   - To find out how many pods can be purchased for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per pod:
     \[
     \text{Number of pods for } \$1 = \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ pods}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of dishwashing cycles:**
   - Since each cycle uses 1 pod, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 is equal to the number of pods we can buy for $1:
     \[
     \text{Number of cycles} = 10
     \]

**Final Answer:**
You can run **10 dishwashing cycles** with the new box for $1.
