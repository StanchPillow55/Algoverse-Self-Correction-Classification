Question ID: 652

Question:
James hires a horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.  He gets 1 hour free.  The first paid hour is $15 and each hour after that is twice the cost.  How much did he pay?


Reference Answer:
He got it for 9-5=<<9-5=4>>4 hours
He pays for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours
The first hour cost 1*15=$<<1*15=15>>15
The other 3-1=2 hours are more expensive
They cost 15*2=$<<15*2=30>>30 per hour
So those 2 hours cost 2*30=$<<2*30=60>>60
So he pays 60+15=$<<60+15=75>>75 per hours
#### 75

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to break down the time James hires the carriage and calculate the cost based on the pricing structure provided.

1. **Determine the total time hired**: 
   James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM. 
   - Total time = 9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours.

2. **Account for the free hour**: 
   James gets 1 hour free. 
   - Paid hours = Total hours - Free hour = 4 hours - 1 hour = 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the cost for the paid hours**:
   - The first paid hour costs $15.
   - Each hour after the first is twice the cost of the first hour.
   - Therefore, the cost for the second hour is: 
     \[
     2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The cost for the third hour is also:
     \[
     2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Sum the costs**:
   - Total cost = Cost of first hour + Cost of second hour + Cost of third hour
   - Total cost = $15 + $30 + $30
   - Total cost = $15 + $60 = $75.

Thus, the total amount James paid for hiring the horse-drawn carriage is:

\[
\boxed{75} \text{ dollars}
\]
