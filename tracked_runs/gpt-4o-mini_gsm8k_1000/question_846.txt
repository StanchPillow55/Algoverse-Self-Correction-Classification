Question ID: 371

Question:
A shoe store was having a weekend sale on a brand of popular tennis shoes. On Friday the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. The next day they sold double that number of shoes. On the last day of the sale they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, but six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. How many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale?


Reference Answer:
On Saturday 14*2=<<14*2=28>>28 shoes were sold
On Sunday 28/2=<<28/2=14>>14 shoes were sold
Before the returns were made 14+28+14=<<14+28+14=56>>56 pairs of shoes were sold
After the returns were made 56-6=<<56-6=50>>50 pairs of shoe were sold

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of tennis shoes sold each day and accounting for the returns.

1. **Sales on Friday:**
   The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes on Friday.
   \[
   \text{Friday sales} = 14 \text{ pairs}
   \]

2. **Sales on Saturday:**
   On Saturday, the store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday.
   \[
   \text{Saturday sales} = 2 \times \text{Friday sales} = 2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ pairs}
   \]

3. **Sales on Sunday:**
   On Sunday, the store sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday.
   \[
   \text{Sunday sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Saturday sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 = 14 \text{ pairs}
   \]

4. **Returns:**
   On Sunday, 6 people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. We need to subtract these returns from the total sales.
   \[
   \text{Returns} = 6 \text{ pairs}
   \]

5. **Total Sales Calculation:**
   Now, we will calculate the total number of shoes sold over the three days and then subtract the returns.
   \[
   \text{Total sales} = \text{Friday sales} + \text{Saturday sales} + \text{Sunday sales}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total sales} = 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 \text{ pairs}
   \]

6. **Final Calculation:**
   Now we will subtract the returns from the total sales to find the final number of shoes sold.
   \[
   \text{Final total} = \text{Total sales} - \text{Returns} = 56 - 6 = 50 \text{ pairs}
   \]

Thus, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is \( \boxed{50} \).
