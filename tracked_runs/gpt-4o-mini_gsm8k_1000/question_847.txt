Question ID: 487

Question:
Uncle Ben has four horses. Each horse can consume five pounds of oats per meal. He feeds his horses twice a day. If one bag contains 50-pounds of oats,  how many bags of oats does he need to fed his horses for five days?


Reference Answer:
The four horses can consume 4 x 5 pounds = <<4*5=20>>20 pounds of oats per meal.
Thus, they can consume 2 x 20 pounds = <<2*20=40>>40 pounds of oats a day.
So, uncle Ben needs 5 x 40 pounds = <<5*40=200>>200 pounds of oats to fed his horses for five days.
Therefore, uncle Ben needs 200/50 = <<200/50=4>>4 bags of oats.

Response:
To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we can break the problem down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by one horse in one day.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and Uncle Ben feeds his horses twice a day. Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is:

\[
\text{Daily consumption per horse} = \text{Oats per meal} \times \text{Number of meals per day}
\]
\[
\text{Daily consumption per horse} = 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses in one day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total daily consumption for all horses is:

\[
\text{Total daily consumption for 4 horses} = \text{Daily consumption per horse} \times \text{Number of horses}
\]
\[
\text{Total daily consumption for 4 horses} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses in five days.

To find out how much oats are needed for five days, we multiply the total daily consumption by the number of days:

\[
\text{Total consumption for 5 days} = \text{Total daily consumption for 4 horses} \times \text{Number of days}
\]
\[
\text{Total consumption for 5 days} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of bags of oats needed.

Each bag of oats contains 50 pounds. To find out how many bags are needed for 200 pounds of oats, we divide the total amount of oats by the weight of one bag:

\[
\text{Number of bags needed} = \frac{\text{Total consumption for 5 days}}{\text{Weight of one bag}}
\]
\[
\text{Number of bags needed} = \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}
\]

### Final Answer

Uncle Ben needs **4 bags of oats** to feed his horses for five days.
