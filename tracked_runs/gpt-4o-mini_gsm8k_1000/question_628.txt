Question ID: 1127

Question:
Rani is obsessed with sports cars. She wonders what the faster car ever made can go so she looks it up. What she finds out is that the fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. The 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car. The average car can go 120 Miles per hour. How fast does the faster car go?


Reference Answer:
The 2nd fastest car can go 600 MPH because 5 x 120 = <<5*120=600>>600
The faster car can go 750 MPH because 1.25 x 600 = <<1.25*600=750>>750
#### 750

Response:
To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the average car**: 
   The problem states that the average car can go 120 miles per hour (mph).

2. **Calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car**: 
   According to the problem, the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. 
   \[
   \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times \text{Speed of average car}
   \]
   Substituting the speed of the average car:
   \[
   \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 \text{ mph} = 600 \text{ mph}
   \]

3. **Calculate the speed of the fastest car**: 
   The problem states that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. 
   \[
   \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car}
   \]
   Substituting the speed of the 2nd fastest car:
   \[
   \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 \text{ mph}
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication**:
   \[
   \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ mph}
   \]

Thus, the speed of the fastest car is **750 miles per hour**.

**Final Answer**: 750 mph
