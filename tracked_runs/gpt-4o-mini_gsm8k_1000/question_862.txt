Question:
Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. Then she gets 20 marbles from her friend. How many marbles does she have now?

Response:
To determine how many marbles Maddison has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of marbles in the boxes:**
   Maddison has 5 boxes, and each box contains 50 marbles. To find the total number of marbles in the boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles per box.

   \[
   \text{Total marbles in boxes} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Marbles per box}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total marbles in boxes} = 5 \times 50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total marbles in boxes} = 250
   \]

2. **Add the marbles received from her friend:**
   Maddison receives an additional 20 marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we add the marbles she received to the total number of marbles she already has.

   \[
   \text{Total marbles now} = \text{Total marbles in boxes} + \text{Marbles received from friend}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total marbles now} = 250 + 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total marbles now} = 270
   \]

3. **State the final answer:**
   After performing the calculations, we find that Maddison has a total of 270 marbles now.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{270}
\]
