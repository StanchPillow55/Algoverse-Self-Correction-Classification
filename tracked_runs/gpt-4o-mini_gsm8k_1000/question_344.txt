Question:
Sunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how much did Sunny earn for two days?


Reference Answer:
He sold 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.
The total number of boxes of gingerbread that Sunny sold is 10 + 15 = <<10+15=25>>25.
Sunny earned 25 x $6 = $<<25*6=150>>150 for selling gingerbread.
He sold 15 - 4 = <<15-4=11>>11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.
The total number of boxes of apple pie that Sunny sold is 15 + 11 = <<15+11=26>>26.
He earned 26 x $15 = $<<26*15=390>>390 for selling apple pie.
So, Sunny earned $150 + $390 = $<<150+390=540>>540 for two days.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of boxes sold and the total earnings for both days.

### Step 1: Determine the number of boxes sold on Saturday

Let:
- \( G_S \) = number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday
- \( A_S \) = number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday
- \( G_S = 10 \) (given)
- \( A_S = G_S - 4 \) (4 fewer boxes than gingerbread)

Calculating the number of apple pies sold on Saturday:
\[
A_S = 10 - 4 = 6
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of boxes sold on Sunday

Let:
- \( G_{Su} \) = number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday
- \( A_{Su} \) = number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday
- \( G_{Su} = G_S + 5 \) (5 more boxes than Saturday)
- \( A_{Su} = 15 \) (given)

Calculating the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Sunday:
\[
G_{Su} = 10 + 5 = 15
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total earnings for both days

Now we will calculate the total earnings for each type of item sold on both days.

**Saturday Earnings:**
- Earnings from gingerbread:
\[
\text{Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday} = G_S \times \text{Price per box} = 10 \times 6 = 60
\]
- Earnings from apple pie:
\[
\text{Earnings from apple pie on Saturday} = A_S \times \text{Price per box} = 6 \times 15 = 90
\]
- Total earnings on Saturday:
\[
\text{Total earnings on Saturday} = 60 + 90 = 150
\]

**Sunday Earnings:**
- Earnings from gingerbread:
\[
\text{Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday} = G_{Su} \times \text{Price per box} = 15 \times 6 = 90
\]
- Earnings from apple pie:
\[
\text{Earnings from apple pie on Sunday} = A_{Su} \times \text{Price per box} = 15 \times 15 = 225
\]
- Total earnings on Sunday:
\[
\text{Total earnings on Sunday} = 90 + 225 = 315
\]

### Step 4: Calculate total earnings for both days

Now we will sum the total earnings from both days:
\[
\text{Total earnings for two days} = \text{Total earnings on Saturday} + \text{Total earnings on Sunday} = 150 + 315 = 465
\]

### Final Answer
Sunny earned a total of **$465** for the two days.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of boxes sold each day and then determining the total earnings.

### Step 1: Define the Variables
Let:
- \( G_S \) = number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday
- \( A_S \) = number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday
- \( G_{Su} \) = number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday
- \( A_{Su} \) = number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday

### Step 2: Set Up the Equations
From the problem statement, we have the following information:

1. On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread:
   \[
   G_S = 10
   \]

2. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday:
   \[
   A_S = A_{Su} - 4
   \]

3. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday:
   \[
   G_{Su} = G_S + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15
   \]

4. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie:
   \[
   A_{Su} = 15
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Apple Pies Sold on Saturday
Using the equation from point 2:
\[
A_S = A_{Su} - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11
\]

### Step 4: Summary of Sales
Now we have:
- Saturday:
  - Gingerbread: \( G_S = 10 \)
  - Apple Pie: \( A_S = 11 \)

- Sunday:
  - Gingerbread: \( G_{Su} = 15 \)
  - Apple Pie: \( A_{Su} = 15 \)

### Step 5: Calculate Total Earnings
Now we will calculate the total earnings for both days.

1. **Cost of Gingerbread**: $6 per box
2. **Cost of Apple Pie**: $15 per box

#### Earnings on Saturday:
\[
\text{Earnings on Saturday} = (G_S \times \text{Cost of Gingerbread}) + (A_S \times \text{Cost of Apple Pie})
\]
\[
= (10 \times 6) + (11 \times 15)
\]
\[
= 60 + 165 = 225
\]

#### Earnings on Sunday:
\[
\text{Earnings on Sunday} = (G_{Su} \times \text{Cost of Gingerbread}) + (A_{Su} \times \text{Cost of Apple Pie})
\]
\[
= (15 \times 6) + (15 \times 15)
\]
\[
= 90 + 225 = 315
\]

### Step 6: Total Earnings for Two Days
Now we add the earnings from both days:
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings on Saturday} + \text{Earnings on Sunday}
\]
\[
= 225 + 315 = 540
\]

### Final Answer
Sunny earned a total of **$540** for the two days.
