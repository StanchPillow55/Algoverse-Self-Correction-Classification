Question ID: 439

Question:
Wayne and Bernadette are movie stars heading to the premiere of their latest film. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city. The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?


Reference Answer:
Bernadette takes 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 minutes to get to the theater.
Her ride takes 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 minutes longer than Wayne’s to get to the theater.
Thus, she should leave 12 + 5 = <<12+5=17>>17 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater 5 minutes sooner than he does.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne to arrive at the premiere 5 minutes before him.

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:**
   - Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:**
   - The problem states that the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time is:
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's travel time} = 4 \times \text{Wayne's travel time} = 4 \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time Bernadette needs to leave:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, he will arrive at:
     \[
     \text{Wayne's arrival time} = 0 \text{ minutes (the time he leaves)} + 4 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to arrive at:
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's desired arrival time} = 4 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = -1 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - This means Bernadette needs to arrive at the theater by -1 minutes, which is effectively 1 minute before the start time (0 minutes).

4. **Calculate when Bernadette needs to leave:**
   - Since it takes Bernadette 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave at:
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's departure time} = \text{desired arrival time} - \text{Bernadette's travel time} = -1 \text{ minutes} - 16 \text{ minutes} = -17 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne:**
   - Wayne leaves at 0 minutes, and Bernadette leaves at -17 minutes. The difference in their departure times is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 0 \text{ minutes} - (-17 \text{ minutes}) = 17 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, Bernadette should leave **17 minutes earlier** than Wayne to arrive at the theater 5 minutes before him.

**Final Answer: Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.**
