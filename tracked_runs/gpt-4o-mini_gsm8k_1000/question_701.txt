Question:
The employees of Google went on a day trip. 4 buses were rented that have the capacity of holding 60 employees. 6 minibusses that can hold 30 employees, and 10 minivans that can hold 15 employees. How many employees can join the day trip?


Reference Answer:
60 x 4 = <<60*4=240>>240 employees can ride on the bus.
30 x 6 = <<30*6=180>>180 employees can ride on the minibusses.
15 x 10 = <<15*10=150>>150 employees can ride on the minivans.
Therefore 240 + 180 + 150 = <<240+180+150=570>>570 employees can join the day trip.
#### 570

Response:
To determine how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles rented for the trip. We will do this by calculating the capacity of each type of vehicle and then summing these capacities.

1. **Calculate the capacity of the buses:**
   - Number of buses = 4
   - Capacity of each bus = 60 employees
   - Total capacity of buses = Number of buses × Capacity of each bus
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of buses} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ employees}
   \]

2. **Calculate the capacity of the minibusses:**
   - Number of minibusses = 6
   - Capacity of each minibus = 30 employees
   - Total capacity of minibusses = Number of minibusses × Capacity of each minibus
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of minibusses} = 6 \times 30 = 180 \text{ employees}
   \]

3. **Calculate the capacity of the minivans:**
   - Number of minivans = 10
   - Capacity of each minivan = 15 employees
   - Total capacity of minivans = Number of minivans × Capacity of each minivan
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of minivans} = 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ employees}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total capacity of all vehicles:**
   - Total capacity = Total capacity of buses + Total capacity of minibusses + Total capacity of minivans
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = 240 + 180 + 150
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = 570 \text{ employees}
   \]

Thus, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is **570**.

Final answer: **570 employees**.

To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles rented.

1. **Calculate the capacity of the buses:**
   - Number of buses = 4
   - Capacity of each bus = 60 employees
   - Total capacity of buses = Number of buses × Capacity of each bus
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of buses} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ employees}
   \]

2. **Calculate the capacity of the minibusses:**
   - Number of minibusses = 6
   - Capacity of each minibus = 30 employees
   - Total capacity of minibusses = Number of minibusses × Capacity of each minibus
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of minibusses} = 6 \times 30 = 180 \text{ employees}
   \]

3. **Calculate the capacity of the minivans:**
   - Number of minivans = 10
   - Capacity of each minivan = 15 employees
   - Total capacity of minivans = Number of minivans × Capacity of each minivan
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of minivans} = 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ employees}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total capacity of all vehicles:**
   - Total capacity = Total capacity of buses + Total capacity of minibusses + Total capacity of minivans
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = 240 + 180 + 150
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = 570 \text{ employees}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is **570**. 

Final answer: **570 employees**.
