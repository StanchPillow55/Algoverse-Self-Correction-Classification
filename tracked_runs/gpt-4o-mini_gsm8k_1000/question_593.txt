Question:
Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles.  But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%.  If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles, in seconds?


Reference Answer:
If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, which was two seconds faster than Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles, then Gerald initially would run the 400-meter hurdles in 38+2=<<38+2=40>>40 seconds.
10% of 40 seconds is 40*0.1=<<40*0.1=4>>4 seconds.
The improved diet reduced Gerald's race time to 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 seconds.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles after improving his diet, given that Lee runs the hurdles in 38 seconds and is 2 seconds faster than Gerald.

### Step 1: Determine Gerald's original time

We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and that he is 2 seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find Gerald's original time:

\[
\text{Lee's time} = \text{Gerald's time} - 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Substituting Lee's time into the equation:

\[
38 \text{ seconds} = \text{Gerald's time} - 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Now, we can solve for Gerald's time:

\[
\text{Gerald's time} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Gerald's improved time

Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find his new time, we first need to determine how much faster he is running. A 10% improvement means he will run the distance in 90% of his original time.

To find 90% of Gerald's original time (40 seconds), we calculate:

\[
\text{Improved time} = \text{Original time} \times (1 - \text{Improvement percentage})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Improved time} = 40 \text{ seconds} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Improved time} = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in **36 seconds**.

Response:
To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding Lee's and Gerald's original times**:
   - We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - According to the problem, Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, we can find Gerald's original time by adding 2 seconds to Lee's time:
     \[
     \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
     \]

2. **Calculating Gerald's improved time**:
   - Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find out how this affects his running time, we first need to determine what 10% of his original time is.
   - 10% of Gerald's original time (40 seconds) is calculated as follows:
     \[
     10\% \text{ of } 40 \text{ seconds} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - This means that with the improvement, Gerald's time will decrease by 4 seconds.

3. **Finding Gerald's new time**:
   - To find Gerald's new time after the improvement, we subtract the 4 seconds from his original time:
     \[
     \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} - \text{improvement} = 40 \text{ seconds} - 4 \text{ seconds} = 36 \text{ seconds}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in **36 seconds**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]
