Question ID: 608

Question:
Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25. He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?


Reference Answer:
The price of the two clothing items totals 35 + 25 = <<35+25=60>>60 dollars before discount.
The total sale discount comes to 60 * 0.3 = <<60*0.3=18>>18 dollars.
The final sale price comes to 60 - 18 = <<60-18=42>>42 dollars.
Joe ends up with 50 - 42 = <<50-42=8>>8 dollars change.

Response:
To determine how much money Joe will have left after his purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.**
   - Joe picks out a shirt priced at $25 and a pair of shorts priced at $35.
   - Total cost before the discount = Price of shirt + Price of shorts
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 25 + 35 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Apply the discount to the total cost.**
   - There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. We need to calculate 30% of the total cost and then subtract that from the total cost.
   - First, calculate 30% of $60:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 0.30 \times 60 = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 60 - 18 = 42 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine how much money Joe has left after the purchase.**
   - Joe starts with $50. We need to subtract the total cost after the discount from this amount:
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 50 - 42 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, after purchasing the shirt and shorts with the discount applied, Joe will have **$8 left**.

Final answer: **$8**

2. **Apply the 30% discount to the total cost.**
   - The discount amount can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 30\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.30 \times 60 = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 60 - 18 = 42 \text{ dollars}

To determine how much money Joe will have left after his purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount**:
   - Shirt: $25
   - Shorts: $35
   - Total cost before discount = Shirt price + Shorts price
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 25 + 35 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Apply the 30% discount**:
   - To find the discount amount, we calculate 30% of the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 0.30 \times 60 = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Now, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final price.
   \[
   \text{Final price} = \text{Total cost before discount} - \text{Discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final price} = 60 - 18 = 42 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate how much money Joe has left after the purchase**:
   - Joe starts with $50.
   - Subtract the final price from the amount Joe has.
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 50 - 42 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, after purchasing the outfit, Joe will have **$8** left.

**Final Answer**: Joe will have $8 left after the purchase.
