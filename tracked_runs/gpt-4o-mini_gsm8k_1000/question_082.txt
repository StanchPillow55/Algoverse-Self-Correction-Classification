Question ID: 49

Question:
Richard lives in an apartment building with 15 floors. Each floor contains 8 units, and 3/4 of the building is occupied. What's the total number of unoccupied units In the building?


Reference Answer:
The total number of units in the building will be 8 units/floor * 15 floors = <<8*15=120>>120 units.
If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then the total number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 units = <<3/4*120=90>>90 units.
The total number of unoccupied units is 120 units - 90 units = <<120-90=30>>30 units.
#### 30

Response:
To find the total number of unoccupied units in Richard's apartment building, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of units in the building.**
2. **Determine the number of occupied units.**
3. **Calculate the number of unoccupied units.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of units

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units in the building can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total units} = \text{Number of floors} \times \text{Units per floor}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total units} = 15 \times 8 = 120
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units

We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we can calculate:

\[
\text{Occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Total units}
\]

Substituting the total number of units we calculated:

\[
\text{Occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied units

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[
\text{Unoccupied units} = \text{Total units} - \text{Occupied units}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Unoccupied units} = 120 - 90 = 30
\]

### Final Answer

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[
\boxed{30}
\]
