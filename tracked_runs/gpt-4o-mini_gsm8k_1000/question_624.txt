Question:
Jess is trying to guess the number of blue jellybeans in a jar. She can see that there are 17 green jelly beans and twice as many red jelly beans. The rest of the jellybeans are blue jelly beans. If there are a total of 60 jelly beans in total, how many blue jellybeans are there?


Reference Answer:
There are 17 green jelly beans * 2 = <<17*2=34>>34 red jelly beans.
So in the green and red jelly beans, there are a total of 17 + 34 = <<17+34=51>>51 jellybeans.
As the rest are blue, there must be 60 total jellybeans â€“ 51 red and green jelly beans = <<60-51=9>>9 blue jelly beans.
#### 9

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many blue jellybeans are in the jar based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the number of green jellybeans**: 
   - We know that there are 17 green jellybeans.

2. **Determine the number of red jellybeans**: 
   - The problem states that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans. 
   - Therefore, the number of red jellybeans can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Number of red jellybeans} = 2 \times \text{Number of green jellybeans} = 2 \times 17 = 34
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of jellybeans accounted for**: 
   - Now we add the number of green and red jellybeans together:
     \[
     \text{Total of green and red jellybeans} = \text{Number of green jellybeans} + \text{Number of red jellybeans} = 17 + 34 = 51
     \]

4. **Determine the total number of jellybeans in the jar**: 
   - The problem states that there are a total of 60 jellybeans in the jar.

5. **Calculate the number of blue jellybeans**: 
   - To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:
     \[
     \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = \text{Total jellybeans} - \text{Total of green and red jellybeans} = 60 - 51 = 9
     \]

6. **Final answer**: 
   - Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans in the jar is:
     \[
     \boxed{9}
     \]
