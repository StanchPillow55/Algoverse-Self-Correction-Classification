Question:
Imma has 3 cats. She feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food. How many days will 720 grams of cat food last?


Reference Answer:
The 3 cats consume 60 grams/cat x 3 cats = <<60*3=180>>180 grams of food per meal.
Since they eat twice a day, then they consume 180 grams/meal x 2 meals/day = <<180*2=360>>360 grams in a day.
So, 720 grams of cat food only last for 720 grams / 360 grams/day = <<720/360=2>>2 days.

Response:
To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of cat food fed to the cats per day.**
   - Imma feeds her cats twice a day with a total of 60 grams of cat food each time.
   - Therefore, the total amount of food fed to the cats in one day is:
     \[
     \text{Total food per day} = \text{Food per feeding} \times \text{Number of feedings per day}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total food per day} = 60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams}
     \]

2. **Determine how many days the 720 grams of cat food will last.**
   - To find out how many days the food will last, we divide the total amount of cat food by the amount of food consumed per day:
     \[
     \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total cat food}}{\text{Total food per day}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of days} = \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{120 \text{ grams/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that 720 grams of cat food will last for **6 days**.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, given that she feeds them twice a day with a total of 60 grams of cat food.

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Cat Food Consumption
Imma feeds her cats twice a day, and each feeding totals 60 grams. Therefore, the total amount of cat food consumed by the cats in one day is:

\[
\text{Daily consumption} = \text{Feeding amount per day} = 60 \text{ grams}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Days the Cat Food Will Last
Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We can do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total cat food}}{\text{Daily consumption}} = \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{60 \text{ grams/day}}
\]

### Step 3: Perform the Division
Now, we perform the division:

\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{720}{60} = 12
\]

### Conclusion
Thus, 720 grams of cat food will last for 12 days.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]

   We have a total of 720 grams of cat food. To find out how many days this will last, we divide the total amount of food by the amount of food consumed per day:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{120 \text{ grams/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
   \]

Thus, the 720 grams of cat food will last for **6 days**.

Final answer: **6 days**.
