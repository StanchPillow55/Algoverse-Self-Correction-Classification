Question ID: 830

Question:
Britany records 18 4-minute TikTok videos each week. She spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs to sing on TikTok, and 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup before filming herself for TikTok. How much time does Britany spend on TikTok in a month with four weeks?


Reference Answer:
First find how long Britany spends recording the videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = <<18*4=72>>72 minutes
Then find how long she spends writing songs in minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes
Then find how long Britany spending doing her makeup in a week: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = <<15*6=90>>90 minutes/week
Then add the time she spends on videos and song-writing to find the total time she spends on TikTok in a week: 72 minutes/week + 90 minutes/week + 120 minutes/week = <<72+90+120=282>>282 minutes/week
Then multiply the time spent per week by the number of weeks per month to find the total time spent per month: 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = <<282*4=1128>>1128 minutes/month

Response:
To determine how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to calculate the time she spends on filming her videos, writing songs, and doing her makeup. We will break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the time spent filming TikTok videos

Britany records 18 TikTok videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long. 

First, we calculate the total time spent filming in one week:

\[
\text{Time spent filming in one week} = \text{Number of videos} \times \text{Duration of each video}
\]
\[
\text{Time spent filming in one week} = 18 \text{ videos} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the total time spent filming in four weeks:

\[
\text{Total time spent filming in four weeks} = \text{Time spent filming in one week} \times 4
\]
\[
\text{Total time spent filming in four weeks} = 72 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 288 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time spent writing songs

Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs. We need to convert this time into minutes for consistency:

\[
\text{Time spent writing songs in one week} = 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we calculate the total time spent writing songs in four weeks:

\[
\text{Total time spent writing songs in four weeks} = 120 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 480 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the time spent doing makeup

Britany spends 15 minutes doing her makeup six days a week. First, we calculate the total time spent on makeup in one week:

\[
\text{Time spent doing makeup in one week} = 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the total time spent doing makeup in four weeks:

\[
\text{Total time spent doing makeup in four weeks} = 90 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total time spent on TikTok

Now we can sum all the time spent on filming, writing songs, and doing makeup to find the total time spent on TikTok in a month:

\[
\text{Total time spent on TikTok} = \text{Total time filming} + \text{Total time writing songs} + \text{Total time doing makeup}
\]
\[
\text{Total time spent on TikTok} = 288 \text{ minutes} + 480 \text{ minutes} + 360 \text{ minutes}
\]
\[
\text{Total time spent on TikTok} = 1128 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

Britany spends a total of **1128 minutes** on TikTok in a month with four weeks.

To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to calculate the time she spends on her videos, songwriting, and makeup preparation.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Total time spent on videos in one week:
     \[
     18 \text{ videos} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - For four weeks, the total time spent on videos is:
     \[
     72 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 288 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Convert hours to minutes:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - For four weeks, the total time spent writing songs is:
     \[
     120 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 480 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes doing her makeup each day for 6 days a week.
   - Total time spent on makeup in one week:
     \[
     15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - For four weeks, the total time spent on makeup is:
     \[
     90 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Total time spent on TikTok in a month:**
   - Now, we add all the time spent on videos, songwriting, and makeup:
     \[
     288 \text{ minutes (videos)} + 480 \text{ minutes (songs)} + 360 \text{ minutes (makeup)} = 1128 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Britany spends a total of **1128 minutes** on TikTok in a month with four weeks. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1128 \text{ minutes}}
\]
