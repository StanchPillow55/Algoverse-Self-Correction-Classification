Question ID: 293

Question:
Three friends: Mike, Jim, and Tony decided to play a game. After 3 rounds Mike has 21 points, Jim 3 points less than Mike, and Tony 2 times more than Mike. In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. How many points do all three players have in total after the extra points had been distributed?


Reference Answer:
After 3 rounds Jim has 21 points - 3 points = <<21-3=18>>18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so he has 2 * 21 points = <<2*21=42>>42 points.
In total they have 42 points + 18 points + 21 points = <<42+18+21=81>>81 points.
Only two of them have over 20 points, so in total, all friends have 81 points + 2 points = <<2+81=83>>83 points.
#### 83

Response:
To solve the problem, we will first determine the points for each player after the first three rounds, and then we will account for the extra points awarded in the fourth round.

1. **Points after 3 rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike. Therefore, Jim's points are:
     \[
     \text{Jim's points} = 21 - 3 = 18
     \]
   - Tony has 2 times more than Mike. Therefore, Tony's points are:
     \[
     \text{Tony's points} = 2 \times 21 = 42
     \]

2. **Points after the fourth round:**
   - In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.
   - Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he receives an extra point:
     \[
     \text{Mike's new points} = 21 + 1 = 22
     \]
   - Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not receive an extra point:
     \[
     \text{Jim's new points} = 18
     \]
   - Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he receives an extra point:
     \[
     \text{Tony's new points} = 42 + 1 = 43
     \]

3. **Calculating the total points after the fourth round:**
   - Now we will sum the points of all three players:
     \[
     \text{Total points} = \text{Mike's new points} + \text{Jim's new points} + \text{Tony's new points}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total points} = 22 + 18 + 43
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total points} = 83
     \]

Thus, the total points that all three players have after the extra points have been distributed is \( \boxed{83} \).
