Response:
To find out how much John will pay for the grooming after applying the discount, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original cost of grooming**: The original cost is given as $100.

2. **Calculate the discount amount**: The groomer offers a 30% discount. To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 30% of the original cost.

   \[
   \text{Discount} = \text{Original Cost} \times \text{Discount Rate}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 100 \times 0.30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 30
   \]

3. **Calculate the final cost after the discount**: To find the final cost, we subtract the discount from the original cost.

   \[
   \text{Final Cost} = \text{Original Cost} - \text{Discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Cost} = 100 - 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Cost} = 70
   \]

Thus, after applying the 30% discount, the grooming cost for John is **$70**.

**Final Answer**: $70
