Question ID: 1242

Question:
Skyler has 100 hats on his hand with the colors red, blue, and white. Half of the hats are red, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, and the rest are white. How many white hats does Skyler have?


Reference Answer:
If half of the hats are red, there are 1/2*100= <<1/2*100=50>>50 red hats.
The remaining number of hats which are not red is 100-50 = <<100-50=50>>50
3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, a total of 3/5*50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30 hats
If the rest of the remaining hats are white, then there are 50-30 = <<50-30=20>>20 white hats.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many hats of each color Skyler has, specifically focusing on the number of white hats.

1. **Total Hats**: Skyler has a total of 100 hats.

2. **Red Hats**: According to the problem, half of the hats are red. 
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining Hats**: After accounting for the red hats, we can find the number of remaining hats:
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Blue Hats**: The problem states that \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining hats are blue. We can calculate the number of blue hats as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **White Hats**: Now, we can find the number of white hats by subtracting the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats:
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 100 - (\text{Number of red hats} + \text{Number of blue hats})
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 100 - (50 + 30) = 100 - 80 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is \( \boxed{20} \).
