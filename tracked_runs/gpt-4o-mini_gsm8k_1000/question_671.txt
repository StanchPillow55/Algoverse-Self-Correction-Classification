Question ID: 1236

Question:
Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother wanted to make grape juice and used up 5 times as many grapes then Madeline to make a full glass. Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. How many grapes were there at the beginning if the pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie?


Reference Answer:
Madeline's brother used 6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 grapes
Their mother used 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 grapes
There were 30 + 48 + 6 = <<30+48+6=84>>84 grapes at the beginning
#### 84

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of grapes Madeline ate:**
   - Madeline ate 6 grapes.

2. **Calculate the number of grapes her brother used:**
   - Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make grape juice.
   - Therefore, the number of grapes her brother used is:
     \[
     5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of grapes used so far:**
   - The total number of grapes used by both Madeline and her brother is:
     \[
     6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of grapes used for the pies:**
   - Their mother made 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes.
   - Therefore, the total number of grapes used for the pies is:
     \[
     4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of grapes at the beginning:**
   - To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother:
     \[
     \text{Total grapes} = \text{Grapes eaten by Madeline} + \text{Grapes used by brother} + \text{Grapes used for pies}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total grapes} = 6 + 30 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes}
     \]

Thus, the total number of grapes at the beginning was \( \boxed{84} \).
