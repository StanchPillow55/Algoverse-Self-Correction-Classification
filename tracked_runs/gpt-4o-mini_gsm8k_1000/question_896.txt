Question ID: 160

Question:
A tank of water has a depth of 17 feet on Monday. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. What is the tank’s water depth on Wednesday?


Reference Answer:
On Tuesday there was 17+7 = <<17+7=24>>24 feet of water in the tank.
24/3 = 8. On Wednesday there was 2*8 = 16 feet of water in the tank.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined in the question and perform the necessary calculations.

1. **Determine the water depth on Monday:**
   - The depth of the water on Monday is given as 17 feet.

2. **Calculate the water depth on Tuesday:**
   - On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than it did on Monday.
   - Therefore, we add 7 feet to the Monday depth:
     \[
     \text{Depth on Tuesday} = \text{Depth on Monday} + 7 \text{ feet}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Depth on Tuesday} = 17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the water depth on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday.
   - To find this, we multiply the Tuesday depth by \(\frac{2}{3}\):
     \[
     \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Depth on Tuesday}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet}
     \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - To calculate \(\frac{2}{3} \times 24\), we can first divide 24 by 3:
     \[
     24 \div 3 = 8
     \]
   - Then, we multiply the result by 2:
     \[
     8 \times 2 = 16
     \]

5. **Final result:**
   - Therefore, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is:
     \[
     \text{Depth on Wednesday} = 16 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:

**The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.**
