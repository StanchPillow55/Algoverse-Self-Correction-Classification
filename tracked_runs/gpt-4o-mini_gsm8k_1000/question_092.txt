Question ID: 399

Question:
Alice is 7 years older than Beth, who is 5 years older than Erica. What is the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, if Erica is 30 years old?


Reference Answer:
Beth is 30+5 = <<30+5=35>>35 years old.
Alice is 35+7 = <<35+7=42>>42 years old.
The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42-30 = <<42-30=12>>12 years.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of Alice, Beth, and Erica based on the relationships given in the problem. We know that:

1. Erica's age is given as 30 years.
2. Beth is 5 years older than Erica.
3. Alice is 7 years older than Beth.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Determine Beth's age:**
   Since Erica is 30 years old and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Beth's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Beth's age} = \text{Erica's age} + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Determine Alice's age:**
   Now that we know Beth's age, we can find Alice's age. Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so we calculate Alice's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Alice's age} = \text{Beth's age} + 7 = 35 + 7 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Calculate the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages:**
   Now that we have the ages of both Alice and Erica, we can find the difference between their ages:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Alice's age} - \text{Erica's age} = 42 - 30 = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is \( \boxed{12} \) years.
