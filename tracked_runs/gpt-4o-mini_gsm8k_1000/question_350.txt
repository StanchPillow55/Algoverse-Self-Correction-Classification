Question:
The price of a laptop is $1000. If you get a 20% discount, how much do you have to pay?


Reference Answer:
You will get a discount of 20/100 x $1000 = $<<20/100*1000=200>>200.
Therefore, you will have to pay $1000 - $200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800.

Response:
To determine how much you have to pay for a laptop that costs $1000 after applying a 20% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of the discount**: 
   The discount is calculated as a percentage of the original price. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage.

   \[
   \text{Discount} = \text{Original Price} \times \text{Discount Percentage}
   \]

   Here, the original price is $1000 and the discount percentage is 20%, which can be expressed as a decimal (20% = 0.20).

   \[
   \text{Discount} = 1000 \times 0.20 = 200
   \]

   So, the discount amount is $200.

2. **Subtract the discount from the original price**: 
   To find the final price you have to pay, we subtract the discount amount from the original price.

   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 1000 - 200 = 800
   \]

3. **Conclusion**: 
   After applying the 20% discount to the original price of $1000, the amount you have to pay for the laptop is $800.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}
\]
