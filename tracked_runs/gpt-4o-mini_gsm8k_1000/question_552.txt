Question ID: 1109

Question:
Three of the women at the cocktail party are wearing 4 inch heels and three are wearing 2 inch heels. What is the average height of heels at this party?


Reference Answer:
First find the total number of inches from the 4-inch heels: 3 women * 4 inches/woman = <<3*4=12>>12 inches
Then find the total number of inches from the 2-inch heels: 3 women * 2 inches/woman = <<3*2=6>>6 inches
Then add the total number of inches from each group of heels to find the overall total: 12 inches + 6 inches = <<12+6=18>>18 inches
Then find the total number of women at the party: 3 women + 3 women = <<3+3=6>>6 women
Then divide the total number of heel inches by the number of women to find the average heel height per woman: 18 inches / 6 women = <<18/6=3>>3 inches / woman

Response:
To find the average height of the heels worn by the women at the cocktail party, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of women wearing each type of heel**:
   - There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels.
   - There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels.

2. **Calculate the total height contributed by each group of women**:
   - For the women wearing 4-inch heels:
     \[
     \text{Total height from 4-inch heels} = 3 \text{ women} \times 4 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - For the women wearing 2-inch heels:
     \[
     \text{Total height from 2-inch heels} = 3 \text{ women} \times 2 \text{ inches} = 6 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the overall total height of all the heels**:
   \[
   \text{Total height} = \text{Total height from 4-inch heels} + \text{Total height from 2-inch heels}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total height} = 12 \text{ inches} + 6 \text{ inches} = 18 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Determine the total number of women**:
   \[
   \text{Total number of women} = 3 \text{ (4-inch)} + 3 \text{ (2-inch)} = 6 \text{ women}
   \]

5. **Calculate the average height of the heels**:
   The average height is calculated by dividing the total height by the total number of women:
   \[
   \text{Average height} = \frac{\text{Total height}}{\text{Total number of women}} = \frac{18 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ women}} = 3 \text{ inches}
   \]

Thus, the average height of the heels at the party is \( \boxed{3} \) inches.
