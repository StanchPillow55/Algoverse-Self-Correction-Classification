Question:
A council met to vote on a new regulation. The vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. If there are 33 people on the council, what was the number of votes in favor of the new regulation?


Reference Answer:
Let V be the number of votes against the new regulation.
There were twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation, so V + 2V = 3V = 33.
Thus, there were V = 33 / 3 = <<33/3=11>>11 votes against the new regulation.
Therefore, there were 2V = 2 * 11 = 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information provided.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of votes against the new regulation.
   - Since the problem states that there are twice as many votes in favor as there are against, the number of votes in favor can be expressed as \( 2x \).

2. **Total Votes**:
   - The total number of council members (and thus total votes) is given as 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + 2x = 33
   \]

3. **Combine Like Terms**:
   - Simplifying the left side of the equation gives:
   \[
   3x = 33
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   x = \frac{33}{3} = 11
   \]

5. **Calculate Votes in Favor**:
   - Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of votes in favor:
   \[
   \text{Votes in favor} = 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( \boxed{22} \).

To summarize, we defined the number of votes against the regulation as \( x \) and the votes in favor as \( 2x \). We set up the equation based on the total number of council members, solved for \( x \), and then calculated the votes in favor. The final answer is 22 votes in favor.
