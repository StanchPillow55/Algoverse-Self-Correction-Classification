Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the ages of each person mentioned.

1. **Determine Steve's age**:
   - Steve is given to be 60 years old.

2. **Determine Steve's wife's age**:
   - Steve's wife is 4 years older than him.
   - Therefore, her age is:
     \[
     \text{Steve's wife's age} = 60 + 4 = 64 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Determine their son's age**:
   - Their son is currently half as old as his mom (Steve's wife).
   - Therefore, the son's age is:
     \[
     \text{Son's age} = \frac{64}{2} = 32 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Determine the son's wife's age**:
   - The son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband (the son).
   - Therefore, her age is:
     \[
     \text{Son's wife's age} = 32 - 3 = 29 \text{ years old}
     \]

Now that we have calculated the ages step by step, we can summarize:

- Steve's age: 60 years
- Steve's wife's age: 64 years
- Son's age: 32 years
- Son's wife's age: 29 years

Finally, the question asks for the age of Steve's son's wife.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{29}
\]
