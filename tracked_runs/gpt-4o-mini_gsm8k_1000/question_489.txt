Question ID: 218

Question:
Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, and Harriet is half the age of Zack. Calculate the average age of the three in three years if Harriet is 21 years old now.


Reference Answer:
In three years, Harriet will be 21+3 = <<21+3=24>>24 years old.
Since Adrian's age is three times that of Harriet, Adrian is 3*21 = <<3*21=63>>63 years old.
In three years, he will be 63+3 =<<63+3=66>>66 years old.
If Harriet is half times the age of Zack, Zack is 21*2 = <<21*2=42>>42 years old.
In three years, he will be 42+3 = <<42+3=45>>45 years old.
The combined age of the three in 3 years will be 45+66+24 = <<45+66+24=135>>135 years.
The average age for the in three years will be 135/3 =<<135/3=45>>45 years

Response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify Harriet's current age**: 
   We are given that Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Calculate Adrian's current age**: 
   According to the problem, Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. Therefore, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Calculate Zack's current age**: 
   The problem states that Harriet is half the age of Zack. We can express Zack's age in terms of Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate the ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years**:
   - In three years, Harriet's age will be:
     \[
     21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years old}
     \]
   - In three years, Adrian's age will be:
     \[
     63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years old}
     \]
   - In three years, Zack's age will be:
     \[
     42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Calculate the average age of the three in three years**:
   To find the average age, we sum the ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years and then divide by the number of people (which is 3):
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Adrian's age} + \text{Harriet's age} + \text{Zack's age}}{3}
   \]
   Plugging in the ages:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   The average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years will be:
   \[
   \boxed{45} \text{ years old}
   \]
