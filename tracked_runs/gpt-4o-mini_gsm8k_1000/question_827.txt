Question ID: 48

Question:
Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden. The wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long. How many pieces did she obtain?


Reference Answer:
If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 inches.
Since the wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long, Tracy obtained 48/6=<<48/6=8>>8 pieces
#### 8

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from a 4-foot long piece of wire.

**Step 1: Convert the length of the wire from feet to inches.**

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 4 feet to inches as follows:

\[
4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
\]

So, the length of the wire is 48 inches.

**Step 2: Determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from 48 inches.**

To find out how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[
\text{Number of pieces} = \frac{\text{Total length of wire}}{\text{Length of each piece}} = \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches/piece}}
\]

**Step 3: Perform the division.**

Now, we perform the division:

\[
\frac{48}{6} = 8
\]

**Final Answer:**

Tracy can obtain **8 pieces** of wire, each 6 inches long, from the 4-foot long piece of wire.
