Question ID: 994

Question:
Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous are the three little wolves who live in the forest and howl at the moon every night. When Tobias howls, each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds.  Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.  And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?


Reference Answer:
Chikote howls for 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 seconds.
Igneous howls for 20+40=<<20+40=60>>60 seconds.
In total, the combined length of time, in seconds, of the three wolves' howls is 20+40+60=<<20+40+60=120>>120 seconds.
Thus, the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls is 120/60=<<120/60=2>>2 minutes.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the duration of howls for each of the three wolves: Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous.

1. **Tobias's Howl:**
   - Tobias howls for a total of 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. 
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is:
     \[
     2 \times 20 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Igneous's Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - First, we need to find the combined duration of Tobias's and Chikote's howls:
     \[
     \text{Combined duration} = \text{Tobias's howl} + \text{Chikote's howl} = 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is:
     \[
     60 \text{ seconds}
     \]

4. **Total Duration of Howls:**
   - Now we can find the total duration of all three howls:
     \[
     \text{Total duration} = \text{Tobias's howl} + \text{Chikote's howl} + \text{Igneous's howl}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total duration} = 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
     \]

5. **Convert Total Duration to Minutes:**
   - To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:
     \[
     \text{Total duration in minutes} = \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:

\[
\boxed{2} \text{ minutes}
\]
