Question:
Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. If Sean has 56 marbles, how many marbles do Carl and Cal have combined?


Reference Answer:
Cal has 56*2 = <<56*2=112>>112 marbles.
Carl has 4*56 = <<4*56=224>>224 marbles.
Carl and Cal have 112+224 = <<112+224=336>>336 marbles combined.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will define the number of marbles each person has based on the information given.

1. **Identify the number of marbles Sean has:**
   - We are told that Sean has 56 marbles.
   \[
   \text{Sean's marbles} = 56
   \]

2. **Determine the number of marbles Cal has:**
   - The problem states that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. This can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles}
   \]
   - Rearranging this equation to find Cal's marbles gives us:
   \[
   \text{Cal's marbles} = 2 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 2 \times 56 = 112
   \]

3. **Determine the number of marbles Carl has:**
   - We are also told that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles}
   \]
   - Substituting Sean's marbles into this equation gives us:
   \[
   \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined:**
   - Now we need to find the combined total of Carl's and Cal's marbles:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112
   \]
   - Performing the addition:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles} = 336
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined is:
   \[
   \boxed{336}
   \]
