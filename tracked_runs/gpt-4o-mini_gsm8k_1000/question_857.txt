Question ID: 1088

Question:
There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but John has to take 2 extra classes.  Each class is 40 minutes long.  He goes to class for 5 days a week.  He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning?


Reference Answer:
He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day
That means he spends 40*8=<<40*8=320>>320 minutes per day in class
So he spends 320*5=<<320*5=1600>>1600 minutes a week
That means he spends 1600/16=<<1600/16=100>>100 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday
So he spends 1600+100+100=<<1600+100+100=1800>>1800 minutes per week
So he spends 1800/60=<<1800/60=30>>30 hours per week

Response:
To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we will break the problem down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total class time during the week

1. **Normal class periods per day**: 6 periods
2. **Extra classes per day**: 2 classes
3. **Total classes per day**: 
   \[
   6 + 2 = 8 \text{ classes}
   \]
4. **Duration of each class**: 40 minutes
5. **Total class time per day**:
   \[
   8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes}
   \]
6. **Days per week**: 5 days
7. **Total class time per week**:
   \[
   320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the extra learning time on the weekend

1. **Total minutes in a week**: 
   \[
   7 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 10080 \text{ minutes}
   \]
2. **Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday**: 
   \[
   \frac{1}{16} \text{ of weekly minutes} = \frac{10080 \text{ minutes}}{16} = 630 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. **Extra learning time for both Saturday and Sunday**:
   \[
   630 \text{ minutes} \text{ (Saturday)} + 630 \text{ minutes} \text{ (Sunday)} = 1260 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total learning time for the week

1. **Total learning time per week**:
   \[
   1600 \text{ minutes (class time)} + 1260 \text{ minutes (extra learning time)} = 2860 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 4: Convert total learning time from minutes to hours

1. **Convert minutes to hours**:
   \[
   \frac{2860 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 47.6667 \text{ hours}
   \]
   This can be expressed as:
   \[
   47 \text{ hours and } 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Final Answer

John spends approximately **47 hours and 40 minutes** learning each week. In decimal form, this is approximately **47.67 hours**.

Response:
To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we will break the problem down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total class time during the week

1. **Normal Class Periods**: John has 6 periods in a day.
2. **Extra Classes**: John takes 2 extra classes.
3. **Total Classes per Day**: 
   \[
   \text{Total Classes} = 6 + 2 = 8 \text{ classes}
   \]
4. **Duration of Each Class**: Each class is 40 minutes long.
5. **Total Class Time per Day**:
   \[
   \text{Total Class Time per Day} = 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes}
   \]
6. **Days per Week**: John goes to class for 5 days a week.
7. **Total Class Time per Week**:
   \[
   \text{Total Class Time per Week} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the extra learning time on the weekend

1. **Total Minutes in a Week**: There are 7 days in a week, and each day has 24 hours, so:
   \[
   \text{Total Minutes in a Week} = 7 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 10080 \text{ minutes}
   \]
2. **Extra Learning Time on Saturday and Sunday**: John spends \( \frac{1}{16} \) of his weekly minutes on each of these days.
3. **Extra Learning Time Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Extra Learning Time per Day} = \frac{1}{16} \times 10080 \text{ minutes} = 630 \text{ minutes}
   \]
4. **Total Extra Learning Time for the Weekend**:
   \[
   \text{Total Extra Learning Time} = 630 \text{ minutes (Saturday)} + 630 \text{ minutes (Sunday)} = 1260 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total learning time for the week

1. **Total Learning Time**:
   \[
   \text{Total Learning Time} = \text{Total Class Time per Week} + \text{Total Extra Learning Time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Learning Time} = 1600 \text{ minutes} + 1260 \text{ minutes} = 2860 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 4: Convert total learning time from minutes to hours

1. **Convert Minutes to Hours**:
   \[
   \text{Total Learning Time in Hours} = \frac{2860 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} \approx 47.6667 \text{ hours}
   \]
   This can be expressed as:
   \[
   47 \text{ hours and } 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Final Answer

John spends approximately **47.67 hours** (or 47 hours and 40 minutes) learning each week.

Response:
To find out how many hours a week John spends learning, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total class time during the weekdays:**
   - John has 6 regular periods and 2 extra classes each day.
   - Total classes per day = 6 + 2 = 8 classes.
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - Total class time per day = 8 classes × 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes.

2. **Calculate the total class time for the week:**
   - John goes to class for 5 days a week.
   - Total class time for the week = 320 minutes/day × 5 days = 1600 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total minutes in a week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total minutes in a week = 7 days × 24 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour = 10080 minutes.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time on the weekend:**
   - John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.
   - Extra learning time for the weekend = (1/16) × 10080 minutes = 630 minutes.
   - Since this is for both Saturday and Sunday, we divide it by 2 to find the extra learning time per day:
     - Extra learning time per day = 630 minutes ÷ 2 = 315 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total learning time for the week:**
   - Total learning time for the week = Total class time for the week + Extra learning time for the weekend.
   - Total learning time for the week = 1600 minutes + 630 minutes = 2230 minutes.

6. **Convert total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
   - Total learning time in hours = 2230 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour ≈ 37.1667 hours.

7. **Final answer:**
   - Rounding to two decimal places, John spends approximately **37.17 hours** a week learning.

Thus, the final answer is:
**37.17 hours**.
