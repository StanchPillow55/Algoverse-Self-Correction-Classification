Question ID: 391

Question:
The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. If the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, how many more popsicles does Sam have more than Betty?


Reference Answer:
The total ratio representing the number of popsicles that Betty and sam have is 5+6 = <<5+6=11>>11.
Since Betty has 5/11 of the total number of popsicles they have together, she has 5/11*165 = <<5/11*165=75>>75 popsicles.
Sam has 165-75 = <<165-75=90>>90 popsicles.
Sam has 90-75 = <<90-75=15>>15 more popsicles than Betty.

Response:
To solve the problem, we start by understanding the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have, which is given as 5:6. This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \( B \) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \( S \). According to the ratio, we can express their amounts in terms of a common variable \( x \):

\[
B = 5x \quad \text{(for Betty)}
\]
\[
S = 6x \quad \text{(for Sam)}
\]

Next, we know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
B + S = 165
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( B \) and \( S \) in terms of \( x \):

\[
5x + 6x = 165
\]

Combining the terms on the left side gives us:

\[
11x = 165
\]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[
x = \frac{165}{11} = 15
\]

Now that we have the value of \( x \), we can find the number of popsicles each person has:

For Betty:

\[
B = 5x = 5 \times 15 = 75
\]

For Sam:

\[
S = 6x = 6 \times 15 = 90
\]

Now, we need to find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty. We can calculate this by subtracting the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

\[
S - B = 90 - 75 = 15
\]

Thus, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Finally, we state the answer:

**Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.**
