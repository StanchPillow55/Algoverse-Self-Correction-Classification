Question ID: 171

Question:
Jake is walking through the Museum of Entomology. He sees 80 spiders with 8 legs each, 90 insects with 6 legs each, and 3 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each. How many legs does Jake see total?


Reference Answer:
First find the total number of spider legs: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = <<80*8=640>>640 legs
Then find the total number of insect legs: 90 spiders * 6 legs/spider = <<90*6=540>>540 legs
Then find the total number of mutant invertebrate legs: 3 mutants * 10 legs/mutant = <<3*10=30>>30 legs
Then add the number of each kind of leg to find the total he saw: 640 legs + 540 legs + 30 legs = <<640+540+30=1210>>1210 legs
#### 1210

Response:
To find the total number of legs that Jake sees in the Museum of Entomology, we will calculate the number of legs for each type of creature separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the total number of legs from the spiders:**
   - Jake sees 80 spiders.
   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   - The total number of legs from the spiders can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total legs from spiders} = \text{Number of spiders} \times \text{Legs per spider} = 80 \times 8
     \]
     \[
     80 \times 8 = 640
     \]
   - So, there are 640 legs from the spiders.

2. **Calculate the total number of legs from the insects:**
   - Jake sees 90 insects.
   - Each insect has 6 legs.
   - The total number of legs from the insects can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total legs from insects} = \text{Number of insects} \times \text{Legs per insect} = 90 \times 6
     \]
     \[
     90 \times 6 = 540
     \]
   - So, there are 540 legs from the insects.

3. **Calculate the total number of legs from the rare mutant invertebrates:**
   - Jake sees 3 rare mutant invertebrates.
   - Each mutant invertebrate has 10 legs.
   - The total number of legs from the mutant invertebrates can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total legs from mutant invertebrates} = \text{Number of mutant invertebrates} \times \text{Legs per mutant invertebrate} = 3 \times 10
     \]
     \[
     3 \times 10 = 30
     \]
   - So, there are 30 legs from the rare mutant invertebrates.

4. **Calculate the total number of legs Jake sees:**
   - Now, we will sum the total legs from all three types of creatures:
     \[
     \text{Total legs} = \text{Total legs from spiders} + \text{Total legs from insects} + \text{Total legs from mutant invertebrates}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total legs} = 640 + 540 + 30
     \]
     \[
     640 + 540 = 1180
     \]
     \[
     1180 + 30 = 1210
     \]

Therefore, the total number of legs that Jake sees in the Museum of Entomology is **1210**. 

Final answer: **1210** legs.
