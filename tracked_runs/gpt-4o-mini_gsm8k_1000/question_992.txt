Response:
To find the total number of thorns on all the rose bushes, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of roses**: 
   - Dan plants 3 rose bushes.
   - Each rose bush has 25 roses.
   - To find the total number of roses, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush:

   \[
   \text{Total Roses} = \text{Number of Bushes} \times \text{Roses per Bush} = 3 \times 25
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total Roses} = 75
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of thorns**:
   - Each rose has 8 thorns.
   - To find the total number of thorns, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:

   \[
   \text{Total Thorns} = \text{Total Roses} \times \text{Thorns per Rose} = 75 \times 8
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total Thorns} = 600
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   - The total number of thorns on all the rose bushes is 600.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{600}
\]
