Question ID: 139

Question:
In a candy machine, there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. If there are 12 blue gumballs how many pink ones are there?


Reference Answer:
Four times the number of blue gumballs is 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 gumballs
There are 48+22=<<48+22=70>>70 pink gumballs
#### 70

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of pink gumballs in the candy machine based on the information given about the blue gumballs.

1. **Identify the number of blue gumballs**: 
   The problem states that there are 12 blue gumballs. We can denote the number of blue gumballs as \( b \).
   \[
   b = 12
   \]

2. **Set up the relationship for pink gumballs**: 
   According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is described as "22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs." We can denote the number of pink gumballs as \( p \). The relationship can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   p = 4b + 22
   \]

3. **Substitute the value of blue gumballs into the equation**: 
   Now we substitute \( b = 12 \) into the equation for \( p \):
   \[
   p = 4(12) + 22
   \]

4. **Calculate \( 4 \times 12 \)**:
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48
   \]

5. **Add 22 to the result**:
   \[
   p = 48 + 22
   \]
   \[
   p = 70
   \]

6. **Conclusion**: 
   The number of pink gumballs in the candy machine is \( 70 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{70}
\]
