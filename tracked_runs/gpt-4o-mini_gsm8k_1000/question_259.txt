Question ID: 931

Question:
The combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 100 years old. Find the age of Peter knowing that Paul is 10 years older than John and that Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.


Reference Answer:
Let x be the age of John. Paul’s age is x + 10
Peter’s age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10
We have (2x + 10) + (x + 1) + x = 100
Combining like terms, we get 4x + 20 = 100
Subtracting 20 from both sides and dividing by 4, we get x = 80/4 = 20 years old.
John is 20 years old, Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old, and Peter is 2 * 20 + 10 = 50 years old.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to define the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean using variables. Let's denote:

- \( P \) as Peter's age
- \( A \) as Paul's age
- \( J \) as Jean's age

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions we have into the equations to solve for the ages.

### Step 1: Substitute Paul's age in terms of Jean's age

From equation (2), we can express \( J \) in terms of \( A \):
\[
J = A - 10
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( J \) into the equation for Peter's age

Now, substitute \( J \) into equation (3):
\[
P = A + (A - 10)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
P = 2A - 10
\]

### Step 3: Substitute \( P \) and \( J \) into the combined age equation

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( J \) into equation (1):
\[
(2A - 10) + A + (A - 10) = 100
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the equation

Combine like terms:
\[
2A - 10 + A + A - 10 = 100
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4A - 20 = 100
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( A \)

Add 20 to both sides:
\[
4A = 120
\]
Now divide by 4:
\[
A = 30
\]

### Step 6: Find Jean's age

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( J \):
\[
J = A - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20
\]

### Step 7: Find Peter's age

Finally, we can find \( P \):
\[
P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean are:
- Peter: 50 years
- Paul: 30 years
- Jean: 20 years

The final answer is:
\[
\text{Peter's age is } \boxed{50} \text{ years.}
\]
