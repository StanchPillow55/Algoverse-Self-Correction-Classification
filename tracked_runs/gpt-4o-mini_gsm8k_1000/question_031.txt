Response:
To determine how many paintball guns each person would have if they shared their guns equally, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of guns**: We will add the number of guns each person has.

   - DJ has 8 guns
   - Nick has 10 guns
   - RJ has 1 gun
   - Richard has 5 guns

   Now, we sum these amounts:

   \[
   \text{Total guns} = \text{DJ's guns} + \text{Nick's guns} + \text{RJ's guns} + \text{Richard's guns}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total guns} = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total guns} = 24
   \]

2. **Determine the number of people sharing the guns**: There are 4 people (DJ, Nick, RJ, and Richard).

3. **Calculate the number of guns each person would have if shared equally**: We divide the total number of guns by the number of people.

   \[
   \text{Guns per person} = \frac{\text{Total guns}}{\text{Number of people}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Guns per person} = \frac{24}{4}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Guns per person} = 6
   \]

Thus, if they were to share their guns equally, each person would have **6 guns**.

Final answer: Each person would have 6 guns.
