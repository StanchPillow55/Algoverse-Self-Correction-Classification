Question ID: 1280

Question:
Steve put together a puzzle that took 10 hours of hard work to complete. Anna put together the same puzzle in 2 hours more than half Steve's time. How long did it take Anna to finish the difficult puzzle?


Reference Answer:
Half the time it took Steve to put together the puzzle is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5
If Anna put together the same puzzle in 2 hours more than half the time it took Steve, she took 5+2=7 hours to finish the puzzle.
#### 7

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle based on the information given about Steve's time.

1. **Identify Steve's Time**: 
   - We know that Steve took 10 hours to complete the puzzle.

2. **Calculate Half of Steve's Time**: 
   - Half of Steve's time is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Half of Steve's time} = \frac{10 \text{ hours}}{2} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Determine Anna's Time**: 
   - According to the problem, Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time. Therefore, we add 2 hours to the half time we calculated:
     \[
     \text{Anna's time} = \text{Half of Steve's time} + 2 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 7 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Final Answer**: 
   - Thus, the time it took Anna to finish the puzzle is:
     \[
     \boxed{7 \text{ hours}}
     \] 

This step-by-step reasoning shows that Anna completed the puzzle in 7 hours.
