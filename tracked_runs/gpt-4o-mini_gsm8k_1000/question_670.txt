Question ID: 335

Question:
Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar to make a batch of suckers and 70 ounces of sugar to make a batch of fudge. How much sugar does he need to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge?


Reference Answer:
First find the total sugar needed for the suckers: 30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = <<30*8=240>>240 ounces
Then add the amount he needs to make the fudge to find the total amount of sugar needed: 240 ounces + 70 ounces = <<240+70=310>>310 ounces
#### 310

Response:
To determine how much sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge, we will first calculate the total amount of sugar required for each type of candy separately and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:**
   - Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
   - Mason is making 8 batches of suckers.
   - Therefore, the total sugar needed for the suckers can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Sugar for suckers} = \text{Number of batches} \times \text{Sugar per batch} = 8 \times 30
   \]

   \[
   \text{Sugar for suckers} = 240 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:**
   - Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
   - Mason is making 1 batch of fudge.
   - Therefore, the total sugar needed for the fudge can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Sugar for fudge} = \text{Number of batches} \times \text{Sugar per batch} = 1 \times 70
   \]

   \[
   \text{Sugar for fudge} = 70 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total sugar needed:**
   - Now, we will add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge to find the total amount of sugar required.

   \[
   \text{Total sugar} = \text{Sugar for suckers} + \text{Sugar for fudge} = 240 + 70
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total sugar} = 310 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Thus, Mason needs a total of **310 ounces of sugar** to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

Final answer: **310 ounces**

Response:
To determine how much sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:**
   - Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
   - For 8 batches, the total sugar needed is:
     \[
     30 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 8 \text{ batches} = 240 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:**
   - Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
   - For 1 batch, the total sugar needed is:
     \[
     70 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 1 \text{ batch} = 70 \text{ ounces}
     \]

3. **Add the sugar needed for both the suckers and the fudge:**
   - Total sugar needed is:
     \[
     240 \text{ ounces (suckers)} + 70 \text{ ounces (fudge)} = 310 \text{ ounces}
     \]

Thus, Mason needs a total of **310 ounces of sugar** to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

Final answer: **310 ounces**.
