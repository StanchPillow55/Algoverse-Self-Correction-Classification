Question:
George has 45% more pears than bananas. If George has 200 bananas, how many fruits does George have?


Reference Answer:
If George has 200 bananas, 45% more than that number is 45/100*200 = <<200*0.45=90>>90
The total number of pears that George has is 200+90 =<<200+90=290>>290
Together, George has 290 pears + 200 bananas = <<290+200=490>>490 fruits
#### 490

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pears George has based on the information provided about his bananas.

1. **Identify the number of bananas**: 
   George has 200 bananas.

2. **Calculate the number of pears**: 
   The problem states that George has 45% more pears than bananas. To find the number of pears, we first need to calculate what 45% of the number of bananas is.

   \[
   \text{45% of 200 bananas} = 0.45 \times 200
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   0.45 \times 200 = 90
   \]

   This means that George has 90 more pears than the number of bananas he has.

3. **Calculate the total number of pears**: 
   Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we add this amount to the number of bananas to find the total number of pears:

   \[
   \text{Number of pears} = \text{Number of bananas} + \text{Additional pears}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of pears} = 200 + 90 = 290
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of fruits**: 
   Now that we know George has 200 bananas and 290 pears, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of bananas and pears together:

   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = \text{Number of bananas} + \text{Number of pears}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = 200 + 290 = 490
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total number of fruits that George has is 

   \[
   \boxed{490}
   \]
