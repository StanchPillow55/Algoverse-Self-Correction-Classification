Question ID: 88

Question:
Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If they sold 88,000 copies combined, how many copies did Harald sell?


Reference Answer:
Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.
Substituting the second equation into the first, we get 10h + h = 88,000
Combining like terms, we get 11h = 88,000
Dividing both sides by 11, we get h = 8,000
#### 8000

Response:
Let \( H \) represent the number of copies that Harald sold. According to the problem, Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald. Therefore, we can express the number of copies Marilyn sold as \( 10H \).

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is given as 88,000. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[
H + 10H = 88,000
\]

Now, we can combine the terms on the left side of the equation:

\[
11H = 88,000
\]

Next, we will solve for \( H \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 11:

\[
H = \frac{88,000}{11}
\]

Now, we perform the division:

\[
H = 8,000
\]

Thus, Harald sold \( 8,000 \) copies.

To verify, we can calculate how many copies Marilyn sold:

\[
10H = 10 \times 8,000 = 80,000
\]

Now, we check the total:

\[
H + 10H = 8,000 + 80,000 = 88,000
\]

Since this matches the total given in the problem, our solution is confirmed.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{8000}
\]
