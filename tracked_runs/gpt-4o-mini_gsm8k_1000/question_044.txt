Question ID: 723

Question:
The restaurant has 170 normal chairs and 23 chairs for babies. If 20 of the normal chairs and 13 of the baby chairs were sent to the carpenter for repair, how many chairs does the restaurant have left?


Reference Answer:
Before sending the chairs and baby chairs to the carpenter the restaurant had 170 + 23 = <<170+23=193>>193 chairs.
They sent 20 + 13 = <<20+13=33>>33 chairs to the carpenter.
Now, they have 193 - 33 = <<193-33=160>>160 chairs left.

Response:
To determine how many chairs the restaurant has left after sending some for repair, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial number of chairs**:
   - Normal chairs: 170
   - Baby chairs: 23

2. **Calculate the total number of chairs before any repairs**:
   \[
   \text{Total chairs} = \text{Normal chairs} + \text{Baby chairs} = 170 + 23 = 193
   \]

3. **Identify the number of chairs sent for repair**:
   - Normal chairs sent for repair: 20
   - Baby chairs sent for repair: 13

4. **Calculate the total number of chairs sent for repair**:
   \[
   \text{Total chairs sent for repair} = \text{Normal chairs sent} + \text{Baby chairs sent} = 20 + 13 = 33
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of chairs left after repairs**:
   \[
   \text{Chairs left} = \text{Total chairs} - \text{Total chairs sent for repair} = 193 - 33 = 160
   \]

Thus, the restaurant has **160 chairs left** after sending some for repair.

Final answer: **160 chairs**.
