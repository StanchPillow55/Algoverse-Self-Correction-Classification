Question ID: 728

Question:
Candy has 15 light blue spools of thread, 45 dark blue spools of thread, 40 light green spools of thread, and 50 dark green spools of thread. What percent of her spools are blue?


Reference Answer:
First find the number of blue spools: 15 spools + 45 spools = <<15+45=60>>60 spools
Then find the total number of spools: 40 spools + 50 spools + 60 spools = <<40+50+60=150>>150 spools
Then divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 60 spools / 150 spools * 100% = 40%
#### 40

Response:
To determine what percent of Candy's spools of thread are blue, we first need to calculate the total number of spools she has and then find out how many of those are blue.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of spools.**

Candy has the following spools:
- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Now, we add these numbers together to find the total:

\[
\text{Total spools} = \text{Light blue} + \text{Dark blue} + \text{Light green} + \text{Dark green}
\]

\[
\text{Total spools} = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. \(15 + 45 = 60\)
2. \(60 + 40 = 100\)
3. \(100 + 50 = 150\)

So, the total number of spools is:

\[
\text{Total spools} = 150
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of blue spools.**

Next, we need to find the total number of blue spools. Blue spools include both light blue and dark blue spools:

\[
\text{Total blue spools} = \text{Light blue} + \text{Dark blue}
\]

\[
\text{Total blue spools} = 15 + 45
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Total blue spools} = 60
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the percentage of spools that are blue.**

To find the percentage of spools that are blue, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
\]

Calculating the fraction:

\[
\frac{60}{150} = 0.4
\]

Now, multiplying by 100 to convert to a percentage:

\[
0.4 \times 100 = 40
\]

**Final Answer:**

The percentage of Candy's spools that are blue is:

\[
\boxed{40\%}
\]
