Response:
To find out how much it costs for lunch today at Subway, we need to calculate the total cost of both the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.

1. **Cost of the foot-long fish sub**: 
   - We are given that the cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40.

2. **Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub**:
   - We are told that the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is thrice as much as the cost of the foot-long fish sub.
   - To find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3:
     \[
     \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo} = 3 \times \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo} = 3 \times 40 = 120
     \]

3. **Total cost for lunch**:
   - Now, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost for lunch:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} + \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 40 + 120 = 160
     \]

Therefore, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is **$160**. 

Final answer: **$160**.
