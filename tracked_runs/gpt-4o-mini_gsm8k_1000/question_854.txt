Question ID: 295

Question:
Darren decides to do body exercises for a whole week. He does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses on the first day. On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than on the first day, ten fewer squats, and doubles the number of dumbbell presses. What's the total count of the activities he's done in the two days?


Reference Answer:
The total count of activities for the first day is 100+50+20 = <<100+50+20=170>>170
On the second day, he does 100+20 = <<100+20=120>>120 pushups
He also does 50-10 = <<50-10=40>>40 squats on the second day
For the dumbbell presses, he doubles the number of the first day, which becomes 2*20 = <<2*20=40>>40
The total count for the three activities on the second day is 40+40+120 = <<40+40+120=200>>200
For the two days, his total count for all the three activities is 200+170 = <<200+170=370>>370

Response:
To find the total count of activities Darren has done over the two days, we will break down the exercises he performed each day and then sum them up.

### Day 1:
- **Pushups**: 100
- **Squats**: 50
- **Dumbbell presses**: 20

Now, let's calculate the total number of exercises he did on the first day:

\[
\text{Total Day 1} = \text{Pushups} + \text{Squats} + \text{Dumbbell presses}
\]
\[
\text{Total Day 1} = 100 + 50 + 20 = 170
\]

### Day 2:
On the second day, Darren's counts change as follows:
- **Pushups**: He does 20 more pushups than on the first day.
- **Squats**: He does 10 fewer squats than on the first day.
- **Dumbbell presses**: He doubles the number of dumbbell presses from the first day.

Now, let's calculate the counts for the second day:

1. **Pushups**:
   \[
   \text{Pushups Day 2} = \text{Pushups Day 1} + 20 = 100 + 20 = 120
   \]

2. **Squats**:
   \[
   \text{Squats Day 2} = \text{Squats Day 1} - 10 = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Dumbbell presses**:
   \[
   \text{Dumbbell presses Day 2} = 2 \times \text{Dumbbell presses Day 1} = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of exercises he did on the second day:

\[
\text{Total Day 2} = \text{Pushups Day 2} + \text{Squats Day 2} + \text{Dumbbell presses Day 2}
\]
\[
\text{Total Day 2} = 120 + 40 + 40 = 200
\]

### Total for Both Days:
Now, we will add the totals from both days to find the overall total:

\[
\text{Total for Both Days} = \text{Total Day 1} + \text{Total Day 2}
\]
\[
\text{Total for Both Days} = 170 + 200 = 370
\]

### Final Answer:
The total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days is \( \boxed{370} \).
