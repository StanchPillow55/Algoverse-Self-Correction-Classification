Question ID: 724

Question:
Bryce and four of his friends each ordered their own pizzas after football practice. Each pizza had 12 slices. Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. How many slices of pizza were left?


Reference Answer:
Bryce and his 4 friends each ordered a pizza with 12 slices, so there were 5 pizzas x 12 slices per pizza = <<5*12=60>>60 slices of pizza.
2/3 of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 8/12 because 2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12.
Bryce and two of his friends each ate 2/3 or 8 slices of pizza, so 3 friends x 8 slices of pizza = 24 slices of pizza.
¾ of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 9/12 because ¾ x 3/3 = 9/12.
Bryce’s two remaining friends each ate ¾ or 9 slices of pizza, so 2 friends x 9 slices = <<2*9=18>>18 slices of pizza.
Together, Bryce and his friends ate 24 + 18 = <<24+18=42>>42 slices of pizza.
Of the 60 total slices of pizza, the friends ate 42, and 60 slices – 42 slices = <<60-42=18>>18 slices of pizza were left.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will first determine how many pizzas were ordered in total, how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his friends, and finally how many slices are left.

1. **Total number of pizzas ordered**:
   Bryce and four of his friends means there are 5 people in total. Each person ordered one pizza.
   \[
   \text{Total pizzas} = 5
   \]

2. **Total number of slices**:
   Each pizza has 12 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices from all pizzas is:
   \[
   \text{Total slices} = \text{Total pizzas} \times \text{Slices per pizza} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends**:
   Bryce and two of his friends (3 people) ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. The number of pizzas they ordered is:
   \[
   \text{Pizzas eaten by Bryce and friends} = 3
   \]
   The total slices they ate is:
   \[
   \text{Slices eaten} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total slices from 3 pizzas} = \frac{2}{3} \times (3 \times 12) = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Slices eaten by the two remaining friends**:
   The two remaining friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. The number of pizzas they ordered is:
   \[
   \text{Pizzas eaten by remaining friends} = 2
   \]
   The total slices they ate is:
   \[
   \text{Slices eaten} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Total slices from 2 pizzas} = \frac{3}{4} \times (2 \times 12) = \frac{3}{4} \times 24 = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

5. **Total slices eaten**:
   Now we can find the total slices eaten by both groups:
   \[
   \text{Total slices eaten} = \text{Slices eaten by Bryce and friends} + \text{Slices eaten by remaining friends} = 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices}
   \]

6. **Slices left**:
   Finally, we can find the number of slices left by subtracting the total slices eaten from the total slices:
   \[
   \text{Slices left} = \text{Total slices} - \text{Total slices eaten} = 60 - 42 = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, we will first determine how many slices of pizza were ordered in total, then calculate how many slices were eaten, and finally find out how many slices are left.

1. **Total number of pizzas ordered**:
   Bryce and his four friends ordered a total of 5 pizzas (1 for each person).

   \[
   \text{Total pizzas} = 5
   \]

2. **Total number of slices**:
   Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

   \[
   \text{Total slices} = 5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} = 60 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends**:
   Bryce and two friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people, the total number of pizzas they consumed is:

   \[
   \text{Pizzas eaten by Bryce and friends} = 3 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

   The total slices they ate is:

   \[
   \text{Slices eaten} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} \times \frac{2}{3} = 3 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 24 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Slices eaten by the two remaining friends**:
   The two remaining friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. They each had 1 pizza, so together they had:

   \[
   \text{Pizzas eaten by remaining friends} = 2 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

   The total slices they ate is:

   \[
   \text{Slices eaten} = 2 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} \times \frac{3}{4} = 2 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

5. **Total slices eaten**:
   Now we add the slices eaten by both groups:

   \[
   \text{Total slices eaten} = 24 \text{ slices} + 18 \text{ slices} = 42 \text{ slices}
   \]

6. **Slices left**:
   Finally, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total slices ordered:

   \[
   \text{Slices left} = 60 \text{ slices} - 42 \text{ slices} = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{18}
\] 

There are 18 slices of pizza left.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of pizzas ordered:**
   Bryce and his four friends ordered their own pizzas, which means there are a total of:
   \[
   1 \text{ (Bryce)} + 4 \text{ (friends)} = 5 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of slices:**
   Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices from all pizzas is:
   \[
   5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} = 60 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Determine how many slices were eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   Bryce and two friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people in total (Bryce and two friends), we need to calculate how many slices they ate:
   - Each person has 1 pizza, so they collectively have:
   \[
   3 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} = 36 \text{ slices}
   \]
   - They ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of these 36 slices:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ slices} = 24 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Determine how many slices were eaten by the two remaining friends:**
   The two remaining friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. Each of these friends also has 1 pizza, so together they have:
   \[
   2 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} = 24 \text{ slices}
   \]
   - They ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of these 24 slices:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 24 \text{ slices} = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten:**
   Now, we add the slices eaten by both groups:
   \[
   24 \text{ slices (Bryce and two friends)} + 18 \text{ slices (two remaining friends)} = 42 \text{ slices}
   \]

6. **Determine how many slices are left:**
   Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:
   \[
   60 \text{ slices (total)} - 42 \text{ slices (eaten)} = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

Thus, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]
