Question ID: 316

Question:
Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. If his father also gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, and each marble weighs 2kgs, calculate the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store.


Reference Answer:
After buying twenty marbles from his friend Johanna, Solomon had 20+50 = <<20+50=70>>70 marbles.
Solomon's father gave him 2/5*20 = <<2/5*20=8>>8 more marbles.
Adding Johanna's and Solomon's marbles, he has a total of 8+70 = <<8+70=78>>78 marbles.
If each marble weigh 2 kgs, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in store is 78 * 2 kgs = <<78*2=156>>156 kgs
#### 156

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of marbles Solomon bought from Johanna.**
   Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.

2. **Calculate the total number of marbles in the store after Solomon's purchase.**
   The store initially had 50 marbles. After adding the 20 marbles he bought, the total number of marbles in the store becomes:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles} = \text{Initial marbles} + \text{Marbles bought from Johanna}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total marbles} = 50 + 20 = 70
   \]

3. **Calculate how many marbles Solomon's father gave him.**
   Solomon's father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Marbles from father} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Marbles from father} = \frac{40}{5} = 8
   \]

4. **Calculate the new total number of marbles in the store.**
   Now, we add the marbles Solomon received from his father to the total number of marbles already in the store:
   \[
   \text{New total marbles} = \text{Total marbles} + \text{Marbles from father}
   \]
   \[
   \text{New total marbles} = 70 + 8 = 78
   \]

5. **Calculate the total weight of the marbles.**
   Each marble weighs 2 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Total marbles} \times \text{Weight per marble}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}
   \]

Finally, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[
\boxed{156 \text{ kg}}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and perform the necessary calculations.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after buying from Johanna.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna. He already had 50 marbles in the store.

\[
\text{Total marbles after buying from Johanna} = \text{Marbles in store} + \text{Marbles bought from Johanna}
\]

\[
\text{Total marbles} = 50 + 20 = 70
\]

### Step 2: Calculate how many marbles Solomon's father gave him.

Solomon's father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, we can calculate the number of marbles his father gave him as follows:

\[
\text{Marbles from father} = \frac{2}{5} \times \text{Marbles bought from Johanna}
\]

\[
\text{Marbles from father} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{40}{5} = 8
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the new total number of marbles Solomon has.

Now we add the marbles Solomon received from his father to the total number of marbles he already has:

\[
\text{New total marbles} = \text{Total marbles} + \text{Marbles from father}
\]

\[
\text{New total marbles} = 70 + 8 = 78
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total weight of the marbles.

Each marble weighs 2 kg. To find the total weight of the marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Total marbles} \times \text{Weight of each marble}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight} = 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}
\]

### Final Answer

The total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is \( \boxed{156} \) kg.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of marbles Solomon bought from Johanna**:
   Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.

2. **Calculate the initial number of marbles in the store**:
   The store initially had 50 marbles.

3. **Calculate the total number of marbles after Solomon added the ones he bought**:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles after purchase} = \text{Initial marbles} + \text{Marbles bought from Johanna}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total marbles after purchase} = 50 + 20 = 70
   \]

4. **Determine how many marbles Solomon's father gave him**:
   Solomon's father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. We need to calculate \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \):
   \[
   \text{Marbles from father} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{40}{5} = 8
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of marbles after receiving from his father**:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles after father's gift} = \text{Total marbles after purchase} + \text{Marbles from father}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total marbles after father's gift} = 70 + 8 = 78
   \]

6. **Calculate the total weight of the marbles**:
   Each marble weighs 2 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Total number of marbles} \times \text{Weight per marble}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}
   \]

Thus, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is \( \boxed{156} \) kg.
