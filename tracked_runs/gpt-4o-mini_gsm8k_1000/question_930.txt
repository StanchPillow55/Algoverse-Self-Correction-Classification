Question:
While on vacation in Bali, Thea bought a hat from a craftsman worth $70. If she gave the craftsman four $20 bills, how much change did she get?


Reference Answer:
If she gave the craftsman four $20 bills, the total amount of money she gave to the craftsman is 4*$20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.
Since the hat was worth $70, the craftsman gave her change equal to $80-$70=$10

Response:
To determine how much change Thea received after purchasing the hat, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the cost of the hat**: The hat costs $70.

2. **Identify the amount Thea paid**: Thea paid with four $20 bills. To find out how much she paid in total, we calculate:
   \[
   4 \text{ bills} \times 20 \text{ dollars/bill} = 80 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the change**: To find out how much change Thea received, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount she paid:
   \[
   \text{Change} = \text{Amount Paid} - \text{Cost of Hat}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Change} = 80 \text{ dollars} - 70 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: Thea received $10 in change.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
