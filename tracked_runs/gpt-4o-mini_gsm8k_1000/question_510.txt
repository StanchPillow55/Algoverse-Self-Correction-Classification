Question:
Ford owns a garden and he grows 40 roses every week. He supplies Roses to the local flower shops. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. How many roses does Ford lack to supply all the flower shops every month?


Reference Answer:
The first flower shop needs 20 x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 roses every month.
The second flower shop needs 15 x 4= <<15*4=60>>60 roses every month.
The third flower shop needs 30 x 4 = <<30*4=120>>120 roses every month.
So the total number of roses that all the flower shop needs every month is 120 + 80 + 60 = <<120+80+60=260>>260.
The total roses Ford grows every month is 40 x 4 = <<40*4=160>>160
Therefore, the total number of roses he lacks is 260 - 160 = <<260-160=100>>100 to supply all the flower shops every month.

Response:
To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.**
2. **Calculate the total number of roses ordered by all the flower shops in a month.**
3. **Determine the difference between the total roses grown and the total roses ordered.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. There are 4 weeks in a month (assuming a typical month).

\[
\text{Total roses grown in a month} = \text{roses per week} \times \text{number of weeks}
\]
\[
\text{Total roses grown in a month} = 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ roses}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of roses ordered by all the flower shops in a month.

Now, we will sum the orders from each flower shop:

- First flower shop orders 20 roses per week.
- Second flower shop orders 15 roses per week.
- Third flower shop orders 30 roses per week.

First, we calculate the total weekly orders:

\[
\text{Total weekly orders} = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses/week}
\]

Now, we calculate the total orders for the month:

\[
\text{Total orders in a month} = \text{total weekly orders} \times \text{number of weeks}
\]
\[
\text{Total orders in a month} = 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 260 \text{ roses}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the difference between the total roses grown and the total roses ordered.

Now we find out how many roses Ford lacks:

\[
\text{Roses lacking} = \text{Total orders in a month} - \text{Total roses grown in a month}
\]
\[
\text{Roses lacking} = 260 \text{ roses} - 160 \text{ roses} = 100 \text{ roses}
\]

### Final Answer

Ford lacks **100 roses** to supply all the flower shops every month.
