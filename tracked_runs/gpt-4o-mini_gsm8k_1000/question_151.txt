Question ID: 924

Question:
A three-toed sloth moves very slowly, and only eats when he is up in his tree.  For a meal of berries, it takes the sloth 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree.  Assuming he picks the same number of berries on each trip, what is the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground if he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours?


Reference Answer:
If one trip is 4-hours long, in 8 hours he can make 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 trips.
To collect 24 berries per 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 berries per trip.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many berries the sloth must pick up per trip down to the ground in order to collect a total of 24 berries in 8 hours.

1. **Understanding the Time Constraint**:
   - The sloth takes 4 hours for each trip (down to the ground, picking berries, and climbing back up).
   - In 8 hours, the sloth can make a maximum of:
     \[
     \text{Number of trips} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Time per trip}} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
     \]

2. **Total Berries Requirement**:
   - The sloth wants to collect a total of 24 berries in these 2 trips.

3. **Calculating Berries per Trip**:
   - To find out how many berries he needs to pick per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:
     \[
     \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{\text{Total berries}}{\text{Number of trips}} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, in order to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, is **12 berries**.

Final Answer: **12 berries** per trip.
