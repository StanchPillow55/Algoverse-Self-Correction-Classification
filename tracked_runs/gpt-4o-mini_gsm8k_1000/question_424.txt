Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of trees Chris has:**
   - According to the problem, Chris has 6 trees.

2. **Calculate the number of trees Ferdinand has:**
   - Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has.
   - Therefore, we calculate Ferdinand's trees as follows:
     \[
     \text{Ferdinand's trees} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Chris's trees} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of trees Harry has:**
   - Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.
   - First, we find twice the number of trees Ferdinand has:
     \[
     \text{Twice Ferdinand's trees} = 2 \times \text{Ferdinand's trees} = 2 \times 3 = 6
     \]
   - Now, we add 5 to this amount to find the total number of trees Harry has:
     \[
     \text{Harry's trees} = \text{Twice Ferdinand's trees} + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11
     \]

4. **Calculate how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard:**
   - To find the difference in the number of trees between Harry and Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's trees} - \text{Ferdinand's trees} = 11 - 3 = 8
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that there are **8 more trees in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard**.
