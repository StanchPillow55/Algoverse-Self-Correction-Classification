Question ID: 30

Question:
Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. If their total age now is 162, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.


Reference Answer:
The total ratio representing their ages is 7+11= <<7+11=18>>18
Since the fraction of the ratio that represents Allen's age is 11/18, Allen's current age is 11/18*162 = <<11/18*162=99>>99
If Allen is currently 99 years old, in 10 years he will be 99+10 = <<99+10=109>>109 years old
#### 109

Response:
To solve the problem, we start by letting Darrell's age be represented as \( 7x \) and Allen's age as \( 11x \), where \( x \) is a common multiplier. This representation is based on the ratio of their ages, which is given as 7:11.

Next, we know that the total of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
7x + 11x = 162
\]

Combining the terms on the left side gives us:

\[
18x = 162
\]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[
x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
\]

Now that we have the value of \( x \), we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:

1. Darrell's age:
   \[
   7x = 7 \times 9 = 63
   \]

2. Allen's age:
   \[
   11x = 11 \times 9 = 99
   \]

Now we have their current ages:
- Darrell is 63 years old.
- Allen is 99 years old.

Next, we need to calculate Allen's age 10 years from now. We simply add 10 to his current age:

\[
\text{Allen's age in 10 years} = 99 + 10 = 109
\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

\[
\boxed{109}
\]
