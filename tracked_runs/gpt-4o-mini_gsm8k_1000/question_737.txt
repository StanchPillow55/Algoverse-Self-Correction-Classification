Question ID: 34

Question:
Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. If Raymond has 40 jewels, how many jewels does Siobhan have?


Reference Answer:
Half of Raymond's jewels is 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20
Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, he has 20+5 = <<5+20=25>>25 jewels.
If Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, he has 25-2 = 23 jewels.
#### 23

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of jewels Raymond has**: 
   According to the problem, Raymond has 40 jewels.

2. **Calculate the number of jewels Aaron has**:
   The problem states that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
   First, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels:
   \[
   \text{Half of Raymond's jewels} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   Now, we add 5 to this amount to find out how many jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   \text{Aaron's jewels} = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jewels Siobhan has**:
   The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   \text{Siobhan's jewels} = 25 - 2 = 23
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   Siobhan has 23 jewels.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{23}
\]
