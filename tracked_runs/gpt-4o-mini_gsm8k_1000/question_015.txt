Question ID: 636

Question:
Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as her less-experienced colleague Jewel. Daily, Jewel processes 50 customers. What is the total weekly production for the two if they work all days of the week?


Reference Answer:
While Jewel is processing 50 orders in a day, Julie processes 50 orders/day * 2 = <<50*2=100>>100 orders/day.
In a day, they process 100 orders/day + 50 orders/day = <<100+50=150>>150 orders together.
The total number of orders the two processes in a week is 150 orders/day * 7 days/week = <<150*7=1050>>1050 orders
#### 1050

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many customers Julie processes in a day and then calculate the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel.

1. **Understanding Jewel's Production**:
   - Jewel processes 50 customers daily.

2. **Determining Julie's Production**:
   - According to the problem, Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Therefore, if Jewel processes 50 customers in a day, Julie will process:
     \[
     \text{Julie's daily production} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's daily production} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ customers}
     \]

3. **Calculating Daily Production for Both**:
   - Now we can find the total daily production for both Jewel and Julie:
     \[
     \text{Total daily production} = \text{Jewel's daily production} + \text{Julie's daily production} = 50 + 100 = 150 \text{ customers}
     \]

4. **Calculating Weekly Production**:
   - Since they work all days of the week (7 days), we can calculate the total weekly production:
     \[
     \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Total daily production} \times 7 = 150 \times 7 = 1050 \text{ customers}
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - The total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel is:
     \[
     \boxed{1050} \text{ customers}
     \]
