Question ID: 986

Question:
Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill.  In each basket she wants to add 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.  The petunias cost $3.00 apiece and the sweet potato vines cost $2.50 apiece.  How much will she spend filling all 5 hanging baskets?


Reference Answer:
The petunia are $3.00 each and she wants 3 per basket so that's 3.00*3 = $<<3*3=9.00>>9.00
The sweet potato vines are $2.50 each and she wants 2 per basket so that's 2.5*2 = $<<2.5*2=5.00>>5.00
For 1 basket, the petunias will cost $9.00 and the sweet potato vines will cost $5.00 for a total of 9+5 = $<<9+5=14.00>>14.00
Each basket will cost $14.00 to fill and she needs to fill 5 baskets for a total of 14*5 = $<<14*5=70.00>>70.00

Response:
To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of plants needed for all baskets**:
   - Each basket contains 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.
   - Therefore, for 5 baskets:
     - Total petunias needed = \( 5 \text{ baskets} \times 3 \text{ petunias/basket} = 15 \text{ petunias} \)
     - Total sweet potato vines needed = \( 5 \text{ baskets} \times 2 \text{ sweet potato vines/basket} = 10 \text{ sweet potato vines} \)

2. **Calculate the cost of the petunias**:
   - The cost of each petunia is $3.00.
   - Total cost for petunias = \( 15 \text{ petunias} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars/petunia} = 45.00 \text{ dollars} \)

3. **Calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines**:
   - The cost of each sweet potato vine is $2.50.
   - Total cost for sweet potato vines = \( 10 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times 2.50 \text{ dollars/vine} = 25.00 \text{ dollars} \)

4. **Calculate the total cost**:
   - Total cost = Total cost for petunias + Total cost for sweet potato vines
   - Total cost = \( 45.00 \text{ dollars} + 25.00 \text{ dollars} = 70.00 \text{ dollars} \)

Thus, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is **$70.00**. 

Final answer: **$70.00**

Response:
To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of plants needed for one basket
Katherine wants to add:
- 3 petunias
- 2 sweet potato vines

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of plants for all baskets
Since she has 5 baskets, we can calculate the total number of each type of plant needed:

**For petunias:**
\[
\text{Total petunias} = 3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias}
\]

**For sweet potato vines:**
\[
\text{Total sweet potato vines} = 2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ sweet potato vines}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of each type of plant
Next, we will calculate the total cost for each type of plant.

**Cost of petunias:**
The cost of one petunia is $3.00. Therefore, the total cost for 15 petunias is:
\[
\text{Total cost for petunias} = 15 \text{ petunias} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars/petunia} = 45.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Cost of sweet potato vines:**
The cost of one sweet potato vine is $2.50. Therefore, the total cost for 10 sweet potato vines is:
\[
\text{Total cost for sweet potato vines} = 10 \text{ vines} \times 2.50 \text{ dollars/vine} = 25.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost for all plants
Now, we add the total costs of both types of plants to find the overall cost:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for petunias} + \text{Total cost for sweet potato vines}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 45.00 \text{ dollars} + 25.00 \text{ dollars} = 70.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Katherine will spend a total of **$70.00** filling all 5 hanging baskets.

Response:
To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we can break the problem down into several steps.

1. **Calculate the number of plants needed for one basket:**
   - Each basket requires 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.
   - Total plants per basket = 3 petunias + 2 sweet potato vines = 5 plants.

2. **Calculate the total number of plants for all 5 baskets:**
   - Total petunias for 5 baskets = 3 petunias/basket × 5 baskets = 15 petunias.
   - Total sweet potato vines for 5 baskets = 2 sweet potato vines/basket × 5 baskets = 10 sweet potato vines.

3. **Calculate the total cost for the petunias:**
   - Cost per petunia = $3.00.
   - Total cost for petunias = 15 petunias × $3.00/petunia = $45.00.

4. **Calculate the total cost for the sweet potato vines:**
   - Cost per sweet potato vine = $2.50.
   - Total cost for sweet potato vines = 10 sweet potato vines × $2.50/vine = $25.00.

5. **Calculate the total cost for all plants:**
   - Total cost = Total cost for petunias + Total cost for sweet potato vines.
   - Total cost = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

Thus, Katherine will spend a total of **$70.00** filling all 5 hanging baskets.
