Question ID: 53

Question:
A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?


Reference Answer:
On Thursday the mechanic charged a total of 6*60 + 4*40 = $<<6*60+4*40=520>>520.
On Friday the mechanic charged a total of 12*40 = $<<12*40=480>>480.
Thus, on Thursday, the day with higher revenue, the mechanic had 520-480 = $<<520-480=40>>40 more revenue than on Friday.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total revenue earned by the mechanic on both Thursday and Friday, and then find the difference between the two days to determine how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue.

### Step 1: Calculate Thursday's Revenue

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs:
- 6 truck tires
- 4 car tires

The charges are:
- $60 per truck tire
- $40 per car tire

**Calculating the revenue from truck tires:**
\[
\text{Revenue from truck tires} = \text{Number of truck tires} \times \text{Charge per truck tire}
\]
\[
\text{Revenue from truck tires} = 6 \times 60 = 360
\]

**Calculating the revenue from car tires:**
\[
\text{Revenue from car tires} = \text{Number of car tires} \times \text{Charge per car tire}
\]
\[
\text{Revenue from car tires} = 4 \times 40 = 160
\]

**Total revenue on Thursday:**
\[
\text{Total revenue on Thursday} = \text{Revenue from truck tires} + \text{Revenue from car tires}
\]
\[
\text{Total revenue on Thursday} = 360 + 160 = 520
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Friday's Revenue

On Friday, the mechanic repairs:
- 0 truck tires
- 12 car tires

**Calculating the revenue from car tires:**
\[
\text{Revenue from car tires} = \text{Number of car tires} \times \text{Charge per car tire}
\]
\[
\text{Revenue from car tires} = 12 \times 40 = 480
\]

**Total revenue on Friday:**
Since no truck tires were repaired, the total revenue on Friday is simply the revenue from car tires:
\[
\text{Total revenue on Friday} = 480
\]

### Step 3: Compare the Revenues

Now we compare the total revenues from both days:
- Total revenue on Thursday: $520
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

### Step 4: Calculate the Difference

To find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue (Thursday), we subtract Friday's revenue from Thursday's revenue:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total revenue on Thursday} - \text{Total revenue on Friday}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 520 - 480 = 40
\]

### Final Answer

The mechanic earned **$40** more on Thursday than on Friday.
