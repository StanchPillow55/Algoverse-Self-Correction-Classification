Question:
Jayden had $70 from selling pictures he took as a hobby.  His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance to help him buy a new camera that costs $200. How much more does Jayden need to buy the camera?


Reference Answer:
Ava gave $90/2 = $<<90/2=45>>45 to Jayden.
Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $<<70+45=115>>115
So, Jayden needs $200 - $115 = $<<200-115=85>>85 to buy the new camera
#### 85

Response:
To determine how much more money Jayden needs to buy the camera, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate how much money Jayden currently has.**
   - Jayden has $70 from selling pictures.

2. **Calculate how much money Ava gives to Jayden.**
   - Ava has an allowance of $90.
   - She gives Jayden half of her allowance:
     \[
     \text{Amount Ava gives} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
     \]

3. **Calculate Jayden's total amount of money after receiving money from Ava.**
   - Now, we add the money Jayden already has to the money he received from Ava:
     \[
     \text{Total money Jayden has} = 70 + 45 = 115
     \]

4. **Determine the cost of the camera.**
   - The camera costs $200.

5. **Calculate how much more money Jayden needs to buy the camera.**
   - We subtract the total amount of money Jayden has from the cost of the camera:
     \[
     \text{Amount needed} = 200 - 115 = 85
     \]

Thus, Jayden needs an additional $85 to buy the camera.

**Final Answer: Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.**
