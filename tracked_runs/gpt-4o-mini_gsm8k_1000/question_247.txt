Question ID: 1007

Question:
Two friends are playing pick-up sticks. While playing, they noticed that there are 9 red sticks, and 5 more blue sticks than red. Also, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. How many sticks do they have?


Reference Answer:
There are 9 + 5 = <<9+5=14>>14 blue sticks.
There are 14 - 3 = <<14-3=11>>11 yellow sticks.
There are a total of 9 + 14 + 11 = <<9+14+11=34>>34 sticks.
#### 34

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of sticks by calculating the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks based on the information given.

1. **Identify the number of red sticks**:
   - The problem states that there are 9 red sticks.
   \[
   \text{Number of red sticks} = 9
   \]

2. **Determine the number of blue sticks**:
   - The problem states that there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Therefore, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue sticks} = \text{Number of red sticks} + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of yellow sticks**:
   - The problem states that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Thus, we can find the number of yellow sticks:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow sticks} = \text{Number of blue sticks} - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of sticks**:
   - Now that we have the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks, we can find the total number of sticks by adding them together:
   \[
   \text{Total number of sticks} = \text{Number of red sticks} + \text{Number of blue sticks} + \text{Number of yellow sticks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of sticks} = 9 + 14 + 11
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of sticks} = 34
   \]

Thus, the total number of sticks they have is \( \boxed{34} \).
