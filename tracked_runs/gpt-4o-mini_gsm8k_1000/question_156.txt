Question:
Dijana and Anis live near a lake, and every weekend they go out rowing into the lake. On a Sunday morning, both went out rowing, and Dijana rowed for 50 miles the whole day. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Calculate the total distance the two of them rowed on that day.


Reference Answer:
Anis rowed for 1/5 * 50 = <<1/5*50=10>>10 more miles than Dijana.
The total distance Anis covered is 50 + 10 = <<50+10=60>>60 miles.
The two of them rowed for 60 + 50 = <<60+50=110>>110 miles on that day.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how far Anis rowed based on the distance Dijana rowed, and then calculate the total distance both of them rowed together.

1. **Distance rowed by Dijana**: 
   Dijana rowed a total of 50 miles.

2. **Distance rowed by Anis**: 
   The problem states that Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find out how far Anis rowed, we first need to calculate what 1/5 of Dijana's distance is.

   \[
   \text{1/5 of Dijana's distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 \text{ miles} = 10 \text{ miles}
   \]

   Now, since Anis rowed 1/5 times more than Dijana, we need to add this amount to Dijana's distance to find Anis's total distance:

   \[
   \text{Distance rowed by Anis} = \text{Dijana's distance} + \text{1/5 of Dijana's distance}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance rowed by Anis} = 50 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance rowed by both**:
   Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis by adding their distances together:

   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance rowed by Dijana} + \text{Distance rowed by Anis}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 50 \text{ miles} + 60 \text{ miles} = 110 \text{ miles}
   \]

Thus, the total distance that Dijana and Anis rowed on that day is:

\[
\boxed{110 \text{ miles}}
\]
