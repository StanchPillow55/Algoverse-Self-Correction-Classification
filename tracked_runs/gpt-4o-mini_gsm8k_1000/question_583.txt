Question ID: 1134

Question:
Jane has saved $4 of her allowance every week for the past 8 weeks. If she continues to save the same amount each week, how many more weeks will it take for her to have saved a total of $60?


Reference Answer:
She has already saved 8 * $4 = $<<8*4=32>>32.
She needs to save an additional $60 - $32 = $<<60-32=28>>28.
It will take her 28 / 4 = <<28/4=7>>7 more weeks to save the rest of the money.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Jane has saved so far and how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60.

1. **Calculate Jane's current savings:**
   Jane saves $4 each week. She has been saving for 8 weeks. Therefore, we can calculate her total savings so far as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total savings} = \text{Amount saved per week} \times \text{Number of weeks}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Total savings} = 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

   So, Jane has saved $32 so far.

2. **Determine how much more she needs to save:**
   Jane wants to save a total of $60. We need to find out how much more she needs to save:

   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Current savings}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

   Thus, Jane needs to save an additional $28 to reach her goal of $60.

3. **Calculate how many more weeks it will take to save the additional amount:**
   Jane continues to save $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the additional $28, we can use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Number of weeks needed} = \frac{\text{Amount needed}}{\text{Amount saved per week}}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Number of weeks needed} = \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Jane **7 more weeks** to save enough money to reach her goal of $60.

**Final Answer: 7 weeks**
