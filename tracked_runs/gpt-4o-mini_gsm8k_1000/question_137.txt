Question ID: 1262

Question:
John decides to take up an odd hobby of speed talking.  His normally speaking speed is 150 WPM.  After training his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed.  How long would it take him to speak 10 pages if each page has 450 words per page?


Reference Answer:
He can speak 150*2.5=<<150*2.5=375>>375 words per minute
He wants to say 450*10=<<450*10=4500>>4500 words
So he can speak them in 4500/375=<<4500/375=12>>12 minutes

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine John's new speaking speed after training.**
2. **Calculate the total number of words he needs to speak.**
3. **Calculate the time it will take him to speak that number of words at his new speed.**

### Step 1: Determine John's new speaking speed

John's normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed increases to 2.5 times his normal speed.

\[
\text{New Speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of words

Next, we need to find out how many words are in 10 pages, given that each page has 450 words.

\[
\text{Total Words} = \text{Number of Pages} \times \text{Words per Page}
\]
\[
\text{Total Words} = 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the time to speak the total number of words

Now, we will calculate how long it will take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM.

To find the time in minutes, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Time (in minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total Words}}{\text{Speed (WPM)}}
\]
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, it would take John **12 minutes** to speak 10 pages if each page has 450 words.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it will take John to speak 10 pages at his new speaking speed after training.

**Step 1: Calculate John's new speaking speed.**

John's normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster than his normal speed.

\[
\text{New Speed} = \text{Normal Speed} \times 2.5 = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{New Speed} = 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of words in 10 pages.**

Each page has 450 words, and there are 10 pages. Therefore, the total number of words is:

\[
\text{Total Words} = \text{Words per Page} \times \text{Number of Pages} = 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total Words} = 4500 \, \text{words}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words at the new speed.**

To find the time in minutes, we divide the total number of words by the new speaking speed:

\[
\text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total Words}}{\text{New Speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{4500}{375} = 12 \, \text{minutes}
\]

**Final Answer:**

It would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speaking speed.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine John's new speaking speed after training.**
2. **Calculate the total number of words he needs to speak.**
3. **Calculate the time it takes him to speak those words at his new speed.**

### Step 1: Determine John's New Speaking Speed

John's normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed increases to 2.5 times his normal speed.

\[
\text{New Speed} = \text{Normal Speed} \times 2.5
\]
\[
\text{New Speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Number of Words

Next, we need to find out how many words are in 10 pages, given that each page has 450 words.

\[
\text{Total Words} = \text{Number of Pages} \times \text{Words per Page}
\]
\[
\text{Total Words} = 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Time to Speak the Total Words

Now, we need to calculate how long it will take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM.

To find the time in minutes, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total Words}}{\text{Speed (WPM)}}
\]
\[
\text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, it would take John **12 minutes** to speak 10 pages if each page has 450 words.
