Question ID: 481

Question:
Belen has two kinds of pennies, a 2010 penny and a 1959 penny. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. If the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, what is the combined weight of the two pennies?


Reference Answer:
If the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, the 2010 penny weighs 3/4 * 48 grains = <<48*3/4=36>>36 grains
The combined weight for the two is 36 grains + 48 grains = <<36+48=84>>84 grains
#### 84

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to find the combined weight of a 2010 penny and a 1959 penny, given that the 2010 penny weighs three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny.

1. **Identify the weight of the 1959 penny**: 
   The problem states that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

2. **Calculate the weight of the 2010 penny**: 
   Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:
   \[
   \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Weight of 1959 penny}
   \]
   Substituting the weight of the 1959 penny:
   \[
   \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains}
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3 \times 48}{4}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{144}{4} = 36 \text{ grains}
   \]

3. **Calculate the combined weight of the two pennies**: 
   Now that we have the weights of both pennies, we can find their combined weight:
   \[
   \text{Combined weight} = \text{Weight of 1959 penny} + \text{Weight of 2010 penny}
   \]
   Substituting the weights we found:
   \[
   \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains}
   \]
   \[
   = 84 \text{ grains}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   The combined weight of the two pennies is \( \boxed{84} \) grains.
