Question ID: 855

Question:
I am three years younger than my brother, and I am 2 years older than my sister. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. When you add all our ages, you get 87. How old am I?


Reference Answer:
Let X be my age. My brother is X + 3 years old. My sister is X - 2 years old.
My mom is (X + 3) * 3 - 1 years old.
The sum of our ages is X + (X+3) + (X-2) + [(X+3)*3 - 1] = 87 years old.
Multiplying through the parentheses and combining like terms, you get X*6 + 9 = 87 years old.
Subtracting nine from both sides and dividing both sides by 6, you get X = 13 years old.

Response:
Let's denote the ages of each family member with variables:

- Let \( x \) be my age.
- Let \( b \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( s \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( m \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. I am three years younger than my brother:
   \[
   x = b - 3
   \]

2. I am two years older than my sister:
   \[
   x = s + 2
   \]

3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age:
   \[
   m = 3b - 1
   \]

4. The sum of all our ages is 87:
   \[
   x + b + s + m = 87
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( x \), \( s \), and \( m \) into the equation for the sum of ages.

First, we can express \( s \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
s = x - 2
\]

Now we substitute \( s \) into the sum equation:
\[
x + b + (x - 2) + m = 87
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + b + m - 2 = 87
\]
Adding 2 to both sides gives:
\[
2x + b + m = 89
\]

Next, we substitute \( m \) with \( 3b - 1 \):
\[
2x + b + (3b - 1) = 89
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 4b - 1 = 89
\]
Adding 1 to both sides gives:
\[
2x + 4b = 90
\]
Dividing the entire equation by 2:
\[
x + 2b = 45
\]
Now we can express \( b \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
2b = 45 - x
\]
\[
b = \frac{45 - x}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \( b \) back into the equation for \( x \):
From \( x = b - 3 \):
\[
x = \frac{45 - x}{2} - 3
\]
Multiplying through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
2x = 45 - x - 6
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
2x + x = 39
\]
\[
3x = 39
\]
Dividing by 3:
\[
x = 13
\]

Now that we have my age, we can find the ages of my brother, sister, and mom.

1. My brother's age:
   \[
   b = x + 3 = 13 + 3 = 16
   \]

2. My sister's age:
   \[
   s = x - 2 = 13 - 2 = 11
   \]

3. My mom's age:
   \[
   m = 3b - 1 = 3(16) - 1 = 48 - 1 = 47
   \]

Now, let's verify the sum of all ages:
\[
x + b + s + m = 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87
\]
This confirms our calculations are correct.

Thus, my age is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]

Response:
Let's define the ages of each family member using variables:

- Let \( x \) be my age.
- Let \( b \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( s \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( m \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. I am three years younger than my brother:
   \[
   x = b - 3
   \]

2. I am two years older than my sister:
   \[
   x = s + 2
   \]

3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age:
   \[
   m = 3b - 1
   \]

4. The sum of all our ages is 87:
   \[
   x + b + s + m = 87
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( x \) and \( m \) into the age sum equation.

First, substitute \( x \) from the first equation into the sum equation:
\[
(b - 3) + b + s + (3b - 1) = 87
\]

Now, simplify this equation:
\[
b - 3 + b + s + 3b - 1 = 87
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
5b + s - 4 = 87
\]
Add 4 to both sides:
\[
5b + s = 91
\]

Next, substitute \( s \) from the second equation into this equation. From the second equation, we have:
\[
s = x - 2
\]
Substituting \( x = b - 3 \) into \( s \):
\[
s = (b - 3) - 2 = b - 5
\]

Now substitute \( s \) into the equation \( 5b + s = 91 \):
\[
5b + (b - 5) = 91
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
6b - 5 = 91
\]
Add 5 to both sides:
\[
6b = 96
\]
Divide by 6:
\[
b = 16
\]

Now that we have my brother's age, we can find my age:
\[
x = b - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13
\]

Next, we can find my sister's age:
\[
s = b - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11
\]

Finally, we can find my mom's age:
\[
m = 3b - 1 = 3(16) - 1 = 48 - 1 = 47
\]

Now let's verify the sum of all ages:
\[
x + b + s + m = 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87
\]

Everything checks out, so my age is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]

Response:
Let's define the ages of each family member using variables:

- Let \( x \) be my age.
- Let \( b \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( s \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( m \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. I am three years younger than my brother:
   \[
   x = b - 3
   \]

2. I am two years older than my sister:
   \[
   x = s + 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad s = x - 2
   \]

3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age:
   \[
   m = 3b - 1
   \]

4. The sum of all our ages is 87:
   \[
   x + b + s + m = 87
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( s \) and \( m \) in terms of \( b \) and \( x \) into the age sum equation.

Substituting \( s \) from equation 2:
\[
x + b + (x - 2) + m = 87
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + b - 2 + m = 87
\]

Now substituting \( m \) from equation 3:
\[
2x + b - 2 + (3b - 1) = 87
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 4b - 3 = 87
\]
Adding 3 to both sides:
\[
2x + 4b = 90
\]
Dividing the entire equation by 2:
\[
x + 2b = 45 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 45 - 2b \quad \text{(Equation 5)}
\]

Now we can substitute equation 5 into equation 1:
\[
45 - 2b = b - 3
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
45 + 3 = 3b \quad \Rightarrow \quad 48 = 3b \quad \Rightarrow \quad b = 16
\]

Now substituting \( b = 16 \) back into equation 5 to find \( x \):
\[
x = 45 - 2(16) = 45 - 32 = 13
\]

Now we can find \( s \) and \( m \):
Using \( x = 13 \):
\[
s = x - 2 = 13 - 2 = 11
\]
\[
m = 3b - 1 = 3(16) - 1 = 48 - 1 = 47
\]

Now let's verify the total:
\[
x + b + s + m = 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87
\]

Everything checks out. Therefore, my age is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]
