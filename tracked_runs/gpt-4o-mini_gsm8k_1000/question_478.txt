Response:
To find the total amount the company spent on advertising over the two years, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the amount spent in the first year:**
   The company spends $15,000 on advertising in the first year. 

   \[
   \text{Amount spent in Year 1} = 15000
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent in the second year:**
   The company spends a third of the amount spent in the first year for the second year. To find this amount, we need to calculate one-third of $15,000.

   \[
   \text{Amount spent in Year 2} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15000
   \]

   Now, we perform the calculation:

   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 15000 = 5000
   \]

   So, the amount spent in the second year is $5,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent over the two years:**
   Now, we will add the amounts spent in both years to find the total expenditure on advertising.

   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Amount spent in Year 1} + \text{Amount spent in Year 2}
   \]

   Substituting the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = 15000 + 5000
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition:

   \[
   15000 + 5000 = 20000
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is 

   \[
   \boxed{20000}
   \]
