Question:
An electronics seller bought 5 phones for $700 each and gives the seller $4000 in dollar bills. How much will the seller give back in change?


Reference Answer:
The seller bought the 5 phones for $700 * 5 = $<<700*5=3500>>3500.
So the seller gives back $4000-$3500 = $<<4000-3500=500>>500.
#### 500

Response:
To determine how much change the seller will give back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 5 phones and then subtract that amount from the $4000 given to the seller.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the phones.**

The seller bought 5 phones, and each phone costs $700. We can calculate the total cost as follows:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Phones} \times \text{Cost per Phone}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 5 \times 700
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 3500
\]

So, the total cost of the 5 phones is $3500.

**Step 2: Calculate the change to be given back.**

The seller gives the seller $4000. To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:

\[
\text{Change} = \text{Amount Given} - \text{Total Cost}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Change} = 4000 - 3500
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Change} = 500
\]

**Final Answer:**

The seller will give back $500 in change.
