Question ID: 1275

Question:
John's car breaks down.  The car weighs 1200 pounds and he has luggage in it weighing 250 pounds.  He also has his two young children who weigh 75 pounds each in it.  If the force to move the car is 1% of the weight how much force does he need to push the car?


Reference Answer:
His two children weigh 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 pounds
So the total weight of the car and everything is 1200+250+150=<<1200+250+150=1600>>1600 pounds
So he needs to generate 1600*.01=<<1600*.01=16>>16 pounds

Response:
To determine the force needed to push John's car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. Then, we will find 1% of that total weight, as the problem states that the force required to move the car is 1% of its weight.

### Step 1: Calculate the total weight

1. **Weight of the car**: 1200 pounds
2. **Weight of the luggage**: 250 pounds
3. **Weight of the two children**: 
   - Each child weighs 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of the children = 75 pounds + 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Now, we can sum these weights to find the total weight:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of the car} + \text{Weight of the luggage} + \text{Weight of the children}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight} = 1200 \text{ pounds} + 250 \text{ pounds} + 150 \text{ pounds}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total weight} = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate 1% of the total weight

Next, we need to find 1% of the total weight to determine the force required to push the car.

\[
\text{Force} = 1\% \text{ of Total weight}
\]

To calculate 1%, we can multiply the total weight by 0.01:

\[
\text{Force} = 0.01 \times 1600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Force} = 16 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the force needed to push the car is:

\[
\boxed{16 \text{ pounds}}
\]
