Question ID: 749

Question:
In a school activity, fifty-four students are to be separated into six groups of equal size. If the activity requires 12 groups, how many more groups are needed to form?


Reference Answer:
There are 54/6 = <<54/6=9>>9 groups formed from the 54 students.
So, 12 - 9 = <<12-9=3>>3 groups more are needed to form.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many more groups are needed to accommodate all 54 students when the activity requires 12 groups.

### Step 1: Determine the size of each group
First, we need to find out how many students can be in each group if we were to separate all 54 students into 12 groups.

To find the size of each group, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups:

\[
\text{Size of each group} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of groups}} = \frac{54}{12}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{54}{12} = 4.5
\]

Since we cannot have half a student in a group, this means that 12 groups cannot accommodate all 54 students evenly. 

### Step 2: Determine the number of groups needed for equal distribution
Next, we need to find out how many groups are required to accommodate all 54 students if each group must have an equal number of students.

To find the number of groups needed, we can divide the total number of students by the maximum number of students we want in each group. Since we want equal groups, we can assume a reasonable group size. 

Let's assume we want each group to have 9 students (a common group size). We can calculate the number of groups needed:

\[
\text{Number of groups needed} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Size of each group}} = \frac{54}{9}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{54}{9} = 6
\]

### Step 3: Compare the required number of groups with the existing number of groups
The problem states that the activity requires 12 groups. We have calculated that we need 6 groups to accommodate all 54 students if each group has 9 students.

Now, we need to find out how many more groups are needed:

\[
\text{More groups needed} = \text{Required groups} - \text{Existing groups} = 12 - 6
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
12 - 6 = 6
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the number of additional groups needed to form is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many more groups are needed if the activity requires 12 groups, given that there are 54 students to be separated into groups of equal size.

### Step 1: Determine the size of each group with the current setup

First, we need to find out how many students will be in each group if we separate 54 students into 6 groups.

\[
\text{Size of each group} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of groups}} = \frac{54}{6} = 9
\]

So, if we create 6 groups, each group will have 9 students.

### Step 2: Determine the size of each group if 12 groups are formed

Next, we need to find out how many students would be in each group if we were to form 12 groups instead.

\[
\text{Size of each group} = \frac{54}{12}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{54}{12} = 4.5
\]

This means that if we were to form 12 groups, each group would have 4.5 students, which is not possible since we cannot have half a student in a group.

### Step 3: Determine how many groups can be formed with whole students

Since we cannot have half students in a group, we need to find out how many complete groups can be formed with whole students. 

To find the maximum number of groups that can be formed with whole students, we can divide the total number of students by the maximum number of students per group (which we can assume to be 9, as calculated earlier).

\[
\text{Maximum number of groups} = \frac{54}{9} = 6
\]

This confirms that we can form 6 groups of 9 students each.

### Step 4: Calculate how many more groups are needed

The problem states that the activity requires 12 groups. Since we can only form 6 groups with the available students, we need to find out how many more groups are needed.

\[
\text{Additional groups needed} = \text{Required groups} - \text{Current groups} = 12 - 6 = 6
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of additional groups needed to meet the requirement of 12 groups is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many groups are needed to accommodate fifty-four students when they are to be separated into groups of equal size. 

1. **Determine the size of each group**: 
   We have 54 students and we want to separate them into 6 groups of equal size. To find the size of each group, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups:

   \[
   \text{Size of each group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{6 \text{ groups}} = 9 \text{ students per group}
   \]

2. **Identify the requirement for groups**: 
   The problem states that the activity requires 12 groups. 

3. **Calculate the total number of students that can be accommodated in 12 groups**: 
   If we have 12 groups and each group can hold 9 students, we can calculate the total number of students that can be accommodated:

   \[
   \text{Total capacity of 12 groups} = 12 \text{ groups} \times 9 \text{ students per group} = 108 \text{ students}
   \]

4. **Determine the difference in the number of groups needed**: 
   Since we already have 6 groups and we need a total of 12 groups, we can find out how many more groups are needed:

   \[
   \text{Additional groups needed} = 12 \text{ groups} - 6 \text{ groups} = 6 \text{ groups}
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the number of additional groups needed to form is:

   \[
   \boxed{6}
   \] 

This means that to accommodate all students in the activity, 6 more groups need to be formed.
