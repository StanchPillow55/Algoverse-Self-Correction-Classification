Question:
Zoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest. Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. They each get one watermelon. Zoey's has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?


Reference Answer:
Zoey spits a total distance of 400 feet because 40 x 10 = <<40*10=400>>400
Sydney spits a total distance of 420 feet because 35 x 12 = <<35*12=420>>420
This totals to 820 feet because 400 + 420 = <<400+420=820>>820
The average total distance is 410 because 820 / 2 = <<820/2=410>>410

Response:
To find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we need to calculate the total distance each person spits their seeds and then find the average of those totals.

**Step 1: Calculate Zoey's total distance.**

Zoey has 40 seeds, and she spits each one 10 feet. We can calculate her total distance by multiplying the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat:

\[
\text{Total distance spat by Zoey} = \text{Number of seeds} \times \text{Distance per seed}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance spat by Zoey} = 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Sydney's total distance.**

Sydney has 35 seeds, and she spits each one 12 feet. Similarly, we calculate her total distance:

\[
\text{Total distance spat by Sydney} = \text{Number of seeds} \times \text{Distance per seed}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance spat by Sydney} = 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the average total distance spat.**

Now that we have the total distances spat by both Zoey and Sydney, we can find the average total distance. The average is calculated by adding both total distances and dividing by the number of participants (which is 2 in this case):

\[
\text{Average total distance} = \frac{\text{Total distance by Zoey} + \text{Total distance by Sydney}}{2}
\]
\[
\text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2}
\]
\[
\text{Average total distance} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet}
\]

**Final Answer:**
The average total distance spat is **410 feet**.
