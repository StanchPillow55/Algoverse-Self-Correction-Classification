Question ID: 578

Question:
Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20. This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5 and the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. What was the final value of the number train?


Reference Answer:
If Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20, half the number is 1/2*20=<<20-10=10>>10
The starting value plus half the number is 20+10=<<20+10=30>>30
This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5, giving a total of 30/5 = <<30/5=6>>6
The starting value minus 12 is 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8
The resulting value after dividing by 5 was times by the starting value minus 12, a total of 8*6 = <<8*6=48>>48

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to follow the steps outlined in the question carefully. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the starting value**: 
   Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20. We denote this starting value as \( S = 20 \).

2. **Calculate half of the number**: 
   The problem states that we need to add half of the number to the starting value. Since we are not given a specific number, we will denote the number as \( N \). Therefore, half of the number is \( \frac{N}{2} \).

3. **Add the starting value and half the number**: 
   We need to calculate:
   \[
   S + \frac{N}{2} = 20 + \frac{N}{2}
   \]

4. **Divide the result by 5**: 
   Next, we take the result from the previous step and divide it by 5:
   \[
   \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5}
   \]

5. **Multiply by the starting value minus 12**: 
   We need to multiply the result from the previous step by \( S - 12 \):
   \[
   S - 12 = 20 - 12 = 8
   \]
   So, we multiply:
   \[
   \left(\frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5}\right) \times 8
   \]

6. **Combine the calculations**: 
   Now we can express the final value \( F \) of the number train:
   \[
   F = \left(\frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5}\right) \times 8
   \]

7. **Simplify the expression**: 
   We can simplify this expression step by step:
   \[
   F = \frac{8(20 + \frac{N}{2})}{5}
   \]
   Distributing the 8:
   \[
   F = \frac{160 + 4N}{5}
   \]

8. **Final expression**: 
   The final value of the number train, expressed in terms of \( N \), is:
   \[
   F = \frac{160 + 4N}{5}
   \]

Since the problem does not specify a particular value for \( N \), we cannot compute a numerical final answer without knowing \( N \). However, we have derived the formula for the final value of the number train based on the starting value and the number \( N \).

If you have a specific value for \( N \), please provide it, and we can calculate the final value. Otherwise, the final answer in terms of \( N \) is:
\[
F = \frac{160 + 4N}{5}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the starting value**: The problem states that Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20. We will denote this starting value as \( S = 20 \).

2. **Define the number**: Let's denote the number in the number train as \( N \). The problem does not specify what \( N \) is, so we will keep it as a variable for now.

3. **Calculate half of the number**: Half of the number \( N \) is given by:
   \[
   \frac{N}{2}
   \]

4. **Add the starting value to half the number**: We need to add the starting value \( S \) to half of the number \( N \):
   \[
   S + \frac{N}{2} = 20 + \frac{N}{2}
   \]

5. **Divide the result by 5**: Now we will divide the result from step 4 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5}
   \]

6. **Multiply by the starting value minus 12**: Next, we need to calculate the starting value minus 12:
   \[
   S - 12 = 20 - 12 = 8
   \]
   Now we multiply the result from step 5 by 8:
   \[
   8 \cdot \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5}
   \]

7. **Simplify the expression**: We can simplify the multiplication:
   \[
   = \frac{8(20 + \frac{N}{2})}{5}
   \]
   Distributing the 8:
   \[
   = \frac{160 + 4N}{5}
   \]

8. **Final expression**: The final value of the number train can be expressed as:
   \[
   \frac{160 + 4N}{5}
   \]

Since the problem does not provide a specific value for \( N \), we cannot compute a numerical final answer without knowing \( N \). However, the expression we derived represents the final value of the number train in terms of \( N \).

If we assume \( N \) is a specific number, we can substitute that value into our final expression to get a numerical answer. 

For example, if \( N = 10 \):
\[
\frac{160 + 4(10)}{5} = \frac{160 + 40}{5} = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

But since \( N \) is not specified in the problem, we conclude that the final value of the number train is:
\[
\frac{160 + 4N}{5}
\]

**Final Answer**: The final value of the number train is \( \frac{160 + 4N}{5} \), where \( N \) is the unspecified number.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined in the question and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Identify the starting value**: The starting value given by Diane is 20.

2. **Define the number**: Let's denote the number as \( x \). The problem states that we will use the starting value (20) plus half of the number \( x \).

3. **Calculate half of the number**: Half of \( x \) is given by:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

4. **Add the starting value to half the number**: We now add the starting value (20) to half of the number:
   \[
   20 + \frac{x}{2}
   \]

5. **Divide the result by 5**: Next, we divide the result from step 4 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{20 + \frac{x}{2}}{5}
   \]

6. **Simplify the expression**: To simplify the expression, we can distribute the division:
   \[
   \frac{20}{5} + \frac{\frac{x}{2}}{5} = 4 + \frac{x}{10}
   \]

7. **Calculate the starting value minus 12**: Now, we need to calculate the starting value minus 12:
   \[
   20 - 12 = 8
   \]

8. **Multiply the result from step 6 by the result from step 7**: We now multiply the two results:
   \[
   \left(4 + \frac{x}{10}\right) \times 8
   \]

9. **Distribute the multiplication**:
   \[
   4 \times 8 + \frac{x}{10} \times 8 = 32 + \frac{8x}{10}
   \]
   Simplifying \( \frac{8x}{10} \) gives us:
   \[
   \frac{8x}{10} = \frac{4x}{5}
   \]

10. **Combine the results**: Thus, the final expression for the value of the number train is:
    \[
    32 + \frac{4x}{5}
    \]

Now, since the problem does not specify a particular value for \( x \), we can express the final value of the number train in terms of \( x \):
\[
\text{Final Value} = 32 + \frac{4x}{5}
\]

If we were to assume a specific value for \( x \), we could substitute it into this expression to find a numerical answer. However, without a specific value for \( x \), the final answer remains in this form.

**Final Answer**: The final value of the number train is \( 32 + \frac{4x}{5} \).
