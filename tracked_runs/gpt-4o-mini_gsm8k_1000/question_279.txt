Question ID: 996

Question:
Four children are playing togetherâ€”Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, and the total age of the children is 20. If Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old, calculate the age of Wilfred.


Reference Answer:
If the combined age of the children is 20, the average age of the group is 20 years / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 years.
Helene is twice as old as the group's average age, meaning Helene is 2 * 5 years = <<2*5=10>>10 years old.
The total age of the three children is 10 years + 3 years + 4 years = <<10+3+4=17>>17 years.
Wilfred's age is 20 years - 17 years = <<20-17=3>>3 years.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to find the age of Wilfred given the ages of the other children and the conditions provided.

1. **Identify the known ages:**
   - Akbar's age = 3 years
   - Alessandro's age = 4 years
   - Helene's age = \( H \) (unknown)
   - Wilfred's age = \( W \) (unknown)

2. **Total age of the children:**
   The total age of all four children is given as 20 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   3 + 4 + H + W = 20
   \]
   Simplifying this, we find:
   \[
   7 + H + W = 20
   \]
   \[
   H + W = 20 - 7
   \]
   \[
   H + W = 13 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

3. **Helene's age in relation to the average age:**
   We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. First, we need to find the average age of the four children:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]
   Since Helene is twice the average age:
   \[
   H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

4. **Substituting Helene's age into Equation 1:**
   Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) into Equation 1:
   \[
   10 + W = 13
   \]
   Solving for \( W \):
   \[
   W = 13 - 10
   \]
   \[
   W = 3
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   The age of Wilfred is \( \boxed{3} \).

6. **Verification:**
   Let's verify the calculations:
   - Ages: Akbar = 3, Alessandro = 4, Helene = 10, Wilfred = 3.
   - Total age: \( 3 + 4 + 10 + 3 = 20 \) (correct).
   - Average age: \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \).
   - Helene's age: \( 10 = 2 \times 5 \) (correct).

Thus, all conditions are satisfied, and Wilfred's age is indeed \( \boxed{3} \).
