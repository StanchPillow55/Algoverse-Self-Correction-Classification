There are 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 students playing volleyball.
There are 16 + 22 = <<16+22=38>>38 students playing soccer.

Response:
To find the total number of students participating in the different sports, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of students playing tennis:**
   - According to the problem, there are 6 students playing tennis.
   \[
   \text{Tennis players} = 6
   \]

2. **Identify the number of students playing volleyball:**
   - The problem states that there are twice the number of students playing volleyball compared to those playing tennis. Therefore, we calculate the number of volleyball players as follows:
   \[
   \text{Volleyball players} = 2 \times \text{Tennis players} = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

3. **Identify the number of students playing soccer:**
   - The problem states that there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer. To find the total number of soccer players, we add the number of boys and girls:
   \[
   \text{Soccer players} = \text{Boys} + \text{Girls} = 16 + 22 = 38
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of students:**
   - Now we can find the total number of students by adding the number of students in each sport:
   \[
   \text{Total students} = \text{Tennis players} + \text{Volleyball players} + \text{Soccer players}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total students} = 6 + 12 + 38
   \]

5. **Perform the final addition:**
   \[
   6 + 12 = 18
   \]
   \[
   18 + 38 = 56
   \]

Thus, the total number of students participating in tennis, volleyball, and soccer is:
\[
\boxed{56}
\]
