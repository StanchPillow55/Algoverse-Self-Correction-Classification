Question:
A water tank is filled with 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her small garden. She was then able to collect rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. How many liters of water are in the tank now?


Reference Answer:
After watering Celine's garden, 120 - 90 = <<120-90=30>>30 liters of water were left in the tank.
Celine was able to collect 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 liters of rainwater.
Thus, there are 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 liters of water in the tank.
#### 90

Response:
To solve the problem, we will go through it step by step.

1. **Initial amount of water in the tank**: The tank starts with 120 liters of water.

2. **Water used by Celine**: Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank. We need to subtract this amount from the initial amount of water.

   \[
   \text{Water left in the tank} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Water used}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Water left in the tank} = 120 \, \text{liters} - 90 \, \text{liters} = 30 \, \text{liters}
   \]

3. **Rainwater collected**: Celine collects rainwater that is twice the amount of water left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, we calculate the rainwater collected as follows:

   \[
   \text{Rainwater collected} = 2 \times \text{Water left in the tank}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Rainwater collected} = 2 \times 30 \, \text{liters} = 60 \, \text{liters}
   \]

4. **Total water in the tank now**: To find the total amount of water in the tank after collecting the rainwater, we add the rainwater collected to the water left in the tank.

   \[
   \text{Total water in the tank now} = \text{Water left in the tank} + \text{Rainwater collected}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total water in the tank now} = 30 \, \text{liters} + 60 \, \text{liters} = 90 \, \text{liters}
   \]

Thus, the final amount of water in the tank now is:

\[
\boxed{90} \, \text{liters}
\]
