Question ID: 457

Question:
While playing with her friends in their school playground, Katelyn saw 50 fairies flying above the nearby forest. After about twenty minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. How many fairies are remaining?


Reference Answer:
Katelyn's friend saw 1/2*50 = <<1/2*50=25>>25, half as many fairies as Katelyn initially saw
The total number of fairies flying above the forest now is 50 + 25 = <<50+25=75>>75
If thirty fairies then flew away, there were 75 - 30 = <<75-30=45>>45 fairies that remained.
#### 45

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Count of Fairies**: Katelyn sees 50 fairies flying above the forest. So, we start with:
   \[
   \text{Initial fairies} = 50
   \]

2. **Fairies Joining from the East**: Katelyn's friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw. Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies, half of that is:
   \[
   \text{Fairies joining} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
   \]
   Now, we add these 25 fairies to the initial count:
   \[
   \text{Total fairies after joining} = 50 + 25 = 75
   \]

3. **Fairies Flying Away**: Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. We need to subtract these from the total count of fairies:
   \[
   \text{Total fairies remaining} = 75 - 30 = 45
   \]

4. **Final Count of Fairies**: After all the calculations, the number of fairies remaining is:
   \[
   \text{Final answer} = 45
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]
