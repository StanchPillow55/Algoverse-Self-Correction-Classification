Question ID: 528

Question:
Ophelia and Jenna are living in the same apartment building. They each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. If Ophelia has 20 sofas, calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that they have.


Reference Answer:
If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20+2 = <<20+2=22>>22 chairs.
Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, a total of 3*22 = <<3*22=66>>66 chairs
The total number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have is 66+22 = <<66+22=88>>88
Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the total number of sofas she has is 66-2 = <<66-2=64>>64 sofas.
The total number of sofas Ophelia and Jenna have is 64+20 = <<64+20=84>>84 sofas
Together, they have 84 sofas+88 chairs = <<84+88=172>>172

Response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the relationship between sofas and chairs:**
   - We know that both Ophelia and Jenna have 2 fewer sofas than chairs. This can be expressed as:
     - For Ophelia: 
       \[
       \text{Sofas}_O = \text{Chairs}_O - 2
       \]
     - For Jenna:
       \[
       \text{Sofas}_J = \text{Chairs}_J - 2
       \]

2. **Given information about Ophelia:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas. We can use this information to find out how many chairs she has.
   - Using the equation for Ophelia:
     \[
     20 = \text{Chairs}_O - 2
     \]
   - To find \(\text{Chairs}_O\), we add 2 to both sides:
     \[
     \text{Chairs}_O = 20 + 2 = 22
     \]

3. **Finding Jenna's chairs:**
   - We know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore:
     \[
     \text{Chairs}_J = 3 \times \text{Chairs}_O = 3 \times 22 = 66
     \]

4. **Finding Jenna's sofas:**
   - Now we can find out how many sofas Jenna has using the relationship we established earlier:
     \[
     \text{Sofas}_J = \text{Chairs}_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64
     \]

5. **Calculating the total number of sofas and chairs:**
   - Now we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna.
   - Total sofas:
     \[
     \text{Total Sofas} = \text{Sofas}_O + \text{Sofas}_J = 20 + 64 = 84
     \]
   - Total chairs:
     \[
     \text{Total Chairs} = \text{Chairs}_O + \text{Chairs}_J = 22 + 66 = 88
     \]

6. **Final calculation of total items:**
   - Finally, we add the total number of sofas and chairs together:
     \[
     \text{Total Items} = \text{Total Sofas} + \text{Total Chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172
     \]

Thus, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is \(\boxed{172}\).
