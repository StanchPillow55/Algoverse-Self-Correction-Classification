Question:
Jeremy saw 12 birds in their backyard and threw a stone at them, scaring away 1/3 of that number. A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. How many birds are now in the backyard?


Reference Answer:
The total number of birds scared away after he threw the stone at them is 1/3 * 12 = <<1/3*12=4>>4 birds.
The total number of birds remaining is 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 birds.
If 20 more birds joined, the total number of birds in the backyard will become 8 + 20 = <<8+20=28>>28 birds.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and perform the necessary calculations.

1. **Initial Number of Birds**: Jeremy saw 12 birds in the backyard.

2. **Calculating the Number of Birds Scared Away**: 
   - Jeremy scared away \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 12 birds.
   - To find out how many birds that is, we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
     \]
   - So, 4 birds were scared away.

3. **Calculating the Remaining Birds**: 
   - After scaring away 4 birds, we need to find out how many birds are left in the backyard:
     \[
     12 - 4 = 8
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 8 birds remaining in the backyard.

4. **Adding More Birds**: 
   - A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds.
   - We add these 20 birds to the 8 birds that are still in the backyard:
     \[
     8 + 20 = 28
     \]

5. **Final Count of Birds**: 
   - The total number of birds now in the backyard is 28.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{28}
\]
