Question ID: 228

Question:
Kalinda is working on a 360 piece puzzle with her mom. Kalinda can normally add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can typically place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.  How many hours will it take them to complete this puzzle?


Reference Answer:
Her mom places 2 pieces per minute because 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2
On average they get in 6 pieces per minute because 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6
It will take 60 minutes to complete the puzzle because 360 / 6 = <<360/6=60>>60
It will take one hour because 60 / 60 = <<60/60=1>>1

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place together per minute and then calculate how long it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

1. **Determine Kalinda's rate of placing pieces:**
   - Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.

2. **Determine her mom's rate of placing pieces:**
   - Her mom places half as many pieces as Kalinda. Therefore, her mom's rate is:
     \[
     \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4 \text{ pieces}}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute}
     \]

3. **Calculate their combined rate:**
   - To find their combined rate, we add the number of pieces they can place together per minute:
     \[
     \text{Combined rate} = \text{Kalinda's rate} + \text{Mom's rate} = 4 \text{ pieces/min} + 2 \text{ pieces/min} = 6 \text{ pieces/min}
     \]

4. **Determine the total time to complete the puzzle:**
   - The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
     \[
     \text{Time (in minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{Combined rate}} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/min}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Convert minutes to hours:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
     \[
     \text{Time (in hours)} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

Thus, the total time it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle is:

\[
\boxed{1 \text{ hour}}
\]
