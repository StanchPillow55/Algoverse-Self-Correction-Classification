Question ID: 1031

Question:
Apple High School is holding graduation in their Fine Arts Center this year which has space for 6000 people.  After accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?


Reference Answer:
Add graduate and faculty seats together. 950 + 300 = <<950+300=1250>>1250 seats for faculty and graduates
Minus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 6000 - 1250 = <<6000-1250=4750>>4750 remaining seats.
Divide amount of graduates by remaining seats. 4750/950 = <<4750/950=5>>5 tickets

Response:
To determine how many tickets each graduate will receive to give to their friends and family, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of seats available for guests**: 
   The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 seats. We need to subtract the seats reserved for graduates and faculty.

   - Seats for graduates: 950
   - Seats for faculty: 300

   Total seats reserved for graduates and faculty:
   \[
   950 + 300 = 1250
   \]

   Now, we subtract this from the total capacity:
   \[
   6000 - 1250 = 4750
   \]

   So, there are 4750 seats available for guests.

2. **Determine the number of graduates**: 
   The problem does not specify the number of graduates, so we will denote the number of graduates as \( G \).

3. **Calculate the number of tickets each graduate receives**:
   If the available seats (4750) are to be split equally among the graduates, each graduate will receive a certain number of tickets. The number of tickets per graduate can be calculated by dividing the total number of guest seats by the number of graduates:
   \[
   \text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{4750}{G}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Since we do not have a specific number for \( G \) (the number of graduates), we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, the formula for the number of tickets each graduate receives is:
   \[
   \text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{4750}{G}
   \]

To summarize, the number of tickets each graduate receives depends on the total number of graduates. If you provide the number of graduates, we can calculate the exact number of tickets each graduate would receive.

Response:
To determine how many tickets each graduate will receive to distribute to their friends and family, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of seats available for guests**: 
   The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 seats. We need to subtract the seats that are already allocated for graduates and faculty.

   - Seats for graduates: 950
   - Seats for faculty: 300

   Total seats occupied by graduates and faculty:
   \[
   950 + 300 = 1250
   \]

   Now, we subtract this from the total capacity:
   \[
   6000 - 1250 = 4750
   \]

   So, there are 4750 seats available for guests.

2. **Determine the number of graduates**: 
   The problem does not specify the number of graduates, but we can denote the number of graduates as \( G \).

3. **Calculate the number of tickets per graduate**: 
   If the available seats (4750) are to be split equally among the graduates, we can find the number of tickets each graduate receives by dividing the total number of available guest seats by the number of graduates.

   The formula for the number of tickets per graduate is:
   \[
   \text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{4750}{G}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Since we do not have a specific number for \( G \) (the number of graduates), we cannot compute a numerical answer. However, the formula \( \frac{4750}{G} \) gives us the number of tickets each graduate can distribute based on the total number of graduates.

If we assume a hypothetical number of graduates, we could calculate a specific answer. For example, if there were 950 graduates, each graduate would receive:
\[
\frac{4750}{950} = 5
\]
Thus, each graduate would receive 5 tickets.

In conclusion, the number of tickets each graduate receives is given by the formula \( \frac{4750}{G} \), where \( G \) is the number of graduates. Without knowing \( G \), we cannot provide a specific numerical answer.
