Question ID: 696

Question:
Students in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior. If they get enough points in total, they can go on a trip. In the class, there are Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam has collected 50 points. Betty was better than Adam and collected 30% more. Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom, who has 30 points less than Betty. How many points is the class missing to go on the trip if the minimum threshold is 400 points?


Reference Answer:
Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.
Betty's total is therefore 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.
So the class is missing 400 - 255 = <<400-255=145>>145 points to go on the trip.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will calculate the points collected by each student step by step and then determine how many points the class is missing to reach the threshold of 400 points.

1. **Calculate Betty's Points:**
   - Adam has collected 50 points.
   - Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
   - To find 30% of Adam's points:
     \[
     30\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.30 \times 50 = 15
     \]
   - Therefore, Betty's total points are:
     \[
     \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 15 = 65
     \]

2. **Calculate Tom's Points:**
   - We know that Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   - Since Betty has 65 points, Tom's points are:
     \[
     \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
     \]

3. **Calculate Martha's Points:**
   - Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   - Therefore, Martha's points are:
     \[
     \text{Martha's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
     \]

4. **Calculate Total Points Collected by the Class:**
   - Now we can sum the points collected by all four students:
     \[
     \text{Total points} = \text{Adam's points} + \text{Betty's points} + \text{Tom's points} + \text{Martha's points}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
     \]

5. **Determine How Many Points the Class is Missing:**
   - The class needs a minimum of 400 points to go on the trip.
   - To find out how many points they are missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold:
     \[
     \text{Points missing} = 400 - 255 = 145
     \]

Thus, the class is missing **145 points** to reach the threshold of 400 points for the trip.

**Final Answer: 145 points**
