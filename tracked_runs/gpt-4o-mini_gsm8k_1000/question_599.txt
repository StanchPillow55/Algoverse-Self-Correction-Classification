Question ID: 21

Question:
Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. If Samantha is now 31, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?


Reference Answer:
When Raymond's son was born Samantha was 23 - 6 = <<23-6=17>>17 years old.
Thus it has been 31 - 17 = <<31-17=14>>14 years since Raymond's son was born.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, given the ages of Raymond and Samantha.

1. **Identify Samantha's age**: We know that Samantha is currently 31 years old.

2. **Determine Raymond's age**: Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can calculate his age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Raymond's age} = \text{Samantha's age} + 6 = 31 + 6 = 37 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine the age at which Raymond had his son**: The problem states that Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old.

4. **Calculate the age of Raymond's son**: To find out how old Raymond's son is now, we need to subtract the age at which Raymond had his son from Raymond's current age:
   \[
   \text{Age of Raymond's son} = \text{Raymond's current age} - \text{Age when he had his son} = 37 - 23 = 14 \text{ years old}
   \]

5. **Determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born**: Since Raymond's son is currently 14 years old, we can conclude that he was born 14 years ago.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Raymond's son was born } 14 \text{ years ago.}
\]
