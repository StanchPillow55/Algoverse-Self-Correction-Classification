Response:
To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month from collecting bottle caps, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of bottle caps collected in a month**:
   - Damien finds 10 bottle caps each day.
   - In a 30-day month, the total number of bottle caps he collects can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total bottle caps} = \text{bottle caps per day} \times \text{number of days}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total bottle caps} = 10 \, \text{bottle caps/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 300 \, \text{bottle caps}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total value of the bottle caps**:
   - Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.
   - To find the total value of the 300 bottle caps, we multiply the total number of bottle caps by the value of each cap:
     \[
     \text{Total value} = \text{Total bottle caps} \times \text{value per bottle cap}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total value} = 300 \, \text{bottle caps} \times 0.25 \, \text{dollars/bottle cap}
     \]

3. **Perform the multiplication**:
   \[
   \text{Total value} = 300 \times 0.25 = 75
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month is:
     \[
     \text{Total money earned} = 75 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

Thus, Damien makes **$75.00** in a 30-day month from collecting bottle caps.
