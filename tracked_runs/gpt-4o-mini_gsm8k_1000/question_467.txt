Question ID: 950

Question:
Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. How many points did Azibo score?


Reference Answer:
Let B = the number of points Bahati scored
Azibo = B - 20
Dinar = B - 10
B + B -20 + B - 10 = 45
3B - 30 = 45;
3B = 75
B = <<25=25>>25
Azibo = 25 - 20 = <<25-20=5>>5 points
Azibo scored 5 points.
#### 5

Response:
Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know the following:

1. The total points scored by the three players is 45:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now we have three equations:

1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (Equation 1)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Equation 2)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Equation 3)

Next, we can substitute the expressions for \( B \) from Equations 2 and 3 into Equation 1.

First, substitute \( B \) from Equation 2 into Equation 1:
\[
(A + 20) + A + D = 45
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2A + D + 20 = 45
\]
Subtracting 20 from both sides gives:
\[
2A + D = 25 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

Next, substitute \( B \) from Equation 3 into Equation 1:
\[
(D + 10) + A + D = 45
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
A + 2D + 10 = 45
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:
\[
A + 2D = 35 \quad \text{(Equation 5)}
\]

Now we have two new equations (Equation 4 and Equation 5):
1. \( 2A + D = 25 \) (Equation 4)
2. \( A + 2D = 35 \) (Equation 5)

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. From Equation 4, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \):
\[
D = 25 - 2A \quad \text{(Equation 6)}
\]

Now substitute Equation 6 into Equation 5:
\[
A + 2(25 - 2A) = 35
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
A + 50 - 4A = 35
\]
Combining like terms results in:
\[
-3A + 50 = 35
\]
Subtracting 50 from both sides gives:
\[
-3A = -15
\]
Dividing by -3 results in:
\[
A = 5
\]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( D \) using Equation 6:
\[
D = 25 - 2(5) = 25 - 10 = 15
\]

Finally, we can find \( B \) using Equation 2:
\[
B = A + 20 = 5 + 20 = 25
\]

Now we have all the scores:
- Bahati (B) = 25
- Azibo (A) = 5
- Dinar (D) = 15

To verify, we check the total:
\[
B + A + D = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45
\]
This is correct.

Thus, the number of points Azibo scored is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]

Response:
Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total points scored by the three players is 45:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

From the second equation:
\[
A = B - 20
\]

From the third equation:
\[
D = B - 10
\]

Now we can substitute \( A \) and \( D \) back into the total points equation:

\[
B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45
\]

Simplifying this equation:
\[
B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45
\]
\[
3B - 30 = 45
\]

Now, add 30 to both sides:
\[
3B = 75
\]

Dividing both sides by 3:
\[
B = 25
\]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \):

Using \( A = B - 20 \):
\[
A = 25 - 20 = 5
\]

Using \( D = B - 10 \):
\[
D = 25 - 10 = 15
\]

Now we have:
- Bahati scored \( B = 25 \)
- Azibo scored \( A = 5 \)
- Dinar scored \( D = 15 \)

To verify, we check the total:
\[
B + A + D = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45
\]
This is correct.

Thus, the number of points Azibo scored is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
