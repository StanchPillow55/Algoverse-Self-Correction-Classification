Question ID: 1247

Question:
Brendan has a bag of marbles with 10 inside. He tripped over a pebble while carrying it and dropped half of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 3. When he went back home, he inspected the marbles further. One of them he picked up wasn't a marble, but actually a bead so he got rid of it. How many marbles did Brendan end up with?


Reference Answer:
Brendan dropped his marbles and was left with 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 marbles.
He searched and found some of his lost marbles, getting him back to 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 marbles.
He went home and removed a bead, leaving him with 8-1=<<8-1=7>>7 marbles.

Response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Count of Marbles**: Brendan starts with 10 marbles in his bag.

2. **Dropping Half of the Marbles**: When he trips, he drops half of the marbles. To find out how many he dropped, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Marbles dropped} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
   \]
   After dropping 5 marbles, the number of marbles left in the bag is:
   \[
   \text{Marbles left} = 10 - 5 = 5
   \]

3. **Searching for the Dropped Marbles**: Brendan searches for the marbles he dropped and finds 3 of them. So, he now has:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles now} = \text{Marbles left in bag} + \text{Marbles found} = 5 + 3 = 8
   \]

4. **Identifying a Bead**: Upon inspecting the marbles further at home, he discovers that one of the marbles he found is actually a bead. Since he gets rid of the bead, we subtract 1 from the total number of marbles:
   \[
   \text{Final count of marbles} = 8 - 1 = 7
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the number of marbles Brendan ended up with is:
   \[
   \boxed{7}
   \]
