Question ID: 1289

Question:
Octavia wants to make a quilt for her sister. She is going to build it from small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with. A small t-shirt is 3 square feet of fabric. A medium one is 4 square feet. A large one is 6 square feet. If she uses 11 small shirts, 8 medium, and 6 large shirts, how many square feet is the quilt?


Reference Answer:
The quilt has 33 square feet from small shirts because 11 x 3 = <<11*3=33>>33
The quilt has 32 square feet from medium shirts because 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32
The quilt has 36 square feet from large shirts because 6 x 6 = <<6*6=36>>36
The quilt is 101 square feet because 33 + 32 + 36 = <<33+32+36=101>>101

Response:
To find out how many square feet the quilt will be, we need to calculate the total area of fabric from the small, medium, and large t-shirts that Octavia is using. We will do this by multiplying the number of each size of t-shirt by the area each size provides, and then summing these areas together.

1. **Calculate the area from small t-shirts:**
   - Each small t-shirt provides 3 square feet of fabric.
   - Octavia is using 11 small t-shirts.
   - The total area from small t-shirts is:
     \[
     \text{Area from small t-shirts} = 11 \text{ shirts} \times 3 \text{ square feet/shirt} = 33 \text{ square feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the area from medium t-shirts:**
   - Each medium t-shirt provides 4 square feet of fabric.
   - Octavia is using 8 medium t-shirts.
   - The total area from medium t-shirts is:
     \[
     \text{Area from medium t-shirts} = 8 \text{ shirts} \times 4 \text{ square feet/shirt} = 32 \text{ square feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the area from large t-shirts:**
   - Each large t-shirt provides 6 square feet of fabric.
   - Octavia is using 6 large t-shirts.
   - The total area from large t-shirts is:
     \[
     \text{Area from large t-shirts} = 6 \text{ shirts} \times 6 \text{ square feet/shirt} = 36 \text{ square feet}
     \]

4. **Sum the areas from all t-shirts:**
   - Now we will add the areas from small, medium, and large t-shirts together:
     \[
     \text{Total area} = \text{Area from small t-shirts} + \text{Area from medium t-shirts} + \text{Area from large t-shirts}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total area} = 33 \text{ square feet} + 32 \text{ square feet} + 36 \text{ square feet}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total area} = 101 \text{ square feet}
     \]

Thus, the total area of the quilt that Octavia will make is **101 square feet**. 

Final answer: **101 square feet**.
