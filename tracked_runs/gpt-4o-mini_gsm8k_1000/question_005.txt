Question ID: 671

Question:
Adam went to a store to buy some sweets. He bought 7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B. One candy of type A costs $0.5, and one candy of type B costs $0.75. How much change did Adam get, if he paid the cashier $15?


Reference Answer:
For type A candies Adam needed to pay 7 * 0.5 = $<<7*0.5=3.5>>3.5.
For the other type of candies, Adam needed to pay 10 * 0.75 = $<<10*0.75=7.5>>7.5.
So Adam had to pay 3.5 + 7.5 = $<<3.5+7.5=11>>11 in total for his shopping.
If Adam gave the cashier $15, that means he got 15 - 11 = $<<15-11=4>>4 of change.

Response:
To determine how much change Adam received after buying candies, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of candies of type A**:
   - Adam bought 7 candies of type A.
   - The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5.
   - Therefore, the total cost for type A candies is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for type A} = \text{Number of candies} \times \text{Cost per candy} = 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of candies of type B**:
   - Adam bought 10 candies of type B.
   - The cost of one candy of type B is $0.75.
   - Therefore, the total cost for type B candies is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for type B} = \text{Number of candies} \times \text{Cost per candy} = 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of all candies**:
   - Now, we add the total costs of type A and type B candies:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for type A} + \text{Total cost for type B} = 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the change Adam received**:
   - Adam paid the cashier $15.
   - To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
     \[
     \text{Change} = \text{Amount paid} - \text{Total cost} = 15 - 11 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Adam received **$4** in change.

   \[
   \text{Total cost for type B} = 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of all candies:**
   - Total cost = Total cost for type A + Total cost for type B
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the change Adam received:**
