Question:
My wife wants to evenly split the check but wants me to pay an additional 20% tip on our $50 dinner bill. How much did I end up paying?


Reference Answer:
If the total bill is $50, the total tip of 20% would be $50*20% = $<<50*20*.01=10>>10
Similarly, if the bill was $50 an even split (1/2) would be $50 * 1/2 = $<<50*1/2=25>>25 to be paid by each person
That means I paid $25 for the bill + $10 for the tip = $<<25+10=35>>35

Response:
To determine how much you ended up paying for the dinner bill, we can break the problem down into a few steps.

1. **Calculate the total dinner bill**: The dinner bill is given as $50.

2. **Calculate the tip**: Your wife wants you to pay an additional 20% tip on the dinner bill. To find the tip amount, we can use the formula for calculating a percentage:
   \[
   \text{Tip} = \text{Dinner Bill} \times \text{Tip Percentage}
   \]
   Here, the tip percentage is 20%, which can be expressed as a decimal (0.20). Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Tip} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount you will pay**: Now, we need to add the tip to the original dinner bill to find out how much you will pay in total:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount Paid} = \text{Dinner Bill} + \text{Tip}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount Paid} = 50 + 10 = 60
   \]

4. **Determine how much each person pays**: Since your wife wants to evenly split the check, we can find out how much each person pays by dividing the total amount by 2:
   \[
   \text{Amount Each Pays} = \frac{\text{Total Amount Paid}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

5. **Final Calculation**: Since you are paying the total amount of $60, we can summarize that you will pay the entire bill plus the tip.

Thus, the final amount you end up paying is:
\[
\text{Final Answer} = 60
\]

In conclusion, you ended up paying a total of **$60** for the dinner, which includes the $50 bill and a $10 tip.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total dinner bill**: The dinner bill is given as $50.

2. **Calculate the tip**: The tip is 20% of the dinner bill. To find 20% of $50, we can use the following calculation:
   \[
   \text{Tip} = 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10
   \]
   So, the tip amounts to $10.

3. **Calculate the total amount to be paid**: Now, we need to add the tip to the original dinner bill to find the total amount that needs to be paid:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Dinner Bill} + \text{Tip} = 50 + 10 = 60
   \]

4. **Split the total amount**: Since your wife wants to evenly split the check, we divide the total amount by 2:
   \[
   \text{Split Amount} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

5. **Determine how much you pay**: You are responsible for paying the entire dinner bill plus the additional tip. Therefore, you will pay the total amount of $60.

Thus, the final amount you end up paying is:
\[
\text{Final Amount Paid} = 60
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]

4. **Split the total amount**: Since the check is to be split evenly between you and your wife, we divide the total amount by 2:
   \[
   \text{Amount Each Pays} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

5. **Determine your total payment**: However, since you are paying the entire bill plus the tip, you will pay the total amount of $60.

Thus, the final amount you end up paying is:
\[
\boxed{60}
