Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla after giving a total of 52 marbles to both twins, Dallas and Darla.

1. **Understanding the situation**: 
   - Mazie has a total of 52 marbles.
   - After giving some marbles to Dallas, he ends up with 21 marbles, but this is after he dropped 4 marbles in the playground.

2. **Calculating how many marbles Dallas originally had**:
   - Since Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, we can find out how many he had before dropping them.
   - We add the 4 marbles he dropped to the 21 marbles he currently has:
     \[
     \text{Marbles Dallas originally had} = 21 + 4 = 25
     \]

3. **Finding out how many marbles Darla received**:
   - Now that we know Dallas originally had 25 marbles, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas has from the total number of marbles Mazie had.
   - The total number of marbles Mazie gave away is 52, so we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Marbles Darla received} = \text{Total marbles} - \text{Marbles Dallas received}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Marbles Darla received} = 52 - 25 = 27
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is \( \boxed{27} \).
