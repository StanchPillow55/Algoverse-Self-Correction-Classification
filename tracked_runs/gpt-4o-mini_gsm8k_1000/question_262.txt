Question ID: 1069

Question:
Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks from his store supplying fertiliser to different farmers in his hometown dispatched for delivery on a particular day. Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser packed in bags. Two hours after the trucks had departed for delivery, Mr Hezekiah got the news that a quarter of the number of lorries dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures on the road and could not deliver the fertilisers to the farmers. Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day?


Reference Answer:
If there were 20 trucks dispatched for delivery, and 1/4 of the total number had mechanical failures, there were 1/4*20 = <<20*1/4=5>>5 failed deliveries.
Out of the 20 trucks dispatched to deliver fertiliser, 20-5 = <<20-5=15>>15 trucks delivered to the farmers.
Since each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of tons of fertiliser delivered that day was 15*20 = <<15*20=300>>300 tons.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of trucks dispatched.**
   Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks.

2. **Determine the amount of fertiliser each truck was carrying.**
   Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.

3. **Calculate the total amount of fertiliser dispatched.**
   We can calculate the total amount of fertiliser by multiplying the number of trucks by the amount of fertiliser each truck carries:
   \[
   \text{Total fertiliser} = \text{Number of trucks} \times \text{Fertiliser per truck}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total fertiliser} = 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures.**
   According to the problem, a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of trucks with failures} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total trucks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of trucks with failures} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.**
   To find the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser, we subtract the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks:
   \[
   \text{Successful trucks} = \text{Total trucks} - \text{Trucks with failures}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Successful trucks} = 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers.**
   Now, we can calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the successful trucks:
   \[
   \text{Total fertiliser delivered} = \text{Successful trucks} \times \text{Fertiliser per truck}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total fertiliser delivered} = 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons}
   \]

Finally, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:
\[
\boxed{300 \text{ tons}}
\]
