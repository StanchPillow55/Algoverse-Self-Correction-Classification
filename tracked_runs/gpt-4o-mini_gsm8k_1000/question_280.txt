Question:
If every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, how many jellyfish would 5 springs working at the same rate create in 4 hours?


Reference Answer:
Since an hour has 3600 seconds, if every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, it will create 4*3600 = <<4*3600=14400>>14400 jellyfish in four hours.
Five springs working at the same rate will create 14400*5 =<<14400*5=72000>>72000 jellyfish in four hours.
#### 72000

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many jellyfish are created by 5 springs in 4 hours, given that each spring creates a new jellyfish every second.

### Step 1: Determine the number of seconds in 4 hours.

First, we need to convert hours into seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, the number of seconds in 4 hours can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Seconds in 4 hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

\[
4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes}
\]
\[
240 \times 60 = 14400 \text{ seconds}
\]

So, there are 14,400 seconds in 4 hours.

### Step 2: Determine how many jellyfish one spring creates in 4 hours.

Since each spring creates 1 jellyfish every second, the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours (or 14,400 seconds) is:

\[
\text{Jellyfish from 1 spring} = 14,400 \text{ jellyfish}
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many jellyfish 5 springs create in 4 hours.

If one spring creates 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create:

\[
\text{Jellyfish from 5 springs} = 5 \text{ springs} \times 14,400 \text{ jellyfish/spring}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
5 \times 14,400 = 72,000 \text{ jellyfish}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is:

\[
\boxed{72000}
\]
