Question ID: 821

Question:
Hunter counted 50 cars packed in their school parking lot when entering class one morning. During the first break, he counted 20 more cars in the parking lot. When he got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. What's the total number of cars he counted during lunch break?


Reference Answer:
During the first break, he saw 20 more cars in the parking lot, which totals 50 + 20 = <<50+20=70>>70 cars
When going for the lunch break, he counted and realized only half the number of cars were present, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars.
#### 35

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Count of Cars**: 
   Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot when he entered class.

   \[
   \text{Initial count of cars} = 50
   \]

2. **Count During First Break**: 
   During the first break, he counted 20 more cars. To find the total number of cars at this point, we add the 20 cars to the initial count.

   \[
   \text{Total cars after first break} = 50 + 20 = 70
   \]

3. **Count During Lunch Break**: 
   When he got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that half of the cars in the parking lot had gone. To find out how many cars left, we need to calculate half of the total number of cars at that moment.

   \[
   \text{Cars that left} = \frac{1}{2} \times 70 = 35
   \]

4. **Remaining Cars in the Parking Lot**: 
   To find the number of cars remaining in the parking lot after half of them left, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars before they left.

   \[
   \text{Remaining cars} = 70 - 35 = 35
   \]

5. **Final Count of Cars During Lunch Break**: 
   The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is the number of cars remaining in the parking lot.

   \[
   \text{Total cars counted during lunch break} = 35
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{35}
\]
