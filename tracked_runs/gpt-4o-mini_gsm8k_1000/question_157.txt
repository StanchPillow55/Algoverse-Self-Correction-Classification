Question ID: 122

Question:
Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less, each, because she had to complete some assignments. If the rest of the week she slept 1 hour more than those two days, how many hours did she sleep in total throughout the week?


Reference Answer:
If on Monday she slept 8 hours, then she slept 8-2 = <<8-2=6>>6 hours on each of the next two days.
The total number of hours slept for the two days will be 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours.
If she slept 1 hour more for the rest of the week each day, then each day she slept 6+1 = <<6+1=7>>7 hours.
The total for the rest of the week will be 4*7 = <<4*7=28>>28 hours.
The total number of hours slept for the whole week will be 8+12+28 = <<8+12+28=48>>48 hours.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate Monday's Sleep**:
   - Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

2. **Calculate Sleep for Tuesday and Wednesday**:
   - On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday:
     \[
     \text{Tuesday's sleep} = 8 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - On Wednesday, she again slept 2 hours less than Monday:
     \[
     \text{Wednesday's sleep} = 8 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate Sleep for Thursday and Friday**:
   - For the rest of the week (Thursday and Friday), she slept 1 hour more than the amount she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday (which is 6 hours):
     \[
     \text{Thursday's sleep} = 6 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 7 \text{ hours}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Friday's sleep} = 6 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 7 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate Sleep for Saturday and Sunday**:
   - Assuming she continues to sleep the same amount as Thursday and Friday, she will also sleep 7 hours on both Saturday and Sunday:
     \[
     \text{Saturday's sleep} = 7 \text{ hours}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Sunday's sleep} = 7 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Total Sleep Calculation**:
   - Now we will sum up the hours she slept throughout the week:
     \[
     \text{Total sleep} = \text{Monday's sleep} + \text{Tuesday's sleep} + \text{Wednesday's sleep} + \text{Thursday's sleep} + \text{Friday's sleep} + \text{Saturday's sleep} + \text{Sunday's sleep}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total sleep} = 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7
     \]

6. **Perform the Addition**:
   - Let's calculate the total step by step:
     \[
     8 + 6 = 14
     \]
     \[
     14 + 6 = 20
     \]
     \[
     20 + 7 = 27
     \]
     \[
     27 + 7 = 34
     \]
     \[
     34 + 7 = 41
     \]
     \[
     41 + 7 = 48
     \]

Thus, the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week is **48 hours**.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]
