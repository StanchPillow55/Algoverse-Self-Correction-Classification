Question ID: 1122

Question:
A toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys. 5 workers are available to work on the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?


Reference Answer:
In the first group of workers, each produces 6 toys * 10 hours = <<6*10=60>>60 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 60 toys * 2 workers = <<60*2=120>>120 toys.
In the second group of workers, each produces 4 toys * 10 hours = <<4*10=40>>40 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 40 toys * 2 workers = <<40*2=80>>80 toys.
Together, these two groups produce 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 toys.
If the order is still short, then all the workers combined have produced 400 ordered toys – 20 remaining toys = <<400-20=380>>380 toys.
This means the fifth worker produced 380 – 200 = <<380-200=180>>180 toys in total.
The fifth worker therefore produced 180 toys / 10 hours = <<180/10=18>>18 toys per hour.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate how many toys the first four workers produce during their 10-hour shift and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the order of 400 toys.

### Step 1: Calculate the production of the first two workers
The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each. Therefore, their combined production per hour is:
\[
\text{Production of first 2 workers} = 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ toys per hour}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the production of the next two workers
The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each. Therefore, their combined production per hour is:
\[
\text{Production of next 2 workers} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ toys per hour}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total production of all four workers
Now, we can find the total production per hour of all four workers:
\[
\text{Total production per hour} = 12 + 8 = 20 \text{ toys per hour}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total production over the 10-hour shift
Since all four workers work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by them during the shift is:
\[
\text{Total production in 10 hours} = 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of toys needed
The manufacturer needs to produce a total of 400 toys. After the first four workers have produced 200 toys, the number of toys still needed is:
\[
\text{Toys still needed} = 400 - 200 = 200 \text{ toys}
\]

### Step 6: Determine the production of the fifth worker
Let \( x \) be the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour. The fifth worker also works for 10 hours, so the total production of the fifth worker over the shift is:
\[
\text{Total production of fifth worker} = 10x
\]

### Step 7: Set up the equation
To meet the order, the total production of the fifth worker must equal the number of toys still needed:
\[
10x = 200
\]

### Step 8: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{200}{10} = 20
\]

### Final Answer
The fifth worker produces **20 toys per hour**.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate how many toys the first four workers produce during their shift and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the order of 400 toys.

### Step 1: Calculate the production of the first two workers
- There are 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour.
- In a 10-hour shift, the total production for these 2 workers is:
  \[
  \text{Toys produced by 2 workers} = 2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ toys}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the production of the next two workers
- There are another 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour.
- In a 10-hour shift, the total production for these 2 workers is:
  \[
  \text{Toys produced by 2 workers} = 2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ toys}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total production of the first four workers
- Now, we add the production from both groups of workers:
  \[
  \text{Total toys produced by 4 workers} = 120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys}
  \]

### Step 4: Determine how many toys are still needed
- The total order is for 400 toys, and the workers produced 200 toys. Therefore, the number of toys still needed is:
  \[
  \text{Toys still needed} = 400 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys}
  \]

### Step 5: Calculate the production of the fifth worker
- Let \( x \) be the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour. The fifth worker also works for 10 hours, so the total production by the fifth worker is:
  \[
  \text{Toys produced by 5th worker} = x \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 10x \text{ toys}
  \]

- We know that the total production from all workers must equal the order of 400 toys:
  \[
  200 \text{ toys} + 10x \text{ toys} = 400 \text{ toys}
  \]

### Step 6: Solve for \( x \)
- Rearranging the equation gives:
  \[
  10x = 400 - 200
  \]
  \[
  10x = 200
  \]
  \[
  x = \frac{200}{10} = 20
  \]

### Final Answer
The fifth worker produces **20 toys per hour**.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour. Let's break down the information provided step by step.

1. **Identify the production rates of the workers:**
   - There are 5 workers in total.
   - 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour each.
   - 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each.
   - We need to find the production rate of the 5th worker, which we will denote as \( x \) (toys per hour).

2. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers:**
   - The total production from the 2 workers who produce 6 toys/hour:
     \[
     2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} = 12 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]
   - The total production from the 2 workers who produce 4 toys/hour:
     \[
     2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} = 8 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total production rate of the first four workers combined is:
     \[
     12 \text{ toys/hour} + 8 \text{ toys/hour} = 20 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total production over the 10-hour shift:**
   - The total number of toys produced by the first four workers in 10 hours is:
     \[
     20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys}
     \]

4. **Determine the total toys produced including the fifth worker:**
   - Let \( x \) be the production rate of the fifth worker. In 10 hours, the fifth worker produces:
     \[
     10x \text{ toys}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all workers is:
     \[
     200 \text{ toys} + 10x \text{ toys}
     \]

5. **Set up the equation based on the order requirement:**
   - The manufacturer needs to produce a total of 400 toys, but they still need 20 toys after the shift. Thus, they have produced:
     \[
     400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys}
     \]
   - We can set up the equation:
     \[
     200 + 10x = 380
     \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Rearranging the equation gives:
     \[
     10x = 380 - 200
     \]
     \[
     10x = 180
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{180}{10} = 18
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The fifth worker produces **18 toys per hour**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]
