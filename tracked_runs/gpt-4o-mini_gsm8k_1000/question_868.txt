Question ID: 1084

Question:
If Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam, how much is left over for Sam?


Reference Answer:
Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+60=100
Subtracting the 60 from both sides, we get 2x=40
We divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.
#### 20

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much fence Sam and Harry each get, given that Harry receives 60 feet more than Sam and that together they have a total of 100 feet of fence.

Let's denote the amount of fence Sam receives as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry receives 60 feet more than Sam, which we can express as:

\[
H = S + 60
\]

where \( H \) is the amount of fence Harry receives.

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we can set up the following equation:

\[
S + H = 100
\]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( H \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

Now, we simplify this equation:

\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by first subtracting 60 from both sides:

\[
2S = 100 - 60
\]
\[
2S = 40
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):

\[
S = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

So, Sam receives 20 feet of fence.

Now, we can find out how much fence Harry receives by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( H \):

\[
H = S + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80
\]

Thus, Harry receives 80 feet of fence.

Finally, we can summarize the results:
- Sam receives 20 feet of fence.
- Harry receives 80 feet of fence.

The question asks how much is left over for Sam. Since we calculated that Sam receives 20 feet, there is no leftover fence for Sam beyond what he has already received.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Sam has } 20 \text{ feet of fence.}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much fence Sam and Harry each receive, given that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam and that the total amount of fence is 100 feet.

Let's denote the amount of fence that Sam receives as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry receives 60 feet more than Sam, so we can express the amount of fence Harry receives as:

\[
H = S + 60
\]

We know that the total amount of fence they have together is 100 feet. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
S + H = 100
\]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) into the equation gives us:

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

Now, we can combine like terms:

\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]

Next, we will isolate \( S \) by first subtracting 60 from both sides:

\[
2S = 100 - 60
\]
\[
2S = 40
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):

\[
S = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

So, Sam receives 20 feet of fence. Now, we can find out how much Harry receives by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( H \):

\[
H = S + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80
\]

Thus, Harry receives 80 feet of fence.

Finally, we can check our work by confirming that the total amount of fence adds up to 100 feet:

\[
S + H = 20 + 80 = 100
\]

Everything checks out, so the final answer is:

**Sam has 20 feet of fence.**

Response:
Let's denote the amount of fence that Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can express the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H = S + 60 \) feet.

The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
S + H = 100
\]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) into the equation gives us:

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

Now, simplify the equation:

\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]

Next, we will isolate \( S \) by first subtracting 60 from both sides:

\[
2S = 100 - 60
\]
\[
2S = 40
\]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):

\[
S = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now that we have \( S \), we can find \( H \):

\[
H = S + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80
\]

To check our work, we can verify that the total length of the fence is indeed 100 feet:

\[
S + H = 20 + 80 = 100
\]

Since the calculations are correct, we can conclude that Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

The question asks how much is left over for Sam. Since he is allocated 20 feet, there is no leftover fence for him. 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Sam has } 20 \text{ feet of fence, and there is no leftover.}
