Question ID: 739

Question:
Cecelia went to the milk store and found out that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. If a gallon jar costs $5, calculate the total amount of money she spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.


Reference Answer:
If a full gallon costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, then the cost of a half-gallon jar is $5 - $2 = $3
If he bought 10 full gallon jars, she spent 10 jars * $5/jar = $<<10*5=50>>50
For the half-gallon jars, she spent $3/jar * 16 jars = $<<3*16=48>>48
The total amount she spent at the store is $48 + $50 = $<<48+50=98>>98

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to first determine the cost of a half-gallon jar based on the information provided about the gallon jar.

1. **Identify the cost of the gallon jar**:
   - The problem states that a gallon jar costs $5.

2. **Determine the cost of the half-gallon jar**:
   - According to the problem, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Let \( x \) be the cost of the half-gallon jar.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     x + 2 = 5
     \]
   - To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides:
     \[
     x = 5 - 2 = 3
     \]
   - Thus, the cost of a half-gallon jar is $3.

3. **Calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars**:
   - The cost of one gallon jar is $5. Therefore, the total cost for 10 gallon jars is:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars**:
   - The cost of one half-gallon jar is $3. Therefore, the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:
     \[
     16 \times 3 = 48
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent**:
   - To find the total amount spent, we add the total costs of the gallon jars and half-gallon jars:
     \[
     50 + 48 = 98
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars is \(\boxed{98}\).
