Question ID: 542

Question:
Verna loves to eat fruit. She bought three apples at $1.50 each, five oranges at $0.80 each, and six peaches at $0.75 each.  If she gave $20, how much change did she receive?


Reference Answer:
Three apples cost 3 x $1.50 = $<<3*1.5=4.50>>4.50.
Five oranges cost 5 x $0.80 = $<<5*0.8=4>>4.
Four peaches cost 6 x $0.75 = $<<6*0.75=4.50>>4.50.
Thus, Verna paid a total of $4.50 +$4+ $4.50 = $<<4.5+4+4.5=13>>13.
Therefore, Verna received $20 - $13 = $<<20-13=7>>7.

Response:
To find out how much change Verna received after buying the fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruit she purchased and then subtract that from the amount she gave ($20).

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the apples.**
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = Number of apples × Price per apple
\[
\text{Total cost for apples} = 3 \times 1.50 = 4.50
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the oranges.**
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = Number of oranges × Price per orange
\[
\text{Total cost for oranges} = 5 \times 0.80 = 4.00
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the peaches.**
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = Number of peaches × Price per peach
\[
\text{Total cost for peaches} = 6 \times 0.75 = 4.50
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of all the fruit.**
- Now we add the total costs of apples, oranges, and peaches together.
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for apples} + \text{Total cost for oranges} + \text{Total cost for peaches}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = 13.00
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the change Verna received.**
- Verna gave $20, so we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave.
\[
\text{Change} = \text{Amount given} - \text{Total cost}
\]
\[
\text{Change} = 20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00
\]

**Final Answer:**
Verna received $7.00 in change.
