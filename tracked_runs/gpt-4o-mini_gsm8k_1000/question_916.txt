Question ID: 588

Question:
Jared is trying to increase his typing speed. He starts with 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons the next time he tests his typing speed it has increased to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, what will be the average of the three measurements?


Reference Answer:
Jared types at 52 WPM and increases it by 5 WPM, 52 + 5 = <<52+5=57>>57 WPM.
His average over all his measured words-per-minute is 47 + 52 + 57 = <<47+52+57=156>>156.
His total is 156 / 3 typing speeds = <<156/3=52>>52 WPM as Jared's average typing speed.
#### 52

Response:
To find the average of Jared's typing speeds over three measurements, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the three measurements**:
   - The first measurement is 47 WPM (words per minute).
   - The second measurement is 52 WPM.
   - The third measurement is calculated by adding 5 WPM to the second measurement.

2. **Calculate the third measurement**:
   \[
   \text{Third measurement} = 52 \text{ WPM} + 5 \text{ WPM} = 57 \text{ WPM}
   \]

3. **List all three measurements**:
   - First measurement: 47 WPM
   - Second measurement: 52 WPM
   - Third measurement: 57 WPM

4. **Calculate the sum of the three measurements**:
   \[
   \text{Sum} = 47 + 52 + 57
   \]

   Let's perform the addition step-by-step:
   - First, add 47 and 52:
     \[
     47 + 52 = 99
     \]
   - Now, add 57 to the result:
     \[
     99 + 57 = 156
     \]

5. **Calculate the average of the three measurements**:
   The average is calculated by dividing the sum of the measurements by the number of measurements (which is 3):
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum}}{\text{Number of measurements}} = \frac{156}{3}
   \]

   Now, perform the division:
   \[
   156 \div 3 = 52
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   The average of the three measurements is:
   \[
   \boxed{52} \text{ WPM}
   \]
