Question ID: 911

Question:
Colby works for a manufacturing company in the packaging division.  He gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. If he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, how much money, in dollars, does he earn in a typical eight-hour workday?


Reference Answer:
Ten less than fifty is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 packages per hour.
At $0.20 per completed package. if he completes 40 packages per hour he earns 40*$0.20=$<<40*0.20=8>>8 per hour.
Thus, in a typical eight-hour day, he earns 8*$8=$<<8*8=64>>64.
#### 64

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of packages Colby completes in one hour.**
2. **Calculate his earnings for one hour.**
3. **Calculate his total earnings for an eight-hour workday.**

### Step 1: Determine the number of packages Colby completes in one hour.

The problem states that Colby completes "10 less than 50 packages per hour." 

To find the number of packages he completes, we can set up the equation:

\[
\text{Packages per hour} = 50 - 10
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Packages per hour} = 40
\]

### Step 2: Calculate his earnings for one hour.

Colby earns $0.20 for each package he completes. Therefore, to find his earnings for one hour, we multiply the number of packages he completes by the amount he earns per package:

\[
\text{Earnings per hour} = \text{Packages per hour} \times \text{Earnings per package}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Earnings per hour} = 40 \times 0.20
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Earnings per hour} = 8.00
\]

### Step 3: Calculate his total earnings for an eight-hour workday.

Now that we know Colby earns $8.00 per hour, we can calculate his total earnings for an eight-hour workday:

\[
\text{Total earnings for 8 hours} = \text{Earnings per hour} \times \text{Number of hours}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total earnings for 8 hours} = 8.00 \times 8
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total earnings for 8 hours} = 64.00
\]

### Final Answer

Colby earns **$64.00** in a typical eight-hour workday.
