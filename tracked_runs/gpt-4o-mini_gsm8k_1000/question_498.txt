Question:
A pound of almonds costs $10 while a pound of walnuts costs $15. How much more does it cost for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts?


Reference Answer:
One-half pound of almonds cost $10/2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.
One-fifth pound of almonds cost $10/5 = $<<10/5=2>>2.
A one-third pound of walnuts costs $15/3 = $<<15/3=5>>5.
So, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $5 + $5 = $10.
And 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $2 + $5 = $7.
Therefore, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $10 - $7 = $3 more than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the cost of two different mixtures of almonds and walnuts, and then find the difference in cost between them.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts.

1. **Cost of almonds**:
   - The cost of almonds is $10 per pound.
   - For 1/2 pound of almonds:
     \[
     \text{Cost of almonds} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ pound} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pound} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of walnuts**:
   - The cost of walnuts is $15 per pound.
   - For 1/3 pound of walnuts:
     \[
     \text{Cost of walnuts} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ pound} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pound} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total cost of the first mixture**:
   - Combine the costs of almonds and walnuts:
     \[
     \text{Total cost (1/2 pound almonds + 1/3 pound walnuts)} = 5 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts.

1. **Cost of almonds**:
   - For 1/5 pound of almonds:
     \[
     \text{Cost of almonds} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ pound} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pound} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of walnuts**:
   - The cost of walnuts remains the same as before, for 1/3 pound:
     \[
     \text{Cost of walnuts} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ pound} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pound} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total cost of the second mixture**:
   - Combine the costs of almonds and walnuts:
     \[
     \text{Total cost (1/5 pound almonds + 1/3 pound walnuts)} = 2 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 7 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in cost between the two mixtures.

1. **Difference in cost**:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total cost of first mixture} - \text{Total cost of second mixture} = 10 \text{ dollars} - 7 \text{ dollars} = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs **$3 more** than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.
