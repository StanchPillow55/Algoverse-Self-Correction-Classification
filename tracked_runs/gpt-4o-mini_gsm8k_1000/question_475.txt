Question ID: 422

Question:
Bill is signing up for a new streaming service. He got a special introductory deal where the first 6 months were $8 a month, then it went up to the normal price of $12 a month. After 8 months of the normal rate, the service increased its price to $14 a month. How much do 2 years of the service cost him?


Reference Answer:
There are 12 months in a year, so there are 2 years * 12 months per year = 24 months in 2 years.
He has 6 months at the special rate, followed by 8 months of the normal rate, so out of 24 months he pays the increased rate for 24 months - 6 months - 8 months = <<24-6-8=10>>10 months.
He pays the special rate of $8 a month for 6 months, or 6 months * $8 per month = $<<6*8=48>>48.
He pays the normal rate of $12 a month for 8 months, or 8 months * $12 per month = $<<8*12=96>>96.
He pays the new raised rate of $14 a month for 10 months, or 10 months * $14 per month = $<<10*14=140>>140.
Over two years, he pays a total of $48 + $96 + $140 = $<<48+96+140=284>>284.

Response:
To calculate the total cost of the streaming service for Bill over a period of 2 years, we need to break down the costs into different segments based on the pricing structure provided.

1. **First 6 months**: 
   - The cost for the first 6 months is $8 per month.
   - Total cost for the first 6 months:
     \[
     6 \text{ months} \times 8 \text{ dollars/month} = 48 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Next 8 months**: 
   - After the first 6 months, the price increases to $12 per month.
   - The next 8 months will therefore cost:
     \[
     8 \text{ months} \times 12 \text{ dollars/month} = 96 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Remaining 10 months**: 
   - After the first 14 months (6 months at $8 and 8 months at $12), the price increases to $14 per month.
   - Since 2 years is 24 months, the remaining months after the first 14 months is:
     \[
     24 \text{ months} - 14 \text{ months} = 10 \text{ months}
     \]
   - The cost for these 10 months at $14 per month is:
     \[
     10 \text{ months} \times 14 \text{ dollars/month} = 140 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total cost**: 
   - Now, we sum up all the costs from each segment:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for first 6 months} + \text{Cost for next 8 months} + \text{Cost for remaining 10 months}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 48 \text{ dollars} + 96 \text{ dollars} + 140 \text{ dollars}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 284 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total cost for 2 years of the streaming service is **$284**. 

Final answer: **$284**.
