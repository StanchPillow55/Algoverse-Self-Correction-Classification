Question:
Susan made 100 cookies for Christmas and was going to equally divide them between her 6 nephews. Before Susan could package them, her husband snuck 4 cookies for himself. How many cookies will each of Susanâ€™s nephews get?


Reference Answer:
Subtract 4 from 100 to see how many cookies are left. 100 cookies - 4 cookies = <<100-4=96>>96 cookies
Divide 96 cookies between her 6 nephews = 96 cookies/6 people = <<96/6=16>>16 cookies/person
#### 16

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cookies each of Susan's 6 nephews will receive after her husband takes 4 cookies for himself.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies left after her husband takes some.**

Susan originally made 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies. We can find the number of cookies remaining by subtracting the 4 cookies taken by her husband from the original 100 cookies:

\[
\text{Cookies remaining} = \text{Original cookies} - \text{Cookies taken by husband}
\]
\[
\text{Cookies remaining} = 100 - 4 = 96
\]

**Step 2: Divide the remaining cookies equally among the nephews.**

Now that we know there are 96 cookies left, we need to divide these cookies equally among Susan's 6 nephews. To do this, we will divide the total number of cookies by the number of nephews:

\[
\text{Cookies per nephew} = \frac{\text{Cookies remaining}}{\text{Number of nephews}}
\]
\[
\text{Cookies per nephew} = \frac{96}{6}
\]

**Step 3: Perform the division.**

Now we perform the division:

\[
\frac{96}{6} = 16
\]

**Final Answer:**

Each of Susan's nephews will receive 16 cookies.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]
