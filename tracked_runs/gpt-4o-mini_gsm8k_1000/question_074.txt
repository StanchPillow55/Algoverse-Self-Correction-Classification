=== Turn 1 ===


Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how long Royce takes to shingle a house based on the time it takes Rob.

1. **Identify the time Rob takes**: 
   Rob takes 2 hours to shingle the house. We need to convert this time into minutes since the final answer should be in minutes.
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate double Rob's time**: 
   Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. First, we calculate double Rob's time:
   \[
   \text{Double Rob's time} = 2 \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Add 40 minutes to double Rob's time**: 
   Now, we add 40 minutes to the double time to find out how long Royce takes:
   \[
   \text{Royce's time} = 240 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 280 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, Royce takes a total of 280 minutes to shingle the house.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{280}
\]
