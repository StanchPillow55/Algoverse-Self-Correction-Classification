Question ID: 1039

Question:
Jim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. He needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. How many square feet of fabric does Jim need to buy?


Reference Answer:
First find the length of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's length: 6 feet + 2 feet = <<6+2=8>>8 feet
Then find the width of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's width: 8 feet + 2 feet = <<8+2=10>>10 feet
Then find the square footage of each piece of fabric by multiplying its length and width: 8 feet * 10 feet = <<8*10=80>>80 square feet
Then double that amount since Jim needs two pieces of fabric: 80 square feet/piece * 2 pieces = <<80*2=160>>160 square feet
#### 160

Response:
To determine how much fabric Jim needs to buy for his comforter, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he requires based on the size of his king-sized bed.

1. **Identify the dimensions of the bed:**
   - Length of the bed = 6 feet
   - Width of the bed = 8 feet

2. **Calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces:**
   - Jim needs each piece of fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.
   - Length of each fabric piece = Length of the bed + 2 feet
     \[
     \text{Length of each fabric piece} = 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}
     \]
   - Width of each fabric piece = Width of the bed + 2 feet
     \[
     \text{Width of each fabric piece} = 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the area of one piece of fabric:**
   - Area of one piece of fabric = Length Ã— Width
     \[
     \text{Area of one piece} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet}
     \]

4. **Determine the total area of fabric needed:**
   - Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2.
     \[
     \text{Total area of fabric} = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Jim needs to buy a total of **160 square feet** of fabric for his comforter.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{160}
\]
