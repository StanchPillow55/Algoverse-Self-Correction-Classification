Question:
Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles.  He drives 100 miles a day for a 30 day month.  How many tune-ups does he need in that time?


Reference Answer:
He drives 100*30=<<100*30=3000>>3000 miles
So he needs 3000/1000=<<3000/1000=3>>3 tune-ups
#### 3

Response:
To determine how many tune-ups Jon needs in a 30-day month, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total miles Jon drives in a month**:
   Jon drives 100 miles a day. Therefore, over a 30-day month, the total miles driven can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total miles} = \text{Miles per day} \times \text{Number of days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total miles} = 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Determine how many tune-ups are needed**:
   Jon's car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs for the total miles driven, we divide the total miles by the miles per tune-up:

   \[
   \text{Number of tune-ups} = \frac{\text{Total miles}}{\text{Miles per tune-up}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of tune-ups} = \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   Jon needs a total of 3 tune-ups in a 30-day month.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
