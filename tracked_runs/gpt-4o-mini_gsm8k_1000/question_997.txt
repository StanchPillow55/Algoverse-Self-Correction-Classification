Question ID: 811

Question:
Felix notices that kids in the neighborhood are always getting things stuck in trees. Since he is an expert tree climber, he decided to start charging kids to get their stuff out. He charges based on how high he has to climb. Every branch he has to climb up costs $.25. During the week he made $105. On average, how many branches did he climb per day?


Reference Answer:
He climbed 420 branches in total because 105 / .25 = <<105/.25=420>>420
He climbed on average 60 branches a day because 420 / 7 = <<420/7=60>>60
#### 60

Response:
To determine how many branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to find out how many branches he climbed in total during the week. 

1. **Calculate Total Earnings from Climbing**:
   Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made a total of $105 during the week. To find out how many branches he climbed, we can set up the following equation:

   \[
   \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Charge per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}
   \]

2. **Perform the Division**:
   To divide 105 by 0.25, we can convert 0.25 into a fraction:

   \[
   0.25 = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

   Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal:

   \[
   \frac{105}{0.25} = 105 \times 4
   \]

   Now, we calculate:

   \[
   105 \times 4 = 420
   \]

   So, Felix climbed a total of 420 branches during the week.

3. **Calculate Average Branches Climbed Per Day**:
   There are 7 days in a week. To find the average number of branches climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days:

   \[
   \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7}
   \]

4. **Perform the Division**:
   Now we calculate:

   \[
   \frac{420}{7} = 60
   \]

Thus, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

**Final Answer**: Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.
