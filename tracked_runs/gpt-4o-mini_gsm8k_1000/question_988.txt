Question:
Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month.  She sets 25% of her paycheck aside to put towards fancy shoes.  Each pair of shoes she buys costs $1,000.00.  How many shoes can she buy in a year?


Reference Answer:
She is paid $2,000.00 a month and she saves 25% for shoes so she saves 2000*.25 = $<<2000*.25=500.00>>500.00
She saves $500.00 a month for 12 months so she saves 500*12 = $<<500*12=6000.00>>6,000.00
Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00 and she has saved $6,000.00 so she can buy 6000/1000 = 6 pair of shoes per year

Response:
To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Jessica's monthly savings for shoes.**
2. **Determine her annual savings for shoes.**
3. **Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her annual savings.**

### Step 1: Calculate Monthly Savings for Shoes

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes.

First, we need to calculate 25% of $2,000.00:

\[
\text{Monthly Savings} = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500
\]

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes.

### Step 2: Determine Annual Savings for Shoes

Next, we need to find out how much she saves in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply her monthly savings by 12:

\[
\text{Annual Savings} = 500 \times 12 = 6000
\]

Thus, Jessica saves $6,000.00 in a year for shoes.

### Step 3: Calculate How Many Pairs of Shoes She Can Buy

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her annual savings, we divide her total annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:

\[
\text{Number of Shoes} = \frac{\text{Annual Savings}}{\text{Cost per Pair}} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6
\]

### Final Answer

Jessica can buy **6 pairs of shoes** in a year.
