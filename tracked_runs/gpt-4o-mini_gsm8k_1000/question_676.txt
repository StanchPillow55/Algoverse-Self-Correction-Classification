Question ID: 259

Question:
Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal and half as many bananas as Jamal. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. How many fruits are there if Andrea has 52 apples?


Reference Answer:
Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, if Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal has 52-8 = <<52-8=44>>44 apples.
The total number of apples is 44+52 = <<44+52=96>>96
Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44+4 = 48 bananas.
Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which totals 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 bananas.
There are a total of 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 bananas.
Altogether, there are 96 apples + 72 bananas = <<96+72=168>>168 fruits
#### 168

Response:
Let's denote the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have using variables.

Let:
- \( A_a \) = number of apples Andrea has
- \( A_j \) = number of apples Jamal has
- \( B_a \) = number of bananas Andrea has
- \( B_j \) = number of bananas Jamal has

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal:
   \[
   A_a = A_j + 8
   \]

2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
   \[
   B_a = \frac{1}{2} B_j
   \]

3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:
   \[
   B_j = A_j + 4
   \]

4. We know that Andrea has 52 apples:
   \[
   A_a = 52
   \]

Now, we can substitute \( A_a \) into the first equation to find \( A_j \):
\[
52 = A_j + 8
\]
Subtracting 8 from both sides gives:
\[
A_j = 52 - 8 = 44
\]

Now that we have \( A_j \), we can use it to find \( B_j \) using the third equation:
\[
B_j = A_j + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48
\]

Next, we can find \( B_a \) using the second equation:
\[
B_a = \frac{1}{2} B_j = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

Now we have all the quantities:
- \( A_a = 52 \) (Andrea's apples)
- \( A_j = 44 \) (Jamal's apples)
- \( B_a = 24 \) (Andrea's bananas)
- \( B_j = 48 \) (Jamal's bananas)

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:
\[
\text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_j + B_a + B_j
\]
Substituting the values we found:
\[
\text{Total fruits} = 52 + 44 + 24 + 48
\]

Calculating this step by step:
1. \( 52 + 44 = 96 \)
2. \( 96 + 24 = 120 \)
3. \( 120 + 48 = 168 \)

Thus, the total number of fruits is:
\[
\boxed{168}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, we will define variables for the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have, and then set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( A_a \) be the number of apples Andrea has.
   - Let \( A_j \) be the number of apples Jamal has.
   - Let \( B_a \) be the number of bananas Andrea has.
   - Let \( B_j \) be the number of bananas Jamal has.

2. **Information Given**:
   - Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: 
     \[
     A_a = A_j + 8
     \]
   - Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
     \[
     B_a = \frac{1}{2} B_j
     \]
   - Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:
     \[
     B_j = A_j + 4
     \]
   - We know that Andrea has 52 apples:
     \[
     A_a = 52
     \]

3. **Substituting Known Values**:
   Since \( A_a = 52 \), we can substitute this value into the first equation:
   \[
   52 = A_j + 8
   \]
   To find \( A_j \):
   \[
   A_j = 52 - 8 = 44
   \]

4. **Finding Bananas for Jamal**:
   Now we can use \( A_j \) to find \( B_j \):
   \[
   B_j = A_j + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48
   \]

5. **Finding Bananas for Andrea**:
   Now we can find \( B_a \) using the second equation:
   \[
   B_a = \frac{1}{2} B_j = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
   \]

6. **Calculating Total Fruits**:
   Now we can calculate the total number of fruits (apples + bananas) for both Andrea and Jamal:
   - Total fruits for Andrea:
     \[
     \text{Total for Andrea} = A_a + B_a = 52 + 24 = 76
     \]
   - Total fruits for Jamal:
     \[
     \text{Total for Jamal} = A_j + B_j = 44 + 48 = 92
     \]

7. **Final Total Fruits**:
   Now we add the total fruits for both Andrea and Jamal:
   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = 76 + 92 = 168
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{168}
\]
