Question ID: 153

Question:
Dave bought a large pack of french fries and ate fourteen before a hungry seagull stole the pack out of his hand. When the seagull landed, he gobbled down half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Then three pigeons bullied him away from the food, and each pigeon ate three fries. Later, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. How many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?


Reference Answer:
Dave ate 14 french fries, so the seagull ate 14 * 1/2 = 14 / 2 = <<14*1/2=7>>7 fries.
The 3 pigeons ate 3 each, so they ate 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 fries.
The ants took one french fry, so there were 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 after the racoon took some.
The raccoon left 1/3 behind, so there were 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 fries before the raccoon took any.
Thus, the pack had 14 + 7 + 9 + 18 = <<14+7+9+18=48>>48 fries in it when Dave bought it.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will work through it step by step, keeping track of the number of french fries at each stage.

1. **Initial Amount of French Fries**: Let \( x \) be the initial number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

2. **French Fries Eaten by Dave**: Dave ate 14 fries. After he ate, the number of fries left is:
   \[
   x - 14
   \]

3. **French Fries Eaten by the Seagull**: The seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate. Since Dave ate 14 fries, the seagull ate:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ fries}
   \]
   After the seagull ate, the number of fries left is:
   \[
   (x - 14) - 7 = x - 21
   \]

4. **French Fries Eaten by the Pigeons**: There are three pigeons, and each ate 3 fries. Therefore, the total number of fries eaten by the pigeons is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ fries}
   \]
   After the pigeons ate, the number of fries left is:
   \[
   (x - 21) - 9 = x - 30
   \]

5. **French Fries Stolen by the Raccoon**: The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. The amount of fries remaining before the raccoon stole them is \( x - 30 \). The amount stolen by the raccoon is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}(x - 30)
   \]
   Therefore, the amount left after the raccoon stole the fries is:
   \[
   (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3}(x - 30) = \frac{1}{3}(x - 30)
   \]

6. **French Fry Taken by Ants**: The ants carried off one final fry, leaving 5 fries behind. This means:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]

7. **Solving the Equation**: Now we can solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]
   Adding 1 to both sides gives:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) = 6
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 3 gives:
   \[
   x - 30 = 18
   \]
   Adding 30 to both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 48
   \]

Thus, the initial number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \( \boxed{48} \).
