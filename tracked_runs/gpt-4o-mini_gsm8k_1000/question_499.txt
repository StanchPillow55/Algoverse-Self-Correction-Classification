Question ID: 834

Question:
Mason is on his bike journey at a rate of 8 miles per hour. He travels for 4 hours, takes some rest, and then goes on for another 6 hours. How many miles has he traveled in total?


Reference Answer:
If Mason travels for 8 miles in one hour, in four hours, he traveled for 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 miles.
After his rest, Mason traveled for another 6 hours, and since he was traveling at 8 miles per hour, he had traveled for 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 miles after the six hours.
For the whole journey, Mason traveled for 32+48 = <<32+48=80>>80 miles.
#### 80

Response:
To determine the total distance Mason has traveled on his bike journey, we can break the problem down into two parts: the distance traveled during the first part of the journey and the distance traveled during the second part.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first part of the journey.

Mason's speed is 8 miles per hour, and he travels for 4 hours. We can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

For the first part of the journey:

- Speed = 8 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours

Now we can calculate the distance:

\[
\text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the second part of the journey.

After taking a rest, Mason continues his journey for another 6 hours at the same speed of 8 miles per hour. We will use the same formula for distance:

For the second part of the journey:

- Speed = 8 miles per hour
- Time = 6 hours

Now we can calculate the distance:

\[
\text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled.

To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we simply add the distances from both parts of the journey:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Final Answer:

Mason has traveled a total of **80 miles**.

Response:
To find out how many miles Mason has traveled in total, we can break the problem down into two parts: the distance he travels during the first segment of his journey and the distance he travels during the second segment. 

### Step 1: Calculate the distance for the first part of the journey.

Mason travels at a speed of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours. We can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

For the first part of the journey:

- Speed = 8 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours

Now, substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance for the second part of the journey.

After taking a rest, Mason continues his journey for another 6 hours at the same speed of 8 miles per hour. We will again use the same distance formula.

For the second part of the journey:

- Speed = 8 miles per hour
- Time = 6 hours

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled.

Now, we can find the total distance traveled by adding the distances from both parts of the journey:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2
\]

Substituting the distances we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Final Answer

Mason has traveled a total of **80 miles**.

Response:
To find out how many miles Mason has traveled in total, we can break the problem down into two parts: the distance he travels during the first part of his journey and the distance he travels during the second part.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first part of the journey.

Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours. We can use the formula for distance:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

For the first part:

- Rate = 8 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours

Now we can calculate the distance:

\[
\text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the second part of the journey.

After taking a rest, Mason continues his journey for another 6 hours at the same rate of 8 miles per hour. We will use the same distance formula:

For the second part:

- Rate = 8 miles per hour
- Time = 6 hours

Now we can calculate the distance:

\[
\text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled.

Now that we have the distances for both parts of the journey, we can find the total distance by adding them together:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Final Answer

Mason has traveled a total of **80 miles**.
