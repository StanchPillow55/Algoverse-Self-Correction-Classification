Question:
Two trains leave San Rafael at the same time. They begin traveling westward, both traveling for 80 miles. The next day, they travel northwards, covering 150 miles. What's the distance covered by each train in the two days?


Reference Answer:
On the first day, the trains covered 2 trains * 80 miles/train = <<2*80=160>>160 miles together.
They also covered 150 miles/train * 2 trains = <<150*2=300>>300 miles together on the second day.
The combined distance the two trains covered in the two days is 300 miles + 160 miles = <<300+160=460>>460 miles
The average distance for the two days is 460 miles / 2 trains = <<460/2=230>>230 miles/train

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total distance covered by each train over the two days.

### Day 1: Traveling Westward
Both trains travel westward for 80 miles.

- Distance covered by each train on Day 1 = 80 miles

### Day 2: Traveling Northward
The next day, both trains travel northward for 150 miles.

- Distance covered by each train on Day 2 = 150 miles

### Total Distance Calculation
Now, we will calculate the total distance covered by each train over the two days.

1. **Total distance for Day 1**:
   \[
   \text{Distance on Day 1} = 80 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Total distance for Day 2**:
   \[
   \text{Distance on Day 2} = 150 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance for both days**:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance on Day 1} + \text{Distance on Day 2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Final Answer
The total distance covered by each train in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{230 \text{ miles}}
\]
