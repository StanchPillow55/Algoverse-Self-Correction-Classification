Question ID: 1166

Question:
Generally, a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits, a 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, a 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, and an 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, and then a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits. How many total fruits can an avocado tree produce during its 10 years of life?


Reference Answer:
At 5 years it produces 50 fruits
At 6 years it produces 50 * 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 fruits.
At 7 years, it produces 50 * 7 = <<50*7=350>>350 fruits
At 10 years, it produces 50 * 20 = <<50*20=1000>>1000 fruits
At 8 years, it produces 200 fewer fruits than at 10 years, so it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits
During 10 years, an avocado tree can produce a total of 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = <<50+150+350+800+1000=2350>>2350 fruits

Response:
To solve the problem, we will calculate the number of fruits produced by the avocado tree each year from its 5th to its 10th year, and then sum these amounts to find the total production over its 10-year life.

1. **5-Year-Old Tree:**
   - The tree produces 50 fruits.
   \[
   \text{Fruits in year 5} = 50
   \]

2. **6-Year-Old Tree:**
   - The tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   \text{Fruits in year 6} = 3 \times 50 = 150
   \]

3. **7-Year-Old Tree:**
   - The tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   \text{Fruits in year 7} = 7 \times 50 = 350
   \]

4. **8-Year-Old Tree:**
   - The tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We need to first find out how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces.
   - We will calculate the 10-year-old tree's production first.

5. **10-Year-Old Tree:**
   - The tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   \text{Fruits in year 10} = 20 \times 50 = 1000
   \]

6. **8-Year-Old Tree Calculation:**
   - Now we can find the production of the 8-year-old tree:
   \[
   \text{Fruits in year 8} = \text{Fruits in year 10} - 200 = 1000 - 200 = 800
   \]

7. **9-Year-Old Tree:**
   - The tree does not produce any fruits.
   \[
   \text{Fruits in year 9} = 0
   \]

Now we have the number of fruits produced each year:
- Year 5: 50 fruits
- Year 6: 150 fruits
- Year 7: 350 fruits
- Year 8: 800 fruits
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 1000 fruits

8. **Total Fruits Calculation:**
   - Now we will sum the fruits produced over the 10 years:
   \[
   \text{Total Fruits} = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Fruits} = 50 + 150 = 200
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Fruits} = 200 + 350 = 550
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Fruits} = 550 + 800 = 1350
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Fruits} = 1350 + 0 = 1350
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Fruits} = 1350 + 1000 = 2350
   \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life is:
\[
\boxed{2350}
\]
