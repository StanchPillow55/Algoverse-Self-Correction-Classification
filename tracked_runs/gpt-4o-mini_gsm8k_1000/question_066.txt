Question ID: 1146

Question:
Adam has $100 and wants to spend it to open a rock stand. He can buy rocks for $5 each and sell them for $7 each. If he invests all his money in the rock stand but only sells 60% of his inventory, how much money does he lose?


Reference Answer:
He can buy 20 rocks because 100 / 5 = <<100/5=20>>20
He sells 12 of these rocks because 20 x .6 = <<20*.6=12>>12
He makes $84 selling these because 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84
He lost $16 on his business because 100 - 84 = <<100-84=16>>16
#### 16

Response:
To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy**:
   Adam has $100 and each rock costs $5. We can find out how many rocks he can buy by dividing his total money by the cost per rock.

   \[
   \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per rock}} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ rocks}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks**:
   Adam only sells 60% of his inventory. First, we need to find out how many rocks that is.

   \[
   \text{Rocks sold} = 60\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.6 \times 20 = 12 \text{ rocks}
   \]

   Next, we calculate the revenue from selling these rocks. Each rock is sold for $7.

   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \text{Rocks sold} \times \text{Selling price per rock} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the rocks**:
   Adam spent $100 to buy the rocks, which is the total cost.

4. **Calculate the loss**:
   To find out how much money Adam loses, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost.

   \[
   \text{Loss} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total revenue} = 100 - 84 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Adam loses $16.

**Final Answer**: Adam loses $16.
