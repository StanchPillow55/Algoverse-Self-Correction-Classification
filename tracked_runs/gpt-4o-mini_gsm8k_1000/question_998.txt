Question ID: 1077

Question:
Paul is at a train station and is waiting for his train. He isn't sure how long he needs to wait, but he knows that the fourth train scheduled to arrive at the station is the one he needs to get on. The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes, and this train will stay in the station for 20 minutes. The second train is to arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station, and this second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station. The third train is to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station, and this third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives.  The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves, and this is the train Paul will board.  In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?


Reference Answer:
The first train stays in the station for 10 minutes * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.
So Paul waits for the first train for 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 minutes.
The second train arrives after half an hour, which is the same as 60 minutes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 minutes.
It then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.
So Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes.
The third train arrives an hour later, which is the same as 60 minutes * 1 hour = <<60*1=60>>60 minutes.
After the final wait, Paul has waited a total of 30 minutes for the first train + 35 minutes for the second train + 60 minutes for the third train + 20 minutes final wait = <<30+35+60+20=145>>145 minutes.

Response:
To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to analyze the schedule of the trains step by step.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrival time: 10 minutes
   - Duration at the station: 20 minutes
   - Departure time: \(10 + 20 = 30\) minutes

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrival time: Half an hour after the first train leaves.
   - The first train leaves at 30 minutes, so the second train arrives at \(30 + 30 = 60\) minutes.
   - Duration at the station: A quarter of the first train's duration.
   - The first train stayed for 20 minutes, so the second train stays for \(20 / 4 = 5\) minutes.
   - Departure time: \(60 + 5 = 65\) minutes

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrival time: An hour after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves at 65 minutes, so the third train arrives at \(65 + 60 = 125\) minutes.
   - Duration at the station: The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it stays for 0 minutes.
   - Departure time: 125 minutes (it leaves immediately).

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrival time: 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves at 125 minutes, so the fourth train arrives at \(125 + 20 = 145\) minutes.

Now, we need to calculate how long Paul waits for the fourth train. Since he arrives at the station at the same time as the first train (0 minutes), we can calculate his total waiting time until the fourth train arrives.

- **Waiting time until the fourth train arrives:**
  - Fourth train arrival time: 145 minutes
  - Paul's arrival time: 0 minutes
  - Total waiting time: \(145 - 0 = 145\) minutes

Thus, Paul will wait for a total of **145 minutes** for his train.

Final answer: **145 minutes**.
