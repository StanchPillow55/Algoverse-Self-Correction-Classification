Response:
To find out how many total meters James runs in a week, we can break the problem down into smaller steps.

1. **Determine the distance James runs in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the total distance for one day of sprints:**
   James runs 3 sprints each time he runs. Therefore, the total distance he runs in one day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance per day} = \text{Distance per sprint} \times \text{Number of sprints}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Distance per day} = 60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints} = 180 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance for one week:**
   James runs 3 times a week. Therefore, the total distance he runs in a week is:
   \[
   \text{Total distance per week} = \text{Distance per day} \times \text{Number of days}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total distance per week} = 180 \text{ meters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 540 \text{ meters}
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Thus, the total distance James runs in a week is:
   \[
   \boxed{540} \text{ meters}
   \]
