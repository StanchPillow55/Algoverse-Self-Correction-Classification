Question ID: 965

Question:
A bird decides to leave her summer home in the north and travel to her winter home in the south.  To make the journey, the bird leaves her home flying in a southerly direction for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.  Then, the bird turns direction and flies towards the north for 2 hours are a speed of 18 miles per hour.  Finally, the bird changes direction and flies toward the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour before landing at her southern home.  What is the distance, in miles, between the bird's northern and the southern homes?


Reference Answer:
Flying for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour, the bird travels 10*30=<<10*30=300>>300 miles in a southerly direction.
Flying for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour, the bird travels 2*18=<<2*18=36>>36 miles in a northerly direction.
And flying for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour, the bird travels 5*22=<<5*22=110>>110 miles in a southerly direction.
Altogether, the distance between the bird's two homes is 300-36+110=<<300-36+110=374>>374 miles

Response:
To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird travels in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled back north.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled south for the first leg of the journey.

The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.

\[
\text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled north for the second leg of the journey.

The bird then flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.

\[
\text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 18 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 36 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled south for the third leg of the journey.

Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.

\[
\text{Distance}_3 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 22 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 110 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total distance traveled south.

Now, we will add the distances traveled south and subtract the distance traveled north.

\[
\text{Total Distance South} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_3 = 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the net distance from the northern home to the southern home.

Now, we subtract the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:

\[
\text{Net Distance} = \text{Total Distance South} - \text{Distance}_2 = 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Final Answer

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

\[
\boxed{374} \, \text{miles}
\]
