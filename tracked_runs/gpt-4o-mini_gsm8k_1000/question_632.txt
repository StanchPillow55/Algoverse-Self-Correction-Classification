Question ID: 361

Question:
A train travels between 3 different cities.  It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city.  It does this trip 3 times a day.  The train needs service every 18,000 miles so how many days does it go between services?


Reference Answer:
It takes 100+75=<<100+75=175>>175 miles for the first two legs of the trip
The third leg is 175-50=<<175-50=125>>125 miles
So the total trip is 175+125=<<175+125=300>>300 miles
So it goes 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 miles per day
So it can go 18000/900=<<18000/900=20>>20 days between services.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will first calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete trip from the first city to the second city, then to the third city, and back to the first city. 

1. **Calculate the distances:**
   - Distance from the first city to the second city: \(75\) miles
   - Distance from the second city to the third city: \(100\) miles
   - Combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city:
     \[
     75 + 100 = 175 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - The distance from the third city back to the first city is \(50\) miles less than the combined distance:
     \[
     175 - 50 = 125 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:**
   - The total distance for one complete trip (first city to second city to third city and back to first city) is:
     \[
     75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:**
   - The train makes this trip \(3\) times a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is:
     \[
     300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Calculate how many days the train can operate before needing service:**
   - The train needs service every \(18,000\) miles. To find out how many days it can operate before needing service, we divide the total service distance by the daily distance:
     \[
     \frac{18,000}{900} = 20 \text{ days}
     \]

Thus, the train can go **20 days** between services.

**Final Answer: 20 days**
