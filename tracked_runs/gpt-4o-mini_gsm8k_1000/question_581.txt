Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many flowers Ryan has planted after 15 days and then account for the 5 flowers that did not grow.

1. **Calculate the total number of flowers planted:**
   Ryan plants 2 flowers each day. Therefore, the total number of flowers he plants in 15 days can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total flowers planted} = \text{flowers per day} \times \text{number of days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total flowers planted} = 2 \text{ flowers/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ flowers}
   \]

2. **Account for the flowers that did not grow:**
   Out of the 30 flowers that Ryan planted, 5 did not grow. To find out how many flowers actually grew, we subtract the number of flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted:

   \[
   \text{Flowers that grew} = \text{Total flowers planted} - \text{flowers that did not grow}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Flowers that grew} = 30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ flowers} = 25 \text{ flowers}
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   After accounting for the flowers that did not grow, Ryan has a total of 25 flowers that grew in his garden.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]
