Question ID: 433

Question:
15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 different containers. Josey needed 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower. How many pints of gasoline did Josey need?


Reference Answer:
15 gallons = 120 pints
120/5 = <<120/5=24>>24 pints per container
(1/4)24 = 6 pints
Josey needed 6 pints of gas for her lawnmower.
#### 6

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of gasoline in each container.**
2. **Calculate how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons.**
3. **Convert the amount of gasoline from gallons to pints.**

### Step 1: Determine the amount of gasoline in each container

We start with 15 gallons of gas divided equally into 5 containers. To find out how much gasoline is in each container, we divide the total amount of gasoline by the number of containers:

\[
\text{Gasoline per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons

Josey needs \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container to run her lawnmower. Since we know that each container holds 3 gallons, we can calculate how much gasoline \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container is:

\[
\text{Gasoline needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 3: Convert the amount of gasoline from gallons to pints

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. We know that:

\[
1 \text{ gallon} = 8 \text{ pints}
\]

To convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons to pints, we multiply by 8:

\[
\text{Gasoline needed in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Gasoline needed in pints} = \frac{3 \times 8}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pints}
\]

### Final Answer

Josey needs **6 pints** of gasoline to run her lawnmower.
