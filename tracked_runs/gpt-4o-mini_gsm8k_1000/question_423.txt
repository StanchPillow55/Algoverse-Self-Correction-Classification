Question:
James delivers 600 newspapers in a day. He delivers 198 newspapers to District A, some to District B and 209 newspapers to District C. How many newspapers does he deliver to District B?


Reference Answer:
He delivers to District A and C a total of 198+209 = <<198+209=407>>407 newspapers
He delivers 600 in total so District B will get the remainder which is 600-407 = <<600-407=193>>193 newspapers

Response:
To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we can start by setting up the information we have:

1. Total newspapers delivered by James in a day: 600
2. Newspapers delivered to District A: 198
3. Newspapers delivered to District C: 209
4. Newspapers delivered to District B: unknown (let's call it \( x \))

We can express the total number of newspapers delivered as the sum of the newspapers delivered to each district:

\[
\text{Total newspapers} = \text{Newspapers to District A} + \text{Newspapers to District B} + \text{Newspapers to District C}
\]

Substituting the known values into the equation gives us:

\[
600 = 198 + x + 209
\]

Next, we can simplify the right side of the equation by adding the known quantities:

\[
198 + 209 = 407
\]

Now, we can rewrite the equation:

\[
600 = 407 + x
\]

To find \( x \), we need to isolate it. We can do this by subtracting 407 from both sides of the equation:

\[
x = 600 - 407
\]

Now we perform the subtraction:

\[
x = 193
\]

Thus, the number of newspapers delivered to District B is:

\[
\boxed{193}
\] 

This means James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.
