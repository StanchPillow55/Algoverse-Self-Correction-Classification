Response:
To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to start with the total population and subtract the number of men and women.

1. **Identify the total population**:  
   The total population of Soda is given as 23,786 inhabitants.

2. **Identify the number of men and women**:  
   - Number of men = 8,417  
   - Number of women = 9,092  

3. **Calculate the total number of adults (men and women)**:  
   We add the number of men and women together to find the total number of adults:
   \[
   \text{Total adults} = \text{Number of men} + \text{Number of women} = 8417 + 9092
   \]

   Performing the addition:
   \[
   8417 + 9092 = 17509
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of children**:  
   To find the number of children, we subtract the total number of adults from the total population:
   \[
   \text{Number of children} = \text{Total population} - \text{Total adults} = 23786 - 17509
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:
   \[
   23786 - 17509 = 6277
   \]

5. **Final answer**:  
   Therefore, the number of children in the city of Soda is \( \boxed{6277} \).
