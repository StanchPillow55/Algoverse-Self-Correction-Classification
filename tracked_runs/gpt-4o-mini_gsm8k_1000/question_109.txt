Question:
Steve decides to start eating more tomatoes and decides to grows his own cherry tomatoes.  He eats twice as much as his girlfriend.  He eats 6 per day.  If a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week how many vines does he need?


Reference Answer:
His girlfriend eats 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 tomatoes per day
So together they eat 6+3=<<6+3=9>>9 tomatoes a day
That means they eat 9*7=<<9*7=63>>63 tomatoes a day
So he needs 63/3=<<63/3=21>>21 tomato vines

Response:
To determine how many vines of cherry tomatoes Steve needs to grow, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Steve's Daily Tomato Consumption**:
   - According to the problem, Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day.

2. **Calculate Weekly Tomato Consumption**:
   - Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week:
   \[
   \text{Tomatoes per week} = \text{Tomatoes per day} \times \text{Days per week} = 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week}
   \]

3. **Determine Tomato Production per Vine**:
   - The problem states that one vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week.

4. **Calculate the Number of Vines Needed**:
   - To find out how many vines are needed to produce 42 tomatoes in a week, we can use the following formula:
   \[
   \text{Number of vines needed} = \frac{\text{Total tomatoes needed per week}}{\text{Tomatoes produced per vine per week}} = \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}}
   \]
   - Performing the division:
   \[
   \text{Number of vines needed} = \frac{42}{3} = 14
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Steve needs **14 vines** to meet his weekly consumption of cherry tomatoes.

In conclusion, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many vines of cherry tomatoes Steve needs to grow in order to meet his daily consumption of tomatoes.

1. **Understanding Steve's Consumption**:
   - We know that Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day.

2. **Calculating Weekly Consumption**:
   - Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate Steve's weekly consumption of tomatoes:
     \[
     \text{Weekly consumption} = \text{Daily consumption} \times \text{Number of days in a week}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Weekly consumption} = 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week}
     \]

3. **Understanding Tomato Production per Vine**:
   - Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.

4. **Calculating the Number of Vines Needed**:
   - To find out how many vines Steve needs, we can use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Number of vines needed} = \frac{\text{Weekly consumption}}{\text{Tomatoes produced per vine per week}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of vines needed} = \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 14 \text{ vines}
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Steve needs **14 vines** to meet his weekly consumption of cherry tomatoes.

In conclusion, the total number of vines Steve needs to grow is **14**.

3. **Tomato Production per Vine**:
   - According to the problem, each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.

4. **Calculating the Number of Vines Needed**:
   - To find out how many vines Steve needs to produce at least 42 tomatoes per week, we can set up the following equation:
     \[
     \text{Number of vines} = \frac{\text{Weekly consumption}}{\text{Tomatoes produced per vine}}
     \]
   - Plugging in the numbers:
     \[
     \text{Number of vines} = \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine}} = 14 \text{ vines}
     \]
