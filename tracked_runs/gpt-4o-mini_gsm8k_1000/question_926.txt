Question ID: 388

Question:
James is in charge of running messages from the office to each teacher's classroom. If he delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson and 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu, how many messages does he deliver total?


Reference Answer:
First find the number of messages Mr. Yu gets: 66 messages / 3 = <<66/3=22>>22 messages
Then add that to the number of messages Ms. Thompson gets to find the total: 66 messages + 22 messages = <<66+22=88>>88 messages
#### 88

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of messages James delivers to both Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

1. **Messages to Ms. Thompson**: 
   James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.

2. **Messages to Mr. Yu**: 
   According to the problem, James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. 
   To find out how many messages he delivers to Mr. Yu, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Messages to Ms. Thompson}
   \]
   Substituting the number of messages to Ms. Thompson:
   \[
   \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66
   \]

3. **Calculating Messages to Mr. Yu**:
   Now we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{66}{3} = 22
   \]

4. **Total Messages Delivered**:
   Now we need to find the total number of messages delivered by adding the messages delivered to both teachers:
   \[
   \text{Total Messages} = \text{Messages to Ms. Thompson} + \text{Messages to Mr. Yu}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total Messages} = 66 + 22
   \]

5. **Final Calculation**:
   Now we perform the addition:
   \[
   \text{Total Messages} = 88
   \]

Thus, the total number of messages James delivers is \( \boxed{88} \).
