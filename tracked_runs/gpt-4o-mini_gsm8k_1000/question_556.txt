Question ID: 416

Question:
A herd consists of camels and dromedaries. There are 180 heads and 304 bumps. How many dromedaries are there if camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each?


Reference Answer:
Let x be the number of camels.
Since each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.
Each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 – x = 304 humps.
x = 304 – 180
x = <<124=124>>124
So, there are 124 camels and 180 – 124 = 56 dromedaries.
#### 56

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given about the herd of camels and dromedaries.

Let's define:
- \( c \): the number of camels
- \( d \): the number of dromedaries

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Each animal has one head. Therefore, the total number of heads (180) gives us our first equation:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]

2. Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each. The total number of humps (304) gives us our second equation:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)  (Equation 2)

Next, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by solving Equation 1 for \( d \):
\[
d = 180 - c
\]

Now, we can substitute this expression for \( d \) into Equation 2:
\[
2c + (180 - c) = 304
\]

Now simplify this equation:
\[
2c + 180 - c = 304
\]
\[
c + 180 = 304
\]
\[
c = 304 - 180
\]
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we have \( c \), we can find \( d \) using Equation 1:
\[
d = 180 - c = 180 - 124 = 56
\]

Thus, the number of dromedaries \( d \) is 56.

Finally, let's summarize our findings:
- Number of camels \( c = 124 \)
- Number of dromedaries \( d = 56 \)

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\text{The number of dromedaries is } 56.
\]
