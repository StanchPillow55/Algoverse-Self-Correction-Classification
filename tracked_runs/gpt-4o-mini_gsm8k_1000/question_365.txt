Question ID: 754

Question:
Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?


Reference Answer:
She trades 27 small stickers because 30 x .9 = <<27=27>>27
She gets 9 large buttons for these because 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9
She trades 20 large stickers for large buttons because 40 x .5 = 20
She gets 20 large buttons for these because 20 / 1 = <<20/1=20>>20
She trades 50% of her large stickers for small buttons because 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50
She trades 20 large stickers for small buttons because 40 x .5 = 20
She gets 60 small buttons because 20 x 3 = <<20*3=60>>60
She has 89 buttons at the end because 9 + 20 + 60 = <<9+20+60=89>>89
#### 89

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to carefully track Lorraine's stickers and buttons through each step of her trades. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Initial Counts
- Lorraine starts with:
  - Small stickers: 30
  - Large stickers: 40

### Step 2: Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons
Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
- 90% of 30 small stickers = \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
- The value of 27 small stickers in terms of large buttons:
  - Since 1 large sticker is worth 1 large button or 3 small buttons, we can convert small stickers to large buttons:
  - 1 small sticker = 1 small button, and since 1 large button = 3 small stickers, we can say:
    - 27 small stickers = \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) large buttons.

After this trade, Lorraine's counts are:
- Small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \)
- Large stickers: 40
- Large buttons: 9

### Step 3: Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons
Next, Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
- 50% of 40 large stickers = \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
- Since 1 large sticker is worth 1 large button, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

After this trade, Lorraine's counts are:
- Small stickers: 3
- Large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)
- Large buttons: \( 9 + 20 = 29 \)

### Step 4: Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons
Lorraine trades the remaining large stickers for small buttons.
- She has 20 large stickers left, which she trades for small buttons:
- Since 1 large button is worth 3 small stickers, 20 large stickers will yield:
  - \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

After this trade, Lorraine's counts are:
- Small stickers: 3
- Large stickers: 0
- Large buttons: 29
- Small buttons: 60

### Step 5: Total Button Count
Now, we need to find the total number of buttons Lorraine has:
- Total buttons = Large buttons + Small buttons
- Total buttons = \( 29 + 60 = 89 \)

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is \( \boxed{89} \).
