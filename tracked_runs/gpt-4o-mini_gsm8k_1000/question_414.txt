Question ID: 483

Question:
Gabriel and Luri each own a portable media player that can store up to 100 songs. Gabriel has 20 songs on his player while Luri has 3 times as many songs. How many fewer songs can Luri add to his player than Gabriel can add to his?


Reference Answer:
Gabriel can still store 100 - 20 = <<100-20=80>>80 songs.
Luri has 20 x 3 = <<20*3=60>>60 songs stored in his player.
Thus, Luri can still store 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40 songs.
Luri can add 80 - 40 = <<80-40=40>>40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel.
#### 40

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many songs each person can still add to their portable media players and then find the difference between those two amounts.

1. **Determine the number of songs Luri has:**
   - Gabriel has 20 songs.
   - Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel.
   \[
   \text{Luri's songs} = 3 \times \text{Gabriel's songs} = 3 \times 20 = 60
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining capacity for each player:**
   - The maximum capacity for both players is 100 songs.
   - For Gabriel:
   \[
   \text{Songs Gabriel can add} = \text{Max capacity} - \text{Gabriel's songs} = 100 - 20 = 80
   \]
   - For Luri:
   \[
   \text{Songs Luri can add} = \text{Max capacity} - \text{Luri's songs} = 100 - 60 = 40
   \]

3. **Find the difference in the number of songs they can add:**
   - We need to find how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Songs Gabriel can add} - \text{Songs Luri can add} = 80 - 40 = 40
   \]

Thus, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.

**Final Answer: 40**
