Question ID: 170

Question:
The marching band is ordering new uniforms. Each uniform comes with a hat that costs $25, a jacket that costs three times as much as the hat, and pants that cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. How much does each uniform cost total?


Reference Answer:
First find the cost of the jacket: $25 * 3 = $<<25*3=75>>75
Then add the cost of the jacket and hat: $25 + $75 = $<<25+75=100>>100
Then divide that amount by 2 to find the average cost, which is the cost of the pants: $100 / 2 = $<<100/2=50>>50
Then add the cost of each item of clothing to find the total cost of the uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $<<25+75+50=150>>150

Response:
To determine the total cost of each uniform, we will break down the costs of each component: the hat, the jacket, and the pants.

1. **Cost of the Hat**:
   The cost of the hat is given as:
   \[
   \text{Cost of Hat} = 25 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of the Jacket**:
   The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. Therefore, we calculate the cost of the jacket as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost of Jacket} = 3 \times \text{Cost of Hat} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of the Pants**:
   The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. First, we need to find the average of the two costs:
   \[
   \text{Average Cost} = \frac{\text{Cost of Hat} + \text{Cost of Jacket}}{2}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Average Cost} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Therefore, the cost of the pants is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of Pants} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Cost of the Uniform**:
   Now, we can find the total cost of the uniform by adding the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Hat} + \text{Cost of Jacket} + \text{Cost of Pants}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost of each uniform is:
\[
\boxed{150} \text{ dollars}
\]
