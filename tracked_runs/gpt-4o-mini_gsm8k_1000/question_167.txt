Question ID: 147

Question:
Debra is monitoring a beehive to see how many bees come and go in a day. She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours. She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours. Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?


Reference Answer:
Debra first sees 30 bees leave the hive, then sees 1/2 that many return, 30 x 1/2 = <<30*1/2=15>>15 bees that return and 15 bees that are still away from the hive.
Debra sees twice as many bees as first left the hive--which was 30--fly from the hive in the next 6 hours, 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 bees that leave the hive.
In total, 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 bees left the hive.
There were 90 bees total that left the hive - 15 bees that already returned = <<90-15=75>>75 bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down into parts and keep track of the number of bees leaving and returning to the hive at each stage.

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees **30 bees** leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours (6 to 12 hours):**
   - She sees **1/2** of the bees that left return. 
   - Since 30 bees left, the number of bees returning is:
     \[
     \text{Bees returning} = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ bees}
     \]

3. **Next 6 hours (12 to 18 hours):**
   - Debra sees **two times** as many bees leave as the first group that left.
   - Since 30 bees left initially, the number of bees leaving now is:
     \[
     \text{Bees leaving} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees}
     \]

4. **Last 6 hours (18 to 24 hours):**
   - Every bee that left before this period and hadn't already returned will return to the hive.
   - The bees that left before this period are:
     - 30 bees that left in the first 6 hours.
     - 60 bees that left in the third 6-hour period.
   - The total number of bees that left before this period is:
     \[
     \text{Total bees left} = 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ bees}
     \]
   - Out of these, 15 bees returned in the second 6-hour period. Therefore, the number of bees that hadn't returned yet is:
     \[
     \text{Bees that hadn't returned} = 90 - 15 = 75 \text{ bees}
     \]
   - These 75 bees will return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The total number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is **75 bees**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{75}
\]
