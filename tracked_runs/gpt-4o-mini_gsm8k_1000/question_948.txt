Question ID: 935

Question:
Fern is trying to decide between buying the Widgeteer 3000, which makes 60 widgets an hour, and the WidgetMaster 9000, which makes 45 widgets an hour. Each widget sells for $6. How much more money will Fern make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000 if it runs 24 hours a day for a month with 30 days?


Reference Answer:
First find how many more widgets the Widgeteer 3000 makes per hour: 60 widgets/hour - 45 widgets/hour = <<60-45=15>>15 widgets/hour
Then multiply that difference by the number of hours in a day to find the daily difference: 15 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = <<360=360>>360 widgets/day
Then multiply the daily difference by the number of days in a month to find the monthly difference: 360 widgets/day * 30 days/month = <<360*30=10800>>10,800 widgets/month
Then multiply that number by the cost per widget to find the total earnings difference: 10,800 widgets/month * $6/widget = $<<10800*6=64800>>64,800

Response:
To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.**
2. **Calculate the total revenue generated from selling those widgets.**
3. **Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of widgets produced

**For the Widgeteer 3000:**
- Production rate: 60 widgets per hour
- Hours per day: 24
- Days in a month: 30

Total widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
\[
\text{Total widgets} = \text{Production rate} \times \text{Hours per day} \times \text{Days in a month}
\]
\[
\text{Total widgets} = 60 \, \text{widgets/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days}
\]
Calculating this:
\[
\text{Total widgets} = 60 \times 24 = 1440 \, \text{widgets/day}
\]
\[
\text{Total widgets} = 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \, \text{widgets}
\]

**For the WidgetMaster 9000:**
- Production rate: 45 widgets per hour

Total widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
\[
\text{Total widgets} = 45 \, \text{widgets/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days}
\]
Calculating this:
\[
\text{Total widgets} = 45 \times 24 = 1080 \, \text{widgets/day}
\]
\[
\text{Total widgets} = 1080 \times 30 = 32400 \, \text{widgets}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue generated

**For the Widgeteer 3000:**
- Selling price per widget: $6

Total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000:
\[
\text{Total revenue} = \text{Total widgets} \times \text{Selling price}
\]
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 43200 \, \text{widgets} \times 6 \, \text{dollars/widget}
\]
Calculating this:
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 259200 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**For the WidgetMaster 9000:**
Total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 32400 \, \text{widgets} \times 6 \, \text{dollars/widget}
\]
Calculating this:
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 194400 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Find the difference in revenue

Now we will find the difference in revenue between the two machines:
\[
\text{Difference in revenue} = \text{Revenue from Widgeteer 3000} - \text{Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000}
\]
\[
\text{Difference in revenue} = 259200 \, \text{dollars} - 194400 \, \text{dollars}
\]
Calculating this:
\[
\text{Difference in revenue} = 64800 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Fern will make **$64,800** more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 if it runs 24 hours a day for a month with 30 days.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of widgets produced

**For the Widgeteer 3000:**
- Production rate: 60 widgets per hour
- Hours per day: 24
- Days in a month: 30

Total widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
\[
\text{Total widgets} = \text{Production rate} \times \text{Hours per day} \times \text{Days in a month}
\]
\[
\text{Total widgets} = 60 \, \text{widgets/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days}
\]
\[
\text{Total widgets} = 60 \times 24 \times 30 = 43,200 \, \text{widgets}
\]

**For the WidgetMaster 9000:**
- Production rate: 45 widgets per hour

Total widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
\[
\text{Total widgets} = 45 \, \text{widgets/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days}
\]
\[
\text{Total widgets} = 45 \times 24 \times 30 = 32,400 \, \text{widgets}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue generated

**Revenue from the Widgeteer 3000:**
- Selling price per widget: $6

Total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000:
\[
\text{Revenue} = \text{Total widgets} \times \text{Selling price}
\]
\[
\text{Revenue} = 43,200 \, \text{widgets} \times 6 \, \text{dollars/widget} = 259,200 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000:**
Total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[
\text{Revenue} = 32,400 \, \text{widgets} \times 6 \, \text{dollars/widget} = 194,400 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Find the difference in revenue

Difference in revenue between the two machines:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Revenue from Widgeteer 3000} - \text{Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 259,200 \, \text{dollars} - 194,400 \, \text{dollars} = 64,800 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Fern will make **$64,800** more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 if it runs 24 hours a day for a month with 30 days.
