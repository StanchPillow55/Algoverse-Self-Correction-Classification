Question ID: 954

Question:
Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. If he has two dozen cups and gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons for his birthday, calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining.


Reference Answer:
A dozen measuring cups are 12, and if Jonathan has two dozens, he has 2*12 = 24 cups.
Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, so he has 2/3*24 = <<2/3*24=16>>16 measuring spoons.
When he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he remains with 16-6 = <<16-6=10>>10 measuring spoons.
He now has a total of 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = <<10+24=34>>34 utensils
#### 34

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has.**
   Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups. Since one dozen equals 12, we can calculate the total number of cups:
   \[
   \text{Number of cups} = 2 \times 12 = 24
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has.**
   According to the problem, Jonathan has \( \frac{2}{3} \) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. We can find the number of measuring spoons by multiplying the number of cups by \( \frac{2}{3} \):
   \[
   \text{Number of spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Number of cups} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24
   \]
   To calculate this, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16
   \]
   So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.

3. **Determine the number of measuring spoons after gifting some to Pedro.**
   Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. We need to subtract the number of spoons gifted from the total number of spoons Jonathan has:
   \[
   \text{Remaining spoons} = \text{Total spoons} - \text{Spoons gifted} = 16 - 6 = 10
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining.**
   The total number of utensils is the sum of the remaining measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:
   \[
   \text{Total utensils remaining} = \text{Remaining cups} + \text{Remaining spoons} = 24 + 10 = 34
   \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:
\[
\boxed{34}
\]
