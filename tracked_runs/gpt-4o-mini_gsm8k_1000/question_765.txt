Question ID: 1245

Question:
Mary is making ice cubes with fruit frozen in them for a cocktail party. She makes some strawberry cubes, and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes total, how many blueberry cubes does she make?


Reference Answer:
Let s be the number of strawberry cubes and b be the number of blueberry cubes. We know that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116.
Substituting the first equation into the second, we get s + 5s - 4 = 116.
Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116
Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120
Dividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20
Substituting this value back into the equation b = 5s - 4, we get b = 96
#### 96

Response:
Let \( s \) represent the number of strawberry cubes that Mary makes. According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes \( b \) is given by the equation:

\[
b = 5s - 4
\]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes (both strawberry and blueberry) is 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
s + b = 116
\]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[
s + (5s - 4) = 116
\]

Next, we simplify the equation:

\[
s + 5s - 4 = 116
\]

Combining like terms gives:

\[
6s - 4 = 116
\]

Now, we will isolate \( s \) by first adding 4 to both sides:

\[
6s = 116 + 4
\]
\[
6s = 120
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( s \):

\[
s = \frac{120}{6} = 20
\]

Now that we have the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes using the equation for \( b \):

\[
b = 5s - 4
\]
\[
b = 5(20) - 4
\]
\[
b = 100 - 4
\]
\[
b = 96
\]

Thus, the number of blueberry cubes that Mary makes is 

\[
\boxed{96}
\]
