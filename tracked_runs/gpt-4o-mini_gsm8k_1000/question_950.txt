Question ID: 909

Question:
Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. If Duncan's age is 60 now, how old will Adam be in 8 years?


Reference Answer:
Eight years ago, Duncan was 60-8 = 52 years old, the same as Adam's age four years ago.
Therefore, four years ago, Adam's age was 52/2 =<<52/2=26>>26 years.
Currently, Adam is 26+4 = <<26+4=30>>30 years old.
In 8 years from now, Adam will be 30+8 = <<30+8=38>>38 years old.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will first establish the ages of Duncan and Adam based on the information provided.

1. **Identify Duncan's current age**:
   - Duncan's current age is given as 60 years.

2. **Calculate Duncan's age eight years ago**:
   - Eight years ago, Duncan's age was:
     \[
     60 - 8 = 52 \text{ years}
     \]

3. **Set up the relationship with Adam's age**:
   - We know from the problem that Duncan's age eight years ago (52 years) was two times Adam's age four years ago. Let's denote Adam's current age as \( A \).
   - Four years ago, Adam's age would be:
     \[
     A - 4
     \]
   - According to the problem, we have the equation:
     \[
     52 = 2 \times (A - 4)
     \]

4. **Solve for Adam's current age \( A \)**:
   - First, we simplify the equation:
     \[
     52 = 2A - 8
     \]
   - Next, we add 8 to both sides:
     \[
     52 + 8 = 2A
     \]
     \[
     60 = 2A
     \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     A = \frac{60}{2} = 30
     \]

5. **Determine Adam's age in 8 years**:
   - Adam's current age is 30 years. To find out how old he will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
     \[
     30 + 8 = 38
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Adam will be **38 years old** in 8 years.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{38}
\]
