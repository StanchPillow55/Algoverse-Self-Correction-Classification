Question ID: 417

Question:
Tom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day, and over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all. During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?


Reference Answer:
In the first four days, Tom made 4 * 200 = <<4*200=800>>800 kilometers.
For the next two days, he made only 30/100 * 800 = <<30/100*800=240>>240 kilometers.
During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day, which means 7 * 300 = <<7*300=2100>>2100 kilometers during the whole week.
During his whole trip, Tom made 800 + 240 + 2100 = <<800+240+2100=3140>>3140 kilometers.

Response:
To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip, we will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days
Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for the first 4 days. We can calculate the total distance for these days as follows:

\[
\text{Distance for first 4 days} = 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the next 2 days
In the next 2 days, Tom traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. First, we need to find 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days:

\[
30\% \text{ of } 800 \text{ km} = 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km}
\]

Since this distance is for 2 days, we can assume he traveled this distance over those 2 days. 

### Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled on the next day (Day 7)
On the next day (Day 7), Tom wasn't traveling at all, so the distance for that day is:

\[
\text{Distance on Day 7} = 0 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the second week
During the second week (Days 8 to 14), Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in the second week, so we calculate the total distance for these days:

\[
\text{Distance for second week} = 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total distance for the entire trip
Now we can sum up all the distances traveled during the trip:

1. Distance for the first 4 days: 800 km
2. Distance for the next 2 days: 240 km
3. Distance for Day 7: 0 km
4. Distance for the second week: 2100 km

Adding these together gives:

\[
\text{Total distance} = 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}
\]

### Final Answer
The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

\[
\boxed{3140 \text{ km}}
\]
