Question ID: 146

Question:
Johnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.  He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, and another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces.  How many blocks does Johnny pick up if he picks up all the legos?


Reference Answer:
The first set had 500 pieces, and the second set had 3 times as many as the first set, so the second set has 500*3=<<500*3=1500>>1500 pieces
The third set had one-quarter of the 500 pieces, so that means it had 500*.25= <<500*.25=125>>125 pieces
In total, that means Johnny picked up 500 + 1500+ 125= <<500+1500+125=2125>>2125 blocks
#### 2,125

Response:
To find out how many blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the total number of pieces from all the lego boxed sets he has.

1. **Identify the number of pieces in each set:**
   - The first set has **500 pieces**.
   - The second set has **3 times more pieces** than the first set. So, we calculate:
     \[
     3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ pieces}
     \]
   - The third set has **1/4 the number of pieces** of the first set. So, we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125 \text{ pieces}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of pieces:**
   Now, we add the number of pieces from all three sets together:
   \[
   500 + 1500 + 125
   \]

   Let's perform the addition step by step:
   - First, add the first two sets:
     \[
     500 + 1500 = 2000
     \]
   - Now, add the third set:
     \[
     2000 + 125 = 2125
     \]

3. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of blocks Johnny picks up is:
   \[
   \boxed{2125}
   \]
