Question ID: 385

Question:
Lisa is part of a choir that has 52 members, 50% of which are boys and 50% of which are girls.  The choir decides to perform with just its female members.  On the day of the performance, however, half the people performing can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down.  The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. How many people sang in the performance?


Reference Answer:
The 50 person choir is 50% female, so if the performance is just women there will be 52/2=26 people performing.
If half of those people can't make it to the performance, then there will be 26/2= <<26/2=13>>13 people performing.
When the 3 teachers decide to participate, the performance now has 13+3=<<13+3=16>>16 people singing.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of girls in the choir:**
   The choir has a total of 52 members, and it is stated that 50% of the members are girls. 

   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \text{ of } 52 = \frac{50}{100} \times 52 = 26
   \]

   So, there are 26 girls in the choir.

2. **Determine the number of girls who can perform:**
   On the day of the performance, it is mentioned that half of the girls cannot make it to the show because their bus breaks down. 

   \[
   \text{Number of girls who can't make it} = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13
   \]

   Therefore, the number of girls who can perform is:

   \[
   \text{Number of girls who can perform} = 26 - 13 = 13
   \]

3. **Include the teachers in the performance:**
   The problem states that the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with the girls who can perform. 

   \[
   \text{Total performers} = \text{Number of girls who can perform} + \text{Number of teachers} = 13 + 3 = 16
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Thus, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

   \[
   \boxed{16}
   \]
