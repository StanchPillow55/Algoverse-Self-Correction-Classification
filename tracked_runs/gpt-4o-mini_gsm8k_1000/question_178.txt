Question ID: 478

Question:
A company decided to take its employees on a tour to explore an ancient site. The employees were divided into 3 groups of 200 employees. Each group was assigned 7 tour guides. How many is the total number of people going on this tour?


Reference Answer:
The number of employees is 3 groups * 200 employees/group = <<3*200=600>>600 employees.
The number of tour guides is 3 groups * 7 guides/group = <<3*7=21>>21 guides.
The total number of people going on this tour is 600 employees + 21 guides = <<600+21=621>>621 people.
#### 621

Response:
To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides, and then sum these two amounts.

1. **Calculate the total number of employees:**
   - The company has divided its employees into 3 groups.
   - Each group consists of 200 employees.
   - Therefore, the total number of employees can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total Employees} = \text{Number of Groups} \times \text{Employees per Group}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Employees} = 3 \times 200 = 600
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of tour guides:**
   - Each group is assigned 7 tour guides.
   - Since there are 3 groups, the total number of tour guides can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total Tour Guides} = \text{Number of Groups} \times \text{Tour Guides per Group}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Tour Guides} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of people going on the tour:**
   - Now, we need to add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour:

   \[
   \text{Total People} = \text{Total Employees} + \text{Total Tour Guides}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total People} = 600 + 21 = 621
   \]

Thus, the total number of people going on the tour is **621**.

Final Answer: **621**
