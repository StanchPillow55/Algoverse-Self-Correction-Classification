Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of bucks:**
   We know that there are 50 deer in total and that 50 percent of them are bucks. 

   \[
   \text{Number of bucks} = 50 \times 0.50 = 25
   \]

2. **Determine the number of 8 point bucks:**
   Next, we know that 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points. We have already calculated that there are 25 bucks.

   \[
   \text{Number of 8 point bucks} = 25 \times 0.20 = 5
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the number of 8 point bucks is:

   \[
   \boxed{5}
   \] 

This means there are 5 bucks in the field that have 8 points.
