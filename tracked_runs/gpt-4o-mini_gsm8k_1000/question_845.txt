Question ID: 712

Question:
Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. How much more candy does Amy have after two weeks?


Reference Answer:
First find the the difference in the number of pieces of candy the two people each per day: 4 pieces/day - 3 pieces/day = <<4-3=1>>1 piece/day
Then find the number of days in 2 weeks: 2 weeks * 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14 days
Then multiply the difference per day by the number of days to find the total difference after 14 days: 1 piece/day * 14 days = <<1*14=14>>14 pieces
#### 14

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much candy Ginger and Amy each have after two weeks, and then find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days in two weeks.**
Two weeks consist of:
\[
2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks.**
Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day. Therefore, in 14 days, she will eat:
\[
4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate how much candy Ginger has left after two weeks.**
Ginger starts with 100 pieces of candy. After eating 56 pieces, the amount of candy she has left is:
\[
100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate how much candy Amy eats in two weeks.**
Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day. Therefore, in 14 days, she will eat:
\[
3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate how much candy Amy has left after two weeks.**
Amy starts with 100 pieces of candy. After eating 42 pieces, the amount of candy she has left is:
\[
100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Step 6: Determine how much more candy Amy has than Ginger.**
Now we need to find the difference in the amount of candy they have:
\[
58 \text{ pieces (Amy)} - 44 \text{ pieces (Ginger)} = 14 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Final Answer:**
Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]
