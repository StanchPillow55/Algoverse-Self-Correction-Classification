Question ID: 1316

Question:
Mark's car breaks down and he needs to get a new radiator.  The cost for a new radiator is $400 but he goes to get it at a junk shop and gets it for 80% off.  He then hires a mechanic to install it and it takes 3 hours at $50 an hour.  How much did he pay?


Reference Answer:
The discount on the radiator was 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320
So he paid 400-320=$<<400-320=80>>80
The mechanic charges 3*50=$<<3*50=150>>150
So in total he paid 80+150=$<<80+150=230>>230
#### 230

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost Mark incurs for the new radiator and the installation by the mechanic. We will break this down into two parts: the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the radiator

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off. To find out how much he pays for the radiator after the discount, we first need to calculate the amount of the discount.

1. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   \[
   \text{Discount} = \text{Original Price} \times \text{Discount Rate}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 400 \times 0.80 = 320
   \]

2. **Calculate the price after the discount:**
   \[
   \text{Price After Discount} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price After Discount} = 400 - 320 = 80
   \]

So, Mark pays **$80** for the radiator.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor

Mark hires a mechanic who charges $50 per hour, and the installation takes 3 hours. We can calculate the total labor cost as follows:

1. **Calculate the total labor cost:**
   \[
   \text{Labor Cost} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Number of Hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Labor Cost} = 50 \times 3 = 150
   \]

So, the mechanic's labor costs **$150**.

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost

Now, we can find the total amount Mark pays by adding the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor:

1. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Radiator} + \text{Labor Cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 80 + 150 = 230
   \]

### Final Answer

Mark pays a total of **$230** for the new radiator and its installation.
