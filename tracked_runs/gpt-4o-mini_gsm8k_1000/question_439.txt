Question ID: 837

Question:
Erika is saving for a new laptop. The laptop she wants costs $600. The sales assistant told her that if she traded in her old laptop, the price of the new one would be reduced by $200. She thinks this is a good deal and agrees to do it. She already has some savings in her purse, and has also been paid $150 this week for her part-time job. Her mom agrees to give her $80 to help her. If Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?


Reference Answer:
Selling the old laptop reduced the cost of the new laptop to $600 – $200 = $<<600-200=400>>400 dollars.
We know she doesn't have all the money yet, so she actually has $400 – $50 = $<<400-50=350>>350 dollars.
Some of this money came from her mom, so the money she had herself was $350 – $80 = $<<350-80=270>>270.
Subtracting her part-time wages shows that she had $270 – $150 = $<<270-150=120>>120 in her purse.
#### 120

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Erika has in her purse based on the information provided.

1. **Cost of the Laptop**: The original cost of the laptop is $600. However, with the trade-in of her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200.
   \[
   \text{Reduced Price} = 600 - 200 = 400
   \]

2. **Total Money Erika Has**: We need to calculate how much money Erika currently has, including her savings, her earnings from her job, and the money her mom is giving her.

   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money Erika has in her purse.
   - She has earned $150 from her part-time job.
   - Her mom is giving her $80.

   Therefore, the total amount of money Erika has is:
   \[
   \text{Total Money} = x + 150 + 80 = x + 230
   \]

3. **Amount Needed**: We know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop. This means that the total money she has must be equal to the reduced price of the laptop minus the extra amount she needs.
   \[
   x + 230 = 400 - 50
   \]
   Simplifying the right side:
   \[
   400 - 50 = 350
   \]
   So we have:
   \[
   x + 230 = 350
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**: To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we can isolate \( x \) by subtracting 230 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 350 - 230
   \]
   \[
   x = 120
   \]

Thus, Erika has **$120** in her purse.

**Final Answer**: Erika has $120 in her purse.
