Question ID: 198

Question:
Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?


Reference Answer:
In the first month, Elaine collected 3*20= <<3*20=60>>60 pokemon cards.
In the second month, she collected 60-20 = <<60-20=40>>40 cards.
After the two months, the new pokemon cards she'd collected is 40+60 = <<40+60=100>>100
The number of cards in the third month is twice the combined number in the first and second month, which totals 2*100 = <<2*100=200>>200 pokemon cards.
In total, Elaine has 20 cards she initially had+100 cards collected in the first and second month +200 cards collected in the third month = <<20+100+200=320>>320 cards
#### 320

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of Pokémon cards Elaine has after each month.

1. **Initial Number of Cards**: 
   Elaine starts with 20 Pokémon cards.

2. **First Month**: 
   In the first month, she collects three times the number of cards she initially had. 
   \[
   \text{Cards collected in the first month} = 3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   Now, we calculate the total number of cards after the first month:
   \[
   \text{Total after first month} = 20 + 60 = 80
   \]

3. **Second Month**: 
   In the second month, she collects 20 fewer cards than she collected in the first month. 
   \[
   \text{Cards collected in the second month} = 60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   Now, we calculate the total number of cards after the second month:
   \[
   \text{Total after second month} = 80 + 40 = 120
   \]

4. **Third Month**: 
   In the third month, she collects twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months. 
   First, we need to find the total number of cards collected in the first and second months:
   \[
   \text{Total collected in first and second months} = 60 + 40 = 100
   \]
   Now, we calculate the number of cards collected in the third month:
   \[
   \text{Cards collected in the third month} = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]
   Finally, we calculate the total number of cards after the third month:
   \[
   \text{Total after third month} = 120 + 200 = 320
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: 
   Therefore, the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now is 
   \[
   \boxed{320}
   \]
