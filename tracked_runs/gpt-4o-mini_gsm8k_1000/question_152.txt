Question ID: 50

Question:
Lloyd has an egg farm. His chickens produce 252 eggs per day and he sells them for $2 per dozen. How much does Lloyd make on eggs per week?


Reference Answer:
In a week, Lloyd's egg farm produces 252 x 7 = <<252*7=1764>>1764 eggs.
There are 1764/12 = <<1764/12=147>>147 dozens of eggs produced in a week.
So, Lloyd makes 147 x $2 = $<<147*2=294>>294 on eggs.
#### 294

Response:
To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we can break the problem down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can find the number of dozens by dividing the total number of eggs by 12:

\[
\text{Number of dozens} = \frac{\text{Total eggs}}{12} = \frac{252}{12}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{252}{12} = 21 \text{ dozens}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the daily income from selling eggs.

Lloyd sells each dozen of eggs for $2. To find out how much he makes in a day from selling the eggs, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:

\[
\text{Daily income} = \text{Number of dozens} \times \text{Price per dozen} = 21 \times 2
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the weekly income from selling eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the weekly income by multiplying the daily income by 7:

\[
\text{Weekly income} = \text{Daily income} \times 7 = 42 \times 7
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
42 \times 7 = 294 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, Lloyd makes **$294** on eggs per week.

Response:
To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of eggs produced per week**:
   - Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of eggs produced in a week is:
     \[
     \text{Total eggs per week} = \text{Eggs per day} \times \text{Days per week} = 252 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total eggs per week} = 252 \times 7 = 1764 \, \text{eggs}
     \]

2. **Convert the total number of eggs to dozens**:
   - Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
     \[
     \text{Total dozens} = \frac{\text{Total eggs}}{12} = \frac{1764 \, \text{eggs}}{12}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total dozens} = 147 \, \text{dozens}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs**:
   - Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling the eggs in a week is:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = \text{Total dozens} \times \text{Price per dozen} = 147 \, \text{dozens} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/dozen}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = 294 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Lloyd makes a total of $294 from selling eggs per week.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{294}
\]
