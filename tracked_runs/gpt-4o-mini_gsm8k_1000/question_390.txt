Question ID: 353

Question:
John decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each.  This was 30% of the time he spent.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?


Reference Answer:
He spent 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours swimming
He spent 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 hours watching shows
So he spent 6+3+6=<<6+3+6=15>>15 hours on these activities
That means he spent 15/.3=<<15/.3=50>>50 hours on activities
So he spent 50*.4=<<50*.4=20>>20 hours sightseeing

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much time John spent sightseeing based on the information given.

1. **Calculate the time spent on boating and swimming:**
   - John spends 6 hours boating.
   - He spends half that time swimming, which is:
     \[
     \text{Time swimming} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time spent watching shows:**
   - John watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours. Therefore, the total time spent watching shows is:
     \[
     \text{Time watching shows} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent on activities:**
   - Now, we can find the total time spent on all activities (boating, swimming, and watching shows):
     \[
     \text{Total time spent} = \text{Time boating} + \text{Time swimming} + \text{Time watching shows}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time spent} = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the total time spent on all activities:**
   - We know that the time spent watching shows (6 hours) is 30% of the total time spent. We can set up the equation:
     \[
     0.30 \times \text{Total time} = 6
     \]
   - To find the total time, we can rearrange the equation:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \frac{6}{0.30} = 20 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the time spent sightseeing:**
   - We know that John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time sightseeing} = 0.40 \times \text{Total time}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Time sightseeing} = 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ hours}
     \]

Finally, we conclude that John spent **8 hours** sightseeing.

**Final Answer: 8 hours**

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the total time John spent on his vacation and then calculate how much time he spent sightseeing based on the information provided.

1. **Calculate time spent on boating and swimming:**
   - John spends 6 hours boating.
   - He spends half that time swimming, which is:
     \[
     \text{Swimming time} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate total time spent on boating and swimming:**
   - Total time for boating and swimming is:
     \[
     \text{Total boating and swimming time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate time spent watching shows:**
   - John watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours:
     \[
     \text{Total show time} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate total time spent on activities:**
   - The total time spent on activities (boating, swimming, and watching shows) is:
     \[
     \text{Total activity time} = 9 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Determine total vacation time based on the percentage of time spent:**
   - We know that the time spent on activities (15 hours) is 30% of the total time John spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. We can set up the equation:
     \[
     0.30T = 15 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.30:
     \[
     T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Calculate time spent sightseeing:**
   - John spent 40% of his total vacation time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
     \[
     \text{Sightseeing time} = 0.40 \times T = 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours}
     \]

Finally, the amount of time John spent sightseeing is:
\[
\boxed{20 \text{ hours}}
\]
