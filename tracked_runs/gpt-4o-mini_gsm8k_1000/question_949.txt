Question ID: 1017

Question:
Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook.  She put the same number of the pics into 8 albums.  3 of the albums were selfies only and 2 of the albums were portraits.  How many portraits and selfies did she have?


Reference Answer:
Olivia had 72 pictures / 8 albums = <<72/8=9>>9 picture per album.
Olivia had 3 selfie albums * 9 pictures = <<3*9=27>>27 pictures.
Olivia had 2 portrait albums * 9 pictures = <<2*9=18>>18 pictures.
The total of portraits and selfies for Olivia is 27 + 18 = <<27+18=45>>45 pictures.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put in each album and then identify how many of those were selfies and how many were portraits.

1. **Total Pictures and Albums**: 
   Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures and divided them into 8 albums. 

2. **Pictures per Album**: 
   To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:
   \[
   \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{\text{Total pictures}}{\text{Number of albums}} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
   \]
   This means each album contains 9 pictures.

3. **Types of Albums**: 
   According to the problem, 3 of the albums are selfies only, and 2 of the albums are portraits. The remaining albums (8 total - 3 selfies - 2 portraits = 3 albums) are unspecified in type.

4. **Calculating Selfies**: 
   Since each of the 3 selfie albums contains 9 pictures, the total number of selfies is:
   \[
   \text{Total selfies} = 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ selfies}
   \]

5. **Calculating Portraits**: 
   Similarly, for the 2 portrait albums:
   \[
   \text{Total portraits} = 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \text{ portraits}
   \]

6. **Calculating Remaining Albums**: 
   The remaining 3 albums (which are unspecified) also contain 9 pictures each:
   \[
   \text{Total pictures in remaining albums} = 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ pictures}
   \]
   These 27 pictures could be of any type (not specified in the problem).

7. **Final Counts**: 
   Now we summarize:
   - Total selfies = 27
   - Total portraits = 18
   - Pictures in unspecified albums = 27

8. **Final Answer**: 
   Therefore, Olivia has **27 selfies** and **18 portraits**.

In conclusion, the final answer is:
- **Selfies: 27**
- **Portraits: 18**

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded, given that she uploaded a total of 72 pictures and organized them into 8 albums.

### Step 1: Determine the number of pictures per album
Since Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and divided them equally into 8 albums, we can find the number of pictures in each album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[
\text{Pictures per album} = \frac{\text{Total pictures}}{\text{Number of albums}} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
\]

### Step 2: Identify the types of albums
According to the problem:
- 3 of the albums are selfies only.
- 2 of the albums are portraits only.
- The remaining albums (8 - 3 - 2 = 3 albums) are unspecified in the problem, but we can assume they contain a mix of selfies and portraits.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of selfies and portraits in the specified albums
Since each album contains 9 pictures, we can calculate the total number of pictures in the selfies and portraits albums:

1. **Selfies**:
   - Number of selfies albums = 3
   - Pictures in selfies albums = 3 albums × 9 pictures/album = 27 selfies

2. **Portraits**:
   - Number of portraits albums = 2
   - Pictures in portraits albums = 2 albums × 9 pictures/album = 18 portraits

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of pictures in the unspecified albums
Now we can calculate how many pictures are left for the remaining 3 albums:

\[
\text{Total selfies and portraits} = 27 \text{ (selfies)} + 18 \text{ (portraits)} = 45
\]

\[
\text{Pictures in unspecified albums} = \text{Total pictures} - \text{Total selfies and portraits} = 72 - 45 = 27
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion
We have determined the following:
- Olivia has **27 selfies**.
- Olivia has **18 portraits**.
- The remaining **27 pictures** are in the unspecified albums.

Thus, the final answer is:

- **Number of selfies: 27**
- **Number of portraits: 18**

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia uploaded into each type of album: selfies and portraits. 

1. **Determine the number of pictures per album**:
   Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures and divided them equally into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

   \[
   \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{\text{Total pictures}}{\text{Number of albums}} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
   \]

   So, each album contains 9 pictures.

2. **Identify the types of albums**:
   According to the problem, Olivia has:
   - 3 albums that contain only selfies
   - 2 albums that contain only portraits
   - The remaining albums (8 total - 3 selfies - 2 portraits = 3 albums) could potentially contain a mix of selfies and portraits, but we need to clarify that first.

3. **Calculate the total number of pictures in selfies and portraits**:
   Since we know that each album has 9 pictures, we can calculate the total number of pictures in the albums that are specifically selfies and portraits.

   - **Selfies**: 
     \[
     \text{Total selfies} = \text{Number of selfie albums} \times \text{Pictures per album} = 3 \times 9 = 27
     \]

   - **Portraits**:
     \[
     \text{Total portraits} = \text{Number of portrait albums} \times \text{Pictures per album} = 2 \times 9 = 18
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pictures accounted for**:
   Now, we add the total number of selfies and portraits:
   \[
   \text{Total selfies and portraits} = \text{Total selfies} + \text{Total portraits} = 27 + 18 = 45
   \]

5. **Determine the remaining pictures**:
   Since Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures, we can find out how many pictures are left after accounting for the selfies and portraits:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pictures} = \text{Total pictures} - \text{Total selfies and portraits} = 72 - 45 = 27
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   The remaining 27 pictures could be in the other 3 albums, but since the problem does not specify how these remaining pictures are categorized, we can conclude that Olivia has:
   - **27 selfies** in the selfie albums,
   - **18 portraits** in the portrait albums,
   - **27 pictures** in the remaining albums (which could be a mix of selfies and portraits).

Thus, the final answer is:
- **Selfies**: 27
- **Portraits**: 18

Final answer:
- Olivia has 27 selfies and 18 portraits.
