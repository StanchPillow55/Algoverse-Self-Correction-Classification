Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Gerald's total earnings for the week.**
2. **Determine how much he spent.**
3. **Calculate how much he has left after his spending.**

### Step 1: Calculate Gerald's total earnings for the week

Gerald earns $30 every day. Since he worked for an entire week, we need to determine how many days are in a week. There are 7 days in a week.

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Daily earnings} \times \text{Number of days}
\]
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 30 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 210 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much he spent

According to the problem, Gerald spent a total of $100.

### Step 3: Calculate how much he has left after his spending

To find out how much money Gerald has left, we subtract his total spending from his total earnings.

\[
\text{Amount left} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Total spending}
\]
\[
\text{Amount left} = 210 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 110 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Gerald has **$110** left after his spending.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Gerald has left after working for a week and spending some of his earnings.

1. **Calculate Gerald's earnings for the week:**
   - Gerald earns $30 per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total earnings for the week = Daily earnings Ã— Number of days
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 30 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 210 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine how much he spent:**
   - Gerald spent a total of $100.

3. **Calculate how much money he has left:**
   - Money left = Total earnings - Total spent
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 210 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 110 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, after working for a week and spending $100, Gerald has **$110 left**.

**Final Answer:** $110
