Question ID: 374

Question:
Mary has 30 sheep. She gets 1 kg of milk from half of them and 2 kg of milk from the other half every day. How much milk does she collect every day?


Reference Answer:
Half of the sheep is 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15.
Mary gets (15 * 1) + (15 * 2) = <<15*1+15*2=45>>45 kg of milk every day.
#### 45

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much milk Mary collects from her 30 sheep each day.

1. **Identify the number of sheep in each group**:
   - Mary has a total of 30 sheep.
   - According to the problem, half of the sheep produce 1 kg of milk each day, and the other half produce 2 kg of milk each day.
   - Since half of 30 is 15, we can conclude that:
     - 15 sheep produce 1 kg of milk each.
     - 15 sheep produce 2 kg of milk each.

2. **Calculate the total milk from the first group of sheep**:
   - For the 15 sheep that produce 1 kg of milk each:
     \[
     \text{Total milk from first group} = 15 \text{ sheep} \times 1 \text{ kg/sheep} = 15 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total milk from the second group of sheep**:
   - For the 15 sheep that produce 2 kg of milk each:
     \[
     \text{Total milk from second group} = 15 \text{ sheep} \times 2 \text{ kg/sheep} = 30 \text{ kg}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total milk collected each day**:
   - Now, we add the total milk from both groups:
     \[
     \text{Total milk collected} = \text{Total milk from first group} + \text{Total milk from second group}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total milk collected} = 15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg}
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Mary collects a total of **45 kg of milk** every day.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{45 \text{ kg}}
\]
