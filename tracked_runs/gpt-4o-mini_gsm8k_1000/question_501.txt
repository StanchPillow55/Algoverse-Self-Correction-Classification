Question ID: 206

Question:
Micheal loves riding a bike. He rode it at least 5 times a week and makes 25 kilometers each time. He did that for four weeks, and then he decided, to ride the bike only 2 times a week, but for 60 kilometers each time, and he did that for 3 weeks. How many kilometers did Micheal do in total?


Reference Answer:
In the first part, Micheal did 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 kilometers every week.
He did that for four weeks, which means he made during that time 125 * 4 = <<125*4=500>>500 kilometers.
After that, he made 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 kilometers a week.
And Micheal did that for three weeks, so he rode 120 * 3 = <<120*3=360>>360 kilometers during that time.
In total Micheal did 500 + 360 = <<500+360=860>>860 kilometers.

Response:
To find out how many kilometers Micheal rode in total, we will break the problem down into two parts: the first part where he rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks, and the second part where he rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks.

### Part 1: Riding 5 times a week for 4 weeks

1. **Calculate the total rides in 4 weeks**:
   \[
   \text{Total rides} = \text{Rides per week} \times \text{Number of weeks} = 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 20 \text{ rides}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total distance for these rides**:
   \[
   \text{Distance per ride} = 25 \text{ kilometers}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Total rides} \times \text{Distance per ride} = 20 \text{ rides} \times 25 \text{ kilometers/ride} = 500 \text{ kilometers}
   \]

### Part 2: Riding 2 times a week for 3 weeks

1. **Calculate the total rides in 3 weeks**:
   \[
   \text{Total rides} = \text{Rides per week} \times \text{Number of weeks} = 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 6 \text{ rides}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total distance for these rides**:
   \[
   \text{Distance per ride} = 60 \text{ kilometers}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Total rides} \times \text{Distance per ride} = 6 \text{ rides} \times 60 \text{ kilometers/ride} = 360 \text{ kilometers}
   \]

### Total Distance

Now, we will add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Micheal rode:

\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance from Part 1} + \text{Distance from Part 2} = 500 \text{ kilometers} + 360 \text{ kilometers} = 860 \text{ kilometers}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total distance Micheal rode in total is:
\[
\boxed{860 \text{ kilometers}}
\]
