Question ID: 1136

Question:
Bob has a certain number of marbles. If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, how many marbles will Bob have?


Reference Answer:
Let B be the number of marbles Bob starts with.
2 dozen marbles is 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 marbles.
So after receiving 2 dozen more marbles, we know B + 24 = 60.
This means B = 60 - 24 = <<60-24=36>>36.
Bob ends with 36 - 10 = <<36-10=26>>26 marbles.
#### 26

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many marbles Bob currently has.

1. **Understanding the problem**: 
   - Bob will have 60 marbles if he receives 2 dozen more marbles.
   - A dozen is equal to 12, so 2 dozen is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) marbles.

2. **Setting up the equation**:
   - Let \(x\) be the number of marbles Bob currently has.
   - According to the problem, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This can be expressed with the equation:
   \[
   x + 24 = 60
   \]

3. **Solving for \(x\)**:
   - To find \(x\), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x = 60 - 24
   \]
   \[
   x = 36
   \]
   So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

4. **Finding the number of marbles after losing 10**:
   - Now, we need to determine how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 marbles. We can calculate this by subtracting 10 from the number of marbles he currently has:
   \[
   \text{Marbles after losing 10} = x - 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Marbles after losing 10} = 36 - 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Marbles after losing 10} = 26
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, after losing 10 marbles, Bob will have **26 marbles**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{26}
\]

Response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Bob has a certain number of marbles, which we will denote as \( x \).
   - If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.
   - We need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 marbles.

2. **Convert Dozens to Individual Marbles**:
   - A dozen is 12. Therefore, 2 dozen is:
     \[
     2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ marbles}
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - According to the problem, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We can set up the equation:
     \[
     x + 24 = 60
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     x = 60 - 24
     \]
     \[
     x = 36
     \]
   - So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

5. **Calculate the Number of Marbles After Losing 10**:
   - Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 marbles:
     \[
     36 - 10 = 26
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, after losing 10 marbles, Bob will have:
     \[
     \boxed{26} \text{ marbles}
     \]

Response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Bob has a certain number of marbles, which we will denote as \( x \).
   - If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

2. **Calculating 2 Dozen**:
   - A dozen is 12, so 2 dozen is:
     \[
     2 \times 12 = 24
     \]

3. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - According to the problem, if Bob receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We can express this as:
     \[
     x + 24 = 60
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation:
     \[
     x = 60 - 24
     \]
     \[
     x = 36
     \]
   - So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

5. **Finding the Number of Marbles After Losing 10**:
   - If Bob loses 10 marbles, we calculate the new total:
     \[
     36 - 10 = 26
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, after losing 10 marbles, Bob will have:
     \[
     \boxed{26}
     \] marbles.
