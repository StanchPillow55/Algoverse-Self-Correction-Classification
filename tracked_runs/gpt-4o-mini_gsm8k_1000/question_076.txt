Question ID: 559

Question:
A stickler for health, Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. By contract, Octavia’s husband Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks. Juan’s doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. By how many cups must Juan reduce his daily coffee intake?


Reference Answer:
Since the daily recommendation is 4 cups of coffee, Octavia drinks 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 cups
Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, which translates to 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 cups
Subtracting the daily recommended amount from Juan’s current coffee intake gives 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 cups
Juan must therefore reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups
#### 16

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much coffee Juan currently drinks and how much he needs to reduce his intake to meet the doctor's recommendation.

1. **Determine Octavia's coffee intake:**
   - Let \( R \) be the daily recommended cups of coffee.
   - According to the problem, Octavia drinks half of the daily recommended amount:
     \[
     \text{Octavia's coffee intake} = \frac{R}{2}
     \]

2. **Determine Juan's coffee intake:**
   - Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks:
     \[
     \text{Juan's coffee intake} = 10 \times \text{Octavia's coffee intake} = 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R
     \]

3. **Determine the doctor's recommendation for Juan:**
   - Juan's doctor has recommended that he reduce his coffee intake to 4 cups:
     \[
     \text{Doctor's recommendation} = 4 \text{ cups}
     \]

4. **Calculate how much Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake:**
   - We need to find the difference between Juan's current intake and the recommended intake:
     \[
     \text{Reduction needed} = \text{Juan's current intake} - \text{Doctor's recommendation}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Reduction needed} = 5R - 4
     \]

5. **Determine the value of \( R \):**
   - Since we know that the doctor recommends 4 cups, we can set \( R \) equal to 4 cups (the daily recommended amount):
     \[
     R = 4
     \]

6. **Substitute \( R \) back into the reduction formula:**
   - Now we substitute \( R = 4 \) into the reduction needed:
     \[
     \text{Reduction needed} = 5(4) - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16
     \]

Thus, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by **16 cups**.

**Final Answer: 16 cups**
