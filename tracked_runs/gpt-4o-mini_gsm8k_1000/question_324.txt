Question ID: 362

Question:
Mark makes custom dog beds. A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing, a bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing, and a bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between the first two kinds of beds. How many pounds of stuffing does Mark need to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds?


Reference Answer:
First, find the total amount of stuffing in one Rottweiler bed and one chihuahua bed: 2 pounds + 8 pounds = <<2+8=10>>10 pounds
Then divide the total stuffing amount by 2 to find the average stuffing amount: 10 pounds / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 pounds
Then find the amount of stuffing in 4 chihuahua beds: 2 pounds/bed * 4 beds = <<2*4=8>>8 pounds
Then find the amount of stuffing in 3 collie beds: 5 pounds/bed * 3 beds = <<5*3=15>>15 pounds
Then add the two amounts of stuffing to find the total amount of stuffing needed: 8 pounds + 15 pounds = <<8+15=23>>23 pounds

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much stuffing Mark needs for the beds he is making. We will break this down step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed:**
   - For a Rottweiler bed, the amount of stuffing required is **8 pounds**.
   - For a Chihuahua bed, the amount of stuffing required is **2 pounds**.
   - For a Collie bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and Chihuahua beds.

   To find the average amount of stuffing for the Collie bed:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Amount for Rottweiler} + \text{Amount for Chihuahua}}{2} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

   Therefore, a Collie bed requires **5 pounds** of stuffing.

2. **Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the beds Mark is making:**
   - Mark is making **4 Chihuahua beds**. The total amount of stuffing for the Chihuahua beds is:
   \[
   \text{Stuffing for Chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
   \]

   - Mark is also making **3 Collie beds**. The total amount of stuffing for the Collie beds is:
   \[
   \text{Stuffing for Collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Add the total amounts of stuffing together:**
   To find the total amount of stuffing needed for all the beds, we add the stuffing for the Chihuahua beds and the Collie beds:
   \[
   \text{Total stuffing} = \text{Stuffing for Chihuahua beds} + \text{Stuffing for Collie beds} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs to make 4 Chihuahua beds and 3 Collie beds is **23 pounds**.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{23}
\]
