Question ID: 769

Question:
Tanya is teaching at school. She earns $15 for every hour and an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. On Monday she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours, and on Wednesday 2 classes for 2 hours. How much did Tanya earn for these two days of teaching?


Reference Answer:
Tanya worked for 5 hours + 2 hours = <<5+2=7>>7 hours.
She earned therefore 7 hours * $15/hour = $<<7*15=105>>105.
On Monday she taught more than 3 classes, so she got a bonus and in total earned $105 + $5 = $110.

Response:
To find out how much Tanya earned for her teaching on Monday and Wednesday, we will calculate her earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate Earnings for Monday
On Monday, Tanya teaches:
- **Number of classes**: 4
- **Number of hours**: 5

**Earnings from hours taught**:
Tanya earns $15 for every hour she teaches. Therefore, for 5 hours, her earnings from teaching hours are calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Earnings from hours} = \text{Number of hours} \times \text{Rate per hour} = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 75 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Additional earnings for teaching more than 3 classes**:
Since Tanya taught 4 classes on Monday, which is more than 3, she earns an additional $5 for the day.

\[
\text{Additional earnings} = 5 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Total earnings for Monday**:
Now, we add her earnings from hours and the additional earnings:

\[
\text{Total earnings for Monday} = \text{Earnings from hours} + \text{Additional earnings} = 75 \, \text{dollars} + 5 \, \text{dollars} = 80 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Earnings for Wednesday
On Wednesday, Tanya teaches:
- **Number of classes**: 2
- **Number of hours**: 2

**Earnings from hours taught**:
For 2 hours, her earnings from teaching hours are calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Earnings from hours} = \text{Number of hours} \times \text{Rate per hour} = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 30 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Additional earnings for teaching more than 3 classes**:
Since Tanya taught only 2 classes on Wednesday, which is not more than 3, she does not earn the additional $5.

\[
\text{Additional earnings} = 0 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Total earnings for Wednesday**:
Now, we add her earnings from hours and the additional earnings:

\[
\text{Total earnings for Wednesday} = \text{Earnings from hours} + \text{Additional earnings} = 30 \, \text{dollars} + 0 \, \text{dollars} = 30 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Earnings for Both Days
Now, we sum the total earnings from both days:

\[
\text{Total earnings for both days} = \text{Total earnings for Monday} + \text{Total earnings for Wednesday} = 80 \, \text{dollars} + 30 \, \text{dollars} = 110 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Tanya earned a total of **$110** for teaching on Monday and Wednesday.

Response:
To calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday and Wednesday, we will break down her earnings for each day separately.

### Step 1: Calculate Monday's Earnings

**Classes Taught**: 4  
**Hours Worked**: 5  
**Hourly Rate**: $15  
**Additional Pay for Classes**: Since Tanya taught more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 for the day.

**Earnings from Hours Worked**:
\[
\text{Earnings from hours} = \text{Hours Worked} \times \text{Hourly Rate} = 5 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Total Earnings for Monday**:
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings from hours} + \text{Additional Pay} = 75 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Wednesday's Earnings

**Classes Taught**: 2  
**Hours Worked**: 2  
**Hourly Rate**: $15  
**Additional Pay for Classes**: Since Tanya taught 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she does not earn the additional $5.

**Earnings from Hours Worked**:
\[
\text{Earnings from hours} = \text{Hours Worked} \times \text{Hourly Rate} = 2 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Total Earnings for Wednesday**:
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings from hours} + \text{Additional Pay} = 30 \text{ dollars} + 0 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Earnings for Both Days

Now, we add the earnings from both days:
\[
\text{Total Earnings for Both Days} = \text{Total Earnings for Monday} + \text{Total Earnings for Wednesday} = 80 \text{ dollars} + 30 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Tanya earned a total of **$110** for teaching on Monday and Wednesday.

Response:
To calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday and Wednesday, we will break down her earnings for each day based on the information provided.

### Monday:
- **Classes Taught**: 4 classes
- **Hours Worked**: 5 hours

**Step 1: Calculate hourly earnings**
Tanya earns $15 for every hour she teaches. Therefore, her earnings for the hours worked on Monday are:
\[
\text{Hourly Earnings} = \text{Hours Worked} \times \text{Hourly Rate} = 5 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Check for additional earnings**
Since Tanya taught more than 3 classes on Monday, she qualifies for the additional $5 per day:
\[
\text{Additional Earnings} = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate total earnings for Monday**
Now, we add her hourly earnings and additional earnings:
\[
\text{Total Earnings for Monday} = \text{Hourly Earnings} + \text{Additional Earnings} = 75 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Wednesday:
- **Classes Taught**: 2 classes
- **Hours Worked**: 2 hours

**Step 1: Calculate hourly earnings**
For Wednesday, her earnings for the hours worked are:
\[
\text{Hourly Earnings} = \text{Hours Worked} \times \text{Hourly Rate} = 2 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Check for additional earnings**
Since Tanya taught 2 classes on Wednesday, which is not more than 3 classes, she does not qualify for the additional $5:
\[
\text{Additional Earnings} = 0 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate total earnings for Wednesday**
Now, we calculate her total earnings for Wednesday:
\[
\text{Total Earnings for Wednesday} = \text{Hourly Earnings} + \text{Additional Earnings} = 30 \text{ dollars} + 0 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Calculation:
Now we can find Tanya's total earnings for both days:
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Total Earnings for Monday} + \text{Total Earnings for Wednesday} = 80 \text{ dollars} + 30 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer:
Tanya earned a total of **$110** for the two days of teaching.
