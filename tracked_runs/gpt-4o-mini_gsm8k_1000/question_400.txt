Question ID: 1123

Question:
Elijah has one dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog and another dog that is half the weight of Kory’s dog. If Kory’s dog is 60 pounds, how much do Elijah and Kory’s dogs weigh altogether, in pounds?


Reference Answer:
Elijah’s first dog is 60 / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 pounds
Elijah’s second dog is 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 pounds
The total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs is 15 + 30 + 60 = <<15+30+60=105>>105 pounds

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, and then sum these weights to find the total.

1. **Identify the weight of Kory's dog**: 
   Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

2. **Calculate the weight of Elijah's first dog**: 
   Elijah's first dog weighs one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. 
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Weight of Kory's dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weight of Elijah's second dog**: 
   Elijah's second dog weighs half the weight of Kory's dog. 
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Weight of Kory's dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of Elijah's dogs**: 
   Now we add the weights of both of Elijah's dogs.
   \[
   \text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = \text{Weight of first dog} + \text{Weight of second dog} = 15 \text{ pounds} + 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = 45 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total weight of all dogs**: 
   Finally, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs.
   \[
   \text{Total weight of all dogs} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = 60 \text{ pounds} + 45 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight of all dogs} = 105 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs altogether is \( \boxed{105} \) pounds.
