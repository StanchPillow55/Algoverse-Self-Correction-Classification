Question:
Ashley's pizza delivery costs $15. What is the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man if she wants to give a tip that is equal to 1/5 of the amount she ordered?


Reference Answer:
The tip that Ashley wants to give amounts to $15 x 1/5 = $<<15*1/5=3>>3.
Hence, she will give a total of $15 + $3 = $<<15+3=18>>18 to the delivery man.

Response:
To find the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to calculate the tip she wants to give and then add that to the cost of the pizza delivery.

1. **Identify the cost of the pizza delivery**: 
   The cost of the pizza delivery is given as $15.

2. **Determine the tip amount**: 
   Ashley wants to give a tip that is equal to \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the amount she ordered. Since the amount she ordered is $15, we need to calculate \( \frac{1}{5} \) of $15.

   \[
   \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15
   \]

   To calculate this, we can divide 15 by 5:

   \[
   \text{Tip} = 15 \div 5 = 3
   \]

   So, the tip amount is $3.

3. **Calculate the total amount to give the delivery man**: 
   Now, we need to add the tip to the cost of the pizza delivery:

   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Cost of Delivery} + \text{Tip}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 15 + 3 = 18
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is **$18**. 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{18}
\]
