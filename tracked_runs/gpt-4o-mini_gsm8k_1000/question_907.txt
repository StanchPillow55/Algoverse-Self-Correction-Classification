Question ID: 405

Question:
Tyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game.  Each sandwich required 1 pound each of meat and cheese and would serve 4 people.  There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?


Reference Answer:
Each sandwich serves 4 people and he had 20 people in total to make food for so 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 sandwiches
1 pound of meat cost $7.00 per sandwich and he had to make 5 so 7*5 = $<<7*5=35.00>>35.00 for meat
1 pound of cheese cost $3.00 per sandwich and he had to make 5 so 3*5 = $<<3*5=15.00>>15.00 for cheese
When you add the meat and cheese together, he would spend 35+15 = $<<35+15=50.00>>50.00

Response:
To determine how much Tyson will spend on meat and cheese for the muffaletta sandwiches, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of sandwiches needed**:
   Each sandwich serves 4 people. Since there are 20 people in total, we can calculate the number of sandwiches required:

   \[
   \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{\text{Total people}}{\text{People served per sandwich}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed**:
   Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, we need:

   - Total meat needed:
   \[
   \text{Total meat} = \text{Number of sandwiches} \times \text{Meat per sandwich} = 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

   - Total cheese needed:
   \[
   \text{Total cheese} = \text{Number of sandwiches} \times \text{Cheese per sandwich} = 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of meat and cheese**:
   The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. We can calculate the total cost for each:

   - Cost of meat:
   \[
   \text{Cost of meat} = \text{Total meat} \times \text{Cost per pound of meat} = 5 \times 7.00 = 35.00
   \]

   - Cost of cheese:
   \[
   \text{Cost of cheese} = \text{Total cheese} \times \text{Cost per pound of cheese} = 5 \times 3.00 = 15.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost**:
   Now, we add the cost of meat and cheese to find the total expenditure:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of meat} + \text{Cost of cheese} = 35.00 + 15.00 = 50.00
   \]

Thus, the total amount Tyson would spend on meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people is:

\[
\boxed{50.00}
\]
