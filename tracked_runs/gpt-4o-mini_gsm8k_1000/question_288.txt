Question ID: 1032

Question:
Grandpa loves to eat jelly beans, but how many jelly beans he can eat depends on the size of the beans.  It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.  And eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean.  How many small beans can Grandpa eat?


Reference Answer:
If Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, then eating 75 large beans is the same as eating 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 medium-sized jelly beans.
If 1 medium-sized bean is the same as 3 small beans, then 150 medium-sized beans are equal to 150*3=<<150*3=450>>450 small jelly beans.
#### 450

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat based on the information provided about large and medium-sized jelly beans.

1. **Determine the number of medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat:**
   - We know that Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.
   - According to the problem, he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     \text{Medium-sized beans} = 2 \times \text{Large beans} = 2 \times 75 = 150
     \]

2. **Determine the number of small beans equivalent to medium-sized beans:**
   - The problem states that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans are equivalent to the 150 medium-sized beans, we can set up a conversion:
     \[
     \text{Small beans} = 3 \times \text{Medium-sized beans} = 3 \times 150 = 450
     \]

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - Therefore, the total number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat is 450.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{450}
\]
