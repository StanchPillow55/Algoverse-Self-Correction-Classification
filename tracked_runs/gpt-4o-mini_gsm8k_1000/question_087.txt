Question ID: 722

Question:
Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?


Reference Answer:
First find the total cost of the asphalt by multiplying the number of buckets by the cost per bucket: 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $<<3*25=75>>75
Now subtract the cost of the asphalt and the fine from the cost of the damage Ron avoids: $450 - $75 - $120 = $<<450-75-120=255>>255
#### 255

Response:
To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total costs he incurs by fixing it himself and compare that to the potential damage costs if he does not fix it.

1. **Calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole:**
   - **Cost of asphalt:** Ron needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, and each bucket costs $25.
     \[
     \text{Cost of asphalt} = 3 \text{ buckets} \times 25 \text{ dollars/bucket} = 75 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - **Fine from the city council:** If Ron fixes the pothole himself, he will incur a fine of $120.
   - **Total cost of fixing the pothole:**
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of asphalt} + \text{Fine} = 75 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} = 195 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the potential damage to Ron's car if the pothole is not fixed:**
   - The damage to Ron's car if the pothole is not fixed is $450.

3. **Calculate the savings by fixing the pothole:**
   - To find out how much Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the total cost of fixing it from the potential damage cost.
   \[
   \text{Savings} = \text{Potential damage} - \text{Total cost of fixing} = 450 \text{ dollars} - 195 \text{ dollars} = 255 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, by fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves **$255**.

**Final Answer: Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.**

Response:
To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total costs he incurs by fixing it himself and compare that to the potential damage to his car if he does not fix it.

1. **Cost of fixing the pothole**:
   - Ron needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt.
   - Each bucket costs $25.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the asphalt is:
     \[
     3 \text{ buckets} \times 25 \text{ dollars/bucket} = 75 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Fine for unauthorized road maintenance**:
   - The city council will fine Ron $120 for fixing the pothole himself.

3. **Total cost for Ron to fix the pothole**:
   - The total cost Ron incurs by fixing the pothole is the sum of the cost of the asphalt and the fine:
     \[
     75 \text{ dollars (asphalt)} + 120 \text{ dollars (fine)} = 195 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Potential damage to Ron's car**:
   - If Ron does not fix the pothole, it will cause $450 worth of damage to his car.

5. **Calculating the savings**:
   - To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the total cost of fixing it from the potential damage:
     \[
     450 \text{ dollars (damage)} - 195 \text{ dollars (cost to fix)} = 255 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, by fixing the pothole, Ron saves **$255**.

**Final Answer**: Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

1. **Calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole:**
   - Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 
     \[
     3 \text{ buckets} \times 25 \text{ dollars/bucket} = 75 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: 
     \[
     120 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total cost of fixing the pothole:
     \[
     75 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} = 195 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Potential damage to Ron's car if the pothole is not fixed:**
   - Damage amount: 
     \[
     450 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the savings by fixing the pothole:**
   - Savings = Potential damage - Total cost of fixing the pothole:
     \[
     450 \text{ dollars} - 195 \text{ dollars} = 255 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, by fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves **$255**.

Final answer: **$255**.
