Question ID: 1071

Question:
Kayla is having her birthday party at a movie theater. The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Kayla invited her 25 classmates and the 7 girls in her dance class, as well as 13 family members. Only 4 people said they could not come. How much will the party cost?


Reference Answer:
Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class friends + 13 family members = <<25+7+13=45>>45 people invited.
Of the 45 people invited – 4 people cannot come = <<45-4=41>>41 people attending the party.
Of the 41 people attending – 20 are included in the fee = <<41-20=21>>21 additional guests not included in the fee.
The cost for 21 additional guests is 21 x $6 = $<<21*6=126>>126.
The total cost for the party is the $125 fee + $126 for additional guests = $<<125+126=251>>251.

Response:
To determine the total cost of Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of guests attending the party.**
   - Kayla invited 25 classmates.
   - She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
   - Additionally, she invited 13 family members.
   - Total invited guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family) = 45 guests.

2. **Determine how many guests will actually attend.**
   - Out of the 45 invited guests, 4 people said they could not come.
   - Therefore, the number of guests who will attend = 45 (invited) - 4 (not attending) = 41 guests.

3. **Calculate the number of guests beyond the initial 20.**
   - The theater rental fee covers up to 20 guests.
   - Since there are 41 guests attending, the number of additional guests = 41 (attending) - 20 (included in the base fee) = 21 additional guests.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the party.**
   - The base fee for renting the theater is $125.
   - The cost for the additional guests is $6 per guest.
   - Total cost for additional guests = 21 (additional guests) × $6 (cost per additional guest) = $126.
   - Therefore, the total cost of the party = Base fee + Cost for additional guests = $125 + $126 = $251.

5. **Final answer:**
   - The total cost of Kayla's birthday party is **$251**.
