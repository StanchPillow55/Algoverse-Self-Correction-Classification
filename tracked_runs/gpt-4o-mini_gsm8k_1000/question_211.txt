Question ID: 128

Question:
Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost. Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. What's the total amount of money he will spend if each pepper costs 15$?


Reference Answer:
A watermelon costs three times what pepper costs, which is 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
An orange price is 45 - 5= $<<45-5=40>>40.
Dillon buys four watermelons at a total cost of 45 * 4 = $<<45*4=180>>180.
He also purchases peppers at a total price of 20 * 15 = $<<20*15=300>>300.
The oranges cost him a total of 10 * 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
He used a total of 400 + 300 + 180 = $<<400+300+180=880>>880.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the costs of watermelons, peppers, and oranges based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the cost of each pepper**:
   - We are given that each pepper costs $15.

2. **Calculate the cost of a watermelon**:
   - According to the problem, a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of a watermelon is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of watermelon} = 3 \times \text{Cost of pepper} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of an orange**:
   - The problem states that an orange costs $5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   - Thus, the cost of an orange is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of orange} = \text{Cost of watermelon} - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for Dillon's purchases**:
   - Dillon is buying:
     - 4 watermelons
     - 20 peppers
     - 10 oranges
   - We will calculate the total cost for each type of fruit separately and then sum them up.

   - **Total cost for watermelons**:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times \text{Cost of watermelon} = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - **Total cost for peppers**:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \times \text{Cost of pepper} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - **Total cost for oranges**:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for oranges} = 10 \times \text{Cost of orange} = 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the overall total cost**:
   - Now we sum the total costs for all the items:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for watermelons} + \text{Total cost for peppers} + \text{Total cost for oranges}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is **880 dollars**. 

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{880}
\]
