Question ID: 277

Question:
It takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig a small hole for shrubs and 10 minutes to dig a large hole for trees.  How many hours will it take him to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes?


Reference Answer:
It takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole and he needs to dig 30 small holes so it will take 3*30 = <<3*30=90>>90 minutes
It takes 10 minutes to dig a large hole and he needs to dig 15 large holes so it will take him 15*10 = <<10*15=150>>150 minutes
It will take 90 minutes to dig the small holes and 150 minutes to dig the large holes for a total of 90+150 = <<90+150=240>>240 minutes
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour and he needs to dig for 240 minutes so that's 240/60 = <<240/60=4>>4 hours

Response:
To determine how long it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we can break the problem down into steps.

1. **Calculate the time taken to dig small holes:**
   - Time taken to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
   - Number of small holes = 30
   - Total time for small holes = Time per small hole × Number of small holes
   \[
   \text{Total time for small holes} = 3 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 30 \text{ holes} = 90 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to dig large holes:**
   - Time taken to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
   - Number of large holes = 15
   - Total time for large holes = Time per large hole × Number of large holes
   \[
   \text{Total time for large holes} = 10 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 15 \text{ holes} = 150 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time taken to dig all holes:**
   - Total time = Total time for small holes + Total time for large holes
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Convert total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we convert minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
   \[
   \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is **4 hours**.

Final answer: **4 hours**.

   - Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
   - Number of large holes = 15
   - Total time for large holes = Time per large hole × Number of large holes
   \[
   \text{Total time for large holes} = 10 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 15 \text{ holes} = 150 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Total time for small holes + Total time for large holes
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
   \]
