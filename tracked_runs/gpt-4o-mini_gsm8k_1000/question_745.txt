Question ID: 464

Question:
Finley took part in a 100-meter race.  She started off in first, but then fell back 5 spots.  She then moved ahead 2 spots, before falling behind 3.  Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot to finish the race.  What place did she finish in?


Reference Answer:
Finley started off at 1st place but then lost 5 spots, which translates to 1+5= <<1+5=6>>6th place
She then moved ahead two spots, which is expressed as 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4th place
She then fell behind by 3 spots, which is expressed as 4+3=<<4+3=7>>7th place
She finished the race moving ahead 1 spot, which is expressed as 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6th place

Response:
To determine Finley's final position in the race, we will track her movements step by step, starting from her initial position.

1. **Starting Position**: Finley starts in 1st place.

2. **Fell Back 5 Spots**: 
   - From 1st place, if she falls back 5 spots, we calculate her new position as:
   \[
   1 - 5 = -4
   \]
   Since a negative position doesn't make sense in this context, we interpret this as moving to the last position. In a race with 100 meters, if we assume there are 100 participants, falling back 5 spots from 1st would place her in 6th place (1st to 6th is a fall of 5 spots).

3. **Moved Ahead 2 Spots**: 
   - Now in 6th place, if she moves ahead 2 spots, we calculate her new position as:
   \[
   6 - 2 = 4
   \]
   So now she is in 4th place.

4. **Fell Behind 3 Spots**: 
   - From 4th place, if she falls behind 3 spots, we calculate her new position as:
   \[
   4 + 3 = 7
   \]
   Now she is in 7th place.

5. **Jumped Ahead 1 Spot**: 
   - Finally, from 7th place, if she jumps ahead 1 spot, we calculate her new position as:
   \[
   7 - 1 = 6
   \]
   So she finishes the race in 6th place.

After following all the steps and calculations, we conclude that Finley finished the race in **6th place**.

Final Answer: **6th place**.
