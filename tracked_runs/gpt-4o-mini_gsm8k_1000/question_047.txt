Question ID: 1086

Question:
Marcel runs a bicycle store. His main products are three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB, and a Trekking bike is $450. In one month, Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes among the types listed. Half of them were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes. The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?


Reference Answer:
First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.
MTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500
In total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the prices of each type of bike:**
   - Price of one MTB = $500
   - Price of one BMX = half the price of an MTB = $500 / 2 = $250
   - Price of one Trekking bike = $450

2. **Determine the total number of bikes sold:**
   - Total bikes sold = 300

3. **Calculate the number of Trekking bikes sold:**
   - Half of the total bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   \[
   \text{Number of Trekking bikes} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of BMX bikes sold:**
   - 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   \[
   \text{Number of BMX bikes} = 0.15 \times 300 = 45
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of MTB bikes sold:**
   - The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes. We can find this by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total.
   \[
   \text{Number of MTB bikes} = 300 - (\text{Number of Trekking bikes} + \text{Number of BMX bikes})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of MTB bikes} = 300 - (150 + 45) = 300 - 195 = 105
   \]

6. **Calculate the earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Earnings from MTB bikes:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from MTB} = \text{Number of MTB bikes} \times \text{Price of MTB}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Earnings from MTB} = 105 \times 500 = 52500
   \]

   - Earnings from BMX bikes:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from BMX} = \text{Number of BMX bikes} \times \text{Price of BMX}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Earnings from BMX} = 45 \times 250 = 11250
   \]

   - Earnings from Trekking bikes:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Trekking} = \text{Number of Trekking bikes} \times \text{Price of Trekking}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Trekking} = 150 \times 450 = 67500
   \]

7. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from MTB} + \text{Earnings from BMX} + \text{Earnings from Trekking}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 52500 + 11250 + 67500 = 131250
   \]

Thus, Marcel earned a total of **$131,250** from selling bicycles during that month.

Final answer: **$131,250**
