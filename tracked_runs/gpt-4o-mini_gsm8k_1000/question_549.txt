Question ID: 1254

Question:
Louise is an artist and needs to apply a coat of varnish to her latest paintings. Usually it takes 7 minutes for the coat of varnish to dry on one painting. However, today she is using a new varnish and it takes 12 minutes for the coat to dry. How much longer will it take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish?


Reference Answer:
Usually, the varnish on all 6 paintings would be dry in 7*6=<<7*6=42>>42 minutes
With the new varnish, all 6 paintings would be dry in 12*6=<<6*12=72>>72 minutes
With the new varnish, it will take 72-42=<<72-42=30>>30 more minutes

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings using both the old varnish and the new varnish, and then find the difference between the two times.

1. **Calculate the drying time with the old varnish:**
   - The drying time for one painting with the old varnish is 7 minutes.
   - For 6 paintings, the total drying time is:
     \[
     \text{Total time with old varnish} = 6 \text{ paintings} \times 7 \text{ minutes/painting} = 42 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the drying time with the new varnish:**
   - The drying time for one painting with the new varnish is 12 minutes.
   - For 6 paintings, the total drying time is:
     \[
     \text{Total time with new varnish} = 6 \text{ paintings} \times 12 \text{ minutes/painting} = 72 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Find the difference in drying times:**
   - To find out how much longer it takes with the new varnish compared to the old varnish, we subtract the total time with the old varnish from the total time with the new varnish:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Total time with new varnish} - \text{Total time with old varnish}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take **30 minutes longer** to dry than it would with the old varnish.

**Final Answer: 30 minutes longer**
