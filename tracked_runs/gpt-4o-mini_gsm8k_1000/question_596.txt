Question ID: 392

Question:
Tim decides to cancel his cable subscription and get streaming services.  He gets Netflix for $10 a month.  Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 a month each but he saves 20% for bundling.  How much money does he save by cancelling his $60 cable package?


Reference Answer:
Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost 10+10=$<<10+10=20>>20
By bundling he saves 20*.2=$<<20*.2=4>>4
So in total it cost 20-4=$<<20-4=16>>16
So he pays 16+10=$<<16+10=26>>26 for streaming
That means he saves 60-26=$<<60-26=34>>34 a month

Response:
To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of streaming services

1. **Cost of Netflix**: 
   - Netflix costs $10 per month.

2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus**: 
   - The normal cost for Hulu is $10 per month.
   - The normal cost for Disney Plus is $10 per month.
   - Together, the normal cost for both services would be:
     \[
     10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Bundling Discount**: 
   - Tim saves 20% by bundling Hulu and Disney Plus.
   - To find the amount saved from the bundling, we calculate 20% of $20:
     \[
     0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost after the discount is:
     \[
     20 - 4 = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total Cost of Streaming Services**: 
   - Now, we add the cost of Netflix to the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
     \[
     10 + 16 = 26 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the savings from cancelling cable

1. **Cost of Cable Package**: 
   - Tim's cable package costs $60 per month.

2. **Calculate the Savings**: 
   - To find out how much Tim saves by switching to streaming services, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
     \[
     60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Final Answer

Tim saves **$34** by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services.

Response:
To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total monthly cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

1. **Cost of Streaming Services:**
   - Netflix: $10 per month
   - Hulu: $10 per month
   - Disney Plus: $10 per month

   Normally, the total cost without bundling would be:
   \[
   \text{Total without bundling} = \text{Netflix} + \text{Hulu} + \text{Disney Plus} = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Bundling Discount:**
   Tim saves 20% by bundling Hulu and Disney Plus. The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus together is:
   \[
   \text{Hulu + Disney Plus} = 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   The discount on this amount is:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Therefore, the bundled cost is:
   \[
   \text{Bundled cost} = 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total Cost of Streaming Services:**
   Now, we add the cost of Netflix to the bundled cost:
   \[
   \text{Total streaming cost} = \text{Netflix} + \text{Bundled cost} = 10 + 16 = 26 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Cable Subscription:**
   Tim's cable subscription costs $60 per month.

5. **Calculating Savings:**
   To find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription, we subtract the total cost of streaming services from the cost of the cable subscription:
   \[
   \text{Savings} = \text{Cable cost} - \text{Total streaming cost} = 60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Tim saves **$34** by cancelling his cable package and switching to streaming services.

**Final Answer: $34**
