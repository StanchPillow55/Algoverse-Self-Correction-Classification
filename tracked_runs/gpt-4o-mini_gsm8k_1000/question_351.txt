Question ID: 1011

Question:
A tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. Wanda and Ms. B decided to pump water from a pond to fill the tank in two days. On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?


Reference Answer:
On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4*18000 gallons = <<1/4*18000=4500>>4500 gallons of water.
On the same day, Ms. B pumped 3/4*4500 gallons = <<3/4*4500=3375>>3375 gallons of water into the tank.
They pumped a total of 3375 gallons+ 4500 gallons = <<3375+4500=7875>>7875 gallons together on the first day
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 gallons = <<2/3*4500=3000>>3000 gallons
Ms. B also pumped 3375 gallons * 1/3 = <<3375*1/3=1125>>1125 gallons
Together, on the second day, they pumped 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = <<3000+1125=4125>>4125 gallons
In the two days, they pumped a total of 4125 gallons + 7875 gallons = <<4125+7875=12000>>12000 gallons
The amount of gallons remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = <<18000-12000=6000>>6000 gallons

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the amount of water pumped into the tank each day by Wanda and Ms. B.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of water Wanda pumped on the first day.

The tank's total capacity is 18,000 gallons. On the first day, Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.

\[
\text{Water pumped by Wanda on Day 1} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the first day.

Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda pumped on the first day.

\[
\text{Water pumped by Ms. B on Day 1} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day.

Now we add the amounts pumped by both Wanda and Ms. B on the first day.

\[
\text{Total water pumped on Day 1} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the amount of water Wanda pumped on the second day.

On the second day, Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.

\[
\text{Water pumped by Wanda on Day 2} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the second day.

Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.

\[
\text{Water pumped by Ms. B on Day 2} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the second day.

Now we add the amounts pumped by both Wanda and Ms. B on the second day.

\[
\text{Total water pumped on Day 2} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the total amount of water pumped over the two days.

Now we add the total amounts pumped on both days.

\[
\text{Total water pumped in 2 days} = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 8: Calculate the remaining water needed to fill the tank.

To find out how many gallons are remaining to fill the tank, we subtract the total amount pumped from the tank's capacity.

\[
\text{Remaining water} = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Final Answer:

The amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is \( \boxed{6000} \) gallons.
