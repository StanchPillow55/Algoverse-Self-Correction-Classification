Question:
While working at the restaurant, each of the forty customers who came into the restaurant gave Rafaela a $20 tip. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. How much money did Julieta and Rafaela receive as tips altogether?


Reference Answer:
The total amount of money that Rafaela received as tips from the forty customers is 40*$20 = $<<40*20=800>>800
Julieta got 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, a total of 10/100*$800 = $<<10/100*800=80>>80
The total amount of money that Julieta received as tips is $800-$80 = $<<800-80=720>>720
Altogether, Julieta, and Rafaela received $720+$800 = $<<720+800=1520>>1520

Response:
To solve the problem, we will first calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips and then determine how much Julieta received based on the information given.

1. **Calculate Rafaela's Tips:**
   - Each of the 40 customers gave Rafaela a $20 tip.
   - To find the total tips Rafaela received, we multiply the number of customers by the tip amount:
     \[
     \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = \text{Number of customers} \times \text{Tip per customer} = 40 \times 20
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     40 \times 20 = 800
     \]
   - Therefore, Rafaela received **$800** in tips.

2. **Calculate Julieta's Tips:**
   - Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. First, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's tips:
     \[
     \text{10% of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     0.10 \times 800 = 80
     \]
   - Now, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's tips to find out how much Julieta received:
     \[
     \text{Julieta's tips} = \text{Rafaela's tips} - \text{10% of Rafaela's tips} = 800 - 80
     \]
   - Performing the subtraction:
     \[
     800 - 80 = 720
     \]
   - Therefore, Julieta received **$720** in tips.

3. **Calculate the Total Tips Received by Both:**
   - Now, we need to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta:
     \[
     \text{Total tips} = \text{Rafaela's tips} + \text{Julieta's tips} = 800 + 720
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     800 + 720 = 1520
     \]
   - Therefore, the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta is **$1520**.

Finally, the total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is **$1520**.
