Question ID: 19

Question:
Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the next two miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) does she need to walk the remaining distance?


Reference Answer:
First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours
Next subtract the time Marissa already spent walking to find out how much time she has left: 3 hours - 1 hour - 1 hour = <<3-1-1=1>>1 hour
Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the speed at which Marissa must walk the remaining distance of the trail to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Time Required for Average Speed

First, we need to find out how much total time Marissa needs to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The formula for average speed is:

\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
\]

Rearranging this formula to find the total time gives us:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Time Already Spent

Next, we need to calculate how much time Marissa has already spent hiking the first 6 miles of the trail.

- For the first 4 miles, she took 1 hour.
- For the next 2 miles, she took another hour.

So, the total time spent so far is:

\[
\text{Time Spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Remaining Time

Now, we can find out how much time Marissa has left to complete the hike in order to meet her average speed goal.

\[
\text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Time} - \text{Time Spent}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Remaining Distance

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles), so the remaining distance to hike is:

\[
\text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Required Speed for Remaining Distance

Now we need to find the speed at which Marissa must walk the remaining 6 miles in the remaining 1 hour. We can use the formula for speed:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]

Substituting the remaining distance and remaining time:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

### Final Answer

Marissa needs to walk at a speed of **6 miles per hour** for the remaining distance to achieve her average speed goal of 4 miles per hour for the entire hike.

Response:
To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required for the entire hike at the desired average speed:**
   \[
   \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}
   \]
   Rearranging this gives us:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the time Marissa has already spent hiking:**
   - Time for the first 4 miles: 1 hour
   - Time for the next 2 miles: 1 hour
   - Total time spent so far:
   \[
   \text{Total time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining time she has to complete the hike:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Total time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Determine the remaining distance to be hiked:**
   - Total distance: 12 miles
   - Distance already hiked: 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
   - Remaining distance:
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed needed to cover the remaining distance in the remaining time:**
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of **6 miles per hour** to achieve her goal of an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire hike.

**Final Answer: 6 miles per hour**
