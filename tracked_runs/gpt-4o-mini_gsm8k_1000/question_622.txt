Question ID: 521

Question:
Chris is way behind on his math homework. He has 100 math problems to complete in total. He completes 12 problems on Monday night. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems. How many math problems does he have left to complete on Thursday?


Reference Answer:
On Tuesday he completes 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 math problems.
This leaves him with 100 - 12 - 36 = <<100-12-36=52>>52 math problems to complete.
On Wednesday he completes 52 * 0.25 = <<52*0.25=13>>13 math problems.
This leaves him with 52 - 13 = <<52-13=39>>39 math problems to complete on Thursday.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Total Problems**: Chris has a total of 100 math problems to complete.

2. **Problems Completed on Monday**: 
   - Chris completes 12 problems on Monday.
   - Remaining problems after Monday = Total problems - Problems completed on Monday
   \[
   \text{Remaining problems after Monday} = 100 - 12 = 88
   \]

3. **Problems Completed on Tuesday**: 
   - On Tuesday, Chris completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday.
   - Problems completed on Tuesday = 3 Ã— Problems completed on Monday
   \[
   \text{Problems completed on Tuesday} = 3 \times 12 = 36
   \]
   - Remaining problems after Tuesday = Remaining problems after Monday - Problems completed on Tuesday
   \[
   \text{Remaining problems after Tuesday} = 88 - 36 = 52
   \]

4. **Problems Completed on Wednesday**: 
   - On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems.
   - Problems completed on Wednesday = \(\frac{1}{4} \times \text{Remaining problems after Tuesday}\)
   \[
   \text{Problems completed on Wednesday} = \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13
   \]
   - Remaining problems after Wednesday = Remaining problems after Tuesday - Problems completed on Wednesday
   \[
   \text{Remaining problems after Wednesday} = 52 - 13 = 39
   \]

5. **Final Calculation**: 
   - The number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 39.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{39}
\]
