Question ID: 944

Question:
Jen is planning to sell her root crops. She has 6 yams which can be sold at $1.5 each, 10 sweet potatoes that cost $2 each, and 4 carrots which cost $1.25 each. If she sells everything, how much will she earn?


Reference Answer:
Jen can earn $1.5 x 6 = $<<1.5*6=9>>9 for the yams.
She can earn $2 x 10 = $<<2*10=20>>20 for the sweet potatoes.
And she can earn $1.25 x 4 = $<<1.25*4=5>>5 for the carrots.
Therefore, she will earn $9 + $20 + $5 = $<<9+20+5=34>>34 if she sells everything.

Response:
To find out how much Jen will earn by selling her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of crop and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate earnings from yams:**
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam sells for $1.50.
   - Total earnings from yams = Number of yams × Price per yam
   \[
   \text{Total from yams} = 6 \times 1.50 = 9.00
   \]

2. **Calculate earnings from sweet potatoes:**
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato sells for $2.00.
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes = Number of sweet potatoes × Price per sweet potato
   \[
   \text{Total from sweet potatoes} = 10 \times 2.00 = 20.00
   \]

3. **Calculate earnings from carrots:**
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot sells for $1.25.
   - Total earnings from carrots = Number of carrots × Price per carrot
   \[
   \text{Total from carrots} = 4 \times 1.25 = 5.00
   \]

4. **Sum the total earnings from all crops:**
   - Total earnings = Total from yams + Total from sweet potatoes + Total from carrots
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 9.00 + 20.00 + 5.00 = 34.00
   \]

Thus, if Jen sells all her root crops, she will earn a total of **$34.00**.

Final answer: **$34.00**
