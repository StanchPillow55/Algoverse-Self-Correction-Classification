Question ID: 100

Question:
Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him on a certain day. The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times, how many doorbell rings did the doorbell make?


Reference Answer:
The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend, a total of 1/4*20=<<1/4*20=5>>5 times.
Jerome's second friend pressed on the doorbell 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25
The first two friends pressed on the doorbell 25+20=<<25+20=45>>45 times altogether before Jerome could open the door.
Jerome's third friend pressed on the doorbell 60+10=<<60+10=70>>70 times before Jerome could open the door.
Altogether, Jerome's third and fourth friends pressed on the doorbell 70+60=<<70+60=130>>130 times before Jerome could open.
The number of doorbell rings that Jerome's friend made before Jerome could open the door is 130+45=<<130+45=175>>175 times.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these amounts to find the total number of doorbell rings.

1. **First Friend**: 
   - The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
   \[
   \text{First Friend} = 20 \text{ times}
   \]

2. **Second Friend**: 
   - The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend. 
   - To find out how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell, we first calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the first friend's presses:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
   \]
   - Now, we add this to the first friend's presses:
   \[
   \text{Second Friend} = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ times}
   \]

3. **Fourth Friend**: 
   - The problem states that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
   \[
   \text{Fourth Friend} = 60 \text{ times}
   \]

4. **Third Friend**: 
   - The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
   - Therefore, we calculate how many times the third friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   \text{Third Friend} = 60 + 10 = 70 \text{ times}
   \]

5. **Total Doorbell Rings**: 
   - Now we sum the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{First Friend} + \text{Second Friend} + \text{Third Friend} + \text{Fourth Friend}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total} = 20 + 25 + 70 + 60
   \]
   - Performing the addition step-by-step:
   \[
   20 + 25 = 45
   \]
   \[
   45 + 70 = 115
   \]
   \[
   115 + 60 = 175
   \]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings made is:
\[
\boxed{175}
\]
