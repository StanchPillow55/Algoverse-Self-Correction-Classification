Question ID: 107

Question:
Frankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?


Reference Answer:
Let W be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.
After Monday, he had 7 - 1 = <<7-1=6>>6 hours of TV left.
After Tuesday, he had 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours of TV left.
After Thursday, he had 5 - 1 - 1/2 = 3 1/2 hours of TV left.
After Friday, he had 3 1/2 - 2 = 1 1/2 hours of TV left.
Each 30-minute episode is 1/2 hour.
Thus, W = 1 1/2 / 1/2 = 3 episodes.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to break down the information given about how much TV Frankie watched each day and then set up an equation to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday.

1. **Calculate TV time for each day:**
   - **Monday:** Watched 1 hour (1 episode of 1 hour).
   - **Tuesday:** Watched 1 hour (1 episode of 1 hour).
   - **Wednesday:** Watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Letâ€™s denote the number of 30-minute episodes he watched as \( x \). Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time watched on Wednesday is \( 0.5x \) hours.
   - **Thursday:** Watched 1 hour (1 episode of 1 hour) and 30 minutes (1 episode of 30 minutes). This totals to \( 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 \) hours.
   - **Friday:** Watched 2 hours (2 episodes of 1 hour).

2. **Sum up the total TV time:**
   Now we can add up the total TV time for the week:
   - Monday: 1 hour
   - Tuesday: 1 hour
   - Wednesday: \( 0.5x \) hours
   - Thursday: 1.5 hours
   - Friday: 2 hours

   The total TV time can be expressed as:
   \[
   1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2
   \]

   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   5.5 + 0.5x
   \]

3. **Set up the equation:**
   According to the problem, the total TV time for the week is 7 hours. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   5.5 + 0.5x = 7
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   To isolate \( x \), we first subtract 5.5 from both sides:
   \[
   0.5x = 7 - 5.5
   \]
   \[
   0.5x = 1.5
   \]

   Next, we divide both sides by 0.5:
   \[
   x = \frac{1.5}{0.5} = 3
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   Frankie watched \( x = 3 \) episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]
