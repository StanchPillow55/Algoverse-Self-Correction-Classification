Question:
Charisma works for 8 hours every day.  She has a timer to remind her to get up and walk for 5 minutes every hour sheâ€™s at work.  After 5 days at the office, how many minutes has she walked?


Reference Answer:
She works 8 hours every day and she sets a timer to walk 5 minutes every hour for a total of 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40 minutes of walking
If she walks 40 minutes a day while at the office then over 5 days she walks 40*5 = <<40*5=200>>200 minutes
#### 200

Response:
To determine how many minutes Charisma has walked after 5 days at the office, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of hours Charisma works in a day:**
   Charisma works for 8 hours every day.

2. **Determine how many times she gets up to walk in a day:**
   Since she walks for 5 minutes every hour, we need to find out how many hours are in a workday:
   - She works for 8 hours, so she will get up to walk 8 times (once every hour).

3. **Calculate the total walking time in minutes for one day:**
   Each time she gets up to walk, she walks for 5 minutes. Therefore, the total walking time in one day is:
   \[
   \text{Total walking time in one day} = \text{Number of walks} \times \text{Time per walk}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total walking time in one day} = 8 \text{ walks} \times 5 \text{ minutes/walk} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total walking time over 5 days:**
   Now, we need to find out how many minutes she has walked over 5 days:
   \[
   \text{Total walking time over 5 days} = \text{Total walking time in one day} \times \text{Number of days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total walking time over 5 days} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   After 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked a total of 200 minutes.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{200 \text{ minutes}}
\]
