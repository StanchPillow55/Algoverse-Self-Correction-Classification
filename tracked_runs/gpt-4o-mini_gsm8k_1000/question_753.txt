Question ID: 238

Question:
Mary is two years younger than Joan, who is five years older than Jessa. If Jessa is 20 years old, what is the sum of the ages of the three girls?


Reference Answer:
Joan is 20 + 5 = <<20+5=25>>25 years old.
Mary is 25 â€“ 2 = <<25-2=23>>23 years old.
Therefore, the sum of their ages is 20 + 25 + 23 = <<20+25+23=68>>68.
#### 68

Response:
To solve the problem, we will first determine the ages of each girl based on the information provided.

1. **Identify Jessa's age**: 
   We know that Jessa is 20 years old.

2. **Determine Joan's age**: 
   The problem states that Joan is five years older than Jessa. Since Jessa is 20 years old, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Mary's age**: 
   The problem also states that Mary is two years younger than Joan. We can calculate Mary's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate the sum of their ages**: 
   Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages:
   \[
   \text{Sum of ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} = 23 + 25 + 20
   \]

   Performing the addition step-by-step:
   \[
   23 + 25 = 48
   \]
   \[
   48 + 20 = 68
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   The sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa is:
   \[
   \boxed{68}
   \]
