Question:
Sam sells bread. He has a target of selling 120 crates of bread in a week. One week he was closed on Monday and Friday. Over the weekend he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and Thursday 18 crates. By how many crates was Sam off from his target for the week?


Reference Answer:
During the whole week Sam sold 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = <<15+12+18+20=65>>65 crates.
Sam was off his target by 120 - 65 = <<120-65=55>>55 crates.
#### 55

Response:
To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target for the week, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the target sales**: Sam's target is to sell 120 crates of bread in a week.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the week**: We will add up the number of crates sold on each day he was open.

   - **Sales on the weekend**: 20 crates
   - **Sales on Tuesday**: 15 crates
   - **Sales on Wednesday**: 12 crates
   - **Sales on Thursday**: 18 crates

   Now, we will sum these amounts:

   \[
   \text{Total sales} = \text{Sales on weekend} + \text{Sales on Tuesday} + \text{Sales on Wednesday} + \text{Sales on Thursday}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total sales} = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18
   \]

   Performing the addition step-by-step:

   \[
   20 + 15 = 35
   \]
   \[
   35 + 12 = 47
   \]
   \[
   47 + 18 = 65
   \]

   Therefore, Sam sold a total of 65 crates during the week.

3. **Calculate how many crates he was off from his target**: To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we subtract the total sales from the target sales.

   \[
   \text{Crates off from target} = \text{Target sales} - \text{Total sales}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Crates off from target} = 120 - 65
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   120 - 65 = 55
   \]

4. **Final answer**: Sam was off from his target by 55 crates.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{55}
\]
