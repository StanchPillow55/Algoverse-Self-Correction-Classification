Question ID: 44

Question:
Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles.  For every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 tapered candles.  One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 in supplies.   If he sells each candle for $2.00 each, what is his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles?


Reference Answer:
1 pound of beeswax and the wick make 10 candles and he wants to make 20 candles so he needs 20/10 = <<20/10=2>>2 pounds of beeswax
1 pound of beeswax costs $10.00 and he needs 2 pounds so his supplies will cost 10*2 = $<<10*2=20.00>>20.00
He wants to sell each candle for $2.00 each and he's selling 20 candles so that's 2*20 = $<<2*20=40.00>>40.00
If he makes $40.00 selling candles and his supplies cost $20.00 then his net profit is 40-20 = $<<40-20=20.00>>20.00
#### 20

Response:
To determine Charlie's net profit from selling 20 beeswax candles, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed for 20 candles.**
   - Charlie can make 10 tapered candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
   - To find out how many pounds are needed for 20 candles, we set up the following proportion:
     \[
     \text{Pounds of beeswax} = \frac{\text{Number of candles}}{\text{Candles per pound}} = \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies.**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Since Charlie needs 2 pounds of beeswax, the total cost will be:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost per pound} \times \text{Number of pounds} = 10 \text{ dollars/pound} \times 2 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = \text{Price per candle} \times \text{Number of candles} = 2 \text{ dollars/candle} \times 20 \text{ candles} = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit.**
   - Net profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
     \[
     \text{Net profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 beeswax candles is:

\[
\boxed{20 \text{ dollars}}
\]

Response:
To find Charlie's net profit from selling 20 beeswax candles, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed for 20 candles.**
   - Charlie can make 10 tapered candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
   - To find out how many pounds he needs for 20 candles, we use the ratio:
     \[
     \text{Pounds of beeswax} = \frac{\text{Number of candles}}{\text{Candles per pound}} = \frac{20}{10} = 2 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies.**
   - Each pound of beeswax and the wicks costs $10.00.
   - Since he needs 2 pounds, the total cost is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Pounds of beeswax} \times \text{Cost per pound} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.**
   - Each candle sells for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = \text{Number of candles} \times \text{Price per candle} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit.**
   - Net profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
     \[
     \text{Net profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 beeswax candles is **$20.00**.

   - Charlie can make 10 tapered candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
   - Therefore, to make 20 candles, he needs:
     \[
     \text{Pounds of beeswax} = \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies for the beeswax and wicks.**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.
   - For 2 pounds, the total cost will be:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pound} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = 20 \text{ candles} \times 2 \text{ dollars/candle} = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit.**
   - Net profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs:
     \[
     \text{Net profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles is:

\[
\boxed{20 \text{ dollars}}
\]
