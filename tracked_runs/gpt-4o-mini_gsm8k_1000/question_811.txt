Question:
Shelly's 3 kids spent all day at the water park.  Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.  Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel and Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne.  How many times did Robert go down the water slide?


Reference Answer:
Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel who went down 30 times so that's .30*30 = <<30*.01*30=9>>9 times less
Mitchel went down 30 times and Anne went down 9 times less than him for a total of 30-9 = <<30-9=21>>21 times
Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, who went down 21 times so Robert went down the slide 4*21 = <<4*21=84>>84 times
#### 84

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many times Anne went down the slide:**
   - Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.
   - Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. 
   - To find 30% of Mitchel's total, we calculate:
     \[
     30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9
     \]
   - Now, we subtract this amount from Mitchel's total to find out how many times Anne went down the slide:
     \[
     \text{Anne's total} = 30 - 9 = 21
     \]

2. **Determine how many times Robert went down the slide:**
   - Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne.
   - We already calculated that Anne went down the slide 21 times. Therefore, we calculate Robert's total:
     \[
     \text{Robert's total} = 4 \times 21 = 84
     \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - Robert went down the water slide **84 times**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{84}
\]
