Question ID: 386

Question:
To have the car for the weekend, Wilson's report card needs to show that he received 80 or higher in his math class.  His math grade is calculated by the average of 5 test scores.  On those tests, he received: 65, 94, 81, 86 and 74.  What is his current math grade?


Reference Answer:
He received 65, 94, 81, 86 and a 74 on his 5 math tests so that's 65+94+81+86+74 = <<400=400>>400
His math grade is calculated by the average test grade on his 5 tests so his math grade is 400/5 = <<400/5=80>>80
#### 80

Response:
To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The average is found by summing all the test scores and then dividing by the number of tests.

Here are the test scores Wilson received:
- Test 1: 65
- Test 2: 94
- Test 3: 81
- Test 4: 86
- Test 5: 74

**Step 1: Calculate the sum of the test scores.**

\[
\text{Sum} = 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74
\]

Now, let's perform the addition step by step:

1. \(65 + 94 = 159\)
2. \(159 + 81 = 240\)
3. \(240 + 86 = 326\)
4. \(326 + 74 = 400\)

So, the total sum of the test scores is:

\[
\text{Sum} = 400
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the average of the test scores.**

To find the average, we divide the sum of the test scores by the number of tests (which is 5).

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum}}{\text{Number of Tests}} = \frac{400}{5}
\]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[
\frac{400}{5} = 80
\]

**Final Calculation:**

Thus, Wilson's current math grade is:

\[
\text{Current Math Grade} = 80
\]

**Conclusion:**

Wilson's current math grade is 80. Since he needs to have a grade of 80 or higher to have the car for the weekend, he meets the requirement.

**Final Answer: Wilson's current math grade is 80.**
