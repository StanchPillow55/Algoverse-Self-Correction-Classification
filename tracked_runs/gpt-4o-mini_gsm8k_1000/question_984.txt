Question ID: 759

Question:
The number of songs in a playlist is 300. If John has 20 such playlists, and each song is 10 hours long, how many hours will the 20 playlists last in total?


Reference Answer:
Since each playlist has 300 songs, the total number of songs in the 20 playlists is 20*300= <<20*300=6000>>6000.
If each song is 10 hours long, the 6000 songs in the 20 playlists last a total of 6000*10 = <<6000*10=60000>>60000 hours
#### 60000

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the total duration of the 20 playlists based on the number of songs in each playlist and the length of each song.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of songs in 20 playlists.**

Each playlist contains 300 songs. Therefore, the total number of songs in 20 playlists can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total songs} = \text{Number of playlists} \times \text{Songs per playlist}
\]
\[
\text{Total songs} = 20 \times 300 = 6000 \text{ songs}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total duration of all songs.**

Each song is 10 hours long. To find the total duration of all 6000 songs, we multiply the total number of songs by the duration of each song:

\[
\text{Total duration (in hours)} = \text{Total songs} \times \text{Duration per song}
\]
\[
\text{Total duration} = 6000 \times 10 = 60000 \text{ hours}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The total duration of the 20 playlists is \( \boxed{60000} \) hours.
