Question:
An ice cream factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.  It can make 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.  How many quarts in total would be made in 48 hours?


Reference Answer:
Chocolate ice cream can be made at 100 quarts / 2 hours = <<100/2=50>>50 quarts per hour.
Vanilla ice cream can be made at 50 quarts / 4 hours = <<50/4=12.5>>12.5 quarts per hour.
In 48 hours there would be 48 * 50 quarts = <<48*50=2400>>2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream.
In 48 hours there would be 48 * 12.5 quarts = <<48*12.5=600>>600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.
Combined there would be 2400 chocolate + 600 vanilla = <<2400+600=3000>>3000 quarts of ice cream.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream can be produced in 48 hours.

### Step 1: Calculate the production rate for chocolate ice cream.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the rate of production per hour, we can use the following calculation:

\[
\text{Rate of chocolate ice cream} = \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the production rate for vanilla ice cream.

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. Similarly, we can find the rate of production per hour:

\[
\text{Rate of vanilla ice cream} = \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total production for each type of ice cream in 48 hours.

#### Chocolate Ice Cream Production in 48 Hours:
Using the rate we calculated for chocolate ice cream:

\[
\text{Total chocolate ice cream in 48 hours} = 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
\]

#### Vanilla Ice Cream Production in 48 Hours:
Using the rate we calculated for vanilla ice cream:

\[
\text{Total vanilla ice cream in 48 hours} = 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total production of both types of ice cream.

Now, we add the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream produced in 48 hours:

\[
\text{Total ice cream} = \text{Total chocolate ice cream} + \text{Total vanilla ice cream}
\]
\[
\text{Total ice cream} = 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
\]

### Final Answer:
The total amount of ice cream made in 48 hours is 

\[
\boxed{3000} \text{ quarts}
\]
