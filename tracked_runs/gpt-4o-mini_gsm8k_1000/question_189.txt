Question ID: 310

Question:
Theo has $6000 he wishes to spend on his upcoming business trip to South Africa. He buys 6 business suits at $100 each, 3 suitcases at $50 each, a flight ticket that costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. He wishes to save $2000 for this trip, how much does he have to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa?


Reference Answer:
Theo buys business suits for 6 suits * $100/suit = $<<6*100=600>>600.
Theo buys suitcases for 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $<<3*50=150>>150.
Theo buys a flight ticket that costs $700 + 5 * $100 = $<<700+5*100=1200>>1200.
Theo can spend $6000 - $600 - $150 - $1200 - $2000 = $<<6000-600-150-1200-2000=2050>>2050 on gifts for his friends.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the total expenses Theo incurs and then determining how much he has left to spend on gifts.

1. **Calculate the cost of business suits:**
   - Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of business suits} = 6 \times 100 = 600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of suitcases:**
   - Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of suitcases} = 3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the flight ticket:**
   - The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of a business suit is $100, so:
   \[
   5 \times \text{Cost of a business suit} = 5 \times 100 = 500 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Therefore, the cost of the flight ticket is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of flight ticket} = 500 + 700 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total expenses:**
   - Now we will sum up all the costs:
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = \text{Cost of business suits} + \text{Cost of suitcases} + \text{Cost of flight ticket}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine how much Theo wishes to save:**
   - Theo wants to save $2000 for his trip.

6. **Calculate the total amount Theo can spend:**
   - Theo has a total of $6000. After saving $2000, the amount he can spend is:
   \[
   \text{Amount available to spend} = 6000 - 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Calculate how much Theo has left for gifts:**
   - Now we will subtract the total expenses from the amount available to spend:
   \[
   \text{Amount available for gifts} = \text{Amount available to spend} - \text{Total expenses}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount available for gifts} = 4000 - 1950 = 2050 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Theo has **$2050** to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.
