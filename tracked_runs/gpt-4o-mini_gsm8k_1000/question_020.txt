Question:
Jennifer bought 12 oranges from the market, she gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, and her only boy got 3 oranges. How many oranges did she remain with?

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of oranges Jennifer bought.**
   - Jennifer bought 12 oranges.

2. **Calculate the total number of oranges given to her daughters.**
   - Jennifer has three daughters, and each daughter receives 2 oranges.
   - Total oranges given to daughters = Number of daughters × Oranges per daughter
   - Total oranges given to daughters = 3 daughters × 2 oranges/daughter = 6 oranges.

3. **Calculate the total number of oranges given to her son.**
   - Jennifer has one son, and he receives 3 oranges.
   - Total oranges given to son = 3 oranges.

4. **Calculate the total number of oranges given away.**
   - Total oranges given away = Total oranges given to daughters + Total oranges given to son
   - Total oranges given away = 6 oranges (to daughters) + 3 oranges (to son) = 9 oranges.

5. **Calculate the number of oranges Jennifer has left.**
   - Oranges remaining = Total oranges bought - Total oranges given away
   - Oranges remaining = 12 oranges - 9 oranges = 3 oranges.

Thus, after giving away the oranges to her daughters and son, Jennifer has 3 oranges remaining.

**Final Answer:**
Jennifer has 3 oranges remaining.
