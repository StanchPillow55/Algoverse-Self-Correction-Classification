Question ID: 150

Question:
Steve and Tim decide to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives further away than Tim, so he is allowed to ride his bike. Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school. If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?


Reference Answer:
Steve has to travel 3 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<3*5280=15840>>15840 feet to get home.
It will take Steve 15840 feet / (440 feet/minute) = <<15840/(440)=36>>36 minutes to get home.
Tim has to travel 2 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<2*5280=10560>>10560 feet to get home.
It will take Tim 10560 feet / (264 feet/minute) = <<10560/264=40>>40 minutes to get home.
Steve will finish the race in 40 minutes - 36 minutes = <<40-36=4>>4 minutes less time than Tim.

Response:
To determine who wins the race and how long the winner will be waiting for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

### Step 1: Convert distances from miles to feet
1 mile = 5280 feet.

- **Steve's distance**: 
  \[
  3 \text{ miles} = 3 \times 5280 \text{ feet} = 15840 \text{ feet}
  \]

- **Tim's distance**: 
  \[
  2 \text{ miles} = 2 \times 5280 \text{ feet} = 10560 \text{ feet}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken for each person to get home
Time is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

- **Steve's time**:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Tim's time**:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
  \]

### Step 3: Determine the winner and the waiting time
Now we compare the times:
- Steve takes 36 minutes.
- Tim takes 40 minutes.

Since Steve takes less time, he is the winner.

### Step 4: Calculate how long the winner waits
To find out how long Steve will be waiting for Tim, we subtract Steve's time from Tim's time:
\[
\text{Waiting time} = \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} - \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer
Steve will be waiting for Tim for **4 minutes** before Tim finishes the race.
