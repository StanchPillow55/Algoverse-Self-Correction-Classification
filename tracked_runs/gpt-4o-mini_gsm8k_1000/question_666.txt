Question ID: 823

Question:
Sasha and Julie are best friends playing on opposing basketball teams. The teams have two practice games scheduled. In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game. Sasha always struggles during away games and their second match was at Julie's home court. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. How many total points did Sasha score during both games?


Reference Answer:
In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points, and Julie scored four fewer points: 14-4 = <<14-4=10>>10 points.
In the second game, Sasha scored 6 points fewer than Julie's score in the first game, meaning she scored 10-6=<<10-6=4>>4 points.
Sasha scored 10+4=<<10+4=14>>14 points in the two games.
#### 14

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Sasha's score in the first game:**
   - Sasha scored 14 points in the first game.

2. **Determine Julie's score in the first game:**
   - Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha. Therefore, we calculate Julie's score as follows:
   \[
   \text{Julie's score} = \text{Sasha's score} - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10 \text{ points}
   \]

3. **Determine Sasha's score in the second game:**
   - In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. We already calculated Julie's score in the first game to be 10 points. Thus, we calculate Sasha's score in the second game as follows:
   \[
   \text{Sasha's score in the second game} = \text{Julie's score in the first game} - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4 \text{ points}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total points scored by Sasha during both games:**
   - Now we add Sasha's scores from both games:
   \[
   \text{Total points scored by Sasha} = \text{Sasha's score in the first game} + \text{Sasha's score in the second game} = 14 + 4 = 18 \text{ points}
   \]

Thus, the total points that Sasha scored during both games is \( \boxed{18} \).

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the points scored by Sasha and Julie in both games.

1. **First Game:**
   - Sasha scored 14 points.
   - Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha. Therefore, we calculate Julie's score as follows:
     \[
     \text{Julie's score} = \text{Sasha's score} - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10 \text{ points}
     \]

2. **Second Game:**
   - In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. We already know that Julie scored 10 points in the first game. Therefore, we calculate Sasha's score in the second game as follows:
     \[
     \text{Sasha's score in the second game} = \text{Julie's score in the first game} - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4 \text{ points}
     \]

3. **Total Points Scored by Sasha:**
   - Now we will find the total points scored by Sasha during both games. We add her scores from the first and second games:
     \[
     \text{Total points scored by Sasha} = \text{Sasha's score in the first game} + \text{Sasha's score in the second game} = 14 + 4 = 18 \text{ points}
     \]

Thus, the total points Sasha scored during both games is \( \boxed{18} \).

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the scores for both Sasha and Julie in each game.

### Step 1: Determine Sasha's score in the first game.
Sasha scored 14 points in the first game.

### Step 2: Determine Julie's score in the first game.
Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game. Therefore, we can calculate Julie's score as follows:

\[
\text{Julie's score} = \text{Sasha's score} - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10
\]

### Step 3: Determine Sasha's score in the second game.
In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. We already calculated Julie's score in the first game to be 10 points. Thus, we can calculate Sasha's score in the second game as follows:

\[
\text{Sasha's score in the second game} = \text{Julie's score in the first game} - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total points scored by Sasha during both games.
Now we will add Sasha's scores from both games to find the total points scored:

\[
\text{Total points scored by Sasha} = \text{Sasha's score in the first game} + \text{Sasha's score in the second game} = 14 + 4 = 18
\]

### Final Answer
Sasha scored a total of **18 points** during both games.
