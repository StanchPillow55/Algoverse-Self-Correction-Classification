Question ID: 1006

Question:
The Smith family is getting ready for summer and needs to have their swimming pool filled. The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. How much will it cost to fill the pool?


Reference Answer:
Mr. Smith found the volume of the pool to be 14 feet wide x 25 feet long x 4 feet deep = <<14*25*4=1400>>1,400 cubic feet
He followed the pool company instructions and found his pool required 1,400 x 5.9 = <<1400*5.9=8260>>8,260 gallons of water.
The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 x 8,260 gallons = $<<0.10*8260=826>>826.

Response:
To determine the cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet**.
2. **Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons**.
3. **Calculate the total cost to fill the pool based on the price per gallon**.

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Pool

The volume \( V \) of a rectangular pool can be calculated using the formula:

\[
V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
\]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
V = 25 \, \text{ft} \times 14 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft}
\]

Calculating step-by-step:

\[
25 \times 14 = 350 \, \text{ft}^2
\]

Now, multiply by the depth:

\[
350 \, \text{ft}^2 \times 4 \, \text{ft} = 1400 \, \text{ft}^3
\]

So, the volume of the pool is \( 1400 \, \text{ft}^3 \).

### Step 2: Convert the Volume from Cubic Feet to Gallons

The pool company instructed the Smith family to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons needed. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{ft}^3 \times 5.9
\]

Calculating this:

\[
1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost to Fill the Pool

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Thus, the total cost \( C \) can be calculated as follows:

\[
C = \text{Gallons} \times \text{Cost per gallon}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
C = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
C = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The total cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool is **$826**.

Response:
To determine the cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.**
   The formula for the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Given:
   - Length = 25 feet
   - Width = 14 feet
   - Depth = 4 feet

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet}
   \]
   \[
   V = 25 \times 14 = 350 \, \text{square feet}
   \]
   \[
   V = 350 \times 4 = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**
   The problem states to multiply the volume in cubic feet by 5.9 to find the volume in gallons:
   \[
   \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9
   \]
   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**
   The cost per gallon is $0.10. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) to fill the pool is given by:
   \[
   C = \text{Volume in gallons} \times \text{Cost per gallon}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   C = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon}
   \]
   \[
   C = 826 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   The total cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool is:
   \[
   \boxed{826} \text{ dollars}
   \]
