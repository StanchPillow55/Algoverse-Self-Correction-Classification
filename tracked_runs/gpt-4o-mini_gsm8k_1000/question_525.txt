Question ID: 1027

Question:
A store offers sandwiches in 3 different package sizes: the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the second with 4 sandwiches for $6, and a third with 8 sandwiches, but the price is not indicated. Knowing that the prices are proportional, how much will the package with 8 sandwiches cost?


Reference Answer:
So the price for 1 sandwich is $3 / 2 sandwiches = $<<3/2=1.5>>1.5/sandwich
Now the price for the package with 8 sandwiches would be $1.5/sandwich * 8 sandwiches = $<<1.5*8=12>>12
#### 12

Response:
To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we first need to analyze the prices of the other packages and establish the relationship between the number of sandwiches and their prices.

1. **Identify the prices and quantities of the packages:**
   - Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Package 3: 8 sandwiches (price unknown)

2. **Calculate the price per sandwich for the first two packages:**
   - For Package 1:
     \[
     \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{\text{Total price}}{\text{Number of sandwiches}} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
     \]

   - For Package 2:
     \[
     \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
     \]

   Both packages have the same price per sandwich, which is $1.50.

3. **Establish the price for the third package:**
   Since the prices are proportional and the price per sandwich remains consistent, we can use the price per sandwich to find the cost of the 8-sandwich package.

   - For Package 3 (8 sandwiches):
     \[
     \text{Cost} = \text{Number of sandwiches} \times \text{Price per sandwich} = 8 \times 1.5
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for the 8-sandwich package:**
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   The cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is **$12**.

Response:
To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we first need to analyze the pricing of the other packages and establish the relationship between the number of sandwiches and their prices.

1. **Identify the prices and quantities of the known packages:**
   - Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6

2. **Calculate the price per sandwich for each package:**
   - For Package 1:
     \[
     \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{\text{Total price}}{\text{Number of sandwiches}} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
     \]
   - For Package 2:
     \[
     \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
     \]

   Both packages have the same price per sandwich, which confirms that the pricing is consistent and proportional.

3. **Determine the price for the package with 8 sandwiches:**
   - Since the price per sandwich is $1.5, we can calculate the total price for 8 sandwiches:
   \[
   \text{Total price for 8 sandwiches} = \text{Price per sandwich} \times \text{Number of sandwiches} = 1.5 \times 8
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   1.5 \times 8 = 12
   \]

Thus, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

5. **Final answer:**
The package with 8 sandwiches will cost **$12**.
