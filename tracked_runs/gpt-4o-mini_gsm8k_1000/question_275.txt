Question ID: 47

Question:
John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.  The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.  He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties?


Reference Answer:
He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties
So he bought 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 red ties
Each red tie cost $40 * .5 = $<<40*.5=20>>20 more than blue ties
So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60
So he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties
So he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   - John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.
   - The number of blue ties can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
     \]

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   - According to the problem, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Therefore, the number of red ties is:
     \[
     \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
     \]

3. **Determine the cost of red ties:**
   - The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. 
   - The cost of a blue tie is $40, so the cost of a red tie can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of red tie} = \text{Cost of blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost of blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of red ties:**
   - Now that we know the cost of a red tie is $60 and John bought 10 red ties, we can calculate the total cost of red ties:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost of red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**
   - Finally, we add the total spent on blue ties and the total spent on red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:
     \[
     \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
     \]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is \(\boxed{800}\).
