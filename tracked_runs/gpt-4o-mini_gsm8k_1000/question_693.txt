Question ID: 850

Question:
Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y. How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?


Reference Answer:
There are 55 - 10 = <<55-10=45>>45 goats left in Farm X.
Mr. Smith sold 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 goats from Farm Y.
Thus, 45 - 20 = <<45-20=25>>25 goats are left in Farm Y.
Therefore, there are a total of 45 + 25 = <<45+25=70>>70 goats left in the two farms altogether.

Response:
To find out how many goats are left in Mr. Smith's two farms after he sold some, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of goats on each farm:**
   - Farm X has 55 goats.
   - Farm Y has 45 goats.

2. **Calculate the number of goats sold from each farm:**
   - Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X.
   - He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y. Therefore, the number of goats sold from Farm Y is:
     \[
     2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ goats}
     \]

3. **Calculate the remaining number of goats on each farm after the sales:**
   - For Farm X:
     \[
     \text{Remaining goats in Farm X} = 55 - 10 = 45 \text{ goats}
     \]
   - For Farm Y:
     \[
     \text{Remaining goats in Farm Y} = 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ goats}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of goats left on both farms:**
   - We add the remaining goats from both farms:
     \[
     \text{Total remaining goats} = \text{Remaining goats in Farm X} + \text{Remaining goats in Farm Y}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total remaining goats} = 45 + 25 = 70 \text{ goats}
     \]

Thus, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is **70 goats**. 

Final answer: **70 goats**.
