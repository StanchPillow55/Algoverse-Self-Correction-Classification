Question ID: 964

Question:
John just started watching a new show.  Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode.  How many minutes will John spend watching the show if he watches every episode?


Reference Answer:
Since there are half as many episodes as the number of minutes per episode, we perform 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 episodes in total.
Since each episode is 20 minutes long, to find the total run time we perform 10*20= <<10*20=200>>200 minutes of run time in total.
#### 200

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many episodes John will watch and then calculate the total time he will spend watching the show.

1. **Identify the length of each episode**: 
   Each episode is given to be 20 minutes long.

2. **Determine the total number of episodes**: 
   The problem states that there are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, we can calculate the total number of episodes as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total episodes} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{minutes per episode}
   \]
   Substituting the value of minutes per episode:

   \[
   \text{Total episodes} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent watching the show**: 
   Now that we know there are 10 episodes, we can calculate the total time John will spend watching the show by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Total episodes} \times \text{minutes per episode}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total time John will spend watching the show is 

   \[
   \boxed{200} \text{ minutes}.
   \]
