Question ID: 582

Question:
Juan asked his neighbor, Herb, how much his house was worth. Herb answered that he paid $76,000 for the house. If Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, calculate the value of the two houses combined.


Reference Answer:
Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, meaning Juan's house is 30/100*$76000= $<<30/100*76000=22800>>22800 less expensive than Herb's house.
Juan's house is worth $76000-$22800 = $<<76000-22800=53200>>53200
The combined total value of Juan's and Herb's house is $76000+$53200 = $<<76000+53200=129200>>129200
#### 129200

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of Juan's house, which is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, and then calculate the combined value of both houses.

1. **Determine the value of Herb's house**:
   Herb's house is worth $76,000.

2. **Calculate 30% of Herb's house value**:
   To find out how much 30% of Herb's house is, we multiply the value of Herb's house by 0.30:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000
   \]
   \[
   0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800
   \]

3. **Calculate the value of Juan's house**:
   Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we subtract the 30% value from Herb's house value:
   \[
   \text{Value of Juan's house} = \text{Value of Herb's house} - 30\% \text{ of Herb's house}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value of Juan's house} = 76,000 - 22,800
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value of Juan's house} = 53,200
   \]

4. **Calculate the combined value of both houses**:
   Now, we add the values of both houses together:
   \[
   \text{Combined value} = \text{Value of Herb's house} + \text{Value of Juan's house}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Combined value} = 76,000 + 53,200
   \]
   \[
   \text{Combined value} = 129,200
   \]

Thus, the combined value of Juan's and Herb's houses is **$129,200**. 

Final answer: **$129,200**.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of Juan's house based on the information provided about Herb's house and then calculate the combined value of both houses.

1. **Determine the value of Herb's house**: 
   Herb paid $76,000 for his house. This is the value we will use for calculations.

2. **Calculate the value of Juan's house**:
   Juan's house is stated to be 30% less expensive than Herb's house. To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value.

   \[
   \text{30% of Herb's house} = 0.30 \times 76,000
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800
   \]

   This means Juan's house is $22,800 less expensive than Herb's house. To find the value of Juan's house, we subtract this amount from Herb's house value:

   \[
   \text{Value of Juan's house} = \text{Value of Herb's house} - \text{30% of Herb's house}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Value of Juan's house} = 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200
   \]

3. **Calculate the combined value of both houses**:
   Now that we have the values of both houses, we can find the combined value:

   \[
   \text{Combined value} = \text{Value of Herb's house} + \text{Value of Juan's house}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Combined value} = 76,000 + 53,200
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition:

   \[
   76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   The combined value of Juan's and Herb's houses is:

   \[
   \boxed{129,200}
   \]
