Question ID: 791

Question:
A train has 172 people traveling on it. At the first stop 47 people get off and 13 more people get on, and at the next stop another 38 people get off. How many people are on the train?


Reference Answer:
At the first stop 172 people - 47 people = <<172-47=125>>125 people are on the train.
Then 13 more people get on increasing it to 125 people + 13 people = <<13+125=138>>138 people.
At the next stop 138 people - 38 people = <<138-38=100>>100 people remain on the train.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will track the number of people on the train step by step, starting with the initial number of passengers and adjusting for the people getting off and on at each stop.

1. **Initial number of people on the train**: 
   \[
   \text{Initial number} = 172
   \]

2. **First stop**:
   - **People getting off**: 47
   - **People getting on**: 13

   We will calculate the number of people after the first stop:
   - First, we subtract the number of people getting off from the initial number:
   \[
   172 - 47 = 125
   \]
   - Next, we add the number of people getting on:
   \[
   125 + 13 = 138
   \]

   After the first stop, the number of people on the train is:
   \[
   \text{People after first stop} = 138
   \]

3. **Second stop**:
   - **People getting off**: 38

   Now, we will calculate the number of people after the second stop:
   - We subtract the number of people getting off from the number of people after the first stop:
   \[
   138 - 38 = 100
   \]

   After the second stop, the number of people on the train is:
   \[
   \text{People after second stop} = 100
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   The total number of people remaining on the train after both stops is:
   \[
   \boxed{100}
   \]
