Question ID: 577

Question:
Mack wants to count things and decided to count how many birds there are in the sky over the next week. On days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds. On day three he saw none. On days four and five, he saw 120 birds. On day six he saw 20 and on day seven he saw 90. On average, how many birds did Mack see in a day?


Reference Answer:
On days one to three, Mack saw 50+0=<<50+0=50>>50 birds.
On days four to seven, he saw 120+20+90=<<120+20+90=230>>230 birds.
For the whole week he saw 230+50=<<230+50=280>>280 birds.
On average Mack saw 280/7=<<280/7=40>>40 birds a day.

Response:
To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day over the week, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw during the week and then divide that by the number of days (which is 7).

Let's break down the information given:

1. **Days 1 and 2**: Mack saw a total of 50 birds.
2. **Day 3**: Mack saw 0 birds.
3. **Days 4 and 5**: Mack saw a total of 120 birds.
4. **Day 6**: Mack saw 20 birds.
5. **Day 7**: Mack saw 90 birds.

Now, we will sum the number of birds seen each day:

- **Days 1 and 2**: 50 birds
- **Day 3**: 0 birds
- **Days 4 and 5**: 120 birds
- **Day 6**: 20 birds
- **Day 7**: 90 birds

Now we can calculate the total number of birds seen over the week:

\[
\text{Total birds} = \text{Birds on Days 1 and 2} + \text{Birds on Day 3} + \text{Birds on Days 4 and 5} + \text{Birds on Day 6} + \text{Birds on Day 7}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total birds} = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90
\]

Now we perform the addition step by step:

1. \(50 + 0 = 50\)
2. \(50 + 120 = 170\)
3. \(170 + 20 = 190\)
4. \(190 + 90 = 280\)

So, the total number of birds Mack saw over the week is:

\[
\text{Total birds} = 280
\]

Next, we calculate the average number of birds seen per day. The average is calculated by dividing the total number of birds by the number of days:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total birds}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{280}{7}
\]

Now we perform the division:

\[
\frac{280}{7} = 40
\]

Thus, the average number of birds Mack saw in a day is:

\[
\boxed{40}
\]
