Question ID: 1234

Question:
Regina wrote 9 novels last year. If this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, how many novels has she written this year?


Reference Answer:
Number of novels she wrote last year = (3/4)*number of novels she wrote this year
9 = (3/4)*number of novels she wrote this year
Multiplying both sides by 4/3 gives the number of novels she has written this year = (4/3)*9 = <<4/3*9=12>>12 novels
#### 12

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many novels Regina has written this year based on the information given.

1. **Understanding the relationship**: We know that Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and this number represents 3 quarters (or \( \frac{3}{4} \)) of the number of novels she has written this year. 

2. **Setting up the equation**: Let \( x \) be the number of novels Regina has written this year. According to the problem, we can express the relationship as:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} x = 9
   \]

3. **Solving for \( x \)**: To find \( x \), we need to isolate it. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{4}{3} \) to get rid of the fraction:
   \[
   x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3}
   \]

4. **Calculating the right side**: Now we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{9 \times 4}{3} = \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, Regina has written \( 12 \) novels this year.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
