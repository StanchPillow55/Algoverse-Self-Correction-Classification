Question:
Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week for his drawing. If there are 30 sheets of paper on a pad of paper, how many sheets of paper does he use every month?

Response:
To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we can break the problem down into several steps.

1. **Determine the number of pads of paper Miguel uses in a month**:
   - Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week.
   - There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.

   To find the number of pads he uses in a month, we multiply the number of pads he uses per week by the number of weeks in a month:

   \[
   \text{Pads per month} = \text{Pads per week} \times \text{Weeks per month} = 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 8 \text{ pads/month}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of sheets of paper used in a month**:
   - Each pad contains 30 sheets of paper.
   - Now we can find the total number of sheets used in a month by multiplying the number of pads used in a month by the number of sheets per pad:

   \[
   \text{Sheets per month} = \text{Pads per month} \times \text{Sheets per pad} = 8 \text{ pads/month} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad}
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Sheets per month} = 8 \times 30 = 240 \text{ sheets}
   \]

3. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month is 

   \[
   \boxed{240}
   \]
