Response:
To determine how many candy bars Marissa bought for her brother Jimmy, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of money Marissa had left after buying the ball.**
   - Marissa initially had $80.
   - She spent $20 on the ball.
   - To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the cost of the ball from the total amount she had:
     \[
     \text{Money left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Cost of the ball} = 80 - 20 = 60
     \]

2. **Determine how many candy bars she can buy with the remaining money.**
   - The price of each candy bar is $5.
   - To find out how many candy bars she can buy, we divide the amount of money she has left by the price of one candy bar:
     \[
     \text{Number of candy bars} = \frac{\text{Money left}}{\text{Price per candy bar}} = \frac{60}{5}
     \]

3. **Perform the division to find the number of candy bars.**
   - Calculating the division:
     \[
     \frac{60}{5} = 12
     \]

Thus, Marissa bought **12 candy bars** for her brother Jimmy.

**Final Answer: 12**
