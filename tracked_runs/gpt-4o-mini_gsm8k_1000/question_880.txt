Question ID: 68

Question:
There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 girls and 5 students to every teacher, how many teachers are there?


Reference Answer:
There are twice as many boys as girls, so if there are 60 girls, there are 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 boys
There are 120 + 60 = <<120+60=180>>180 students in total
If there are 5 students to each teacher, then 180 students would need 180/5 = <<180/5=36>>36 teachers
#### 36

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of boys and girls**: 
   We know from the problem statement that there are 60 girls at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

   So, there are 120 boys at the school.

2. **Calculate the total number of students**:
   Now, we can find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls together:

   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} = 120 + 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Determine the number of teachers**:
   The problem states that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

   \[
   \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Students per teacher}} = \frac{180}{5}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \frac{180}{5} = 36
   \]

Thus, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is \( \boxed{36} \).
