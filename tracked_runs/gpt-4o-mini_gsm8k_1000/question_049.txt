Question:
90 single use contacts come in 1 box and will last Pete 45 days.  Each box is $100.00 and currently 10% off.  If he buys 2 boxes of contact, how much will each pair of contacts cost?


Reference Answer:
Each box of contacts is $100.00 with 10% off so that's 100*.10 = $<<100*.10=10.00>>10.00 off
So the box was $100.00 and he has $10.00 off so each box will cost 100-10 = $<<100-10=90.00>>90.00
He buys 2 boxes and each box costs $90.00 so that's 2*90= $<<2*90=180.00>>180.00
1 box of contacts has 90 contacts and he buys 2 boxes so that's 90*2 = <<90*2=180>>180 contacts
He needs 1 contact for each eye and he has 180 contacts so that's 180/2 = <<180/2=90>>90 pairs of contacts
He spent $180.00 to have 90 pairs of contacts so each pair of contacts costs 180/90 = $<<180/90=2.00>>2.00 a pair

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts after the discount.**
2. **Calculate the total number of contacts in 2 boxes.**
3. **Find the cost per pair of contacts.**

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of 2 boxes after the discount

The original price of one box of contacts is $100.00. Since there is a 10% discount, we first need to calculate the discount amount:

\[
\text{Discount} = 10\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.10 \times 100 = 10
\]

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price of one box:

\[
\text{Sale Price of One Box} = 100 - 10 = 90
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 2 boxes:

\[
\text{Total Cost for 2 Boxes} = 2 \times 90 = 180
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of contacts in 2 boxes

Each box contains 90 single-use contacts. Therefore, the total number of contacts in 2 boxes is:

\[
\text{Total Contacts} = 2 \times 90 = 180
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost per pair of contacts

A pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts. To find out how many pairs are in 180 contacts, we divide the total number of contacts by 2:

\[
\text{Number of Pairs} = \frac{180}{2} = 90
\]

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts by dividing the total cost of the 2 boxes by the number of pairs:

\[
\text{Cost per Pair} = \frac{\text{Total Cost for 2 Boxes}}{\text{Number of Pairs}} = \frac{180}{90} = 2
\]

### Final Answer

The cost of each pair of contacts is **$2.00**.
