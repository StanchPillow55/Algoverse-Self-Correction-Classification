Question ID: 1133

Question:
Grandma walks 3 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 2 miles of walking on the beach and 1 mile of walking on the sidewalk.  On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach.  If 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, in minutes?


Reference Answer:
On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.
To walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Grandma 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to walk her favorite route.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it takes Grandma to complete her entire 3-mile walk, given the information about her walking speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

1. **Identify the distances and speeds**:
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - Let \( v \) be Grandma's walking speed on the beach (in miles per minute).
   - Therefore, her walking speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v \) (since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk).

2. **Calculate the time spent on the beach**:
   - We know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.
   - The distance she walks on the beach is 2 miles.
   - Using the formula for time, \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \), we can express the time spent on the beach as:
     \[
     \text{Time on beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{v} = 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - From this equation, we can solve for \( v \):
     \[
     2 = 40v \implies v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk**:
   - The distance Grandma walks on the sidewalk is 1 mile.
   - Her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \).
   - Now we can calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk:
     \[
     \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 1 \times 10 = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk**:
   - The total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total time it takes Grandma to complete her entire 3-mile walk is:
     \[
     \boxed{50} \text{ minutes}
     \]
