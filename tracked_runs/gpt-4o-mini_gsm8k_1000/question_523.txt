Question ID: 1269

Question:
Elvis starts driving from his house and travels west for 5 hours. Then he turns around and travels east for 8 hours. If he was driving at an average speed of 18mph for both parts of the journey, how far is he from his house now?


Reference Answer:
During the first part of the journey he travels west for 5 hours at a speed of 18mph so he covered a distance of 5*18 = <<5*18=90>>90 miles
Then he travels east at the same speed for 8 hours so he covered a distance of 8*18 = <<8*18=144>>144 miles
His distance from his house now is the difference between his east and west movements which is 144-90 = <<144-90=54>>54 miles

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how far Elvis is from his house after completing his journey.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled west:**
   - Elvis drives west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 miles per hour (mph).
   - The formula to calculate distance is:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Therefore, the distance traveled west is:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_{\text{west}} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled east:**
   - After traveling west, Elvis turns around and drives east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18 mph.
   - Using the same distance formula, the distance traveled east is:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_{\text{east}} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 144 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Determine his final position relative to his starting point:**
   - Initially, Elvis was 90 miles west of his house.
   - After driving 144 miles east, we need to calculate his total displacement from his house:
     - He first travels 90 miles west (which we can consider as -90 miles).
     - Then he travels 144 miles east (which we can consider as +144 miles).
   - The total displacement from his house is:
     \[
     \text{Total Displacement} = -90 + 144 = 54 \, \text{miles}
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the total displacement is positive, it indicates that Elvis is 54 miles east of his house.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Elvis is 54 miles from his house.}
\]
