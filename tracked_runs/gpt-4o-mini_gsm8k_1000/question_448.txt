Question:
Brady is counting the money in his piggy bank. He has 100 pennies, 40 nickels, 20 dimes, and 40 pieces of dollar bills. How much does Brady have in his piggy bank in dollars?


Reference Answer:
Since a penny is 1 cent, then 100 pennies is equal to 100 x 1 cent = <<100=100>>100 cents.
Since nickel is 5 cents, then 40 nickels is equal to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents.
Since a dime is equal to 10 cents, then 20 dimes are equal to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.
So, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.
Since a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.
Thus, Brady has a total of $40 + $5 = $<<40+5=45>>45 in his piggy bank.

Response:
To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill he has, and then sum these values.

1. **Calculate the value of the pennies:**
   - Brady has 100 pennies.
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Therefore, the total value of the pennies is:
     \[
     100 \text{ pennies} \times 0.01 \text{ dollars/penny} = 1.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the value of the nickels:**
   - Brady has 40 nickels.
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Therefore, the total value of the nickels is:
     \[
     40 \text{ nickels} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/nickel} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the value of the dimes:**
   - Brady has 20 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Therefore, the total value of the dimes is:
     \[
     20 \text{ dimes} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/dime} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the value of the dollar bills:**
   - Brady has 40 dollar bills.
   - Each dollar bill is worth $1.00.
   - Therefore, the total value of the dollar bills is:
     \[
     40 \text{ dollar bills} \times 1.00 \text{ dollars/bill} = 40.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Sum the total values:**
   - Now we add up all the values calculated:
     \[
     \text{Total} = \text{Value of pennies} + \text{Value of nickels} + \text{Value of dimes} + \text{Value of dollar bills}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total} = 1.00 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 40.00
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total} = 45.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank is **$45.00**. 

Final answer: **$45.00**

Response:
To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we will calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill he has, and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the value of the pennies:**
   - Brady has 100 pennies.
   - The value of 1 penny is $0.01.
   - Total value of pennies = 100 pennies × $0.01/penny = $1.00.

2. **Calculate the value of the nickels:**
   - Brady has 40 nickels.
   - The value of 1 nickel is $0.05.
   - Total value of nickels = 40 nickels × $0.05/nickel = $2.00.

3. **Calculate the value of the dimes:**
   - Brady has 20 dimes.
   - The value of 1 dime is $0.10.
   - Total value of dimes = 20 dimes × $0.10/dime = $2.00.

4. **Calculate the value of the dollar bills:**
   - Brady has 40 dollar bills.
   - The value of 1 dollar bill is $1.00.
   - Total value of dollar bills = 40 bills × $1.00/bill = $40.00.

5. **Sum all the values:**
   - Total value = Value of pennies + Value of nickels + Value of dimes + Value of dollar bills
   - Total value = $1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00.

Thus, the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank is **$45.00**.
