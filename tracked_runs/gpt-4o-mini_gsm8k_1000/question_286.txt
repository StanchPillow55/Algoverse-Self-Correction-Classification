Question:
Greta wanted brownies for her birthday.  She made a batch for herself; one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.  At her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.  When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting.  During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.  How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire day?


Reference Answer:
Her office sent her home with a 1/2 dozen brownies so she had 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 individual brownies
Her friends had 4 dozen brownies and 1 1/2 dozen were eaten so 4-1.5 = <<4-1.5=2.5>>2.5 dozen brownies left
She made 1 dozen brownies and had 2.5 dozen left from the party so 1+2.5 = <<1+2.5=3.5>>3.5 dozen brownies
Every dozen is 12 and she has 3.5 dozen so she has 12*3.5 = <<12*3.5=42>>42 individuals brownies
She has 42 individual brownies plus the 6 individual brownies sent home from work so she has a total of 42+6 = <<42+6=48>>48 individual brownies
#### 48

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the total number of brownies Greta had and how many were consumed during the day.

1. **Brownies Greta made for herself:**
   - Greta made 1 dozen brownies.
   - Since 1 dozen equals 12, she made:
     \[
     12 \text{ brownies}
     \]

2. **Brownies from the office party:**
   - Greta received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office party.
   - Since 1/2 dozen equals 6, she received:
     \[
     6 \text{ brownies}
     \]

3. **Brownies from her friends' surprise party:**
   - Greta's friends brought her 4 dozen brownies.
   - Since 4 dozen equals 48, she received:
     \[
     48 \text{ brownies}
     \]

4. **Total brownies before the party:**
   - We will now add the brownies Greta made, the ones she received from the office, and the ones from her friends:
     \[
     12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \text{ brownies}
     \]

5. **Brownies eaten during the party:**
   - During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   - Since 1 1/2 dozen equals 12 + 6 = 18, the number of brownies eaten is:
     \[
     18 \text{ brownies}
     \]

6. **Calculating brownies left over:**
   - To find out how many brownies Greta had left after the party, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she had:
     \[
     66 - 18 = 48 \text{ brownies}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Greta has **48 individual brownies left over from the entire day**.
