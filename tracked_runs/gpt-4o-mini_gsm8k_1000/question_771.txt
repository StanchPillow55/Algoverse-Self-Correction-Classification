Question ID: 1089

Question:
Nathan has a bouncy ball that bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. If he drops it from the third-floor balcony in the mall, where each story is 24 feet high, how high does the ball go on its second bounce?


Reference Answer:
First find the total height from which Nathan drops the ball: 24 feet/story * 3 stories = <<24*3=72>>72 feet
Then multiply that number by 2/3rds to find the height of the ball after one bounce: 72 feet * 2/3 = <<72*2/3=48>>48 feet
Then multiply that number by 2/3rds to find the height of the ball after two bounces: 48 feet * 2/3 = <<48*2/3=32>>32 feet
#### 32

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how high the bouncy ball goes on its second bounce after being dropped from a height. 

### Step 1: Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.

Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony. Each story is 24 feet high, and since he is on the third floor, we can calculate the height as follows:

\[
\text{Initial height} = \text{Number of stories} \times \text{Height per story}
\]
\[
\text{Initial height} = 3 \times 24 \text{ feet} = 72 \text{ feet}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the height of the first bounce.

The ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, the height of the first bounce can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Height of first bounce} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Initial height}
\]
\[
\text{Height of first bounce} = \frac{2}{3} \times 72 \text{ feet}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Height of first bounce} = \frac{144}{3} = 48 \text{ feet}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the height of the second bounce.

Now we need to find the height of the second bounce, which is again \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the height of the first bounce:

\[
\text{Height of second bounce} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Height of first bounce}
\]
\[
\text{Height of second bounce} = \frac{2}{3} \times 48 \text{ feet}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Height of second bounce} = \frac{96}{3} = 32 \text{ feet}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:

\[
\boxed{32 \text{ feet}}
\]
