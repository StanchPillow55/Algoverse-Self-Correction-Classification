Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many lollipops Ray shared**: 
   Ray starts with a total of 25 lollipops. He decides to keep 5 lollipops for himself. Therefore, the number of lollipops he shares with his friends can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Lollipops shared} = \text{Total lollipops} - \text{Lollipops kept}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Lollipops shared} = 25 - 5 = 20
   \]

2. **Calculate how many friends Ray shares with**: 
   Ray shares the lollipops equally with his four friends. This means there are a total of 4 friends.

3. **Determine how many lollipops each friend receives**: 
   To find out how many lollipops each friend receives, we divide the total number of lollipops shared by the number of friends:

   \[
   \text{Lollipops per friend} = \frac{\text{Lollipops shared}}{\text{Number of friends}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Lollipops per friend} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Each of Ray's friends receives 5 lollipops.

Thus, the final answer is:

**Each friend receives 5 lollipops.**
