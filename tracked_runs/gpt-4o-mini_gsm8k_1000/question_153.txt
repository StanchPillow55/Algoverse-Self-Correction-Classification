Question ID: 790

Question:
At the trip to the county-level scavenger hunt competition, 90 people were required to split into groups for the competition to begin. To break people up into smaller groups with different leaders, 9-person groups were formed. If 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each, how many seashells did they bring?


Reference Answer:
Since the total number of people at the competition was 90, they formed 90/9=<<90/9=10>>10 groups after splitting into 9-person groups.
If 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bringing back 2 seashells each, then 3/5*10=<<3/5*10=6>>6 groups had members bringing back 2 seashells.
Since each group had 9 people, the number of people in the 6 groups, who found 2 seashells each, was 6*9= <<6*9=54>>54.
The total number of seashells the 54 people brought is 54*2=<<54*2=108>>108 seashells.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of groups formed:**
   We know that there are 90 people and each group consists of 9 people. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:

   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total people}}{\text{People per group}} = \frac{90}{9} = 10
   \]

   So, there are 10 groups formed.

2. **Calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells:**
   According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total number of groups brought back seashells. We need to find \( \frac{3}{5} \) of 10 groups:

   \[
   \text{Groups that brought back seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
   \]

   Thus, 6 groups brought back seashells.

3. **Determine the total number of seashells brought back:**
   Each member of the groups that brought back seashells contributed 2 seashells. Since each group has 9 members, the total number of members in the 6 groups is:

   \[
   \text{Total members in 6 groups} = 6 \times 9 = 54
   \]

   Now, we calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these 54 members, where each member brings back 2 seashells:

   \[
   \text{Total seashells} = \text{Total members} \times \text{Seashells per member} = 54 \times 2 = 108
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

   \[
   \boxed{108}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total number of people}}{\text{Number of people per group}} = \frac{90}{9} = 10
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells**:
   According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total number of groups brought back seashells. We need to calculate \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the 10 groups:

   \[
   \text{Groups bringing back seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
   \]

3. **Determine the number of seashells brought back**:
   Each member of the groups that brought back seashells contributed 2 seashells. Since there are 6 groups and each group has 9 members, we first calculate the total number of members in these 6 groups:

   \[
   \text{Total members in 6 groups} = 6 \text{ groups} \times 9 \text{ members/group} = 54 \text{ members}
   \]

   Now, we can calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these members:

   \[
   \text{Total seashells} = \text{Total members} \times \text{Seashells per member} = 54 \text{ members} \times 2 \text{ seashells/member} = 108 \text{ seashells}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back by the members of the groups is:

   \[
   \boxed{108}
   \]

   \]

   Now, we calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these members:

   \[
   \text{Total seashells} = 54 \text{ members} \times 2 \text{ seashells/member} = 108 \text{ seashells}
   \]
