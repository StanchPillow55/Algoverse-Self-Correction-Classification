Question ID: 378

Question:
Lindsay is doing the laundry, and thinks she has missed some socks. There are 50 socks that need washing. If she washes 10 pairs of socks and 15 loose socks, how many socks has Lindsay missed?


Reference Answer:
Splitting the pairs shows there were 10 pairs of socks * 2 socks/pair = <<10*2=20>>20 socks paired together.
This means she has washed a total of 20 paired socks + 15 loose socks = <<20+15=35>>35 socks.
She has therefore missed 50 socks â€“ 35 socks = <<50-35=15>>15 socks.
#### 15

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many socks Lindsay has washed and how many she has missed.

1. **Understanding the total number of socks**: 
   Lindsay has a total of 50 socks that need washing.

2. **Calculating the number of socks washed**:
   - Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair consists of 2 socks, the total number of socks in 10 pairs is:
     \[
     10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks/pair} = 20 \text{ socks}
     \]
   - Additionally, she washes 15 loose socks. 

3. **Total socks washed**:
   To find the total number of socks that Lindsay has washed, we add the socks from the pairs and the loose socks:
   \[
   20 \text{ socks (from pairs)} + 15 \text{ socks (loose)} = 35 \text{ socks}
   \]

4. **Calculating the number of socks missed**:
   To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks washed from the total number of socks:
   \[
   50 \text{ total socks} - 35 \text{ socks washed} = 15 \text{ socks missed}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the number of socks that Lindsay has missed is:
   \[
   \boxed{15}
   \]
