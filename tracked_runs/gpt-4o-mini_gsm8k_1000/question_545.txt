Response:
To find out how much Mark makes in a week after his pay raise, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine Mark's new hourly wage**: 
   - Mark's previous hourly wage was $10.
   - His pay was raised by $2 per hour.
   - Therefore, his new hourly wage is:
     \[
     10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total hours Mark works in a week**:
   - Mark works 8 hours a day.
   - He works 5 days a week.
   - To find the total hours worked in a week, we multiply the number of hours per day by the number of days:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

3. **Calculate Mark's weekly earnings**:
   - Now that we know his new hourly wage and the total hours he works in a week, we can calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his hourly wage by the total hours worked:
     \[
     12 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 480 \text{ dollars/week}
     \]

Thus, Mark makes **$480 per week** after his pay raise.

Final answer: **$480**
