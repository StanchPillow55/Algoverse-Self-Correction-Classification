Question ID: 156

Question:
The zookeeper feeds all the apes in the zoo. He orders all the bananas from a local farm every 2 months. If the monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas need 400 bananas, and the baboons need 100 bananas every month, how many bananas does he need to order to last for 2 months?


Reference Answer:
The total number of bananas the prime apes need every month is 200+400+100= <<200+400+100=700>>700.
Therefore in 2 months, the total number of bananas they need is 700x2= <<700*2=1400>>1400.
#### 1400

Response:
To determine how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required by each type of ape for one month and then multiply that by 2.

1. **Calculate the monthly banana requirement for each type of ape:**
   - **Monkeys:** 200 bananas per month
   - **Gorillas:** 400 bananas per month
   - **Baboons:** 100 bananas per month

2. **Calculate the total banana requirement for one month:**
   \[
   \text{Total bananas for one month} = \text{Bananas for monkeys} + \text{Bananas for gorillas} + \text{Bananas for baboons}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total bananas for one month} = 200 + 400 + 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total bananas for one month} = 700 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total banana requirement for 2 months:**
   \[
   \text{Total bananas for 2 months} = \text{Total bananas for one month} \times 2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total bananas for 2 months} = 700 \times 2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total bananas for 2 months} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
   \]

Thus, the zookeeper needs to order **1400 bananas** to last for 2 months.

**Final Answer: 1400 bananas**
