Jordan has 2 children who wear diapers.  Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.  Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.  How many diapers does Jordan change per day?


Reference Answer:
Jordan has 2 children, each requiring 5 diaper changes per day, for a total of 5*2=<<2*5=10>>10 diaper changes per day.
Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, leaving Jordan to change the other half, for a total of 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 diaper changes per day that Jordan is responsible for.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day based on the information provided.

1. **Calculate the total number of diaper changes per day for both children**:
   - Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.
   - Since Jordan has 2 children, we can calculate the total diaper changes as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total diaper changes} = \text{Number of children} \times \text{Diaper changes per child}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total diaper changes} = 2 \times 5 = 10
     \]

2. **Determine how many diapers Jordan's wife changes**:
   - It is stated that Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.
   - To find out how many diapers she changes, we calculate half of the total diaper changes:
     \[
     \text{Diapers changed by wife} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Total diaper changes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Diapers changed by wife} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5
     \]

3. **Calculate how many diapers Jordan changes**:
   - Since the total number of diaper changes is 10 and his wife changes 5 of them, we can find out how many diapers Jordan changes by subtracting the number of diapers changed by his wife from the total:
     \[
     \text{Diapers changed by Jordan} = \text{Total diaper changes} - \text{Diapers changed by wife}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Diapers changed by Jordan} = 10 - 5 = 5
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of diapers that Jordan changes per day is:
     \[
     \boxed{5}
     \]
