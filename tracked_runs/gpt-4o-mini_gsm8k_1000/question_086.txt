Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial number of roses Patricia has.**
   - Patricia starts with 30 roses.

2. **Determine how many roses she gives away.**
   - Patricia gives 24 roses to her mother.

3. **Calculate the number of roses Patricia has after giving some away.**
   - To find out how many roses she has left after giving away 24, we subtract the number of roses given away from the initial amount:
   \[
   \text{Roses left} = \text{Initial roses} - \text{Roses given away}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Roses left} = 30 - 24 = 6
   \]

4. **Determine how many roses Patricia buys.**
   - Patricia buys 15 more roses.

5. **Calculate the total number of roses Patricia has now.**
   - To find the total number of roses after buying more, we add the number of roses she bought to the number of roses she has left:
   \[
   \text{Total roses now} = \text{Roses left} + \text{Roses bought}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total roses now} = 6 + 15 = 21
   \]

Thus, after following all the steps and calculations, we find that Patricia now has a total of 21 roses.

**Final Answer: 21 roses**
