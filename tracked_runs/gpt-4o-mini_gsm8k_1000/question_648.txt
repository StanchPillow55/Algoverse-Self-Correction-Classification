Question ID: 703

Question:
Larry cooked dumplings for a group of friends.  There are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females among them. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. How many dumplings did Larry cook if each female ate 3 dumplings and there were no leftovers?


Reference Answer:
So each male ate 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 dumplings.
Hence, the 8 males ate a total of 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 dumplings.
The 6 females ate a total of 6 x 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 dumplings.
So, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is 18 + 32 = <<18+32=50>>50.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many dumplings Larry cooked based on the information provided about the number of males and females, as well as their eating habits.

1. **Identify the number of males and females**:
   - There are 8 males (including Larry).
   - There are 6 females.

2. **Determine how many dumplings each female ate**:
   - Each female ate 3 dumplings.

3. **Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by females**:
   \[
   \text{Total dumplings eaten by females} = \text{Number of females} \times \text{Dumplings per female}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total dumplings eaten by females} = 6 \times 3 = 18
   \]

4. **Determine how many dumplings each male ate**:
   - Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
   - Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate:
   \[
   \text{Dumplings per male} = 3 + 1 = 4
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by males**:
   \[
   \text{Total dumplings eaten by males} = \text{Number of males} \times \text{Dumplings per male}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total dumplings eaten by males} = 8 \times 4 = 32
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry**:
   - Since there are no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked is the sum of dumplings eaten by males and females:
   \[
   \text{Total dumplings cooked} = \text{Total dumplings eaten by females} + \text{Total dumplings eaten by males}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total dumplings cooked} = 18 + 32 = 50
   \]

Thus, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is \( \boxed{50} \).
