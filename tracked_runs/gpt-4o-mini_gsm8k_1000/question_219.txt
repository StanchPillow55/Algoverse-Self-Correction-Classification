Question ID: 186

Question:
Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?


Reference Answer:
In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.
Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw â€“ 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.
This means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many rats are in each cage given the total distribution of straw among the rodents. Let's break down the information provided step by step.

1. **Understanding the distribution of straw**:
   - **Rats**: There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw.
   - **Hamsters**: There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
   - **Rabbits**: A pen of rabbits receives a total of 20 pieces of straw.

2. **Setting up the equations**:
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - The total number of rats is \( 3r \) (since there are 3 cages).
   - The total straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \) pieces of straw.
   
   - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage.
   - The total number of hamsters is \( 10h \) (since there are 10 cages).
   - The total straw given to the hamsters is \( 10h \times 5 = 50h \) pieces of straw.

3. **Total straw distributed**:
   - The total straw distributed among all rodents is given as 160 pieces.
   - Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   18r + 50h + 20 = 160
   \]

4. **Simplifying the equation**:
   - First, we can subtract the straw given to the rabbits from both sides:
   \[
   18r + 50h = 160 - 20
   \]
   \[
   18r + 50h = 140
   \]

5. **Finding integer solutions**:
   - We can rearrange the equation to express \( h \) in terms of \( r \):
   \[
   50h = 140 - 18r
   \]
   \[
   h = \frac{140 - 18r}{50}
   \]

   - For \( h \) to be an integer, \( 140 - 18r \) must be divisible by 50. We can test integer values for \( r \) to find valid solutions.

6. **Testing values for \( r \)**:
   - **If \( r = 0 \)**:
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(0)}{50} = \frac{140}{50} = 2.8 \quad (\text{not an integer})
     \]
   - **If \( r = 1 \)**:
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(1)}{50} = \frac{140 - 18}{50} = \frac{122}{50} = 2.44 \quad (\text{not an integer})
     \]
   - **If \( r = 2 \)**:
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(2)}{50} = \frac{140 - 36}{50} = \frac{104}{50} = 2.08 \quad (\text{not an integer})
     \]
   - **If \( r = 3 \)**:
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(3)}{50} = \frac{140 - 54}{50} = \frac{86}{50} = 1.72 \quad (\text{not an integer})
     \]
   - **If \( r = 4 \)**:
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(4)}{50} = \frac{140 - 72}{50} = \frac{68}{50} = 1.36 \quad (\text{not an integer})
     \]
   - **If \( r = 5 \)**:
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(5)}{50} = \frac{140 - 90}{50} = \frac{50}{50} = 1 \quad (\text{integer})
     \]
   - **If \( r = 6 \)**:
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(6)}{50} = \frac{140 - 108}{50} = \frac{32}{50} = 0.64 \quad (\text{not an integer})
     \]
   - **If \( r = 7 \)**:
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(7)}{50} = \frac{140 - 126}{50} = \frac{14}{50} = 0.28 \quad (\text{not an integer})
     \]
   - **If \( r = 8 \)**:
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(8)}{50} = \frac{140 - 144}{50} = \frac{-4}{50} \quad (\text{not an integer})
     \]

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The only integer solution found is when \( r = 5 \) and \( h = 1 \).
   - Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \( \boxed{5} \).

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to break down the distribution of straw among the different types of rodents and set up an equation based on the total amount of straw distributed.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw.
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
   - The rabbits receive a total of 20 pieces of straw.

2. **Calculate the total straw distributed to the rats:**
   - The total number of rats is \( 3r \) (3 cages with \( r \) rats each).
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw for the rats is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for rats} = 3r \times 6 = 18r
     \]

3. **Calculate the total straw distributed to the hamsters:**
   - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage.
   - The total number of hamsters is \( 10h \) (10 cages with \( h \) hamsters each).
   - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, so the total straw for the hamsters is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10h \times 5 = 50h
     \]

4. **Total straw distributed:**
   - The total straw distributed among all rodents is given as 160 pieces. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     18r + 50h + 20 = 160
     \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Subtract 20 from both sides:
     \[
     18r + 50h = 140
     \]

6. **Express \( h \) in terms of \( r \):**
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     50h = 140 - 18r
     \]
   - Dividing by 50:
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18r}{50}
     \]

7. **Finding integer solutions:**
   - Since \( h \) must be a non-negative integer, \( 140 - 18r \) must be non-negative and divisible by 50.
   - We can test integer values for \( r \) to find suitable values for \( h \).

8. **Testing values for \( r \):**
   - **If \( r = 0 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(0)}{50} = \frac{140}{50} = 2.8 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - **If \( r = 1 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(1)}{50} = \frac{122}{50} = 2.44 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - **If \( r = 2 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(2)}{50} = \frac{104}{50} = 2.08 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - **If \( r = 3 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(3)}{50} = \frac{86}{50} = 1.72 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - **If \( r = 4 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(4)}{50} = \frac{68}{50} = 1.36 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - **If \( r = 5 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(5)}{50} = \frac{50}{50} = 1 \quad \text{(integer)}
     \]
   - **If \( r = 6 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(6)}{50} = \frac{32}{50} = 0.64 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - **If \( r = 7 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(7)}{50} = \frac{14}{50} = 0.28 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

9. **Conclusion:**
   - The only integer solution found is when \( r = 5 \) and \( h = 1 \).
   - Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
     \[
     \boxed{5}
     \]
