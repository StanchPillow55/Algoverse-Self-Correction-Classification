Question:
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.  They are currently on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00.  How much does he spend on yogurt over 30 days?


Reference Answer:
He eats 2 yogurts a day so over 30 days he will need 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 yogurts
The yogurt is sold as 4 units for $5.00 and he needs 60 yogurts so thatâ€™s 60/4 = <<60/4=15>>15 4-packs
Each 4-pack is $5.00 and he needs 15 4-packs so he will spend $5*15 = $<<5*15=75.00>>75.00 on yogurt

Response:
To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.**
   - Terry eats 2 yogurts per day.
   - Over 30 days, the total number of yogurts he eats is:
     \[
     \text{Total yogurts} = \text{Yogurts per day} \times \text{Number of days} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ yogurts}
     \]

2. **Determine how many packs of yogurts Terry needs to buy.**
   - The yogurts are sold in packs of 4.
   - To find out how many packs Terry needs, we divide the total number of yogurts by the number of yogurts per pack:
     \[
     \text{Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total yogurts}}{\text{Yogurts per pack}} = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \text{ packs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for the packs of yogurts.**
   - Each pack of 4 yogurts costs $5.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 15 packs is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Cost per pack} = 15 \times 5.00 = 75.00
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Terry spends a total of $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{75.00}
\]
