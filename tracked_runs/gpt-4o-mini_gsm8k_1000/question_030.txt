Question ID: 1110

Question:
Although Soledad works in a windowless office, she loves the outdoors. She will be on vacation for the entire month of June and cannot wait to hike 9,300 miles within that month. She is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. How many more miles per day must Soledad hike to complete her journey on time?


Reference Answer:
June has 30 days, so Soledad must hike 9,300 miles / 30 days = <<9300/30=310>>310 miles/day
Initially, she wanted to hike 2 times/day * 125 miles/time = <<2*125=250>>250 miles/day
To complete her journey, she must increase her hike by 310 miles/day - 250 miles/day = 60 miles/day
#### 60

Response:
To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey of 9,300 miles in June, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days in June**:
   June has 30 days.

2. **Determine the total distance Soledad plans to hike**:
   Soledad wants to hike a total of 9,300 miles.

3. **Calculate the distance she plans to hike each day**:
   Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total distance she plans to hike each day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance per day} = 125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total distance she would hike in June with her current plan**:
   If she hikes 250 miles each day for 30 days, the total distance she would hike is:
   \[
   \text{Total distance in June} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Determine how many more miles she needs to hike**:
   To find out how many more miles she needs to hike to reach her goal of 9,300 miles, we subtract the total distance she would hike with her current plan from her goal:
   \[
   \text{Additional miles needed} = 9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles}
   \]

6. **Calculate how many more miles she must hike per day**:
   To find out how many additional miles she needs to hike each day, we divide the additional miles needed by the number of days in June:
   \[
   \text{Additional miles per day} = \frac{1,800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   Soledad must hike an additional **60 miles per day** to complete her journey of 9,300 miles in June.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]
