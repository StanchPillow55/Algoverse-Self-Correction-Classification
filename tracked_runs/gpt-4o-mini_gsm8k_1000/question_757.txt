Question ID: 693

Question:
Brittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares. The comforter had 14 red squares, 4 more blue squares than red squares, 6 more green squares than blue squares, and 12 fewer white squares than green squares.  How many square feet is Brittany's comforter?


Reference Answer:
With 4 more blue than red squares, the comforter has 14+4=<<14+4=18>>18 blue squares.
With 6 more green than blue squares, the comforter has 24 green squares.
With 12 fewer white squares than green squares, the comforter has 12 white squares.
In total, the comforter has 14+18+24+12 = <<14+18+24+12=68>>68 squares that are 1-foot by 1-foot in size.
Since each square is 1-foot by 1-foot, then each square equals one square foot.
Thus, the comforter is 68 square feet.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of colored squares on Brittany's quilted comforter. We will do this step by step, calculating the number of squares of each color based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the number of red squares:**
   - The problem states that there are 14 red squares.
   \[
   \text{Red squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of blue squares:**
   - The problem states that there are 4 more blue squares than red squares. Therefore, we can calculate the number of blue squares as follows:
   \[
   \text{Blue squares} = \text{Red squares} + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of green squares:**
   - The problem states that there are 6 more green squares than blue squares. Therefore, we can calculate the number of green squares as follows:
   \[
   \text{Green squares} = \text{Blue squares} + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of white squares:**
   - The problem states that there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. Therefore, we can calculate the number of white squares as follows:
   \[
   \text{White squares} = \text{Green squares} - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of squares:**
   - Now that we have the number of squares of each color, we can find the total number of squares by adding them all together:
   \[
   \text{Total squares} = \text{Red squares} + \text{Blue squares} + \text{Green squares} + \text{White squares}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12
   \]

   Now, let's perform the addition step by step:
   - First, add the red and blue squares:
   \[
   14 + 18 = 32
   \]
   - Next, add the green squares:
   \[
   32 + 24 = 56
   \]
   - Finally, add the white squares:
   \[
   56 + 12 = 68
   \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - The total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter is:
   \[
   \boxed{68}
   \]
