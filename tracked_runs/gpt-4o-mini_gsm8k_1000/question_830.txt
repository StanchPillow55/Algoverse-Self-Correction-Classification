Question ID: 479

Question:
Tom decides to give his wife an anniversary getaway.  The plane tickets cost $5000 each.  The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal because it is a busy weekend.  The normal price is $1500 per day.  If they are there for 3 days how much did the trip cost?


Reference Answer:
The hotel room is 1500*.2=$<<1500*.2=300>>300 more expensive per night than normal
So they paid 1500+300=$<<1500+300=1800>>1800 per night
That means she paid 1800*3=$<<1800*3=5400>>5400
The plane tickets cost 5000*2=$<<5000*2=10000>>10,000
So the total cost is 10,000+5400=$<<10000+5400=15400>>15,400

Response:
To calculate the total cost of Tom's anniversary getaway, we need to break down the expenses into two main components: the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel stay.

### Step 1: Calculate the Cost of Plane Tickets
Tom is purchasing two plane tickets, each costing $5000. 

\[
\text{Cost of Plane Tickets} = 2 \times 5000 = 10000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Cost of the Hotel
The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. Since it is a busy weekend, the hotel price is 20% more expensive than normal.

First, we need to calculate the increase in the hotel price due to the 20% increase.

\[
\text{Increase} = 1500 \times 0.20 = 300
\]

Now, we add this increase to the normal price to find the new hotel price.

\[
\text{New Hotel Price} = 1500 + 300 = 1800
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the hotel stay over 3 days.

\[
\text{Cost of Hotel for 3 Days} = 1800 \times 3 = 5400
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost of the Trip
Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel to find the total cost of the trip.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Plane Tickets} + \text{Cost of Hotel}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 10000 + 5400 = 15400
\]

### Final Answer
The total cost of Tom's anniversary getaway is:

\[
\boxed{15400}
\]
