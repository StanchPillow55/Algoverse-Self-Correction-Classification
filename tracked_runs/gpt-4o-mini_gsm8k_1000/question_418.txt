Question:
Beatrice bought ten packets of crayons for her Art class. Six of the packets had eight pieces of colors each, and the other four packets had sixteen pieces of colors each. How many colors of crayons did Beatrice buy in all?


Reference Answer:
Six packets had 6 x 8 = <<6*8=48>>48 colors of crayons.
Four packets had 4 x 16 = <<4*16=64>>64 colors of crayons.
Therefore, Beatrice bought 48 + 64 = <<48+64=112>>112 colors of crayons in all.

Response:
To find out how many colors of crayons Beatrice bought in total, we will break the problem down into manageable steps.

1. **Identify the number of packets and the number of crayons in each type of packet**:
   - Beatrice bought a total of 10 packets of crayons.
   - Out of these, 6 packets had 8 pieces of colors each.
   - The remaining 4 packets had 16 pieces of colors each.

2. **Calculate the total number of crayons from the first type of packet (8 pieces each)**:
   - For the 6 packets with 8 pieces of colors:
   \[
   \text{Total crayons from these packets} = 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ pieces/packet} = 48 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of crayons from the second type of packet (16 pieces each)**:
   - For the 4 packets with 16 pieces of colors:
   \[
   \text{Total crayons from these packets} = 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ pieces/packet} = 64 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Add the total number of crayons from both types of packets**:
   - Now, we will add the total crayons from both types of packets to find the overall total:
   \[
   \text{Total crayons} = \text{Total from 8-piece packets} + \text{Total from 16-piece packets}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total crayons} = 48 \text{ pieces} + 64 \text{ pieces} = 112 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of colors of crayons that Beatrice bought is:
   \[
   \boxed{112}
   \]
