Question ID: 303

Question:
Elise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years. Each book sells at 20$, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. There are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45. What's the total amount of money she earned in the second year?


Reference Answer:
If her sales in the current year are 45, she sold 45*2 = <<45*2=90>>90 books in the first year.
The total number of books sold in the first and current year is 90+45 = <<90+45=135>>135.
The total number of books sold in the second year is 250 of the original number of books - 135 sold books - 50 unsold books = <<250-135-50=65>>65 books.
If each book sells at 20$, then she earned 20*65 = $<<20*65=1300>>1300 in the second year

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of books and the current unsold books**:
   - Total books: 250
   - Unsold books: 50
   - Therefore, the number of sold books so far is:
     \[
     \text{Sold books} = \text{Total books} - \text{Unsold books} = 250 - 50 = 200
     \]

2. **Determine the number of books sold this year**:
   - Books sold this year: 45

3. **Calculate the number of books sold in previous years**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the current year (this year), which we know is 45.
   - According to the problem, Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she sold this year. Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:
     \[
     \text{Books sold in the first year} = 2x = 2 \times 45 = 90
     \]
   - Let \( y \) be the number of books sold in the second year. We can now express the total number of books sold over the three years as:
     \[
     \text{Total sold} = \text{Books sold in the first year} + \text{Books sold in the second year} + \text{Books sold this year}
     \]
   - Plugging in the known values:
     \[
     200 = 90 + y + 45
     \]

4. **Solve for \( y \)**:
   \[
   200 = 90 + y + 45
   \]
   \[
   200 = 135 + y
   \]
   \[
   y = 200 - 135 = 65
   \]
   So, Elise sold 65 books in the second year.

5. **Calculate the total earnings from the second year**:
   - Each book sells for $20. Therefore, the total earnings from the second year can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from second year} = \text{Books sold in second year} \times \text{Price per book}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Earnings from second year} = 65 \times 20 = 1300
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \(\boxed{1300}\).
