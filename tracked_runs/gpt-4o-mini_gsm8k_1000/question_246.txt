Question ID: 141

Question:
There are 700 bees in a hive. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and there are twice as many babies as queens.  How many worker bees are there?


Reference Answer:
Let x represent the number of queens
Babies:2x
Workers:2(2x)=4x
Total:x+2x+4x=700
7x=700
x=<<100=100>>100 queen bees
Workers:4(100)=400 worker bees
#### 400

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to define variables for the different types of bees in the hive: worker bees, baby bees, and queen bees. Let's denote:

- \( W \) = number of worker bees
- \( B \) = number of baby bees
- \( Q \) = number of queen bees

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The total number of bees in the hive is 700:
   \[
   W + B + Q = 700
   \]

2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees:
   \[
   W = 2B
   \]

3. There are twice as many baby bees as queens:
   \[
   B = 2Q
   \]

Now, we can express \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \).

From the third equation, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[
B = 2Q
\]

Now, substituting \( B \) into the second equation to find \( W \):
\[
W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q
\]

Now we have \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \):
- \( W = 4Q \)
- \( B = 2Q \)

Next, we substitute these expressions for \( W \) and \( B \) back into the first equation:
\[
W + B + Q = 700
\]
Substituting \( W \) and \( B \):
\[
4Q + 2Q + Q = 700
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
7Q = 700
\]

Now, we can solve for \( Q \):
\[
Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100
\]

Now that we have \( Q \), we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
1. Calculate \( B \):
   \[
   B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200
   \]

2. Calculate \( W \):
   \[
   W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400
   \]

Finally, we summarize our findings:
- Number of worker bees \( W = 400 \)
- Number of baby bees \( B = 200 \)
- Number of queen bees \( Q = 100 \)

Thus, the number of worker bees in the hive is:
\[
\boxed{400}
\]
