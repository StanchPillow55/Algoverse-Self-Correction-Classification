Question ID: 103

Question:
A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. If the city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?


Reference Answer:
The city will be covered in 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 intervals of 10 minutes.
Thus, it will take 14 * 10 = <<14*10=140>>140 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.
#### 140

Response:
To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: The fog bank covers 3 miles of the city in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take to cover the entire width of the city, which is 42 miles.

2. **Calculate the number of segments**: Since the fog covers 3 miles at a time, we need to find out how many 3-mile segments fit into the total distance of 42 miles.

   \[
   \text{Number of segments} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Distance covered per segment}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles}} = 14
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time**: Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, we can find the total time by multiplying the number of segments by the time taken for each segment.

   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Number of segments} \times \text{Time per segment} = 14 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 140 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: Therefore, it will take a total of 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

\[
\text{Final answer: } 140 \text{ minutes}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, which is 42 miles across.

1. **Understanding the Rate of Coverage**:
   The problem states that the fog bank covers 3 miles of the city in 10 minutes. This gives us a rate of coverage.

   \[
   \text{Rate of coverage} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ miles per minute}
   \]

2. **Calculating the Total Time to Cover 42 Miles**:
   We need to find out how long it will take to cover the entire 42 miles. We can use the rate of coverage to find the total time.

   To find the time \( t \) in minutes to cover 42 miles, we can use the formula:

   \[
   t = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   t = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{0.3 \text{ miles per minute}}
   \]

3. **Performing the Calculation**:
   Now we perform the division:

   \[
   t = 42 \div 0.3
   \]

   To make the division easier, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimal:

   \[
   t = \frac{42 \times 10}{0.3 \times 10} = \frac{420}{3}
   \]

   Now, we divide 420 by 3:

   \[
   420 \div 3 = 140
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

\[
\text{Final Answer: } 140 \text{ minutes}
\]
