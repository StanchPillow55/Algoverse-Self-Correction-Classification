Question:
On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 the next day. If 1 cookie has 200 calories, how many more calories did Sue consume than her sister?


Reference Answer:
Sue’s Monday cookie intake is 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20.
Sue’s Tuesday cookie intake is 2*13 = <<2*13=26>>26.
Total cookies Sue consumed is 20+26 = <<20+26=46>>46.
Sue’s sister ate a total of 5+13 = <<5+13=18>>18 cookies.
Sue ate 46-18=<<46-18=28>>28 more cookies.
Sue consumed 28*200=<<28*200=5600>>5,600 more calories.
#### 5,600

Response:
To solve the problem, we will first determine how many cookies Sue ate on both Monday and Tuesday based on the information provided about her sister's cookie consumption.

1. **Determine the number of cookies Sue ate on Monday:**
   - Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday.
   - Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday.
   - Therefore, the number of cookies Sue ate on Monday is:
     \[
     \text{Sue's cookies on Monday} = 4 \times \text{Sister's cookies on Monday} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of cookies Sue ate on Tuesday:**
   - Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday.
   - Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the number of cookies Sue ate on Tuesday is:
     \[
     \text{Sue's cookies on Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Sister's cookies on Tuesday} = 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate over both days:**
   - Total cookies eaten by Sue:
     \[
     \text{Total cookies by Sue} = \text{Sue's cookies on Monday} + \text{Sue's cookies on Tuesday} = 20 + 26 = 46 \text{ cookies}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of cookies her sister ate over both days:**
   - Total cookies eaten by her sister:
     \[
     \text{Total cookies by Sister} = \text{Sister's cookies on Monday} + \text{Sister's cookies on Tuesday} = 5 + 13 = 18 \text{ cookies}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister:**
   - Each cookie has 200 calories.
   - Total calories consumed by Sue:
     \[
     \text{Calories by Sue} = \text{Total cookies by Sue} \times 200 = 46 \times 200 = 9200 \text{ calories}
     \]
   - Total calories consumed by her sister:
     \[
     \text{Calories by Sister} = \text{Total cookies by Sister} \times 200 = 18 \times 200 = 3600 \text{ calories}
     \]

6. **Determine how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:**
   - The difference in calories consumed:
     \[
     \text{Difference in calories} = \text{Calories by Sue} - \text{Calories by Sister} = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 \text{ calories}
     \]

Finally, the answer to the question of how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister is:
\[
\boxed{5600}
\]
