Question ID: 1169

Question:
Ronnie was given $5 while Rissa was given thrice as much. After each of them had given an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. How much is left in Ronnie's money?


Reference Answer:
Rissa was given $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.
After Rissa had given an amount to her sister, she has $15 x 4/5 = $<<15*4/5=12>>12 left.
This means she has given $15 - $12 = $<<15-12=3>>3.
Since Ronnie had given the same amount as Rissa, then Ronnie is left with $5 - $3 = $<<5-3=2>>2.

Response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the amounts given to Ronnie and Rissa:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie. Therefore, Rissa's amount is:
     \[
     3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine how much money Rissa has left after giving some to her sister:**
   - After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount.
   - Rissa's original amount is $15, so we calculate \( \frac{4}{5} \) of $15:
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - This means Rissa has $12 left after giving some money to her sister.

3. **Calculate how much Rissa gave to her sister:**
   - To find out how much Rissa gave to her sister, we subtract the amount she has left from her original amount:
     \[
     15 - 12 = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - So, Rissa gave $3 to her little sister.

4. **Since Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount to their little sister, Ronnie also gave $3.**
   - Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left after giving $3 to his sister.

5. **Calculate how much Ronnie has left:**
   - Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3, so we calculate:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is:
     \[
     \boxed{2}
     \]
