Question ID: 240

Question:
James has 6 more candies than Robert. John has twice as many candies as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does John have than James?


Reference Answer:
Robert has 54/2 = <<54/2=27>>27 candies.
James has 27+6 = <<27+6=33>>33 candies.
John has 54-33= <<54-33=21>>21 more candies than James.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to establish relationships between the number of candies that James, Robert, and John have based on the information given.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( R \) be the number of candies Robert has.
   - According to the problem, James has 6 more candies than Robert, so we can express the number of candies James has as:
     \[
     J = R + 6
     \]
   - John has twice as many candies as Robert, so we can express the number of candies John has as:
     \[
     Jn = 2R
     \]

2. **Use the information about John:**
   - We know from the problem that John has 54 candies:
     \[
     Jn = 54
     \]
   - Since we have \( Jn = 2R \), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     2R = 54
     \]

3. **Solve for \( R \):**
   - To find \( R \), divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     R = \frac{54}{2} = 27
     \]

4. **Find the number of candies James has:**
   - Now that we know \( R \), we can find how many candies James has using the equation \( J = R + 6 \):
     \[
     J = 27 + 6 = 33
     \]

5. **Calculate how many more candies John has than James:**
   - We need to find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = Jn - J = 54 - 33
     \]
   - Performing the subtraction:
     \[
     54 - 33 = 21
     \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}
\]
