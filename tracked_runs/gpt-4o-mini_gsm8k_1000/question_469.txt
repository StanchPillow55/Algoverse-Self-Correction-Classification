Question ID: 987

Question:
Artemis is potting flowers with her father. They buy a 30-pound bag of soil. Each rose needs 1 pound. Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds. Each Sunflower needs 3 pounds. If they plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations, how many roses can they plant?


Reference Answer:
They used 12 pounds on the sunflowers because 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12
They used 15 pounds on carnations because 10 x 1.5 = <<10*1.5=15>>15
They have used 27 pounds in total because 12 + 15 = <<12+15=27>>27
They have 30 pounds left because 30 - 27 = <<30-27=3>>3
The can plant three roses because 3 / 1 = <<3/1=3>>3

Response:
To determine how many roses Artemis can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then subtract that from the total amount of soil available.

1. **Calculate the soil used for sunflowers:**
   - Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil.
   - They are planting 4 sunflowers.
   - Total soil used for sunflowers = Number of sunflowers × Soil per sunflower
   \[
   \text{Total soil for sunflowers} = 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the soil used for carnations:**
   - Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil.
   - They are planting 10 carnations.
   - Total soil used for carnations = Number of carnations × Soil per carnation
   \[
   \text{Total soil for carnations} = 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total soil used for both sunflowers and carnations:**
   \[
   \text{Total soil used} = \text{Total soil for sunflowers} + \text{Total soil for carnations}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total soil used} = 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining soil available for roses:**
   - They started with a 30-pound bag of soil.
   - Remaining soil = Total soil - Total soil used
   \[
   \text{Remaining soil} = 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Determine how many roses can be planted with the remaining soil:**
   - Each rose requires 1 pound of soil.
   - The number of roses that can be planted = Remaining soil / Soil per rose
   \[
   \text{Number of roses} = \frac{\text{Remaining soil}}{\text{Soil per rose}} = \frac{3 \text{ pounds}}{1 \text{ pound/rose}} = 3 \text{ roses}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Artemis can plant **3 roses**.
