Question ID: 980

Question:
Adrianne is collecting different kinds of beads for making bracelets. Her mother gave her 20 metallic beads. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, and her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave.  How many beads did Adrianne have altogether?


Reference Answer:
Adrianne received 20 +10 = <<20+10=30>>30 beads from her sister.
And, she received 2 x 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 beads from her friend.
Therefore, Adrianne had 20 + 30 + 40 = <<20+30+40=90>>90 beads altogether.
#### 90

Response:
To find out how many beads Adrianne has altogether, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of beads given by each person:**
   - Adrianne's mother gave her **20 metallic beads**.
   - Adrianne's sister gave her **ten more beads than her mother**. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, we calculate the number of beads from her sister:
     \[
     \text{Sister's beads} = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ beads}
     \]
   - Adrianne's friend gave her **twice as many beads as her mother gave**. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, we calculate the number of beads from her friend:
     \[
     \text{Friend's beads} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ beads}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of beads:**
   Now we will add the number of beads from her mother, sister, and friend together:
   \[
   \text{Total beads} = \text{Mother's beads} + \text{Sister's beads} + \text{Friend's beads}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total beads} = 20 + 30 + 40
   \]

3. **Perform the addition:**
   First, we add the beads from the mother and sister:
   \[
   20 + 30 = 50
   \]
   Next, we add the friend's beads:
   \[
   50 + 40 = 90
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of beads Adrianne has altogether is:
   \[
   \boxed{90}
   \]
