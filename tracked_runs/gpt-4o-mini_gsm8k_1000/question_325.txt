Question ID: 247

Question:
Isabelle bought party supplies for her little sisterâ€™s birthday party. She spent $12 on ingredients for the cake, $43 on birthday presents, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on goodie bags for the party guests. She split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents. How many dollars did each person pay?


Reference Answer:
Isabelle spent 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = $<<12+43+15+4+22=96>>96 on party supplies.
The cost was evenly split 3 ways, so each person paid 96 / 3 = $<<96/3=32>>32.
#### 32

Response:
To determine how much each person paid for the party supplies, we first need to calculate the total amount spent by Isabelle on all the items. We will then divide that total by the number of people sharing the cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of party supplies.**

Isabelle's expenses are as follows:
- Ingredients for the cake: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Now, we will add these amounts together:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22
\]

Calculating this step by step:

1. \(12 + 43 = 55\)
2. \(55 + 15 = 70\)
3. \(70 + 4 = 74\)
4. \(74 + 22 = 96\)

So, the total cost of the party supplies is:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 96 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Split the total cost evenly among three people.**

Isabelle is splitting the total cost with her two parents, which means the total cost will be divided by 3.

\[
\text{Cost per person} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{3} = \frac{96}{3}
\]

Now, we perform the division:

\[
96 \div 3 = 32
\]

**Final Answer:**

Each person paid \(32\) dollars.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{32}
\]
