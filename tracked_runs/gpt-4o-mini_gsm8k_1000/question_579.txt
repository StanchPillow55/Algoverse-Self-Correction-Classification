Question ID: 1193

Question:
Jason was told he could earn $3.00 for doing his laundry,  $1.50 for cleaning his room, $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb each week and $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher.  In a two week period, Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, did his laundry once, took the trash out twice and cleaned his room once.  How much money did Jason earn?


Reference Answer:
Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times at $0.50 each so he made 6*.50=$<<6*.50=3.00>>3.00
Jason did his laundry 1 time at $3.00 so he made 1*3 = $<<1*3=3.00>>3.00
Jason took the trash out 2 times at $0.75 each so he made 2*.75 = $<<2*.75=1.50>>1.50
Jason cleaned his room 1 time at $1.50 each so he made 1*1.50 = $<<1*1.50=1.50>>1.50
Jason made 3+1.50+1.50+3 = $<<3+1.5+1.5+3=9.00>>9.00

Response:
To determine how much money Jason earned over the two-week period, we will calculate the earnings from each task he completed and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate earnings from each task:**
   - **Laundry:** Jason did his laundry once and earns $3.00 for it.
     \[
     \text{Earnings from laundry} = 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00
     \]

   - **Cleaning his room:** Jason cleaned his room once and earns $1.50 for it.
     \[
     \text{Earnings from cleaning his room} = 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50
     \]

   - **Taking out the trash:** Jason took the trash out twice and earns $0.75 for each time.
     \[
     \text{Earnings from taking out the trash} = 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50
     \]

   - **Emptying the dishwasher:** Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times and earns $0.50 for each time.
     \[
     \text{Earnings from emptying the dishwasher} = 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00
     \]

2. **Sum up all the earnings:**
   Now, we will add up all the earnings from each task:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from laundry} + \text{Earnings from cleaning his room} + \text{Earnings from taking out the trash} + \text{Earnings from emptying the dishwasher}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 3.00
   \]

   Now, we will perform the addition step by step:
   \[
   3.00 + 1.50 = 4.50
   \]
   \[
   4.50 + 1.50 = 6.00
   \]
   \[
   6.00 + 3.00 = 9.00
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, Jason earned a total of **$9.00** over the two-week period.

\[
\boxed{9.00}
\]
