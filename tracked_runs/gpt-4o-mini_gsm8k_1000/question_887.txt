Question ID: 484

Question:
Stetson made a bet with Alec that he would give up $10 for each orange he eats. While at the farm, Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked. If they picked 60 oranges, calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up?


Reference Answer:
If they picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them, he ate 2/5*60 = <<60*2/5=24>>24 oranges.
If he gave $10 for every orange he ate, then he gave up $10*24 = $<<10*24=240>>240
#### 240

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of oranges Stetson ate.**
   - We know that Stetson ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total oranges picked.
   - The total number of oranges picked is 60.

   To find out how many oranges Stetson ate, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Oranges eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \text{Oranges eaten} = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
   \]

   So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up.**
   - Stetson agreed to give up $10 for each orange he eats.
   - Since he ate 24 oranges, we can calculate the total amount he gave up as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total amount given up} = 24 \times 10
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \text{Total amount given up} = 240
   \]

3. **State the final answer.**
   - Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is **$240**.

Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]
