Question:
On Tuesday, Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. On Sunday he exercised for 23 minutes. On Monday he exercised for 16 minutes. How many minutes does he have to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal?


Reference Answer:
On Sunday and Monday he exercised a total of 39 minutes because 23 + 16 = <<23+16=39>>39
On Tuesday he has to exercise for 78 minutes because 39 x 2 = <<39*2=78>>78
#### 78

Response:
To determine how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Sunday and Monday combined.

1. **Calculate the total exercise time for Sunday and Monday:**
   - Time exercised on Sunday = 23 minutes
   - Time exercised on Monday = 16 minutes

   We add these two amounts together:
   \[
   \text{Total time on Sunday and Monday} = 23 \text{ minutes} + 16 \text{ minutes} = 39 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Determine the time Peter wants to exercise on Tuesday:**
   - Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Sunday and Monday combined. Therefore, we multiply the total time by 2:
   \[
   \text{Time on Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Total time on Sunday and Monday} = 2 \times 39 \text{ minutes}
   \]

   Now we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   Peter needs to exercise for **78 minutes** on Tuesday to reach his goal.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{78}
\]
