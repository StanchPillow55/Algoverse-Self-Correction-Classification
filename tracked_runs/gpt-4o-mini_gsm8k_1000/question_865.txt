Question ID: 114

Question:
Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than can Brittany's phone.  The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.  If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo?


Reference Answer:
Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos, which is 6 times more than Brittany's phone can hold, Brittany's phone can hold `1800/6=<<1800/6=300>>300 photographs.
Since Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photos than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph, then 300/50=6 ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.
#### 6

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the relationship between Jamal's and Brittany's phones:**
   - We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Let \( B \) be the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold.
   - Therefore, we can express Jamal's phone capacity as:
     \[
     J = 6B
     \]
   - We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs:
     \[
     J = 1800
     \]
   - Setting the two equations equal gives us:
     \[
     6B = 1800
     \]

2. **Solving for \( B \):**
   - To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
     \[
     B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]
   - Thus, Brittany's phone can hold a maximum of 300 photographs.

3. **Understanding the relationship between Brittany's phone and the number of birds:**
   - The problem states that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold (which we found to be 300) is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
   - Let \( D \) be the number of ducks (or birds) in Jamal's photograph.
   - The relationship can be expressed as:
     \[
     B = 50D
     \]
   - Substituting the value of \( B \):
     \[
     300 = 50D
     \]

4. **Solving for \( D \):**
   - To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 50:
     \[
     D = \frac{300}{50} = 6
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is:
     \[
     \boxed{6}
     \]
