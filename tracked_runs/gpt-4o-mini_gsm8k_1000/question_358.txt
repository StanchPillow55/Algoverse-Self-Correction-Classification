Question ID: 1255

Question:
Crista's plants need to be watered every day. She has 20 plants. 4 of her plants need half of a cup of water. 8 plants need 1 cup of water. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?


Reference Answer:
She will need 2 cups for the plants that need half of a cup of water because .5*4 = 2 cups
She will need 8 cups for the plants that need a cup of water because 1*8= <<1*8=8>>8 cups.
Since she has 20 plants, 20-4-8=<<20-4-8=8>>8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water.
Since 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, she will need 2 cups of water for these plants because .25*8=<<.25*8=2>>2 cups.
In total, she will need 2+8+2=<<2+8+2=12>>12 cups of water per day.

Response:
To determine how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of plants and their water requirements:**
   - Crista has a total of 20 plants.
   - 4 plants need half a cup of water each.
   - 8 plants need 1 cup of water each.
   - The remaining plants need a quarter of a cup of water each.

2. **Calculate the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - First, we find out how many plants have already been accounted for:
     \[
     4 \text{ (half-cup plants)} + 8 \text{ (one-cup plants)} = 12 \text{ plants}
     \]
   - Now, we subtract this from the total number of plants to find the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup:
     \[
     20 \text{ (total plants)} - 12 \text{ (accounted plants)} = 8 \text{ plants}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water needed for each group of plants:**
   - For the 4 plants that need half a cup of water:
     \[
     4 \text{ plants} \times 0.5 \text{ cups/plant} = 2 \text{ cups}
     \]
   - For the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water:
     \[
     8 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ cup/plant} = 8 \text{ cups}
     \]
   - For the 8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water:
     \[
     8 \text{ plants} \times 0.25 \text{ cups/plant} = 2 \text{ cups}
     \]

4. **Add the total amounts of water needed:**
   - Now, we sum the water needed for all groups:
     \[
     2 \text{ cups (half-cup plants)} + 8 \text{ cups (one-cup plants)} + 2 \text{ cups (quarter-cup plants)} = 12 \text{ cups}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Crista needs a total of 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
