Question ID: 1030

Question:
Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?


Reference Answer:
First find the chance that the normal teacher comes in by subtracting the odds she doesn't from 100%: 100% - 50% = 50%
Then find the chance the teacher doesn't grant the whole class an extension by subtracting the chance she does from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%
Then find the chance that Marcus can't get a personal extension by subtracting the chance he does from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%
Now find the chance the teacher comes in AND doesn't grant the whole class an extension by multiplying the two independent probabilities: .6 * .5 = <<.6*.5=.3>>.3
Now multiply that probability by the probability Marcus can't get a personal extension to find the probability he actually has to turn in his homework: .3 * .8 = <<.3*.8=.24>>.24
Finally, multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .24 * 100% = <<.24*100=24>>24%

Response:
To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to analyze the different scenarios that could occur based on the probabilities given.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario**:
   - There is a 50% chance that a substitute teacher will be present. If a substitute is present, Marcus will not have to turn in his homework.
   - Therefore, if a substitute teacher is present, the probability that he has to turn in his homework is 0%.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario**:
   - If the normal teacher is present (which happens with a 50% probability), we need to consider two sub-scenarios:
     - **Extension Given**: There is a 40% chance that the teacher will give an extension. If this happens, Marcus will not have to turn in his homework.
     - **No Extension Given**: If the teacher does not give an extension (which happens with a 60% probability), we then consider whether Marcus can convince the teacher that his dog ate his homework.
       - **Convincing the Teacher**: There is a 20% chance that Marcus can convince the teacher to give him a personal extension. If he convinces her, he will not have to turn in his homework.
       - **Not Convincing the Teacher**: If he does not convince her (which happens with an 80% probability), he will have to turn in his homework.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of having to turn in homework with the normal teacher.

- Probability of having the normal teacher = 50% = 0.5
- Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher = 40% = 0.4
- Probability of not getting an extension = 60% = 0.6
- Probability of convincing the teacher for a personal extension = 20% = 0.2
- Probability of not convincing the teacher = 80% = 0.8

Now, if the normal teacher is present:
- Probability of having to turn in homework if the teacher is present:
  - This occurs only if he does not get an extension and does not convince the teacher.
  
  \[
  P(\text{Turn in homework | Normal teacher}) = P(\text{No extension}) \times P(\text{Not convincing}) = 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.48
  \]

### Step 2: Combine the probabilities.

Now we combine the probabilities of the two main scenarios (substitute teacher and normal teacher):

- Probability of having to turn in homework if the substitute teacher is present = 0% = 0
- Probability of having to turn in homework if the normal teacher is present = 0.5 (probability of normal teacher) * 0.48 (probability of having to turn in homework with normal teacher)

\[
P(\text{Turn in homework}) = P(\text{Substitute}) \times 0 + P(\text{Normal}) \times P(\text{Turn in homework | Normal}) 
\]
\[
= 0.5 \times 0 + 0.5 \times 0.48 = 0 + 0.24 = 0.24
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage.

To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we multiply by 100:

\[
0.24 \times 100 = 24\%
\]

### Final Answer:
The percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is **24%**.

Response:
To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to analyze the different scenarios that could occur based on the probabilities given.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario**:
   - There is a 50% chance that there will be a substitute teacher. If there is a substitute, Marcus will not have to turn in his homework.
   - Therefore, if a substitute teacher is present, the probability that he has to turn in his homework is 0%.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario**:
   - If there is no substitute teacher (which happens with a probability of 50%), we need to consider the next possibilities:
     - There is a 40% chance that the normal teacher will give everyone an extension. If she gives an extension, Marcus will not have to turn in his homework.
     - Conversely, there is a 60% chance that the teacher will not give an extension. In this case, we need to consider whether Marcus can convince the teacher that his dog ate his homework.

3. **Convincing the Teacher**:
   - If the teacher does not give an extension (which happens with a probability of 60%), there is a 20% chance that Marcus can convince her to give him a personal extension.
   - Therefore, there is an 80% chance that he will not be able to convince her and will have to turn in his homework.

Now, let's calculate the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

- **Case 1**: Substitute Teacher (50% chance)
  - Probability of having to turn in homework = 0%

- **Case 2**: Normal Teacher (50% chance)
  - Probability of getting an extension from the teacher = 40% (thus, no homework)
  - Probability of not getting an extension = 60%
    - Within this, the probability of convincing the teacher = 20% (thus, no homework)
    - Probability of not convincing the teacher = 80% (thus, must turn in homework)

Now we can calculate the probabilities for the normal teacher scenario:

- Probability of having to turn in homework with a normal teacher:
  \[
  P(\text{turn in homework | normal teacher}) = P(\text{no extension}) \times P(\text{not convincing})
  \]
  \[
  = 0.60 \times 0.80 = 0.48
  \]

Now, we combine the probabilities from both cases:

- Total probability of having to turn in homework:
\[
P(\text{turn in homework}) = P(\text{substitute}) \times P(\text{turn in homework | substitute}) + P(\text{normal teacher}) \times P(\text{turn in homework | normal teacher})
\]
\[
= 0.50 \times 0 + 0.50 \times 0.48
\]
\[
= 0 + 0.24 = 0.24
\]

Finally, to express this as a percentage:
\[
0.24 \times 100 = 24\%
\]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is **24%**. 

**Final Answer: 24%**
