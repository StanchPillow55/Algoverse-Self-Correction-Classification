Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of cookies Suzanne made**: 
   We know from the problem that Suzanne made 36 cookies.

2. **Determine how many cookies Josh made**: 
   The problem states that Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. Therefore, we can calculate the number of cookies Josh made as follows:
   \[
   \text{Josh's cookies} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Suzanne's cookies} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36
   \]
   Now, we perform the calculation:
   \[
   \text{Josh's cookies} = \frac{36}{4} = 9
   \]
   So, Josh made 9 cookies.

3. **Determine how many cookies Kelsie made**: 
   According to the problem, Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. This means we need to calculate:
   \[
   \text{Kelsie's cookies} = 2 \times \text{Josh's cookies} = 2 \times 9
   \]
   Now, we perform this calculation:
   \[
   \text{Kelsie's cookies} = 18
   \]
   Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

4. **Final Answer**: 
   Kelsie made 18 cookies.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]
