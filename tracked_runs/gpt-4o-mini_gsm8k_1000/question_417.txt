Question ID: 67

Question:
A treasure hunter found a buried treasure chest filled with gems. There were 175 diamonds, 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and twice the number of emeralds than the rubies.   How many of the gems were there in the chest?


Reference Answer:
There were 175 - 35 = <<175-35=140>>140 rubies in the treasure chest.
There were 140 x 2 = <<140*2=280>>280 emeralds in the treasure chest.
So, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 175 + 140 + 280 = <<175+140+280=595>>595.
#### 595

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of gems in the treasure chest, which includes diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of diamonds**:
   The problem states that there are 175 diamonds.

   \[
   \text{Number of diamonds} = 175
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of rubies**:
   The problem states that there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. To find the number of rubies, we subtract 35 from the number of diamonds.

   \[
   \text{Number of rubies} = \text{Number of diamonds} - 35 = 175 - 35 = 140
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of emeralds**:
   The problem states that there are twice the number of emeralds than rubies. To find the number of emeralds, we multiply the number of rubies by 2.

   \[
   \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times \text{Number of rubies} = 2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of gems**:
   Now that we have the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds, we can find the total number of gems by adding these three quantities together.

   \[
   \text{Total number of gems} = \text{Number of diamonds} + \text{Number of rubies} + \text{Number of emeralds}
   \]

   Substituting the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Total number of gems} = 175 + 140 + 280
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition step-by-step:

   \[
   175 + 140 = 315
   \]

   Then add the number of emeralds:

   \[
   315 + 280 = 595
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is 

   \[
   \boxed{595}
   \]
