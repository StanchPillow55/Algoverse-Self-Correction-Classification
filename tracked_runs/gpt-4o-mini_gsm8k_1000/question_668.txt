Question ID: 824

Question:
Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food and 6 packages of dog food. Each package of cat food contained 11 tins, and each package of dog food contained 6 tins. How many more tins of cat food than dog food did Kimberly buy?


Reference Answer:
The number of cat food tins that Kimberley has bought is 8 × 11 = <<8*11=88>>88.
Whilst the number of dog food tins she has bought is 6 × 6 = <<6*6=36>>36.
There are 88 - 36 = <<88-36=52>>52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

Response:
To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to calculate the total number of tins for both cat food and dog food separately, and then find the difference.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of tins of cat food.**

Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. We can calculate the total number of tins of cat food using the formula:

\[
\text{Total tins of cat food} = \text{Number of packages} \times \text{Tins per package}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total tins of cat food} = 8 \times 11
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
8 \times 11 = 88
\]

So, Kimberly bought **88 tins of cat food**.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of tins of dog food.**

Next, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food. Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. We use the same formula:

\[
\text{Total tins of dog food} = \text{Number of packages} \times \text{Tins per package}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total tins of dog food} = 6 \times 6
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
6 \times 6 = 36
\]

So, Kimberly bought **36 tins of dog food**.

**Step 3: Find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food.**

Now we need to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought. We do this by subtracting the total tins of dog food from the total tins of cat food:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total tins of cat food} - \text{Total tins of dog food}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Difference} = 88 - 36
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
88 - 36 = 52
\]

Thus, Kimberly bought **52 more tins of cat food than dog food**.

**Final Answer:**
Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.
