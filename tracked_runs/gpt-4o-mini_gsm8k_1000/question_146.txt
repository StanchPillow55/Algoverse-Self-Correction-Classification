Question ID: 1170

Question:
A wall mural has four different colors of paint in it: red, white, purple, and yellow.  There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural. Half the mural is yellow. If the mural used 12 pints of paint in all, how many pints of red paint was used?


Reference Answer:
Half the mural is yellow, so the other half took 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pints of paint.
The mural has equal amounts of the other three colors, so it used 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 pints of red paint.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pints of red paint were used in the mural, given that there are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. 

1. **Understanding the proportions of paint**:
   - We know that red, white, and purple paints are in equal amounts.
   - Half of the mural is yellow.

2. **Setting up the variables**:
   - Let \( r \) be the amount of red paint in pints.
   - Since red, white, and purple paints are equal, we can also say that the amount of white paint is \( r \) and the amount of purple paint is \( r \).
   - The amount of yellow paint is given as half of the total mural.

3. **Total amount of paint**:
   - The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints.
   - Therefore, we can express the total amount of paint as:
     \[
     r + r + r + \text{(amount of yellow paint)} = 12
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     3r + \text{(amount of yellow paint)} = 12
     \]

4. **Finding the amount of yellow paint**:
   - Since half of the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is:
     \[
     \text{amount of yellow paint} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
     \]

5. **Substituting the yellow paint amount back into the equation**:
   - Now we can substitute the amount of yellow paint back into our equation:
     \[
     3r + 6 = 12
     \]

6. **Solving for \( r \)**:
   - To isolate \( r \), we first subtract 6 from both sides:
     \[
     3r = 12 - 6
     \]
     \[
     3r = 6
     \]
   - Next, we divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     r = \frac{6}{3} = 2
     \]

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The amount of red paint used in the mural is \( r = 2 \) pints.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]
