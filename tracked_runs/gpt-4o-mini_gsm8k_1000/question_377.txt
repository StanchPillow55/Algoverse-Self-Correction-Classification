Question ID: 86

Question:
Greg has an alarm set to ring three times a day as a reminder. When the alarm goes off, it continues to ring until Greg turns it off. The first time it went off today, it rang four times. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. How many times did the alarm ring in all?


Reference Answer:
The second time Greg’s alarm went off, it rang three times as long as the first, so it rang 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 times the second time.
The third time it went off, it rang half as long as the second, so it rang 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 times the third time.
In all, Greg’s alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = <<4+12+6=22>>22 times.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the alarm rang in total throughout the day based on the information provided.

1. **First Alarm Ringing**:
   - The first time the alarm went off, it rang **4 times**.

2. **Second Alarm Ringing**:
   - The second time the alarm went off, it rang for **three times as long** as the first time. 
   - Since the first time it rang 4 times, we calculate the number of rings for the second time:
     \[
     \text{Second time rings} = 3 \times \text{First time rings} = 3 \times 4 = 12
     \]
   - Therefore, the second time it rang **12 times**.

3. **Third Alarm Ringing**:
   - The third time the alarm went off, it rang for **half as long** as the second time.
   - Since the second time it rang 12 times, we calculate the number of rings for the third time:
     \[
     \text{Third time rings} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Second time rings} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6
     \]
   - Therefore, the third time it rang **6 times**.

4. **Total Rings**:
   - Now, we add up all the rings from the three times the alarm went off:
     \[
     \text{Total rings} = \text{First time rings} + \text{Second time rings} + \text{Third time rings}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total rings} = 4 + 12 + 6
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total rings} = 22
     \]

Thus, the total number of times the alarm rang in all is **22**.

Final answer: **22**.
