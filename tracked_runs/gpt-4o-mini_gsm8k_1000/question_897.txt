Question ID: 407

Question:
Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school and did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?


Reference Answer:
Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = <<6000=6000>>6,000 steps.
He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = <<10000-2000=8000>>8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = <<8000-6000=2000>>2,000 steps.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog. We will break down the information given step by step.

1. **Total Steps Goal**: Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day.

2. **Steps Completed from School**: We know that he finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Let's denote the number of steps he completed on his walks to and from school as \( S \). Since he completed half of his total steps, we have:
   \[
   S = \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

3. **Steps from Short Walk with Friend**: Elliott also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, we can add this to the steps he has already taken:
   \[
   \text{Total steps so far} = S + 1,000 = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

4. **Remaining Steps**: After his jog, he realized he had only 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means that before he started his jog, he had:
   \[
   \text{Steps before jog} = 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

5. **Steps Taken During the Jog**: We can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the total steps he had completed before the jog from the steps he had before the jog:
   \[
   \text{Steps during jog} = \text{Steps before jog} - \text{Total steps so far} = 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:

\[
\boxed{2,000}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog. We will break down the information given step by step.

1. **Total Steps Goal**: Elliott aims to walk a total of 10,000 steps in a day.

2. **Steps Completed from School**: It is mentioned that he finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he is aiming for 10,000 steps, half of that is:
   \[
   \text{Steps from school} = \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

3. **Steps from Short Walk with Friend**: Elliott also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, we add this to the steps he has already completed:
   \[
   \text{Total steps so far} = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

4. **Steps Remaining After Jog**: After finishing his jog, he realized he only had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that the total number of steps he has taken after his jog can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Steps after jog} = 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

5. **Steps Taken During the Jog**: To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we need to determine how many steps he had taken before the jog and then subtract that from the total steps after the jog. We already calculated that he had taken 6,000 steps before the jog. Therefore, the steps taken during the jog can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Steps during jog} = \text{Total steps after jog} - \text{Steps before jog}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Steps during jog} = 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is **2,000 steps**.

Final answer: **2,000 steps**.

   \]

3. **Steps from Short Walk with Friend**: He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.

4. **Total Steps So Far**: Now, we can calculate the total number of steps Elliott has taken so far:
   \[
   \text{Total Steps} = \text{Steps from School} + \text{Steps from Walk with Friend} = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

5. **Remaining Steps**: After his jog, he realized he had only 2,000 steps left to take. This means that before he started jogging, he had already taken:
   \[
   \text{Steps before Jog} = 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

6. **Steps Taken During the Jog**: To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we can subtract the total steps he had taken before the jog from the total steps he had completed after the jog:
   \[
   \text{Steps during Jog} = \text{Steps before Jog} - \text{Steps so far} = 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
\[
\boxed{2,000}
