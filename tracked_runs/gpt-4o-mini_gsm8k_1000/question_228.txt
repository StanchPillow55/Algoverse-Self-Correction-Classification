Question ID: 1165

Question:
John collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes.  The first two have 200 apartments each and the last one is 60% bigger than the other two combined.  He collects garbage 3 times a week from each place and he gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment.  How much money does he make in a week?


Reference Answer:
The first two complexes have 200+200=<<200+200=400>>400 apartments
The third one has 400*.6=<<400*.6=240>>240 more apartments than those 2 combined
So in total, it has 400+240=<<400+240=640>>640 apartments
So he goes to 640+400=<<640+400=1040>>1040 apartments each time
That means he visits 1040*3=<<1040*3=3120>>3120 apartments every week
So he makes 3120*$0.4=$<<3120*0.4=1248>>1248 every week

Response:
To determine how much money John makes in a week from collecting garbage, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.**
   - Each of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.
   - Therefore, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is:
     \[
     200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.**
   - The third complex is 60% bigger than the total of the first two complexes.
   - First, we find 60% of the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
     \[
     60\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ apartments}
     \]
   - Now, we add this to the total of the first two complexes to find the total number of apartments in the third complex:
     \[
     400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of apartments across all three complexes.**
   - Now we add the number of apartments from all three complexes:
     \[
     200 \text{ (first complex)} + 200 \text{ (second complex)} + 640 \text{ (third complex)} = 1040 \text{ apartments}
     \]

4. **Determine how many collections John makes in a week.**
   - John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment.
   - Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ collections/week} \times 1040 \text{ apartments} = 3120 \text{ collections/week}
     \]

5. **Calculate John's earnings for the week.**
   - John gets paid $0.40 per collection.
   - Therefore, his total earnings for the week are:
     \[
     3120 \text{ collections} \times 0.40 \text{ dollars/collection} = 1248 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Finally, we conclude that John makes **$1248** in a week from collecting garbage from the three apartment complexes. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1248}
\]
