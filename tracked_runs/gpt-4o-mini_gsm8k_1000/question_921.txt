Response:
To find out how much Leila, Jack, and Chase spent together to make a salad for the potluck, we will calculate the total cost for each person and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate Leila's spending on cucumbers:**
   - Leila buys 3 cucumbers.
   - The cost of each cucumber is $2.
   - Total cost for cucumbers = Number of cucumbers × Cost per cucumber
   \[
   \text{Total cost for cucumbers} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate Jack's spending on tomatoes:**
   - Jack buys 5 tomatoes.
   - The cost of each tomato is $1.
   - Total cost for tomatoes = Number of tomatoes × Cost per tomato
   \[
   \text{Total cost for tomatoes} = 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate Chase's spending on lettuce:**
   - Chase buys 1 head of lettuce.
   - The cost of each head of lettuce is $3.
   - Total cost for lettuce = Number of heads of lettuce × Cost per head of lettuce
   \[
   \text{Total cost for lettuce} = 1 \times 3 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total spending by all three:**
   - Total spending = Total cost for cucumbers + Total cost for tomatoes + Total cost for lettuce
   \[
   \text{Total spending} = 6 + 5 + 3
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total spending} = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount that Leila, Jack, and Chase spent together to make a salad for the potluck is **$14**. 

Final answer: **$14**.

   \]

2. **Jack's Purchase:**
   - Jack buys 5 tomatoes.
   - The cost of each tomato is $1.
   - Total cost for tomatoes = Number of tomatoes × Cost per tomato

   \]

3. **Chase's Purchase:**
   - Chase buys 1 head of lettuce.
   - The cost of each head of lettuce is $3.
   - Total cost for lettuce = Number of heads of lettuce × Cost per head of lettuce
   \[
   \text{Total cost for lettuce} = 1 \times 3 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Now, we add the total costs from each person to find the overall amount spent.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for cucumbers} + \text{Total cost for tomatoes} + \text{Total cost for lettuce}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase to make a salad for the potluck is **$14**.
