Response:
To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need for 80 meatballs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pounds of ground beef needed**:
   Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef. To find out how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs, we can use the following calculation:

   \[
   \text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs/pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of seasoning needed**:
   Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Since we determined that he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can calculate the total amount of seasoning required:

   \[
   \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Pounds of ground beef} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons/pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   Aiden will need a total of 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs.

Thus, the final answer is:

**Aiden needs 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.**
