Question ID: 8

Question:
John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph and then turns around because he realizes he forgot something very important at home.  He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?


Reference Answer:
When he turned around he was 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 miles from home
He was only able to drive 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours in the first four hours
In half an hour he goes 30*.5=<<30*.5=15>>15 miles
He then drives another 2-.5=<<2-.5=1.5>>1.5 hours
In that time he goes 80*1.5=<<80*1.5=120>>120 miles
So he drove 120+15=<<120+15=135>>135 miles
So he is 180-135=<<180-135=45>>45 miles away from home

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down into parts and calculate the distances traveled by John during each segment of his journey.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance John drove away from home.

John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he travels can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Distance} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
\]

So, John is 180 miles away from home when he turns around.

### Step 2: Analyze John's return journey.

John attempts to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic. During this time, he does not cover any distance.

- **Distance covered in standstill traffic**: 0 miles

### Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled in the next half-hour.

After the standstill traffic, John drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at a speed of 30 mph. The distance he travels during this time is:

\[
\text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining time for driving at 80 mph.

John has a total of 4 hours for his return trip. He has already spent 2 hours in traffic and 0.5 hours driving at 30 mph, which totals:

\[
2 \, \text{hours} + 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 2.5 \, \text{hours}
\]

Thus, the remaining time for driving is:

\[
4 \, \text{hours} - 2.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the distance traveled in the remaining time at 80 mph.

In the remaining 1.5 hours, John drives at a speed of 80 mph. The distance he travels during this time is:

\[
\text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total distance John has traveled back towards home.

Now, we can sum the distances John traveled back towards home:

- Distance from standstill traffic: 0 miles
- Distance at 30 mph: 15 miles
- Distance at 80 mph: 120 miles

Total distance back towards home:

\[
0 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 7: Calculate John's distance from home at the end of the 4 hours.

Initially, John was 180 miles away from home. After driving back for a total of 135 miles, we can find his distance from home by subtracting the distance he has traveled back from the initial distance:

\[
\text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Final Answer

At the end of the 4 hours, John is **45 miles** away from home.
