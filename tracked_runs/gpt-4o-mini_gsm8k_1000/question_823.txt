Question:
Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills from the bank account.  He loses 10 bills while getting home.  After that, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.  Thomas then triples his money.  He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.  How many 5 dollar bills does he have?


Reference Answer:
He withdrew 1000/20=<<1000/20=50>>50 bills
So he has 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 bills left over
He uses half the bills to pay for something, so he has 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 bills
He triples his money which gives him 20*3=<<20*3=60>>60 bills
So he has 60*20=$<<60*20=1200>>1200
Converting to 5s means he has 1200/5=<<1200/5=240>>240 bills
#### 240

Response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Withdrawal**: Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. **Losing Bills**: He loses 10 bills on his way home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. **Paying a Bill**: He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used to pay} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   After paying, the number of bills left is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills after payment} = 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]

4. **Tripling His Money**: Now, we need to calculate how much money he has left. Since he has 20 $20 bills:
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   When he triples his money:
   \[
   \text{Tripled money} = 3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Converting to $5 Bills**: Now, we need to convert this amount into $5 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $5 bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]
