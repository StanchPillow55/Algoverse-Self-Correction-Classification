Question ID: 450

Question:
You can buy a movie super ticket for $20 that includes rights to watch any movie and you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. Or you can buy a movie ticket for $12 and buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price. What's the regular price of popcorn if the soda costs $3 and you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2?


Reference Answer:
The super ticket costs $20 and for $1 extra I can get a popcorn and a soda, there I'd pay in total $20+$1 = $<<20+1=21>>21
If I didn't buy the ($21) super ticket but bought everything included on it and still saved $2, then I spent in total $21-$2 = $<<21-2=19>>19
If the regular movie ticket costs $12 and the soda costs $3 then the popcorn would cost $19-$12-$3=$4

Response:
To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Super Ticket Option:**
   - The cost of the super ticket is $20.
   - If you buy the super ticket, you can watch any movie and get one popcorn with a soda for an additional $1.
   - Therefore, the total cost if you buy the super ticket and the popcorn with soda is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost with super ticket} = 20 + 1 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Understanding the Regular Movie Ticket Option:**
   - The cost of a regular movie ticket is $12.
   - The soda costs $3 (as given).
   - Let \( p \) be the regular price of popcorn.
   - Therefore, the total cost if you buy the regular movie ticket and the popcorn and soda is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost with regular ticket} = 12 + 3 + p = 15 + p \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Understanding the Savings:**
   - According to the problem, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - This means that the total cost with the regular ticket option is $2 less than the total cost with the super ticket option:
     \[
     15 + p = 21 - 2
     \]
   - Simplifying the right side:
     \[
     15 + p = 19
     \]

4. **Solving for the Price of Popcorn:**
   - Now, we can solve for \( p \):
     \[
     p = 19 - 15
     \]
     \[
     p = 4
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The regular price of popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \) dollars.
