Question ID: 456

Question:
In a set of magicians cards, there are 15 red cards, and 60% more green cards. Yellow cards are as many, as the sum of red and green cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?


Reference Answer:
There are 60/100 * 15 = <<60/100*15=9>>9 more green cards than red cards.
Which means there are 15 + 9 = <<15+9=24>>24 green cards.
Yellow cards make up to 15 + 24 = <<15+24=39>>39 cards.
So in total, there are 39 + 39 = <<39+39=78>>78 cards of different colors.
#### 78

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of red cards:**
   We are given that there are 15 red cards.

   \[
   \text{Number of red cards} = 15
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of green cards:**
   We are told that there are 60% more green cards than red cards. To find the number of green cards, we first calculate 60% of the number of red cards.

   \[
   60\% \text{ of red cards} = 0.60 \times 15 = 9
   \]

   Now, we add this amount to the number of red cards to find the total number of green cards.

   \[
   \text{Number of green cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + 60\% \text{ of red cards} = 15 + 9 = 24
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of yellow cards:**
   We are told that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards. First, we need to find the sum of the red and green cards.

   \[
   \text{Sum of red and green cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 24 = 39
   \]

   Therefore, the number of yellow cards is:

   \[
   \text{Number of yellow cards} = 39
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards together.

   \[
   \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards}
   \]

   Substituting the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   15 + 24 = 39
   \]
   \[
   39 + 39 = 78
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   The total number of cards of all mentioned colors is:

   \[
   \boxed{78}
   \]
