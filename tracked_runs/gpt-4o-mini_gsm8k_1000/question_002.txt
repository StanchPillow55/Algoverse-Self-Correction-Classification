Question ID: 886

Question:
A singer has 50 microphones that he wants to arrange in pairs on a stage. While making the arrangement, he realizes that 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. How many pairs of microphones was he able to arrange on the stage?


Reference Answer:
The number of microphones that were not able to find space on the stage is 20/100*50 = <<20/100*50=10>>10
This means the singer could set 50-10 = <<50-10=40>>40 microphones into pairs on the stage.
Since a pair has 2 microphones, the singer set up 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 pairs of microphones on the stage.
#### 20

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pairs of microphones the singer can arrange on the stage, given that 20% of the microphones won't fit.

1. **Calculate the number of microphones that won't fit:**
   The singer has a total of 50 microphones. According to the problem, 20% of these microphones will not find any space to fit in.

   To find 20% of 50, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Number of microphones that won't fit} = 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of microphones that will fit:**
   Since 10 microphones won't fit, we subtract this from the total number of microphones to find out how many will fit:
   \[
   \text{Number of microphones that will fit} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Determine how many pairs can be arranged:**
   A pair consists of 2 microphones. To find out how many pairs can be formed from the 40 microphones that will fit, we divide the number of fitting microphones by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of pairs} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]

Thus, the singer was able to arrange **20 pairs** of microphones on the stage.

**Final Answer: 20 pairs**
