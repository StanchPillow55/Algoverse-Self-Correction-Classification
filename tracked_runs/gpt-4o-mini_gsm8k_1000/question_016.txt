Question:
Oscar has 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school.  He passes 14 out to his friends.  He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends.  He eats 3 more that night and 2 more in the morning.  How many lollipops does Oscar have?


Reference Answer:
He has 24 lollipops, eats 2 and passes 14 out to his friends so thatâ€™s 24-2-14 = <<24-2-14=8>>8 lollipops are left
On his way home he buys twice the amount of the 14 that he passed out so he bought 2*14 = <<2*14=28>>28 lollipops
He now has 8+28 = <<8+28=36>>36 lollipops
He has 36, eats 3 that night and 2 more in the morning leaving him with 36-3-2 = <<36-3-2=31>>31 lollipops

Response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Count of Lollipops**:
   Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

2. **Lollipops Eaten on the Way to School**:
   Oscar eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22 \text{ lollipops remaining}
   \]

3. **Lollipops Given to Friends**:
   Oscar passes out 14 lollipops to his friends.
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8 \text{ lollipops remaining}
   \]

4. **Lollipops Bought on the Way Home**:
   Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave away 14 lollipops, he buys:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ lollipops}
   \]
   Now, we add these to the remaining lollipops:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36 \text{ lollipops}
   \]

5. **Lollipops Eaten at Night**:
   Oscar eats 3 more lollipops that night.
   \[
   36 - 3 = 33 \text{ lollipops remaining}
   \]

6. **Lollipops Eaten in the Morning**:
   Oscar eats 2 more lollipops in the morning.
   \[
   33 - 2 = 31 \text{ lollipops remaining}
   \]

Finally, after all the calculations, the number of lollipops Oscar has is:
\[
\boxed{31}
\]
