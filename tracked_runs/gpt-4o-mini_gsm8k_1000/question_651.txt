Question ID: 1157

Question:
Carl has a cane that is half as long as he is tall.  Carl is one foot taller than his brother, Ned.  And Ned is two feet shorter than his cousin, Isabel.  If Isabel is 7 feet tall, how long is Carl's cane, in feet?


Reference Answer:
If Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, then Ned is 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 feet tall.
If Carl is one foot taller than Ned, then Carl is 5+1=<<5+1=6>>6 feet tall.
Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, or 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 feet long.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the height of Carl and then calculate the length of his cane based on that height.

1. **Determine Isabel's height**: 
   We know from the problem that Isabel is 7 feet tall.

2. **Determine Ned's height**: 
   The problem states that Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel. Therefore, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:
   \[
   \text{Ned's height} = \text{Isabel's height} - 2 \text{ feet} = 7 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine Carl's height**: 
   The problem states that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. Thus, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:
   \[
   \text{Carl's height} = \text{Ned's height} + 1 \text{ foot} = 5 \text{ feet} + 1 \text{ foot} = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Determine the length of Carl's cane**: 
   The problem states that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, we can calculate the length of Carl's cane as follows:
   \[
   \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Carl's height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \text{ feet} = 3 \text{ feet}
   \]

In conclusion, the length of Carl's cane is \( \boxed{3} \) feet.
