Question ID: 745

Question:
Mark decides to buy packs of old magic cards and open them to sell.  He buys 3 packs for $1800 each.  He gets 1 card that is worth $4000 and another card worth $1000.  There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each.  How much money profit did he make?


Reference Answer:
The cheaper cards are worth a total of 30*50=$<<30*50=1500>>1500
So all the cards together are worth 1500+4000+1000=$<<1500+4000+1000=6500>>6500
The cost for the cards was 1800*3=$<<1800*3=5400>>5400
So he made a profit of 6500-5400=$<<6500-5400=1100>>1100

Response:
To determine how much profit Mark made from buying and selling the magic cards, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the packs**: 
   Mark buys 3 packs at $1800 each. 
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3 \times 1800 = 5400
   \]

2. **Calculate the total value of the cards he received**: 
   Mark receives:
   - 1 card worth $4000
   - 1 card worth $1000
   - 30 cards worth an average of $50 each

   First, we calculate the total value of the 30 cards:
   \[
   \text{Value of 30 cards} = 30 \times 50 = 1500
   \]

   Now, we can find the total value of all the cards:
   \[
   \text{Total value of cards} = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit**: 
   Profit is calculated as the total value of the cards minus the total cost of the packs.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total value of cards} - \text{Total cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 6500 - 5400 = 1100
   \]

Thus, Mark made a profit of **$1100**.

Final answer: **$1100**.
