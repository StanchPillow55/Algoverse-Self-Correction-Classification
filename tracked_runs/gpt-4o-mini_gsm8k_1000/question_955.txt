Question ID: 963

Question:
Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are trying to catch them all, Pokemon that is.  Together they have caught 339 Pokemon.  Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. How many Pokemon has Stan caught?


Reference Answer:
Let x represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught
Stan: 4x-13
Alex: 5+(4x-13)=4x-8
Total: x+4x-13+4x-8=339
9x-21=339
9x=360
x=<<40=40>>40 Pokemon
Stan:4(40)-13=147 Pokemon
#### 147

Response:
Let \( A \) be the number of Pokemon Alex has caught, \( S \) be the number of Pokemon Stan has caught, and \( D \) be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught. We are given the following information:

1. The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

Now we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation. First, we substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]

Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:

\[
2S + D = 334
\]

Next, we substitute \( S \) from the third equation into this equation. We have \( S = 4D - 13 \). Substituting this into \( 2S + D = 334 \):

\[
2(4D - 13) + D = 334
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
8D - 26 + D = 334
\]

Combining like terms results in:

\[
9D - 26 = 334
\]

Adding 26 to both sides gives:

\[
9D = 360
\]

Dividing both sides by 9 results in:

\[
D = 40
\]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( S \) using the equation \( S = 4D - 13 \):

\[
S = 4(40) - 13
\]
\[
S = 160 - 13
\]
\[
S = 147
\]

Finally, we can find \( A \) using \( A = S + 5 \):

\[
A = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Now we can verify the total:

\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

This confirms our calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

\[
\boxed{147}
\]

Response:
Let \( A \) be the number of Pokemon Alex has caught, \( S \) be the number of Pokemon Stan has caught, and \( D \) be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught. We are given the following information:

1. The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the total equation. First, substitute \( A \) into the total equation:

\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
2S + D = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into this equation. We have:

\[
D = \frac{334 - 2S}{1}
\]

Now substitute \( S = 4D - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + D = 334 \):

\[
2(4D - 13) + D = 334
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
8D - 26 + D = 334
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9D - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[
9D = 360
\]

Now, divide by 9:

\[
D = 40
\]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( S \):

\[
S = 4D - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can find \( A \):

\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Now we can verify the total:

\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

Everything checks out. Thus, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

\[
\boxed{147}
\]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the total equation.

First, substitute \( A \):
\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:
\[
2S + D = 334 \quad \text{(1)}
\]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into equation (1):
\[
2(4D - 13) + D = 334
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
8D - 26 + D = 334
\]
Combining like terms results in:
\[
9D - 26 = 334
\]
Adding 26 to both sides yields:
\[
9D = 360
\]
Dividing both sides by 9 gives:
\[
D = 40
\]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( S \):
\[
S = 4D - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can find \( A \):
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Now we can check our work by verifying the total:
\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]
This confirms our calculations are correct.

Thus, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:
\[
\boxed{147}
\]
