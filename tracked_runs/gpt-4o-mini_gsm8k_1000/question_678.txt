Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the weights of each type of vegetable Daisy bought.

1. **Weight of the bag of potatoes**: 
   Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds. 
   \[
   \text{Weight of potatoes} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Weight of the bag of sweet potatoes**: 
   The problem states that the bag of sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes. Therefore, we can calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes as follows:
   \[
   \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times \text{Weight of potatoes} = 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Weight of the bag of carrots**: 
   The problem also states that the bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. We can calculate the weight of the carrots as follows:
   \[
   \text{Weight of carrots} = \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now that we have calculated the weight of the carrots, we can state the final answer.

**Final Answer**: Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots.
