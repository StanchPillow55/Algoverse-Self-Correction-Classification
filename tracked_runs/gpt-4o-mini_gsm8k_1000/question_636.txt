Question ID: 721

Question:
Helga was the fastest clog dancer in all of Slovenia. With both hands at her sides, she could tap her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute, while simultaneously tapping her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute.  When she raised her arms, her tap rate slowed down to 200 taps per minute with each foot.  If she dances a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised during only 2 of those minutes, what would be the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet?


Reference Answer:
During the 5 minutes of dancing, 2 minutes were performed with hands raised and 5-2=3 minutes were performed without hands raised.
With hands not raised, her right foot tapped 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 times.
With hands not raised, her left foot tapped 3*250=<<3*250=750>>750 times.
With hands raised, her right foot tapped 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 times.
With hands raised, her left foot tapped 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 times.
Thus, in total, she tapped 900+750+400+400=<<900+750+400+400=2450>>2450 times

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with both feet over the 5 minutes of dancing, taking into account the different tap rates for when her arms are raised and when they are not.

### Step 1: Calculate the taps per minute when arms are raised

When Helga raises her arms, she taps each foot at a rate of 200 taps per minute. Therefore, the total taps per minute for both feet when her arms are raised is:

\[
\text{Taps per minute with arms raised} = 200 \text{ (right foot)} + 200 \text{ (left foot)} = 400 \text{ taps per minute}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the taps per minute when arms are at her sides

When her arms are at her sides, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. Therefore, the total taps per minute for both feet when her arms are at her sides is:

\[
\text{Taps per minute with arms at sides} = 300 \text{ (right foot)} + 250 \text{ (left foot)} = 550 \text{ taps per minute}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the time spent in each position

Helga dances for a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised for 2 minutes. This means she dances with her arms at her sides for the remaining time:

\[
\text{Time with arms raised} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]
\[
\text{Time with arms at sides} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 2 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total taps for each time period

**Total taps with arms raised (2 minutes):**

\[
\text{Total taps with arms raised} = 400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ taps}
\]

**Total taps with arms at sides (3 minutes):**

\[
\text{Total taps with arms at sides} = 550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the combined total taps

Now, we add the total taps from both time periods to find the combined total:

\[
\text{Combined total taps} = 800 \text{ taps} + 1650 \text{ taps} = 2450 \text{ taps}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet during the 5 minutes of dancing is:

\[
\boxed{2450}
\]
