Question ID: 601

Question:
Steve loves playing video games.  His parents get him a console along with 5 games for his birthday.  He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the following year he starts buying 2 games a month.  For the third year he buys 4 games a month as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year.  How many games does Steve have after 3 years?


Reference Answer:
Steve buys 1 game a month his first year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*1=<<1*12=12>>12 games
Steve then buys 2 games per month for a year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*2=<<2*12=24>>24 games
Steve then buys 4 games per month for a year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*4=<<4*12=48>>48 games
Steve also gets 5 games for Christmas each year for three years, for another 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 games.
In total over three years, Steve gets 12+24+48+15=<<12+24+48+15=99>>99 games
Since Steve started with 5 games, he has 5+99=<<5+99=104>>104 games after 3 years
#### 104

Response:
To find out how many games Steve has after 3 years, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Games**: 
   - Steve starts with 5 games given to him by his parents.

2. **Year 1**:
   - In the first year, Steve buys 1 game per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so:
     \[
     \text{Games bought in Year 1} = 1 \text{ game/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ games}
     \]
   - Additionally, he receives 5 games for Christmas.
   - Therefore, the total number of games after Year 1 is:
     \[
     \text{Total games after Year 1} = 5 \text{ (initial)} + 12 \text{ (bought)} + 5 \text{ (Christmas)} = 22 \text{ games}
     \]

3. **Year 2**:
   - In the second year, Steve buys 2 games per month.
   - Again, there are 12 months in a year, so:
     \[
     \text{Games bought in Year 2} = 2 \text{ games/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 24 \text{ games}
     \]
   - He receives another 5 games for Christmas.
   - Therefore, the total number of games after Year 2 is:
     \[
     \text{Total games after Year 2} = 22 \text{ (from Year 1)} + 24 \text{ (bought)} + 5 \text{ (Christmas)} = 51 \text{ games}
     \]

4. **Year 3**:
   - In the third year, Steve buys 4 games per month.
   - Again, there are 12 months in a year, so:
     \[
     \text{Games bought in Year 3} = 4 \text{ games/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 48 \text{ games}
     \]
   - He receives another 5 games for Christmas.
   - Therefore, the total number of games after Year 3 is:
     \[
     \text{Total games after Year 3} = 51 \text{ (from Year 2)} + 48 \text{ (bought)} + 5 \text{ (Christmas)} = 104 \text{ games}
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - After calculating all the games Steve has after 3 years, we find that:
     \[
     \text{Total games after 3 years} = 104
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{104}
\]
