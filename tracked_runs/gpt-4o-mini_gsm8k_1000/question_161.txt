Question ID: 688

Question:
John is very tired. He decides to take a nap, but he wants to finish his homework first. If John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework and 3 hours before he has to eat dinner, how many minutes does John have to nap?


Reference Answer:
John has to spend 20+40+20 = <<20+40+20=80>>80 minutes on homework.
John has 3 hours*60 minutes= <<3*60=180>>180 minutes before dinner.
Thus, John has 180-80=<<180-80=100>>100 minutes for his nap.
#### 100

Response:
To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we first need to calculate the total time he will spend on his homework and then subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

1. **Calculate the total time for homework:**
   - Math homework: 20 minutes
   - Reading homework: 40 minutes
   - History homework: 20 minutes

   Now, we add these times together:
   \[
   \text{Total homework time} = \text{Math} + \text{Reading} + \text{History}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total homework time} = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Convert the time before dinner into minutes:**
   John has 3 hours before dinner. We need to convert this into minutes:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time available for napping:**
   To find out how much time John has left for napping, we subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner:
   \[
   \text{Time for nap} = \text{Total time before dinner} - \text{Total homework time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time for nap} = 180 - 80 = 100 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, John has **100 minutes** to nap.

Final answer: **100 minutes**.
