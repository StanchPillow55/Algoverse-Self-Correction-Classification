Question ID: 1061

Question:
Betsy and Donovan made a meal together. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. The meal was made in 98 minutes. How many minutes long was Betsy's part?


Reference Answer:
Let D = Donovan's time in minutes
Betsy = D + <<+18=18>>18
2D + 18 = 98
2D = 80
D = <<40=40>>40
Betsy = 40 + 18 = <<40+18=58>>58 minutes
Betsy's part took 58 minutes.
#### 58

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) represent the time (in minutes) that Donovan spent on his part of the meal. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. Therefore, we can express Betsy's time as:

\[
B = D + 18
\]

We also know that the total time spent on the meal by both Betsy and Donovan is 98 minutes. This gives us the equation:

\[
D + B = 98
\]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[
D + (D + 18) = 98
\]

Now, combine like terms:

\[
2D + 18 = 98
\]

Next, we will isolate \( D \) by first subtracting 18 from both sides:

\[
2D = 98 - 18
\]
\[
2D = 80
\]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[
D = \frac{80}{2} = 40
\]

Now that we have the time Donovan spent, we can find the time Betsy spent by substituting \( D \) back into the equation for \( B \):

\[
B = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58
\]

Thus, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

Finally, we can summarize our findings:

- Donovan's part took 40 minutes.
- Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

To confirm, we can check the total time:

\[
D + B = 40 + 58 = 98
\]

This matches the total time given in the problem.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Betsy's part took } 58 \text{ minutes.}
\]

Response:
Let \( D \) represent the time Donovan took to complete his part of the meal in minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so we can express Betsy's time as \( D + 18 \).

The total time taken to make the meal is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
D + (D + 18) = 98
\]

Now, we can simplify this equation:

\[
2D + 18 = 98
\]

Next, we will isolate \( 2D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides:

\[
2D = 98 - 18
\]
\[
2D = 80
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[
D = \frac{80}{2} = 40
\]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find Betsy's time:

\[
\text{Betsy's time} = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58
\]

Thus, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

Finally, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{58}
\]
