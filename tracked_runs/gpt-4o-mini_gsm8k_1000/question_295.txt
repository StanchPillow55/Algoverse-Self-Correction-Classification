Question ID: 444

Question:
Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Movie C was 1.25 hours. How many minutes long was Movie A?


Reference Answer:
Movie C = 1.25 hours = 75 minutes
Movie B = 75 + 5 = <<75+5=80>>80 minutes
Movie A = (1/4) * 80 = <<(1/4)*80=20>>20 minutes
Movie A was <<20=20>>20 minutes long.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, converting all time measurements to minutes for consistency.

1. **Convert Movie C's length from hours to minutes**:
   - Movie C is given as 1.25 hours.
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert hours to minutes:
     \[
     \text{Length of Movie C} = 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Determine the length of Movie B**:
   - We know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C.
   - Therefore, we can calculate the length of Movie B:
     \[
     \text{Length of Movie B} = \text{Length of Movie C} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Determine the length of Movie A**:
   - Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B.
   - We can calculate the length of Movie A as follows:
     \[
     \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Length of Movie B} = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   - The length of Movie A is 20 minutes.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20} \text{ minutes}
\]
