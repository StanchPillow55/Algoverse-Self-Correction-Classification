Question ID: 1093

Question:
Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet. A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and cost $12. How much will it cost to paint the room?


Reference Answer:
The north and south walls are 80 square feet each because 10 x 8 = <<10*8=80>>80
The east and west walls are 40 square feet because 5 x 8 = <<5*8=40>>40
The south and north walls total 160 square feet because 80 x 2 = <<80*2=160>>160
The East and west walls total 80 square feet because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
All the walls total 240 square feet because 160 + 80 = <<160+80=240>>240
He will need 12 gallons of paint because 240 / 20 = <<240/20=12>>12
It will cost $144 because 12 x 12 = <<12*12=144>>144

Response:
To determine the total cost of painting the room, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the area of each wall.**
2. **Sum the areas of all four walls to find the total area to be painted.**
3. **Determine how many gallons of paint are needed.**
4. **Calculate the total cost based on the number of gallons required.**

### Step 1: Calculate the area of each wall

- **North wall:** 
  \[
  \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{height} = 10 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} = 80 \, \text{sq ft}
  \]

- **South wall:** 
  \[
  \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{height} = 10 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} = 80 \, \text{sq ft}
  \]

- **East wall:** 
  \[
  \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{height} = 5 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} = 40 \, \text{sq ft}
  \]

- **West wall:** 
  \[
  \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{height} = 5 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} = 40 \, \text{sq ft}
  \]

### Step 2: Sum the areas of all four walls

Now, we add the areas of all the walls together:
\[
\text{Total Area} = \text{Area of North wall} + \text{Area of South wall} + \text{Area of East wall} + \text{Area of West wall}
\]
\[
\text{Total Area} = 80 \, \text{sq ft} + 80 \, \text{sq ft} + 40 \, \text{sq ft} + 40 \, \text{sq ft} = 240 \, \text{sq ft}
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many gallons of paint are needed

Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet. To find out how many gallons are needed, we divide the total area by the coverage per gallon:
\[
\text{Gallons needed} = \frac{\text{Total Area}}{\text{Coverage per gallon}} = \frac{240 \, \text{sq ft}}{20 \, \text{sq ft/gallon}} = 12 \, \text{gallons}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost

Each gallon of paint costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for the paint is:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Gallons needed} \times \text{Cost per gallon} = 12 \, \text{gallons} \times 12 \, \text{dollars/gallon} = 144 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The total cost to paint the room is **$144**.
