Question ID: 546

Question:
Elise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full twice, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Elise written in total?


Reference Answer:
Elise has written the alphabet twice which is a total of 26 * 2 = <<26*2=52>>52 letters.
She then writes half the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = <<26/2=13>>13 letters.
So far, this is a total of 52 + 13 = <<52+13=65>>65 letters.
Writing this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 65 * 2 = <<65*2=130>>130 letters.
#### 130

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to break down the steps of how many letters Elise writes at each stage.

1. **Writing the alphabet in full twice:**
   The English alphabet consists of 26 letters. When Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, we calculate the total letters written in this step as follows:
   \[
   26 \text{ letters} \times 2 = 52 \text{ letters}
   \]

2. **Writing half of the alphabet once:**
   Half of the alphabet means writing 13 letters (since half of 26 is 13). Therefore, the total letters written in this step is:
   \[
   13 \text{ letters}
   \]

3. **Re-writing everything she has already written:**
   At this point, we need to find out how many letters Elise has written so far before she rewrites everything. We already calculated:
   - Letters from writing the alphabet in full twice: 52 letters
   - Letters from writing half of the alphabet: 13 letters

   Now, we add these two amounts together to find the total letters written before the re-writing:
   \[
   52 \text{ letters} + 13 \text{ letters} = 65 \text{ letters}
   \]

   When she rewrites everything she has already written, she writes another 65 letters.

4. **Calculating the total letters written:**
   Now we add the letters from the re-writing step to the total we have so far:
   \[
   65 \text{ letters (previous total)} + 65 \text{ letters (rewritten)} = 130 \text{ letters}
   \]

Thus, the total number of letters Elise has written in total is:
\[
\boxed{130}
\]
