Response:
To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of Facebook friends that Charlie, Dorothy, and James have.

1. **Identify the variables**:
   - Let \( D \) represent the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has.
   - According to the problem, Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, so we can express Charlie's friends as:
     \[
     C = 3D
     \]
   - James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we can express James's friends as:
     \[
     J = 4D
     \]

2. **Use the information given**:
   - We know from the problem that Charlie has 12 friends:
     \[
     C = 12
     \]

3. **Set up the equation**:
   - Since we have \( C = 3D \) and \( C = 12 \), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     3D = 12
     \]

4. **Solve for \( D \)**:
   - To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
     \[
     D = \frac{12}{3} = 4
     \]
   - So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.

5. **Calculate James's friends**:
   - Now that we know \( D \), we can find the number of friends James has using the equation \( J = 4D \):
     \[
     J = 4 \times 4 = 16
     \]

6. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends.

In conclusion, the number of Facebook friends James has is \( \boxed{16} \).
