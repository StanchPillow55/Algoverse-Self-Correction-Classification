Question:
Jen works for 7.5 hours a day 6 days a week. Her hourly rate is $1.5. Jen also receives an additional $10 if she has complete attendance. Suppose Jen did not incur any absences for  April, and there are exactly 4 weeks in April, how much will she receive?


Reference Answer:
In a week, Jen works for 7.5 hours/day x 6 days = <<7.5*6=45>>45 hours/week
So in a month, she works for 45 hours/week x 4 weeks = <<45*4=180>>180 hours.
180 hours of work is equal to 180 hours x $1.5 = $<<180*1.5=270>>270.
Since she has complete attendance, she will receive a total of $270 + $10 = $<<270+10=280>>280.

Response:
To determine how much Jen will receive for the month of April, we need to calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate, the number of hours she works per week, and the additional attendance bonus she receives for having complete attendance.

### Step 1: Calculate Weekly Earnings
Jen works for 7.5 hours a day and 6 days a week. 

First, we calculate the total hours she works in a week:
\[
\text{Total hours per week} = \text{Hours per day} \times \text{Days per week} = 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week}
\]
\[
\text{Total hours per week} = 7.5 \times 6 = 45 \, \text{hours/week}
\]

Next, we calculate her earnings for one week based on her hourly rate of $1.5:
\[
\text{Weekly earnings} = \text{Total hours per week} \times \text{Hourly rate} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times 1.5 \, \text{dollars/hour}
\]
\[
\text{Weekly earnings} = 45 \times 1.5 = 67.5 \, \text{dollars/week}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Monthly Earnings
Since there are 4 weeks in April, we can calculate her total earnings for the month:
\[
\text{Monthly earnings} = \text{Weekly earnings} \times \text{Number of weeks} = 67.5 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks}
\]
\[
\text{Monthly earnings} = 67.5 \times 4 = 270 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Add Attendance Bonus
Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, we add this bonus to her monthly earnings:
\[
\text{Total earnings for April} = \text{Monthly earnings} + \text{Attendance bonus} = 270 \, \text{dollars} + 10 \, \text{dollars}
\]
\[
\text{Total earnings for April} = 270 + 10 = 280 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total amount Jen will receive for the month of April is:
\[
\boxed{280 \, \text{dollars}}
\]
