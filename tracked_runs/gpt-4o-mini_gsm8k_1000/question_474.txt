Question ID: 442

Question:
When Marcus wakes up, his house is 40 degrees. He spends 3 hours baking, and every hour the oven is on it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees. Then Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. What is the house's final temperature?


Reference Answer:
First find the total temperature increase from the oven: 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = <<3*5=15>>15 degrees
Then add that amount to the starting temperature: 15 degrees + 40 degrees = <<15+40=55>>55 degrees
Then divide the time the window is open by 10 minutes to find how many 2-degree temperature decreases there are: 30 minutes / 10 minutes = <<30/10=3>>3
Then multiply the number of decreases by the amount of each decrease: 3 * 2 degrees = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees
Then subtract that amount from the house's temperature after baking to find the final temperature: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = <<55-6=49>>49 degrees

Response:
To find the final temperature of Marcus's house after he bakes and then opens a window, we will break the problem down into steps.

1. **Initial Temperature**: 
   The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees.

2. **Temperature Increase from Baking**:
   Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees for each hour it is on. 
   - The total increase in temperature from baking can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Temperature increase} = \text{hours} \times \text{increase per hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \times 5 \, \text{degrees/hour} = 15 \, \text{degrees}
     \]

3. **New Temperature After Baking**:
   We add the temperature increase from baking to the initial temperature:
   \[
   \text{New temperature} = \text{Initial temperature} + \text{Temperature increase} = 40 \, \text{degrees} + 15 \, \text{degrees} = 55 \, \text{degrees}
   \]

4. **Cooling from Opening the Window**:
   After baking, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - First, we determine how many 10-minute intervals are in 30 minutes:
     \[
     \text{Number of intervals} = \frac{30 \, \text{minutes}}{10 \, \text{minutes/interval}} = 3 \, \text{intervals}
     \]
   - Next, we calculate the total cooling effect:
     \[
     \text{Total cooling} = \text{Number of intervals} \times \text{cooling per interval} = 3 \, \text{intervals} \times 2 \, \text{degrees/interval} = 6 \, \text{degrees}
     \]

5. **Final Temperature After Cooling**:
   We subtract the total cooling from the temperature after baking:
   \[
   \text{Final temperature} = \text{New temperature} - \text{Total cooling} = 55 \, \text{degrees} - 6 \, \text{degrees} = 49 \, \text{degrees}
   \]

Thus, the final temperature of Marcus's house after baking and then opening the window is:

\[
\boxed{49 \, \text{degrees}}
\]
