Question ID: 524

Question:
Jackson is planting tulips. He can fit 6 red tulips in a row and 8 blue tulips in a row. If Jackson buys 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips, how many rows of flowers will he plant?


Reference Answer:
First, divide the number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row: 36 / 6 = <<36/6=6>>6 rows.
Next, divide the number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips per row: 24 / 8 = <<24/8=3>>3 rows.
Now add the number of rows of each color to find the total: 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 rows.
#### 9

Response:
To determine how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for both the red tulips and the blue tulips separately.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of rows for red tulips.**

Jackson has 36 red tulips, and he can fit 6 red tulips in each row. To find out how many rows he can plant, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips per row:

\[
\text{Number of rows for red tulips} = \frac{\text{Total red tulips}}{\text{Red tulips per row}} = \frac{36}{6}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{36}{6} = 6
\]

So, Jackson will plant **6 rows of red tulips**.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of rows for blue tulips.**

Jackson has 24 blue tulips, and he can fit 8 blue tulips in each row. Similarly, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips per row:

\[
\text{Number of rows for blue tulips} = \frac{\text{Total blue tulips}}{\text{Blue tulips per row}} = \frac{24}{8}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{24}{8} = 3
\]

So, Jackson will plant **3 rows of blue tulips**.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of rows.**

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips together to find the total number of rows Jackson will plant:

\[
\text{Total number of rows} = \text{Number of rows for red tulips} + \text{Number of rows for blue tulips} = 6 + 3
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
6 + 3 = 9
\]

Thus, the final answer is that Jackson will plant a total of **9 rows of flowers**.
