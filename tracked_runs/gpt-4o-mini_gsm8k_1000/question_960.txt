Question ID: 1259

Question:
Derrick has a bakery that makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, selling at $2 per doughnut. How much money does Derrick make in June if he sells all the doughnuts?


Reference Answer:
A dozen doughnuts have 12 doughnuts, and if Derrick makes 10 dozen in a day, the total number of doughnuts he makes is 10*12 = <<10*12=120>>120 doughnuts.
Since each doughnut sells at $2 per piece, Derrick makes 120*$2 = $<<120*2=240>>240 per day from selling his doughnuts.
In June, with 30 days, after making and selling the doughnuts every day, Derrick makes $240*30 = $<<30*240=7200>>7200
#### 7200

Response:
To determine how much money Derrick makes in June from selling doughnuts, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in a day.**
   - Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day.
   - Since 1 dozen equals 12, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts:
     \[
     \text{Total doughnuts per day} = 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the doughnuts in a day.**
   - Each doughnut is sold for $2.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in a day is:
     \[
     \text{Revenue per day} = 120 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 240 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of days in June.**
   - June has 30 days.

4. **Calculate the total revenue for the entire month of June.**
   - To find the total revenue for June, we multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in June:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue in June} = \text{Revenue per day} \times \text{Number of days in June}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total revenue in June} = 240 \text{ dollars/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **State the final answer.**
   - Derrick makes a total of **$7200** in June if he sells all the doughnuts.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7200}
\]
