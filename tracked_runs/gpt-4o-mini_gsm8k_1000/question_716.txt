Question ID: 232

Question:
Dax went to their farm to pick some apples and found half as many bugs as ants in the garden. If there were 50 ants, calculate the total number of insects in the garden.


Reference Answer:
If there were 50 ants, the total number of bugs in the garden is 1 bug/2 ants * 50 ants = 25 bugs
The total number of insects in the garden is 25 bugs + 50 ants = <<25+50=75>>75 insects
#### 75

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of insects in the garden, which includes both ants and bugs.

1. **Identify the number of ants**: 
   According to the problem, there are 50 ants in the garden.

2. **Determine the number of bugs**: 
   The problem states that there are half as many bugs as there are ants. Since we know there are 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants}
   \]
   Substituting the number of ants:
   \[
   \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of insects**: 
   The total number of insects in the garden is the sum of the number of ants and the number of bugs:
   \[
   \text{Total insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total insects} = 50 + 25 = 75
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   The total number of insects in the garden is \( \boxed{75} \).
