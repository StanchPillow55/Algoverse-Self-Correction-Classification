Question ID: 181

Question:
Sandra, the florist around the corner, is very unhappy with Fred's incomplete order delivery. Sandra had ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. To keep Sandra's business, how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?


Reference Answer:
Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies / 5 = <<200/5=40>>40 white carnations.
Sandra therefore ordered 4 * 40 = <<4*40=160>>160 red roses.
#### 160

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many red roses Sandra ordered based on the information provided about her order of white carnations and pink calla lilies.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of white carnations Sandra ordered.

2. **Determine the Number of Red Roses**:
   - According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses ordered is:
     \[
     \text{Number of red roses} = 4x
     \]

3. **Determine the Number of Pink Calla Lilies**:
   - The problem states that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     5x = 200
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - To find the number of white carnations, we solve the equation:
     \[
     x = \frac{200}{5} = 40
     \]
   - So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

5. **Calculate the Number of Red Roses**:
   - Now that we know \( x \), we can find the number of red roses:
     \[
     \text{Number of red roses} = 4x = 4 \times 40 = 160
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - To keep Sandra's business, Fred must deliver the missing red roses. The number of red roses that Fred must deliver by 5 pm is:
     \[
     \boxed{160}
     \] 

This completes the reasoning and calculations for the problem. Fred needs to deliver 160 red roses to fulfill Sandra's order.
