Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of the two remaining pizzas after knowing the total cost of all four pizzas and the cost of two of them.

1. **Identify the total cost of the pizzas**: 
   The total cost of the four pizzas is given as 64 dollars.

2. **Identify the cost of two pizzas**: 
   We know that two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars.

3. **Calculate the cost of the remaining two pizzas**: 
   To find the cost of the remaining two pizzas, we subtract the cost of the two pizzas from the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Cost of remaining two pizzas} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Cost of two pizzas}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of remaining two pizzas} = 64 - 30 = 34 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine the cost of each of the remaining two pizzas**: 
   Since the problem states that the two remaining pizzas cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each pizza by dividing the total cost of the remaining two pizzas by 2:
   \[
   \text{Cost of each remaining pizza} = \frac{\text{Cost of remaining two pizzas}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of each remaining pizza} = \frac{34}{2} = 17 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Each of the other two pizzas costs 17 dollars.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Each of the other two pizzas costs } 17 \text{ dollars.}
\]
