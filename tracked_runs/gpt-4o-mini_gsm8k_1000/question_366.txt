Question ID: 967

Question:
Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. What is the total age of all three of the family members?


Reference Answer:
Nani's brother is 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 years old.
Nani's sister is 25/100 * 8 = <<25/100*8=2>>2 years younger than he is.
That means she is 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 years old.
In total all mentioned family members, are 16 + 6 + 8 = <<16+6+8=30>>30 years old.
#### 30

Response:
To solve the problem, we will calculate the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister step by step.

1. **Nani's Age**: 
   - Nani is given to be 8 years old.

2. **Brother's Age**: 
   - It is stated that Nani's brother is twice his age. 
   - Therefore, we calculate the brother's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Brother's Age} = 2 \times \text{Nani's Age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Sister's Age**: 
   - Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. 
   - First, we need to find out what 25% of Nani's age is:
     \[
     25\% \text{ of Nani's Age} = 0.25 \times 8 = 2 \text{ years}
     \]
   - Now, we subtract this amount from Nani's age to find the sister's age:
     \[
     \text{Sister's Age} = \text{Nani's Age} - 25\% \text{ of Nani's Age} = 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Total Age of All Three Family Members**: 
   - Now we will add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister together:
     \[
     \text{Total Age} = \text{Nani's Age} + \text{Brother's Age} + \text{Sister's Age}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Age} = 8 + 16 + 6
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Age} = 30 \text{ years}
     \]

Thus, the total age of all three family members is \( \boxed{30} \) years.
