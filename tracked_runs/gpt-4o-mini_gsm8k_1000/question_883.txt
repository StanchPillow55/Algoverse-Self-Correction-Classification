Question ID: 1152

Question:
Mark buys one lottery ticket with a 20% chance of winning and a second lottery ticket that's three times more likely to win. What is the probability, expressed as a percentage, that both tickets are winners?


Reference Answer:
First triple 20% to find the second ticket's chance of winning: .2 * 3 = <<.2*3=.6>>.6
Then multiply both tickets' chances of winning to find the probability they both win, and multiply that by 100 to convert it to a percentage: .6 * .2 * 100% = 12%
#### 12


=== Turn 1 ===


Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that both lottery tickets purchased by Mark are winners.

1. **Understanding the probabilities**:
   - The first lottery ticket has a 20% chance of winning. This can be expressed as a decimal:
     \[
     P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) = 0.20
     \]

   - The second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. To find the probability of the second ticket winning, we multiply the probability of the first ticket by 3:
     \[
     P(\text{Ticket 2 wins}) = 3 \times P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
     \]

2. **Calculating the probability that both tickets are winners**:
   - The events of winning on each ticket are independent, meaning the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other. Therefore, we can find the probability that both tickets win by multiplying their individual probabilities:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) = P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) \times P(\text{Ticket 2 wins}) = 0.20 \times 0.60
     \]

3. **Performing the multiplication**:
   \[
   P(\text{Both tickets win}) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
   \]

4. **Converting the probability to a percentage**:
   - To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) \text{ (as a percentage)} = 0.12 \times 100 = 12\%
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - The probability that both tickets are winners is:
     \[
     \boxed{12\%}
     \]

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that both lottery tickets purchased by Mark are winners.

1. **Identify the probability of winning for each ticket**:
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. In decimal form, this probability is:
     \[
     P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) = 0.20
     \]

   - The second ticket is said to be three times more likely to win than the first ticket. To find the probability of winning for the second ticket, we multiply the probability of the first ticket by 3:
     \[
     P(\text{Ticket 2 wins}) = 3 \times P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
     \]

2. **Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners**:
   - Since the outcomes of the two tickets are independent (the outcome of one does not affect the outcome of the other), we can find the probability that both tickets win by multiplying their individual probabilities:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) = P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) \times P(\text{Ticket 2 wins}) = 0.20 \times 0.60
     \]

   - Now, we perform the multiplication:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
     \]

3. **Convert the probability to a percentage**:
   - To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) \text{ (as a percentage)} = 0.12 \times 100 = 12\%
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - The probability that both tickets are winners, expressed as a percentage, is:
     \[
     \boxed{12\%}
     \]

   - The first lottery ticket has a 20% chance of winning. This can be expressed as a decimal:
     \[
     P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) = 0.20
     \]

   - The second lottery ticket is described as being three times more likely to win than the first ticket. To find the probability of winning for the second ticket, we multiply the probability of the first ticket by 3:
     \[
     P(\text{Ticket 2 wins}) = 3 \times P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
     \]

2. **Calculating the probability that both tickets win**:
   - The events of winning on each ticket are independent. Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) = P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) \times P(\text{Ticket 2 wins})
     \]
   - Substituting the values we calculated:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) = 0.20 \times 0.60
     \]

3. **Performing the multiplication**:
   \[
   P(\text{Both tickets win}) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
   \]

4. **Converting the probability to a percentage**:
   - To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) \text{ (as a percentage)} = 0.12 \times 100 = 12\%
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   The probability that both tickets are winners is \( \boxed{12\%} \).
