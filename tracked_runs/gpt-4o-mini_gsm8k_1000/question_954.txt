Question ID: 948

Question:
Cayley markets various newspapers to get a commission on each copy sold. He gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times and an 8% commission on each of the Wall Street Journal. How much commission will he earn in total from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of Wall Street Journal if each costs $5 and $15 respectively?


Reference Answer:
He gets a commission of 10% on each copy of the New York Times so for 6 copies he will get 6*$5*(10/100) = $<<6*5*(10/100)=3>>3
He gets a commission of 8% on each copy of Wall Street Journal so for 10 copies he will get 10*$15*(8/100) = $<<10*15*8/100=12>>12
He will make a total commission of $3+$12 = $<<3+12=15>>15

Response:
To find out how much commission Cayley will earn from selling the newspapers, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sales for each type of newspaper.**
2. **Determine the commission for each type of newspaper.**
3. **Add the commissions together to find the total commission.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total sales for each type of newspaper

**New York Times:**
- Price per copy = $5
- Number of copies sold = 6

Total sales from New York Times:
\[
\text{Total Sales NYT} = \text{Price per copy} \times \text{Number of copies sold} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Wall Street Journal:**
- Price per copy = $15
- Number of copies sold = 10

Total sales from Wall Street Journal:
\[
\text{Total Sales WSJ} = \text{Price per copy} \times \text{Number of copies sold} = 15 \times 10 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the commission for each type of newspaper

**Commission for New York Times:**
- Commission rate = 10%

Commission from New York Times:
\[
\text{Commission NYT} = \text{Total Sales NYT} \times \text{Commission Rate} = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Commission for Wall Street Journal:**
- Commission rate = 8%

Commission from Wall Street Journal:
\[
\text{Commission WSJ} = \text{Total Sales WSJ} \times \text{Commission Rate} = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Add the commissions together to find the total commission

Total commission earned:
\[
\text{Total Commission} = \text{Commission NYT} + \text{Commission WSJ} = 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Cayley will earn a total commission of **$15** from the sales of the newspapers.

Response:
To find out how much commission Cayley will earn from selling the newspapers, we need to calculate the commission for each type of newspaper separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the commission from the New York Times:**
   - **Number of copies sold:** 6
   - **Cost per copy:** $5
   - **Commission rate:** 10%

   First, we calculate the total sales from the New York Times:
   \[
   \text{Total sales from New York Times} = \text{Number of copies} \times \text{Cost per copy} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Next, we calculate the commission earned from these sales:
   \[
   \text{Commission from New York Times} = \text{Total sales} \times \text{Commission rate} = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:**
   - **Number of copies sold:** 10
   - **Cost per copy:** $15
   - **Commission rate:** 8%

   First, we calculate the total sales from the Wall Street Journal:
   \[
   \text{Total sales from Wall Street Journal} = \text{Number of copies} \times \text{Cost per copy} = 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Next, we calculate the commission earned from these sales:
   \[
   \text{Commission from Wall Street Journal} = \text{Total sales} \times \text{Commission rate} = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total commission earned:**
   Now, we sum the commissions from both newspapers:
   \[
   \text{Total commission} = \text{Commission from New York Times} + \text{Commission from Wall Street Journal} = 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Cayley will earn a total commission of **$15** from the sales of the newspapers. 

Final answer: **$15**
