Question ID: 1241

Question:
Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 a dozen. She will sell it for $1 for 3 eggs. How much will be Rose's profit?


Reference Answer:
Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 x 5 = $<<2.40*5=12>>12.
Five dozens of eggs is equal to 12 x 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 eggs.
So there are 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 sets of 3 eggs that Rose will sell.
Thus, the total earnings of Rose for selling the eggs are $1 x 20 = $<<20=20>>20.
Therefore, her profit will be $20 - $12 = $<<20-12=8>>8.

Response:
To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate her total costs and her total revenue from selling the eggs.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the eggs

Rose bought five dozens of eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, the total number of eggs she bought is:

\[
5 \text{ dozens} \times 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 60 \text{ eggs}
\]

The cost per dozen is $2.40. Therefore, the total cost for five dozens is:

\[
5 \text{ dozens} \times 2.40 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 12.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs

Rose sells the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs. To find out how much she will earn from selling all 60 eggs, we first need to determine how many groups of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs:

\[
\frac{60 \text{ eggs}}{3 \text{ eggs/group}} = 20 \text{ groups}
\]

Since each group sells for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:

\[
20 \text{ groups} \times 1 \text{ dollar/group} = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the profit

Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. Therefore, Rose's profit is:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Profit} = 20 \text{ dollars} - 12 \text{ dollars} = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Rose's profit from selling the eggs is **$8.00**.
