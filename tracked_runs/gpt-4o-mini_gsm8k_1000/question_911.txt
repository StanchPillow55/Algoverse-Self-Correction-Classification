Question ID: 829

Question:
Boris owns a chocolate factory. He produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. The second week, Boris only produces half as much as the first week. But, the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. How much does he produce the fourth week?


Reference Answer:
In the second week, Boris produces 8,000/2 = <<8000/2=4000>>4,000 bars of chocolate.
In the third week, Boris produces 8,000*3 = <<8000*3=24000>>24,000 bars of chocolate.
In the first three weeks, Boris produces 8,000+4,000+24,000 = <<8000+4000+24000=36000>>36,000 bars of chocolate
In the fourth week, Boris produces 50,000-36,000 = <<50000-36000=14000>>14,000 bars of chocolate.
#### 14,000

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many chocolate bars Boris produces in the fourth week, given the production amounts for the first three weeks.

1. **First Week Production**:
   - Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.

2. **Second Week Production**:
   - In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     \text{Second Week Production} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8,000 = 4,000 \text{ bars}
     \]

3. **Third Week Production**:
   - In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Third Week Production} = 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
     \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks**:
   - Now, we can calculate the total production for the first three weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total Production (First Three Weeks)} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000
   \]
   - Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Total Production (First Three Weeks)} = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Total Monthly Production**:
   - Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. To find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production.
   - Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Fourth Week Production} = 50,000 - 36,000
   \]
   - Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Fourth Week Production} = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, the amount of chocolate bars Boris produces in the fourth week is **14,000 bars**.

**Final Answer**: 14,000 bars

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many chocolate bars Boris produces in the fourth week after knowing his production for the first three weeks.

1. **Production in the First Week**: 
   Boris produces 8,000 bars in the first week.

2. **Production in the Second Week**: 
   In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week. 
   \[
   \text{Production in the second week} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8,000 = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Production in the Third Week**: 
   In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. 
   \[
   \text{Production in the third week} = 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks**: 
   Now, we can calculate the total production for the first three weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total production in three weeks} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Total Monthly Production**: 
   Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars each month. To find out how many bars he produces in the fourth week, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production:
   \[
   \text{Production in the fourth week} = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, the amount of chocolate bars Boris produces in the fourth week is:

\[
\boxed{14,000}
\]

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many chocolate bars Boris produces in the fourth week based on the production in the first three weeks.

1. **First Week Production**:
   - Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.

2. **Second Week Production**:
   - In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     \text{Second Week Production} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8,000 = 4,000 \text{ bars}
     \]

3. **Third Week Production**:
   - In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Third Week Production} = 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
     \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks**:
   - Now, we can calculate the total production for the first three weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total Production} = \text{First Week} + \text{Second Week} + \text{Third Week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Production} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Monthly Production**:
   - Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars each month. Since we have the total production for the first three weeks, we can find out how much he has left to produce in the fourth week.
   - Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Fourth Week Production} = \text{Total Monthly Production} - \text{Total Production for First Three Weeks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Fourth Week Production} = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, the amount of chocolate bars Boris produces in the fourth week is **14,000 bars**.

**Final Answer**: 14,000 bars.
