Question ID: 183

Question:
Two track teams are competing against each other in a 4 by 400 meter relay; a race where each competing team has four members that each run 400 meters, or one lap, around a standard track.  One of the two teams is very well-rounded and each of their members will run their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds.  The other team is less well-rounded; their first runner will run their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds then each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.  Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?


Reference Answer:
The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.
On the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Thus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.
Therefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team in the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference in their times to determine how many seconds the faster team will win by.

### Team A (Well-Rounded Team)
Each member of Team A runs their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, we can calculate the total time for Team A as follows:

\[
\text{Total time for Team A} = 4 \times 55 \text{ seconds} = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Team B (Less Well-Rounded Team)
The first runner of Team B runs their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. We can calculate the times for each runner in Team B:

1. **First runner**: 60 seconds
2. **Second runner**: \(60 - 3 = 57\) seconds
3. **Third runner**: \(57 - 3 = 54\) seconds
4. **Fourth runner**: \(54 - 3 = 51\) seconds

Now, we can calculate the total time for Team B:

\[
\text{Total time for Team B} = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

\[
60 + 57 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 54 = 171
\]
\[
171 + 51 = 222
\]

So, the total time for Team B is:

\[
\text{Total time for Team B} = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Comparing the Times
Now we compare the total times of both teams:

- Team A: 220 seconds
- Team B: 222 seconds

To find out how many seconds Team A wins by, we subtract the total time of Team A from the total time of Team B:

\[
\text{Time difference} = \text{Total time for Team B} - \text{Total time for Team A}
\]
\[
\text{Time difference} = 222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Final Answer
Team A wins by **2 seconds**.

The first runner of Team B runs their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. We can calculate the time for each runner in Team B:

1. **First runner**: 60 seconds
2. **Second runner**: 60 seconds - 3 seconds = 57 seconds
3. **Third runner**: 57 seconds - 3 seconds = 54 seconds
4. **Fourth runner**: 54 seconds - 3 seconds = 51 seconds

Now, we can calculate the total time for Team B:

\[
\text{Total time for Team B} = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51

Calculating this step-by-step:

\[
60 + 57 = 117

\]
\[
171 + 51 = 222
\]

Thus, the total time for Team B is:

\[
\text{Total time for Team B} = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Comparing the times:
Now we can compare the total times of both teams:

- Team A: 220 seconds
- Team B: 222 seconds

To find out how many seconds Team A wins by, we subtract the total time of Team A from the total time of Team B:

\[
\text{Time difference} = \text{Total time for Team B} - \text{Total time for Team A}
\]
\[
\text{Time difference} = 222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Final Answer:
Team A will win by **2 seconds**.

\]

So, the total time for Team B is:

\[
\text{Total time for Team B} = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Finding the difference in times
Now we can find out how many seconds the faster team (Team A) wins by:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total time for Team B} - \text{Total time for Team A}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Conclusion
Team A, the well-rounded team, wins by 2 seconds.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
