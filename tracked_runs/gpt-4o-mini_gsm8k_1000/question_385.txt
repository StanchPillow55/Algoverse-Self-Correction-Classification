Question ID: 17

Question:
Jill gets paid $20 per hour to teach and $30 to be a cheerleading coach. If she works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what's her annual salary?


Reference Answer:
First find the total amount Jill makes per week teaching: $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $<<20*35=700>>700/week
Then find the total amount Jill makes per week coaching: $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $<<30*15=450>>450/week
Then add those two amounts to find the total amount Jill makes per week: $700/week + $450/week = $<<700+450=1150>>1150/week
Then multiply that number by the number of weeks Jill works in a year to find her annual salary: $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $<<1150*50=57500>>57,500
#### 57500

Response:
To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching job and her coaching job separately, and then sum those amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate Jill's earnings from teaching

Jill earns $20 per hour as a teacher. She works 35 hours a week for 50 weeks a year.

1. **Calculate weekly earnings from teaching:**
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings from teaching} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours per week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings from teaching} = 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate annual earnings from teaching:**
   \[
   \text{Annual earnings from teaching} = \text{Weekly earnings} \times \text{Weeks per year}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Annual earnings from teaching} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35,000 \, \text{dollars/year}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Jill's earnings from coaching

Jill earns $30 per hour as a cheerleading coach. She works 15 hours a week for 50 weeks a year.

1. **Calculate weekly earnings from coaching:**
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings from coaching} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours per week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings from coaching} = 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate annual earnings from coaching:**
   \[
   \text{Annual earnings from coaching} = \text{Weekly earnings} \times \text{Weeks per year}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Annual earnings from coaching} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22,500 \, \text{dollars/year}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate Jill's total annual salary

Now, we will add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary.

\[
\text{Total annual salary} = \text{Annual earnings from teaching} + \text{Annual earnings from coaching}
\]
\[
\text{Total annual salary} = 35,000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22,500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57,500 \, \text{dollars/year}
\]

### Final Answer

Jill's annual salary is **$57,500**.

To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching job and her coaching job separately, and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate Earnings from Teaching

Jill earns $20 per hour as a teacher. She works 35 hours a week for 50 weeks a year.

1. **Calculate weekly earnings from teaching:**
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings from teaching} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours per week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings from teaching} = 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate annual earnings from teaching:**
   \[
   \text{Annual earnings from teaching} = \text{Weekly earnings} \times \text{Number of weeks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Annual earnings from teaching} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35,000 \, \text{dollars/year}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Earnings from Coaching

Jill earns $30 per hour as a cheerleading coach. She works 15 hours a week for 50 weeks a year.

1. **Calculate weekly earnings from coaching:**

   \[
   \text{Annual earnings from coaching} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22,500 \, \text{dollars/year}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Annual Salary

Now, we sum the annual earnings from both teaching and coaching to find Jill's total annual salary.

\[
\text{Total annual salary} = \text{Annual earnings from teaching} + \text{Annual earnings from coaching}
\]
\[
\text{Total annual salary} = 35,000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22,500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57,500 \, \text{dollars/year}
\]

### Final Answer

Response:
To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both her teaching job and her cheerleading coaching job separately, and then combine those amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate Jill's earnings as a teacher

1. **Hourly Rate as a Teacher**: $20 per hour
2. **Hours Worked per Week as a Teacher**: 35 hours
3. **Weeks Worked per Year**: 50 weeks

Now, we can calculate her annual earnings from teaching:

\[
\text{Annual Earnings from Teaching} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours per Week} \times \text{Weeks per Year}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Annual Earnings from Teaching} = 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Calculate the weekly earnings from teaching:
   \[
   20 \times 35 = 700 \, \text{dollars/week}
   \]

2. Now, calculate the annual earnings from teaching:
   \[
   700 \times 50 = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Jill's earnings as a cheerleading coach

1. **Hourly Rate as a Cheerleading Coach**: $30 per hour
2. **Hours Worked per Week as a Coach**: 15 hours
3. **Weeks Worked per Year**: 50 weeks

Now, we can calculate her annual earnings from coaching:

\[
\text{Annual Earnings from Coaching} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours per Week} \times \text{Weeks per Year}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Annual Earnings from Coaching} = 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Calculate the weekly earnings from coaching:
   \[
   30 \times 15 = 450 \, \text{dollars/week}
   \]

2. Now, calculate the annual earnings from coaching:
   \[
   450 \times 50 = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year}
   \]

### Step 3: Combine both earnings to find the total annual salary

Now, we add Jill's earnings from teaching and coaching:

\[
\text{Total Annual Salary} = \text{Annual Earnings from Teaching} + \text{Annual Earnings from Coaching}
\]

Substituting the calculated values:

\[
\text{Total Annual Salary} = 35000 + 22500
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Total Annual Salary} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year}
\]

### Final Answer

Jill's annual salary is **$57,500**.
