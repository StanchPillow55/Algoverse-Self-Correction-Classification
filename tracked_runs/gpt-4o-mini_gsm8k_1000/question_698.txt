Question:
Misha picks out 4 blouses from the 30% off rack.  The regular price for each blouse is $20.  How much is the total cost of the discounted blouses?


Reference Answer:
Total regular price for the blouses is $20 x 4 = $<<20*4=80>>80.
Total discount on the blouses is $80 x 30% = $<<80*30*.01=24>>24.
Misha paid $80 - $24 = $<<80-24=56>>56 for the discounted blouses.

Response:
To find the total cost of the discounted blouses that Misha picks out, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the regular price of each blouse.**
   The regular price of each blouse is given as $20.

2. **Calculate the discount amount.**
   The discount is 30% off the regular price. To find the discount amount, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Regular Price} \times \text{Discount Rate}
   \]
   Here, the discount rate is 30%, which can be expressed as a decimal:
   \[
   30\% = 0.30
   \]
   Now we can calculate the discount amount:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the sale price of each blouse.**
   To find the sale price after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price:
   \[
   \text{Sale Price} = \text{Regular Price} - \text{Discount Amount}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Sale Price} = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses.**
   Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we need to multiply the sale price of one blouse by the number of blouses:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Sale Price} \times \text{Number of Blouses}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 14 \times 4 = 56
   \]

5. **State the final answer.**
   The total cost of the discounted blouses is:
   \[
   \boxed{56}
   \]
