Question ID: 296

Question:
Each person in a certain household consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal. Supposing 5 members of the household eat rice every lunch and dinner, how many weeks will a 42 kg bag of rice last?


Reference Answer:
Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.
So, the 5 members consume 0.4 kg/day/person x 5 people = <<0.4*5=2>>2 kg of rice per day.
In a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14kg of rice.
Thus, 42 kg of rice will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = <<42/14=3>>3 weeks.

Response:
To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members consuming rice at every lunch and dinner, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total rice consumption per meal for the household.**
   Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Therefore, for 5 members:
   \[
   \text{Total consumption per meal} = \text{Number of members} \times \text{Consumption per person}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total consumption per meal} = 5 \times 0.2 \text{ kg} = 1 \text{ kg}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total rice consumption per day.**
   Since the household eats rice for both lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption will be:
   \[
   \text{Total daily consumption} = \text{Total consumption per meal} \times \text{Number of meals per day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total daily consumption} = 1 \text{ kg} \times 2 = 2 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**
   To find out how many days the bag will last, we divide the total weight of the rice by the daily consumption:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total weight of rice}}{\text{Total daily consumption}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{2 \text{ kg/day}} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

4. **Convert days into weeks.**
   Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the total number of days into weeks:
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Number of days}}{7}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{21 \text{ days}}{7} = 3 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Thus, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for **3 weeks** for the household of 5 members eating rice at every lunch and dinner.

Final answer: **3 weeks**

1. **Calculate the total rice consumption per meal for the household:**
   Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Therefore, for 5 members:
   \[
   \text{Total rice per meal} = 5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/member} = 1 \text{ kg}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total rice consumption per day:**
   The household eats rice for lunch and dinner, which means 2 meals per day. Thus, the total rice consumption per day is:
   \[
   \text{Total rice per day} = 1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   To find out how many days the 42 kg bag will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:
   \[
   \text{Days} = \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{2 \text{ kg/day}} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

4. **Convert days into weeks:**
   Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the total days into weeks:
   \[
   \text{Weeks} = \frac{21 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Thus, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for **3 weeks**.

Final answer: **3 weeks**.

Response:
To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members consuming rice at every meal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total rice consumption per meal for the household:**
   Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Therefore, for 5 members:
   \[
   \text{Total consumption per meal} = 0.2 \, \text{kg/person} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 1 \, \text{kg}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total rice consumption per day:**
   Since the household eats rice for both lunch and dinner, there are 2 meals per day:
   \[
   \text{Total consumption per day} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   To find out how many days the rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:
   \[
   \text{Days the rice will last} = \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{2 \, \text{kg/day}} = 21 \, \text{days}
   \]

4. **Convert days into weeks:**
   Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the total days into weeks:
   \[
   \text{Weeks the rice will last} = \frac{21 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that the 42 kg bag of rice will last for **3 weeks**.
