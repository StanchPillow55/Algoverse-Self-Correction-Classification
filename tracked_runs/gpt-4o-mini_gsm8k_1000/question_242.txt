Question ID: 377

Question:
Lucy sells apples from her orchard at $4 per piece. On Monday, she sold all the apples picked. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. Come Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day. If Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday, how many apples did she pick over the three days?


Reference Answer:
Since each apple costs $4, it means that on Monday, Lucy picked 56/4 = <<56/4=14>>14 apples
Combining Monday and Tuesday, Lucy picked 14 + 12 = <<14+12=26>>26 apples
On Wednesday, she picked 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 apples
All together, Lucy picked 26 + 24 = <<26+24=50>>50 apples.
#### 50

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples sold on Monday:**
   Lucy sells apples at $4 each. She made $56 from selling the apples on Monday. To find out how many apples she sold, we can use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Number of apples sold} = \frac{\text{Total money earned}}{\text{Price per apple}}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
   \]

   So, Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday.

2. **Determine the number of apples picked on Tuesday:**
   On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. 

3. **Determine the number of apples picked on Wednesday:**
   On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Since she picked 12 apples on Tuesday, we calculate:

   \[
   \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days:**
   Now we can find the total number of apples picked by adding the apples picked on each day:

   \[
   \text{Total apples picked} = \text{Apples on Monday} + \text{Apples on Tuesday} + \text{Apples on Wednesday}
   \]

   We already know:
   - Apples on Monday = 14 (sold)
   - Apples on Tuesday = 12
   - Apples on Wednesday = 24

   Now we add these values:

   \[
   \text{Total apples picked} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

   \[
   \boxed{50}
   \]
