Question ID: 18

Question:
Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.  How many dozens of eggs will she eat in 4 weeks?


Reference Answer:
She eats 3 eggs every day and there are 7 days in a week so she eats 3*7 = <<3*7=21>>21 eggs a week
After 4 weeks she will have eaten 4*21 = <<4*21=84>>84 eggs
There are 12 eggs in 1 dozen and she'll eat 84 eggs so that's 84/12 = <<84/12=7>>7 dozen eggs
#### 7

Response:
To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we can break the problem down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day**:
   Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. Therefore, the number of eggs she eats in one day is:
   \[
   \text{Eggs per day} = 3
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of days in 4 weeks**:
   There are 7 days in a week. Therefore, in 4 weeks, the total number of days is:
   \[
   \text{Total days} = 4 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks**:
   Since she eats 3 eggs each day, the total number of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks is:
   \[
   \text{Total eggs} = \text{Eggs per day} \times \text{Total days} = 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Convert the total number of eggs into dozens**:
   A dozen is equal to 12 eggs. To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
   \[
   \text{Dozens of eggs} = \frac{\text{Total eggs}}{12} = \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12} = 7 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Thus, after performing all the calculations and reasoning through the problem, we find that Claire will eat a total of:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]

dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

Response:
To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Claire uses in one week:**
   - Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of eggs she uses in one week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks:**
   - Now we multiply the number of eggs she uses in one week by 4 to find out how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks:
     \[
     21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Convert the total number of eggs into dozens:**
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen. To find out how many dozens are in 84 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
     \[
     \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Claire will eat **7 dozens of eggs** in 4 weeks.

2. **Calculate the total number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.**
   - Since she uses 21 eggs in one week, in 4 weeks she will use:
     \[
     21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.**
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   - To find out how many dozens are in 84 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
     \[

     \]

Thus, Claire will eat a total of **7 dozens of eggs** in 4 weeks.

Final answer: **7 dozens**.
