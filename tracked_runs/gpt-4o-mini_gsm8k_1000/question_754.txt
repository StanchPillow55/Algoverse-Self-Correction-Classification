Question:
A real estate agent has spent $5 on each newspaper ad and spent $75 on each television ad. He bought 50 newspaper ads and 15 television ads. How much did the real estate agent spend on buying all the ads?


Reference Answer:
He spent a total of $5 x 50 = $<<5*50=250>>250 for the newspaper ads.
He spent a total of $75 x 15 = $<<75*15=1125>>1125 for the television ads.

Response:
To find out how much the real estate agent spent on buying all the ads, we will calculate the total cost for both the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then sum these amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of newspaper ads

The cost of each newspaper ad is $5. The agent bought 50 newspaper ads. We can calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads using the formula:

\[
\text{Total cost of newspaper ads} = \text{Number of newspaper ads} \times \text{Cost per newspaper ad}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total cost of newspaper ads} = 50 \times 5
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total cost of newspaper ads} = 250
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of television ads

The cost of each television ad is $75. The agent bought 15 television ads. We can calculate the total cost for the television ads using the same formula:

\[
\text{Total cost of television ads} = \text{Number of television ads} \times \text{Cost per television ad}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total cost of television ads} = 15 \times 75
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total cost of television ads} = 1125
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all ads

Now, we will sum the total costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total expenditure:

\[
\text{Total cost of all ads} = \text{Total cost of newspaper ads} + \text{Total cost of television ads}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total cost of all ads} = 250 + 1125
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total cost of all ads} = 1375
\]

### Final Answer

The real estate agent spent a total of **$1375** on buying all the ads.
