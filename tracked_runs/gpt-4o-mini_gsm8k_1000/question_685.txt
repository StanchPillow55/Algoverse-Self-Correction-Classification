Question:
Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley. If Haley is 26 years old, how old is Geb?

Response:
To find Geb's age based on the information provided, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify Haley's age**: We know from the problem that Haley is 26 years old.

2. **Calculate half of Haley's age**: 
   \[
   \text{Half of Haley's age} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
   \]

3. **Determine Geb's age**: The problem states that Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley. Therefore, we need to subtract 10 from the half of Haley's age:
   \[
   \text{Geb's age} = 13 - 10 = 3
   \]

4. **Final answer**: After performing the calculations, we find that Geb is 3 years old.

Thus, Geb's age is \( \boxed{3} \).
