Question ID: 1131

Question:
John cuts down an 80-foot tree.  He can make logs out of 80% of it. He cuts it into 4-foot logs.  From each of those logs, he cuts 5 planks.  He then sells each plank for $1.2.  How much does he make?


Reference Answer:
He can use 80*.8=<<80*.8=64>>64 feet of the tree.
That means he can make 64/4=<<64/4=16>>16 logs.
That gives him16*5=<<16*5=80>>80 planks.
So he makes 80*1.2=$<<80*1.2=96>>96.
#### 96

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the usable length of the tree**: 
   John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree. 
   \[
   \text{Usable length} = 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of 4-foot logs**: 
   Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs can be made from the 64 feet of usable wood. 
   \[
   \text{Number of logs} = \frac{\text{Usable length}}{\text{Length of each log}} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of planks from the logs**: 
   From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can cut from the 16 logs is:
   \[
   \text{Total planks} = \text{Number of logs} \times \text{Planks per log} = 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total earnings from selling the planks**: 
   John sells each plank for $1.2. Thus, his total earnings from selling all the planks is:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Total planks} \times \text{Price per plank} = 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we can summarize the calculations:

- Usable length of the tree: 64 feet
- Number of logs: 16 logs
- Total number of planks: 80 planks
- Total earnings: $96

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{96}
\] 

John makes $96 from selling the planks.
