Question:
Greta and Celinda are baking cookies. Greta bakes 30 cookies and Celinda bakes twice as many. If the pair eat 10 of the cookies while they are cooling and put the rest in a box, how many cookies are there in the box?


Reference Answer:
Celinda bakes 30 cookies * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 cookies.
So in total, Celinda and Greta bakes a total of 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 cookies.
After eating some of the cookies, they have 90 baked cookies â€“ 10 eaten cookies = <<90-10=80>>80 cookies in the box.
#### 80

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many cookies Greta bakes:**
   - Greta bakes 30 cookies.

2. **Determine how many cookies Celinda bakes:**
   - Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta. 
   - Therefore, the number of cookies Celinda bakes is:
     \[
     2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cookies}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:**
   - To find the total number of cookies, we add the cookies baked by Greta and Celinda:
     \[
     30 + 60 = 90 \text{ cookies}
     \]

4. **Determine how many cookies they eat:**
   - Greta and Celinda eat 10 cookies while they are cooling.

5. **Calculate the number of cookies left after they eat some:**
   - To find the number of cookies left, we subtract the number of cookies they ate from the total number of cookies:
     \[
     90 - 10 = 80 \text{ cookies}
     \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - The number of cookies that are in the box is:
     \[
     \boxed{80}
     \] 

Thus, after following all the steps and calculations, we conclude that there are 80 cookies in the box.
