Question ID: 121

Question:
Morisette and Kael were asked to bring fruits. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, while Kael brought twice the amount of apples and half the number of oranges than Morisette. How many fruits do they have in total?


Reference Answer:
Kael brought 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 apples.
And he also brought 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 oranges.
Therefore, Kael and Morisette brought 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = <<5+10+8+4=27>>27 fruits in total.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many fruits Morisette and Kael brought in total. We will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of fruits Morisette brought:**
   - Morisette brought:
     - Apples: 5
     - Oranges: 8

   Therefore, the total number of fruits Morisette brought is:
   \[
   \text{Total fruits from Morisette} = \text{Number of apples} + \text{Number of oranges} = 5 + 8 = 13
   \]

2. **Determine the number of fruits Kael brought:**
   - Kael brought twice the amount of apples that Morisette brought:
     \[
     \text{Kael's apples} = 2 \times \text{Morisette's apples} = 2 \times 5 = 10
     \]
   - Kael brought half the number of oranges that Morisette brought:
     \[
     \text{Kael's oranges} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Morisette's oranges} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4
     \]

   Therefore, the total number of fruits Kael brought is:
   \[
   \text{Total fruits from Kael} = \text{Kael's apples} + \text{Kael's oranges} = 10 + 4 = 14
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of fruits brought by both Morisette and Kael:**
   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = \text{Total fruits from Morisette} + \text{Total fruits from Kael} = 13 + 14 = 27
   \]

Thus, the total number of fruits that Morisette and Kael have together is:
\[
\boxed{27}
\]
