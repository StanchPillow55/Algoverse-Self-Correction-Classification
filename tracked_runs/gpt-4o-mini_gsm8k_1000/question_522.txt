Question ID: 366

Question:
To be promoted to the next school year, Jane takes 3 tests that together must total at least 42 points. On her first test, Jane scored 15 points, on the second test she scored 18 points. What is the minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass?


Reference Answer:
Adding the points obtained in the first two tests, Jane scored 15 + 18 = <<15+18=33>>33 points.
To pass, Jane must score 42 - 33 = <<42-33=9>>9 points.

Response:
To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to be promoted to the next school year, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total points needed**: Jane needs a total of at least 42 points from all three tests combined.

2. **Calculate the points Jane has already scored**: 
   - On the first test, Jane scored 15 points.
   - On the second test, Jane scored 18 points.
   
   We can calculate the total points she has scored so far:
   \[
   \text{Total points scored} = \text{Points from Test 1} + \text{Points from Test 2} = 15 + 18
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total points scored} = 33
   \]

3. **Determine the points needed from the third test**: 
   To find out how many points Jane needs on the third test, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Total points needed} = \text{Points scored on Test 1} + \text{Points scored on Test 2} + \text{Points scored on Test 3}
   \]
   We know that the total points needed is at least 42, so we can express this as:
   \[
   33 + \text{Points scored on Test 3} \geq 42
   \]

4. **Solve for the points needed on the third test**:
   To find the minimum score Jane needs on the third test, we can rearrange the inequality:
   \[
   \text{Points scored on Test 3} \geq 42 - 33
   \]
   \[
   \text{Points scored on Test 3} \geq 9
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: 
   Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9 points.

Final answer: **9 points**.

Response:
To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to be promoted to the next school year, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total points needed**: Jane needs a total of at least 42 points from all three tests combined.

2. **Calculate the points Jane has already scored**:
   - On the first test, Jane scored 15 points.
   - On the second test, Jane scored 18 points.
   
   We can calculate her total score from the first two tests:
   \[
   \text{Total score from first two tests} = 15 + 18 = 33 \text{ points}
   \]

3. **Determine the points needed from the third test**:
   To find out how many points Jane needs on the third test, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   \text{Total score from all tests} = \text{Score on Test 1} + \text{Score on Test 2} + \text{Score on Test 3}
   \]
   We know that:
   \[
   \text{Score on Test 1} = 15, \quad \text{Score on Test 2} = 18, \quad \text{Score on Test 3} = x
   \]
   Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   15 + 18 + x \geq 42
   \]

4. **Simplify the inequality**:
   Combine the scores from the first two tests:
   \[
   33 + x \geq 42
   \]

5. **Isolate \(x\)**:
   To find \(x\), we subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:
   \[
   x \geq 42 - 33
   \]
   \[
   x \geq 9
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to meet the requirement of a total of at least 42 points.

Thus, the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test is **9 points**.
