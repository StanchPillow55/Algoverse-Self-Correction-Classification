Question ID: 286

Question:
Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, how many cents will she have left?


Reference Answer:
Her quarters are worth 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 cents.
The dimes are worth 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 cents
Kelly has a total of 125 + 20 = <<125+20=145>>145 cents
After buying the can of pop, Kelly will have 145 - 55 = <<145-55=90>>90 cents left.
#### 90

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Kelly has initially and then subtract the cost of the can of pop to find out how much she has left.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Kelly has.**

1. **Calculate the value of the quarters:**
   - Kelly has 5 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth 25 cents.
   - Therefore, the total value of the quarters is:
     \[
     5 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 125 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Calculate the value of the dimes:**
   - Kelly has 2 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth 10 cents.
   - Therefore, the total value of the dimes is:
     \[
     2 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 20 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Kelly has:**
   - Now, we add the total value of the quarters and the dimes:
     \[
     125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents}
     \]

**Step 2: Subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount.**

- The cost of the can of pop is 55 cents.
- We will subtract this amount from the total amount Kelly has:
  \[
  145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents}
  \]

**Final Answer:**
Kelly will have **90 cents** left after buying the can of pop.
