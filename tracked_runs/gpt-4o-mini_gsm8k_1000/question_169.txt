Question ID: 882

Question:
Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kelly’s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?


Reference Answer:
Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.
She therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.

Response:
To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget after shopping, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart step by step.

1. **Cost of Bacon**:
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost a total of $10.
   - Therefore, the cost of bacon is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of bacon} = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of Chicken**:
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Since the total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of one packet of chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries**:
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for strawberries is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of Apples**:
   - Each pack of apples is priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Since each pack of strawberries costs $4, the cost of one pack of apples is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total Cost of All Items**:
   - Now we can calculate the total cost of all items in Kelly's cart:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Calculating Remaining Budget**:
   - Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left after her purchases, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
     \[
     \text{Remaining budget} = \text{Budget} - \text{Total cost}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Remaining budget} = 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget is \(\boxed{5}\) dollars.
