Question:
Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10000 and a phone for $800. Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200 to help him. How much money does he still need?


Reference Answer:
The amount of purchases Gabriel wants to make is $10000 + $800 = $<<10000+800=10800>>10800.
And Gabriel has $5000 + $200 = $<<5000+200=5200>>5200.
So, Gabriel still needs $10800 - $5200 = $<<10800-5200=5600>>5600.
#### 5600

Response:
To determine how much money Gabriel still needs to buy a car and a phone, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the car and phone.**
   - Cost of the car: $10,000
   - Cost of the phone: $800
   - Total cost = Cost of the car + Cost of the phone

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 10,000 + 800 = 10,800
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has.**
   - Money from working: $5,000
   - Money from his brother: $200
   - Total money = Money from working + Money from his brother

   \[
   \text{Total money} = 5,000 + 200 = 5,200
   \]

3. **Determine how much more money Gabriel needs.**
   - Amount needed = Total cost - Total money

   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = 10,800 - 5,200 = 5,600
   \]

Thus, Gabriel still needs **$5,600** to buy the car and the phone.

Final answer: Gabriel still needs **$5,600**.
