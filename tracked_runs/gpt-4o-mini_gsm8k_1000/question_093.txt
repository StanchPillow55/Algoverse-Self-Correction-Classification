Question ID: 125

Question:
Julia was preparing for a dinner party at her house, where she intended to serve stew.  She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons.  Later, her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.  While Julia was making the stew, she used three of the spoons to sample her stew.  Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.  How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?


Reference Answer:
The total number of spoons from Julia and her husband was 12+3=<<12+3=15>>15 spoons.
Since the husband bought a package of five spoons, then Julia's package contained 15-5=<<15-5=10>>10 spoons.

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought. Let's break down the information given step by step.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought.

2. **Information about the spoons:**
   - Julia bought \( x \) spoons.
   - Her husband bought 5 additional spoons.
   - Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.

3. **Calculate the total number of spoons before setting the table:**
   - The total number of spoons Julia had after buying her package and receiving the spoons from her husband, but before using any, is:
     \[
     x + 5
     \]
   - After using 3 spoons, the number of spoons remaining is:
     \[
     (x + 5) - 3 = x + 2
     \]

4. **Total spoons when setting the table:**
   - We know that when Julia went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     x + 2 = 12
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     x = 12 - 2
     \]
     \[
     x = 10
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

Thus, the final answer is that Julia bought **10 spoons** in the package.
