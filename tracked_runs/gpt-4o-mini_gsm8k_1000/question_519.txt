Response:
To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of clothing item and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the shorts:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
   - The cost of one pair of shorts is $16.50.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the shorts can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of shorts} = \text{Number of pairs} \times \text{Cost per pair} = 3 \times 16.50
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     3 \times 16.50 = 49.50
     \]
   - So, the total cost of the shorts is **$49.50**.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the pants:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
   - The cost of one pair of pants is $22.50.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the pants can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of pants} = \text{Number of pairs} \times \text{Cost per pair} = 3 \times 22.50
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     3 \times 22.50 = 67.50
     \]
   - So, the total cost of the pants is **$67.50**.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the shoes:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - The cost of one pair of shoes is $42.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the shoes can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of shoes} = \text{Number of pairs} \times \text{Cost per pair} = 3 \times 42
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     3 \times 42 = 126
     \]
   - So, the total cost of the shoes is **$126.00**.

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on all clothing items:**
   - Now we sum the total costs of shorts, pants, and shoes:
     \[
     \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of shorts} + \text{Total cost of pants} + \text{Total cost of shoes}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we calculated:
     \[
     \text{Total amount spent} = 49.50 + 67.50 + 126
     \]
   - Performing the addition step-by-step:
     - First, add the cost of shorts and pants:
       \[
       49.50 + 67.50 = 117.00
       \]
     - Now add the cost of shoes:
       \[
       117.00 + 126 = 243.00
       \]

Therefore, the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items is **$243.00**. 

Final answer: **$243.00**.
