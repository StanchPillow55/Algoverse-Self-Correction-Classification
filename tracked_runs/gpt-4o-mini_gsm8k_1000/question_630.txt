Question ID: 928

Question:
Rita hand-picks Junebugs off of her plants every summer.  On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.  On both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday.  Thursday she removed 48 and on Friday she removed 57.  What is the average number of Junebugs that she removes per day?


Reference Answer:
On both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as the 39 on Monday so she removed 2*39 = <<2*39=78>>78 Junebugs
All total she has removed 39+78+78+48+57 = <<39+78+78+48+57=300>>300 Junebugs
She has removed 300 Junebugs over 5 days so she has removed, on average 300/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 Junebugs per day
#### 60

Response:
To find the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

1. **Calculate the number of Junebugs removed each day:**
   - **Monday:** Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
   - **Tuesday:** She removed twice as many as Monday, so:
     \[
     \text{Tuesday} = 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ Junebugs}
     \]
   - **Wednesday:** Again, she removed twice as many as Monday, so:
     \[
     \text{Wednesday} = 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ Junebugs}
     \]
   - **Thursday:** She removed 48 Junebugs.
   - **Friday:** She removed 57 Junebugs.

2. **Total number of Junebugs removed:**
   Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} + \text{Thursday} + \text{Friday}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total} = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition step-by-step:
   - First, add Monday and Tuesday:
     \[
     39 + 78 = 117
     \]
   - Next, add Wednesday:
     \[
     117 + 78 = 195
     \]
   - Then, add Thursday:
     \[
     195 + 48 = 243
     \]
   - Finally, add Friday:
     \[
     243 + 57 = 300
     \]

   So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is:
   \[
   \text{Total} = 300 \text{ Junebugs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day:**
   Rita removed Junebugs over 5 days (Monday to Friday). The average is calculated by dividing the total number of Junebugs by the number of days:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{300}{5}
   \]

   Performing the division:
   \[
   \text{Average} = 60
   \]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \( \boxed{60} \).
