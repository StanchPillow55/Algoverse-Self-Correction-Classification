Question ID: 757

Question:
Krissa needs to order field trip shirts for her preschool students. 11 students need size extra-small.  Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.  Half as many students need size large as size medium.  Six more students need size extra-large than large.  Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?


Reference Answer:
Krissa ordered 11 x 2 = <<11*2=22>>22 size small.
She ordered 22 - 4 = <<22-4=18>>18 size medium.
She ordered 18 / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 size large.
She ordered 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 size extra-large.
Altogether, Krissa ordered 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = <<11+22+18+9+15=75>>75 shirts.
#### 75

Response:
To solve the problem, we will define the number of students needing each shirt size based on the information provided. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Extra-small shirts**: 
   - We know that 11 students need size extra-small.
   \[
   \text{Extra-small} = 11
   \]

2. **Small shirts**: 
   - The problem states that twice as many students need size small as extra-small. Therefore, we calculate the number of small shirts as follows:
   \[
   \text{Small} = 2 \times \text{Extra-small} = 2 \times 11 = 22
   \]

3. **Medium shirts**: 
   - It is stated that four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Thus, we calculate the number of medium shirts:
   \[
   \text{Medium} = \text{Small} - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18
   \]

4. **Large shirts**: 
   - The problem indicates that half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, we calculate the number of large shirts:
   \[
   \text{Large} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Medium} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
   \]

5. **Extra-large shirts**: 
   - Finally, it is mentioned that six more students need size extra-large than large. Thus, we calculate the number of extra-large shirts:
   \[
   \text{Extra-large} = \text{Large} + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15
   \]

Now that we have calculated the number of shirts needed for each size, we can sum them up to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order.

6. **Total shirts**:
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{Extra-small} + \text{Small} + \text{Medium} + \text{Large} + \text{Extra-large}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total} = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15
   \]

Now, let's perform the addition step by step:
- First, add the extra-small and small:
  \[
  11 + 22 = 33
  \]
- Next, add medium:
  \[
  33 + 18 = 51
  \]
- Then, add large:
  \[
  51 + 9 = 60
  \]
- Finally, add extra-large:
  \[
  60 + 15 = 75
  \]

Thus, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is:
\[
\boxed{75}
\]
