Question ID: 331

Question:
Nick is choosing between two jobs. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, and is in a state with a 20% total tax rate. Job B pays $42,000 a year and is in a state that charges $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax. How much more money will Nick make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job?


Reference Answer:
First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000
Next, calculate the amount of taxes Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: .2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000
Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000
Now multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600
Now subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400
Now subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income from the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400

Response:
To determine which job provides a higher net pay for Nick, we will calculate the net income for both Job A and Job B, taking into account their respective tax rates.

### Step 1: Calculate Net Income for Job A

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000

First, we calculate the annual gross income for Job A:

\[
\text{Gross Income} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Hours per Year} = 15 \times 2000 = 30000
\]

Next, we apply the tax rate of 20% to this gross income to find the net income:

\[
\text{Tax Amount} = \text{Gross Income} \times \text{Tax Rate} = 30000 \times 0.20 = 6000
\]

Now, we subtract the tax amount from the gross income to find the net income:

\[
\text{Net Income} = \text{Gross Income} - \text{Tax Amount} = 30000 - 6000 = 24000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Net Income for Job B

**Job B:**
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Tax rate on net income after property tax: 10%

First, we calculate the net income after property tax:

\[
\text{Net Income After Property Tax} = \text{Annual Salary} - \text{Property Tax} = 42000 - 6000 = 36000
\]

Next, we apply the 10% tax rate on this net income after property tax:

\[
\text{Tax Amount} = \text{Net Income After Property Tax} \times \text{Tax Rate} = 36000 \times 0.10 = 3600
\]

Now, we subtract the tax amount from the net income after property tax to find the final net income for Job B:

\[
\text{Final Net Income} = \text{Net Income After Property Tax} - \text{Tax Amount} = 36000 - 3600 = 32400
\]

### Step 3: Compare Net Incomes

Now we compare the net incomes from both jobs:

- Net Income from Job A: $24,000
- Net Income from Job B: $32,400

To find out how much more money Nick will make at Job B compared to Job A, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Net Income from Job B} - \text{Net Income from Job A} = 32400 - 24000 = 8400
\]

### Final Answer

Nick will make **$8,400** more at Job B compared to Job A.
