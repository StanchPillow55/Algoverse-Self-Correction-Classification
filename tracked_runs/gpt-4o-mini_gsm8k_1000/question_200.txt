Question ID: 288

Question:
A landscaping company is delivering flagstones to a customer’s yard. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. If the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, how many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip?


Reference Answer:
The 80 flagstones weight 75 * 80 = <<75*80=6000>>6000 pounds.
Thus, the landscaping company will need 6000 / 2000 = <<6000/2000=3>>3 trucks to transport the flagstones in one trip.

Response:
To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the flagstones.**
   Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of 80 flagstones can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Number of flagstones} \times \text{Weight per flagstone}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 80 \times 75
   \]

   Now, performing the multiplication:

   \[
   80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

   So, the total weight of the 80 flagstones is 6000 pounds.

2. **Determine the weight capacity of one truck.**
   According to the problem, each delivery truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds.

3. **Calculate the number of trucks needed.**
   To find out how many trucks are required to transport the total weight of 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of one truck:

   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Weight capacity of one truck}}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{6000}{2000}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \frac{6000}{2000} = 3
   \]

   Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport the 80 flagstones.

4. **Final answer.**
   The landscaping company will need **3 trucks** to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.
