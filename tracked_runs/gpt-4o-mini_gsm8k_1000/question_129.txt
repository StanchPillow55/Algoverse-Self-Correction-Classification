Question ID: 319

Question:
The ratio of the electric poles and electric wires needed to connect and supply the electricity in a certain neighborhood is 1:3. If the total number of electric wires needed to connect the electricity in the neighborhood is 45, calculate the total number of electric poles required by an electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood.


Reference Answer:
The total ratio representing the number of electric poles and wires is 1+3=<<1+3=4>>4
The fraction representing the number of wires required to connect the neighborhood's electricity is <<3/4=3/4>>3/4
If 3/4 represents 45, the number of wires required for the connections, then the total fraction which is 4/4, representing the poles and wires needed, represents 4/4*45*4/3=60
Since the total number of wires and poles required is 60, and the number of electric wires to be used is 45, the number of poles required is 60-45=<<60-45=15>>15

Response:
To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

Letâ€™s denote:
- The number of electric poles as \( P \)
- The number of electric wires as \( W \)

From the ratio, we can express the relationship between poles and wires mathematically:
\[
\frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

This can be rearranged to express \( P \) in terms of \( W \):
\[
P = \frac{1}{3} W
\]

We are given that the total number of electric wires \( W \) is 45. We can substitute this value into our equation:
\[
P = \frac{1}{3} \times 45
\]

Now, we perform the calculation:
\[
P = \frac{45}{3} = 15
\]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply electricity in the neighborhood is \( P = 15 \).

Finally, we state the answer:
\[
\text{The total number of electric poles required is } 15.
\]
