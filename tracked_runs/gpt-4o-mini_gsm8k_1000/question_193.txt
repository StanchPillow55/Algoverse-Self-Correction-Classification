Question:
The amount of water passing through a river at one point in time is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles at the same point. If the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases by 6000 gallons on the third day, calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point.


Reference Answer:
After a day of rain, the volume of water in the river passing at one point in time doubled to 2*4000 = <<2*4000=8000>>8000 gallons.
After more heavy rains, the volume of water passing through the river on the third day is 8000+6000 = <<8000+6000=14000>>14000 gallons.
#### 14000

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the specified point over the three days.

1. **Initial Amount of Water**:
   - On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is given as 4000 gallons.

2. **Amount of Water After Heavy Rain**:
   - After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. Therefore, we calculate the new amount:
   \[
   \text{Amount after rain} = 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Amount of Water on the Third Day**:
   - On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. We add this increase to the amount from the second day:
   \[
   \text{Amount on the third day} = 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **Total Amount of Water**:
   - Now, we need to find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days. We will sum the amounts from each day:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \text{Day 1} + \text{Day 2} + \text{Day 3}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 4000 + 8000 + 14000
   \]

5. **Calculating the Total**:
   - Now we perform the addition:
   \[
   4000 + 8000 = 12000
   \]
   \[
   12000 + 14000 = 26000
   \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days is:

\[
\boxed{26000} \text{ gallons}
\]


Extracted Answer: 26000

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the amount of water passing through the river at each stage.

1. **Initial Amount of Water**: 
   The problem states that the amount of water passing through the river at one point in time is 4000 gallons.

   \[
   \text{Initial amount} = 4000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **After Heavy Rain (Day 1)**: 
   After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. Therefore, we calculate the new amount:

   \[
   \text{Amount after rain} = 2 \times \text{Initial amount} = 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Increase on the Third Day**: 
   On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. We need to add this increase to the amount of water from Day 1:

   \[
   \text{Total amount on Day 3} = \text{Amount after rain} + 6000 = 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **Final Calculation**: 
   Now we have calculated the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the rain and the increase on the third day:

   \[
   \text{Final total amount} = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:

\[
\boxed{14000} \text{ gallons}
\]
