Question ID: 313

Question:
Six years ago, when Noah was half as old as Cera, the population of Chile was half what it is now. Currently, Cera is 46 years old. If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, calculate the population of Chile now.


Reference Answer:
If Cera is 46 years old now, she was 46-6 = <<46-6=40>>40 years old six years ago.
Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, meaning Noah was 1/2*40 = 20 years.
If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, there were 3000*20 = <<3000*20=60000>>60000 people living in chile.
Since the population of Chile was half what it was now six years ago, currently Chile has 60000*2 = <<60000*2=120000>>120000 people
#### 120000

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's current age**:
   We know that Cera is currently 46 years old. Six years ago, Cera's age was:
   \[
   46 - 6 = 40 \text{ years old}
   \]

   According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, Noah's age six years ago was:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ years old}
   \]

   To find Noah's current age, we add 6 years to his age six years ago:
   \[
   20 + 6 = 26 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **Calculate the population of Chile six years ago**:
   The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah at that time. Since we found that Noah was 20 years old six years ago, we can calculate the population:
   \[
   \text{Population six years ago} = 3000 \times 20 = 60000
   \]

3. **Determine the current population of Chile**:
   The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. Let \( P \) be the current population of Chile. According to the information given:
   \[
   \frac{P}{2} = 60000
   \]

   To find \( P \), we multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   The current population of Chile is:
   \[
   \boxed{120000}
   \]
