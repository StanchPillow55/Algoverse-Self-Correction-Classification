Question ID: 548

Question:
Mark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month. If his final weight was 70 pounds, what was his initial weight?


Reference Answer:
Since Mark was losing 10 pounds each month, in 3 months he lost 10 * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 pounds.
Adding the weight lost to the final weight gives an initial weight of 70 + 30 = <<70+30=100>>100 pounds.
Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.

Response:
To find Mark's initial weight, we need to consider the weight he lost during the 3 months he was unwell and his final weight.

1. **Determine the total weight lost**: 
   Mark lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months. We can calculate the total weight lost as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total weight lost} = \text{Weight lost per month} \times \text{Number of months}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight lost} = 10 \text{ pounds/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Identify Mark's final weight**: 
   According to the problem, Mark's final weight after losing weight is 70 pounds.

3. **Calculate Mark's initial weight**: 
   To find Mark's initial weight, we need to add the total weight lost to his final weight:
   \[
   \text{Initial weight} = \text{Final weight} + \text{Total weight lost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Initial weight} = 70 \text{ pounds} + 30 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, Mark's initial weight was **100 pounds**.

Final answer: **100 pounds**.
