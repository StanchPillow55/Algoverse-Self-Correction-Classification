Question ID: 694

Question:
Tomorrow, 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending a function at Miaâ€™s restaurant. The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. If there are 8 high chairs, how many more chairs does she have to get?


Reference Answer:
Since there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = <<8*5=40>>40 regular chairs
The total number of both types of chairs is therefore 8 + 40 = <<8+40=48>>48 chairs
However, the total number of attendants will be 42 + 15 = <<42+15=57>>57 people
Mia will therefore need 57-48 = <<57-48=9>>9 more chairs
#### 9

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many regular chairs Mia's restaurant has and how many more chairs she needs to accommodate all the attendees.

1. **Identify the number of high chairs:**
   The problem states that there are 8 high chairs.

2. **Determine the number of regular chairs:**
   According to the problem, the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Therefore, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

   \[
   \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times \text{Number of high chairs}
   \]

   Substituting the number of high chairs:

   \[
   \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of attendees:**
   The total number of attendees consists of 42 adults and 15 babies. We can find the total by adding these two numbers:

   \[
   \text{Total attendees} = \text{Number of adults} + \text{Number of babies}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Total attendees} = 42 + 15 = 57
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of chairs currently available:**
   Now, we need to find the total number of chairs available in the restaurant, which is the sum of regular chairs and high chairs:

   \[
   \text{Total chairs} = \text{Number of regular chairs} + \text{Number of high chairs}
   \]

   Substituting the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Total chairs} = 40 + 8 = 48
   \]

5. **Determine how many more chairs are needed:**
   To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the total number of chairs available from the total number of attendees:

   \[
   \text{Chairs needed} = \text{Total attendees} - \text{Total chairs}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Chairs needed} = 57 - 48 = 9
   \]

Thus, Mia needs to get **9 more chairs** to accommodate all the attendees.

**Final Answer: 9**
