Question ID: 880

Question:
Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long. Her friend wants to buy the rope for $2 a meter. Sarah plans to use the profit to buy a new rope, which at the store costs $1.5 a meter. How much money will she have left over after she buys the new rope?


Reference Answer:
Her friend pays her $40 for the rope because 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40
She can buy the rope at the store for $30 because 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30
She has $10 left over because 40 - 30 = <<40-30=10>>10

Response:
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount Sarah will earn from selling the rope.**
2. **Determine how much new rope Sarah can buy with her earnings.**
3. **Calculate the total cost of the new rope.**
4. **Find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount Sarah will earn from selling the rope.

Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 per meter. 

To find the total earnings from selling the rope, we multiply the length of the rope by the price per meter:

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Length of Rope} \times \text{Price per Meter}
\]
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much new rope Sarah can buy with her earnings.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of new rope Sarah can buy, we divide her total earnings by the cost per meter of the new rope:

\[
\text{Meters of New Rope} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{\text{Cost per Meter of New Rope}}
\]
\[
\text{Meters of New Rope} = \frac{40 \, \text{dollars}}{1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter}} \approx 26.67 \, \text{meters}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the new rope.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of the new rope that Sarah can buy. Since she can buy approximately 26.67 meters, we multiply this by the cost per meter:

\[
\text{Total Cost of New Rope} = \text{Meters of New Rope} \times \text{Cost per Meter of New Rope}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost of New Rope} = 26.67 \, \text{meters} \times 1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter} \approx 40 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope.

Now, we subtract the total cost of the new rope from her total earnings:

\[
\text{Money Left Over} = \text{Total Earnings} - \text{Total Cost of New Rope}
\]
\[
\text{Money Left Over} = 40 \, \text{dollars} - 40 \, \text{dollars} = 0 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

After selling the rope and buying the new rope, Sarah will have **$0 left over**.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total selling price of the rope Sarah is selling.**
   - Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long.
   - Her friend wants to buy the rope for $2 per meter.
   - Therefore, the total selling price can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Length of Rope} \times \text{Price per Meter}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Selling Price} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine how much new rope Sarah can buy with the profit.**
   - The cost of the new rope is $1.5 per meter.
   - To find out how many meters of new rope Sarah can buy with the $40 she received from selling the old rope, we use the following formula:
     \[
     \text{Meters of New Rope} = \frac{\text{Total Money}}{\text{Cost per Meter of New Rope}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Meters of New Rope} = \frac{40 \, \text{dollars}}{1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter}} \approx 26.67 \, \text{meters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the new rope Sarah can buy.**
   - Since Sarah can buy approximately 26.67 meters of new rope, we need to calculate the total cost for this amount:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost of New Rope} = \text{Meters of New Rope} \times \text{Cost per Meter of New Rope}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Cost of New Rope} = 26.67 \, \text{meters} \times 1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter} \approx 40 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine how much money Sarah has left over after buying the new rope.**
   - Since the total cost of the new rope is approximately $40, and Sarah received $40 from selling her old rope, we can find out how much money she has left over:
     \[
     \text{Money Left Over} = \text{Total Money from Sale} - \text{Total Cost of New Rope}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Money Left Over} = 40 \, \text{dollars} - 40 \, \text{dollars} = 0 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

Thus, after Sarah buys the new rope, she will have **$0 left over**.

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total selling price of the rope Sarah has.**
   - Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long.
   - Her friend wants to buy the rope for $2 per meter.
   - To find the total selling price, we multiply the length of the rope by the price per meter:
     \[
     \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Length of Rope} \times \text{Price per Meter}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Selling Price} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine how much new rope Sarah can buy with the profit.**
   - The cost of the new rope is $1.5 per meter.
   - To find out how many meters of new rope Sarah can buy, we divide the total selling price by the cost per meter:
     \[
     \text{Meters of New Rope} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Cost per Meter}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Meters of New Rope} = \frac{40 \, \text{dollars}}{1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter}} \approx 26.67 \, \text{meters}
     \]
   - Since Sarah cannot buy a fraction of a meter of rope, we consider only the whole meters she can buy. Thus, she can buy 26 meters of new rope.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the new rope Sarah buys.**
   - Now, we calculate the total cost for 26 meters of new rope:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost of New Rope} = \text{Meters of New Rope} \times \text{Cost per Meter}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Cost of New Rope} = 26 \, \text{meters} \times 1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 39 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine how much money Sarah has left over after buying the new rope.**
   - To find out how much money Sarah has left over, we subtract the total cost of the new rope from the total selling price:
     \[
     \text{Money Left Over} = \text{Total Selling Price} - \text{Total Cost of New Rope}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Money Left Over} = 40 \, \text{dollars} - 39 \, \text{dollars} = 1 \, \text{dollar}
     \]

Thus, after buying the new rope, Sarah will have **$1 left over**.

**Final Answer: $1**
