Question:
Emma can make and upload 72 vlogs per month. But she was only able to make 18 vlogs for the first week, 21 vlogs for the second week, and 15 vlogs for the third week. How many vlogs should she do to complete the 72 vlogs per month?


Reference Answer:
Emma was able to make 18 + 21 + 15 = <<18+21+15=54>>54 vlogs for 3 weeks.
Therefore, Emma needs to do 72 - 54 = <<72-54=18>>18 more vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs.
#### 18

Response:
To determine how many vlogs Emma needs to complete in order to reach her goal of 72 vlogs for the month, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of vlogs Emma has made so far.**
   - For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
   - For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
   - For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

   We will add these numbers together:

   \[
   \text{Total vlogs made} = 18 + 21 + 15
   \]

   Let's perform the addition step-by-step:

   - First, add the vlogs from the first two weeks:
     \[
     18 + 21 = 39
     \]

   - Now, add the vlogs from the third week:
     \[
     39 + 15 = 54
     \]

   So, Emma has made a total of 54 vlogs so far.

2. **Determine how many more vlogs Emma needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs.**
   - We know her monthly goal is 72 vlogs, and she has already made 54 vlogs. We will subtract the number of vlogs she has made from her goal:

   \[
   \text{Vlogs needed} = 72 - 54
   \]

   Now, let's perform the subtraction:

   \[
   72 - 54 = 18
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to reach her goal of 72 vlogs for the month.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{18}
\]
