Question ID: 1000

Question:
Doctor Jones is scheduling his time for Monday. He is spending nine hours at the clinic where he works that day. He has to do rounds to check on inpatients staying at the clinic, which takes twenty minutes per inpatient, and he has ten appointments, which take thirty minutes each. How many hours will Doctor Jones have left to update his records if he has 9 inpatients at the clinic?


Reference Answer:
Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients, so his rounds will take 9 * 20 = <<9*20=180>>180 minutes.
He has ten appointments, which will take 10 * 30 = <<10*30=300>>300 minutes.
The rounds and appointments will take 180 + 300 = <<180+300=480>>480 minutes total.
An hour is 60 minutes, so rounds and appointments will take 480 / 60 = <<480/60=8>>8 hours.
Doctor Jones will have 9 - 8 = <<9-8=1>>1 hour left to update his records.

Response:
To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records after completing his rounds and appointments, we need to calculate the total time he spends on both activities and then subtract that from his total available time at the clinic.

1. **Total Time at the Clinic**: 
   Doctor Jones spends a total of 9 hours at the clinic.

2. **Time Spent on Inpatient Rounds**:
   - He has 9 inpatients.
   - Each inpatient takes 20 minutes for rounds.
   - Total time for rounds = Number of inpatients × Time per inpatient
   \[
   \text{Total time for rounds} = 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Convert Minutes to Hours**:
   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 180 minutes to hours:
   \[
   \text{Total time for rounds in hours} = \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Time Spent on Appointments**:
   - He has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - Total time for appointments = Number of appointments × Time per appointment
   \[
   \text{Total time for appointments} = 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Convert Minutes to Hours**:
   We convert 300 minutes to hours:
   \[
   \text{Total time for appointments in hours} = \frac{300 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Total Time Spent**:
   Now we add the time spent on rounds and appointments:
   \[
   \text{Total time spent} = \text{Time for rounds} + \text{Time for appointments} = 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Time Left for Updating Records**:
   Finally, we subtract the total time spent from the total time at the clinic:
   \[
   \text{Time left} = \text{Total time at the clinic} - \text{Total time spent} = 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

Thus, Doctor Jones will have **1 hour** left to update his records.

**Final Answer**: 1 hour
