Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many people John lost to after arm wrestling 20 people and beating 80% of them.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of people John beat.**

John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles. To find out how many people that is, we can calculate:

\[
\text{Number of people John beat} = 80\% \text{ of } 20
\]

First, convert 80% to a decimal:

\[
80\% = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8
\]

Now, multiply this decimal by the total number of people:

\[
\text{Number of people John beat} = 0.8 \times 20 = 16
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of people John lost to.**

To find out how many people John lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:

\[
\text{Number of people John lost to} = \text{Total people} - \text{Number of people John beat}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Number of people John lost to} = 20 - 16 = 4
\]

**Final Answer:**

John lost to 4 people.
