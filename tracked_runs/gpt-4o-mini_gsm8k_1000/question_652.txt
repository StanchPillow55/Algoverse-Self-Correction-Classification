Question ID: 298

Question:
Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. She accepts the opening bid of $200 and continues bidding until she wins. The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time and 3 other people each bid once. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?


Reference Answer:
3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $<<200+300=500>>500.

Response:
To determine how much Carmen pays for the antique desk, we need to analyze the bidding process step by step.

1. **Opening Bid**: The auction starts with an opening bid of $200.

2. **Bidding Increments**: Each bid increases by $50.

3. **Number of Other Bidders**: There are 3 other people bidding before Carmen bids.

Let's denote the bids as follows:

- **Carmen's Bid**: \( C \)
- **Other Bidders' Bids**: \( O_1, O_2, O_3 \)

### Step-by-Step Bidding Process

1. **First Bid**:
   - Opening bid: $200
   - The first other bidder (let's call them Bidder 1) bids: 
     \[
     O_1 = 200 + 50 = 250
     \]

2. **Second Bid**:
   - Carmen bids after Bidder 1:
     \[
     C_1 = 250 + 50 = 300
     \]

3. **Third Bid**:
   - The second other bidder (Bidder 2) bids:
     \[
     O_2 = 300 + 50 = 350
     \]

4. **Fourth Bid**:
   - Carmen bids after Bidder 2:
     \[
     C_2 = 350 + 50 = 400
     \]

5. **Fifth Bid**:
   - The third other bidder (Bidder 3) bids:
     \[
     O_3 = 400 + 50 = 450
     \]

6. **Final Bid**:
   - Carmen bids after Bidder 3:
     \[
     C_3 = 450 + 50 = 500
     \]

### Conclusion

Carmen wins the auction with her final bid of $500. Therefore, the total amount of money she spends on the desk is:

\[
\text{Final Cost of the Desk} = 500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{500}
\]
