Question ID: 640

Question:
Bill is ordering a new truck. He has decided to purchase a two-ton truck with several added features: a king cab upgrade, a towing package, leather seats, running boards, and the upgraded exterior light package.  The base price of the truck is $30,000, and the other features are at extra cost. The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500.  What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?


Reference Answer:
The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, at a cost of $7,500/3=$<<7500/3=2500>>2500.
The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats at a cost of $2500-$500=$2000
The total cost of the truck is $30,000+$7500+$2500+$2000+$1500=$<<30000+7500+2500+2000+1500=43500>>43,500
#### 43,500

Response:
To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and then sum them up with the base price of the truck. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Base Price of the Truck**: 
   \[
   \text{Base Price} = 30,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of the King Cab Upgrade**: 
   \[
   \text{King Cab Upgrade} = 7,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Leather Seats**: 
   The leather seats cost one-third of the cost of the king cab upgrade. We calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Leather Seats} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{King Cab Upgrade} = \frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = 2,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Running Boards**: 
   The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats. We calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Running Boards} = \text{Leather Seats} - 500 = 2,500 - 500 = 2,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Cost of Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: 
   \[
   \text{Upgraded Exterior Light Package} = 1,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we can sum all these costs to find the total cost of the truck:

6. **Total Cost Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Base Price} + \text{King Cab Upgrade} + \text{Leather Seats} + \text{Running Boards} + \text{Upgraded Exterior Light Package}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500
   \]

7. **Performing the Addition**:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 30,000 + 7,500 = 37,500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 37,500 + 2,500 = 40,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 40,000 + 2,000 = 42,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 42,000 + 1,500 = 43,500
   \]

Thus, the total cost of Bill's new truck is:
\[
\boxed{43,500} \text{ dollars}
\]

To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we will calculate the cost of each feature and then sum them up with the base price of the truck.

1. **Base Price of the Truck**: 
   \[
   \text{Base Price} = 30,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of the King Cab Upgrade**: 
   \[
   \text{King Cab Upgrade} = 7,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Leather Seats**: 
   The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade.
   \[
   \text{Leather Seats} = \frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = 2,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Running Boards**: 
   The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats.
   \[
   \text{Running Boards} = 2,500 - 500 = 2,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Cost of Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: 
   \[
   \text{Upgraded Exterior Light Package} = 1,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we will sum all these costs to find the total cost of the truck:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Base Price} + \text{King Cab Upgrade} + \text{Leather Seats} + \text{Running Boards} + \text{Upgraded Exterior Light Package}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500
\]

Now, we perform the addition step-by-step:

1. \(30,000 + 7,500 = 37,500\)
2. \(37,500 + 2,500 = 40,000\)
3. \(40,000 + 2,000 = 42,000\)
4. \(42,000 + 1,500 = 43,500\)

Thus, the total cost of Bill's new truck is:

\[
\boxed{43,500} \text{ dollars}
\]
