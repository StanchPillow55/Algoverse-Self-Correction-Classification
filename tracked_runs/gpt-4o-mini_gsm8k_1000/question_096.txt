Question:
James gets 80 emails a day.  20% of those emails don't require any response.  He responds to the rest of them.  How many emails does he respond to in a 5 day work week?


Reference Answer:
He gets 80*.2=<<80*.2=16>>16 emails he doesn't need to respond to
So he responds to 80-16=<<80-16=64>>64 emails
So he responds to 64*5=<<64*5=320>>320 emails a week
#### 320

Response:
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, given that he receives 80 emails a day and 20% of those do not require a response.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that do not require a response.

James receives 80 emails each day. We need to find out how many of these emails do not require a response, which is 20% of 80.

To calculate 20% of 80, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Percentage Rate}}{100}\right) \times \text{Total}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Emails not requiring response} = \left(\frac{20}{100}\right) \times 80
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Emails not requiring response} = 0.20 \times 80 = 16
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of emails that require a response.

Now, we need to find out how many emails require a response. This is the total number of emails minus the number of emails that do not require a response.

\[
\text{Emails requiring response} = \text{Total Emails} - \text{Emails not requiring response}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Emails requiring response} = 80 - 16 = 64
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week.

Since James responds to 64 emails each day, we need to find out how many emails he responds to over 5 days.

\[
\text{Total responses in 5 days} = \text{Emails requiring response per day} \times \text{Number of days}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total responses in 5 days} = 64 \times 5
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Total responses in 5 days} = 320
\]

### Final Answer

James responds to a total of **320 emails** in a 5-day work week.
