Question ID: 363

Question:
John drives to his friend's house 200 miles away.  He drives at a speed of 70 mph.  He had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip.  After he gets there he takes a route home that is 240 miles but he goes 80 mph.  How long did the trip take?


Reference Answer:
The first leg was 200+10=<<200+10=210>>210 miles
So he drove 210/70=<<210/70=3>>3 hours
The second route took 240/80=<<240/80=3>>3 hours
So in total he drove 3+3=<<3+3=6>>6 hours

Response:
To find out how long John's trip took, we need to break it down into two parts: the trip to his friend's house and the trip back home.

### Part 1: Trip to Friend's House

1. **Distance to Friend's House**: The original distance is 200 miles, but due to a detour, he drives an additional 10 miles. Therefore, the total distance to his friend's house is:
   \[
   200 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 210 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Speed**: John drives at a speed of 70 mph.

3. **Time Calculation**: To find the time taken to drive to his friend's house, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   Substituting in the values:
   \[
   \text{Time to friend's house} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

### Part 2: Trip Back Home

1. **Distance Back Home**: The distance back home is given as 240 miles.

2. **Speed**: John drives back at a speed of 80 mph.

3. **Time Calculation**: Again, we use the same formula for time:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   Substituting in the values:
   \[
   \text{Time back home} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

### Total Trip Time

Now, we can find the total time for the entire trip by adding the time taken to get to his friend's house and the time taken to return home:
\[
\text{Total Trip Time} = \text{Time to friend's house} + \text{Time back home}
\]
Substituting in the calculated times:
\[
\text{Total Trip Time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

The total time for John's trip is:
\[
\boxed{6 \text{ hours}}
\]
