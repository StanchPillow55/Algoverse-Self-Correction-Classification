Question ID: 1287

Question:
In a family, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters. All sisters are the same age, which is 16. One of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. What is the total age of all these siblings?


Reference Answer:
Three sisters are in total 3 * 16 = <<3*16=48>>48 years old.
The younger brother is only half the age of the older one, which leads us to the older brother being 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 years old.
So all family members in total are 48 + 12 + 24 = <<48+12+24=84>>84 years old.

Response:
To find the total age of all the siblings in the family, we will first identify the ages of each sibling based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the ages of the sisters:**
   - There are 3 sisters, and each sister is 16 years old.
   - Therefore, the total age of the sisters can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total age of sisters} = 3 \text{ sisters} \times 16 \text{ years/sister} = 48 \text{ years}
     \]

2. **Identify the ages of the brothers:**
   - We know that one brother is 12 years old.
   - The problem states that this younger brother's age (12 years) is half the age of the older brother. We can denote the age of the older brother as \( x \).
   - According to the information given:
     \[
     12 = \frac{1}{2} x
     \]
   - To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     x = 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ years}
     \]
   - Thus, the older brother is 24 years old.

3. **Calculate the total age of the brothers:**
   - Now we can find the total age of both brothers:
     \[
     \text{Total age of brothers} = 12 \text{ years (younger brother)} + 24 \text{ years (older brother)} = 36 \text{ years}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total age of all siblings:**
   - Finally, we add the total age of the sisters and the total age of the brothers to find the total age of all siblings:
     \[
     \text{Total age of all siblings} = \text{Total age of sisters} + \text{Total age of brothers}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total age of all siblings} = 48 \text{ years} + 36 \text{ years} = 84 \text{ years}
     \]

Thus, the total age of all the siblings is \( \boxed{84} \) years.
