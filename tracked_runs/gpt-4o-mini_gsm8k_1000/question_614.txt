Question:
The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. If the chair is 3 feet wide. How many feet long is the couch?


Reference Answer:
Chair = <<3=3>>3 feet
Rug = 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 feet
Couch = 2 * 8 + 2 = <<2*8+2=18>>18 feet
The couch is <<18=18>>18 feet long.
#### 18

Response:
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, using the information given to find the length of the couch.

1. **Identify the width of the chair**: 
   The problem states that the chair is 3 feet wide. 
   \[
   \text{Width of the chair} = 3 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine the width of the rug**: 
   The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Therefore, we can calculate the width of the rug as follows:
   \[
   \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 \text{ feet}
   \]
   Substituting the width of the chair:
   \[
   \text{Width of the rug} = 3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the length of the couch**: 
   The couch is described as being 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. We first need to calculate twice the width of the rug:
   \[
   2 \times \text{Width of the rug} = 2 \times 8 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]
   Now, we add 2 feet to this value to find the length of the couch:
   \[
   \text{Length of the couch} = 16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   The length of the couch is:
   \[
   \boxed{18 \text{ feet}}
   \] 

This concludes the problem, and we have determined that the couch is 18 feet long.
