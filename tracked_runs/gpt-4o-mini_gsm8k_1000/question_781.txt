Question ID: 151

Question:
Shawnda decides that her neighborhood kids could really use a bike inflation service. She decides the best way to charge is by the tire. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. On the first day, 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated. 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. Finally, one person actually came by on a unicycle. How many dollars did she make that day?


Reference Answer:
There were 10 bike tires to fill up because 2 times 5 equals <<2*5=10>>10.
There were 9 tricycle tires to fill up because 3 times 3 equals <<3*3=9>>9.
There was one unicycle tire to fill up because 1 times 1 equals 1.
There were 20 total tires to fill up because 10 plus 9 plus 1 equals <<10+9+1=20>>20.
She made $5 because 20 times .25 equals <<20*.25=5>>5.

Response:
To determine how much money Shawnda made on her first day of providing the bike inflation service, we need to calculate the total number of tires she inflated and then convert that total into dollars.

1. **Calculate the number of tires inflated for bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - Shawnda had 5 people come by with bicycles.
   - Therefore, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is:
     \[
     5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires/bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of tires inflated for tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - Shawnda had 3 people come by with tricycles.
   - Therefore, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is:
     \[
     3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires/tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of tires inflated for the unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - Shawnda had 1 person come by with a unicycle.
   - Therefore, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is:
     \[
     1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire/unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of tires inflated:**
   - Now, we add up all the tires inflated:
     \[
     10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for inflating the tires:**
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Therefore, the total cost for inflating 20 tires is:
     \[
     20 \text{ tires} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/tire} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Shawnda made a total of **5 dollars** on her first day of providing the bike inflation service.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
