Question ID: 1158

Question:
The Hortex company produces bottled carrot juices. Every day it can produce 4200 bottles of these juices. Each juice can cover 20% of 1 person'ts daily energy demand. How many more bottles of juices would Hortex have to produce to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people?


Reference Answer:
Each juice covers only 20% of the daily energy demand, so to cover 100%, one person would need 100 / 20 = <<100/20=5>>5 juices.
So 2300 people, need 5 * 2300 = <<2300*5=11500>>11500 juices for this purpose.
To cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need to produce 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles of juices.
#### 7300

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy demand covered by the current production of 4200 bottles.
2. Calculate the total daily energy demand of 2300 people.
3. Calculate the difference between the total daily energy demand and the current production coverage.
4. Calculate the number of additional bottles needed to cover the remaining energy demand.

Step 1: Calculate the daily energy demand covered by the current production of 4200 bottles.
* Each bottle of juice can cover 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand.
* 4200 bottles can cover 20% of 4200 people's daily energy demand.
* 4200 bottles can cover 20% × 4200 = 840 people's daily energy demand.

Step 2: Calculate the total daily energy demand of 2300 people.
* The total daily energy demand of 2300 people is 100% of 2300 people's daily energy demand.
* Total daily energy demand = 100% × 2300 = 2300 people's daily energy demand.

Step 3: Calculate the difference

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy demand of 2300 people.
2. Calculate the daily energy demand that can be satisfied by the current production of 4200 bottles.
3. Calculate the additional energy demand that needs to be satisfied.
4. Calculate the number of additional bottles needed to satisfy the additional energy demand.

Step 1: Calculate the daily energy demand of 2300 people.
Since each bottle of juice can cover 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total daily energy demand as follows:
* Total daily energy demand = 2300 people × (1 / 0.20) = 11,500 person-units of energy demand

Step 2: Calculate the daily energy demand that can be satisfied by the current production of 4200 bottles.
* Energy demand satisfied by 4200 bottles = 4200 bottles × 0.20 = 840 person-units of energy demand

Step 3: Calculate the additional energy demand that needs to be satisfied.
* Additional energy demand = 11,500 person-units - 840

Step 2: Calculate the daily energy demand that can be satisfied by the current production of 4200 bottles.
* Energy demand satisfied by 4200 bottles = 4200 bottles × 0.20 = 840 person-units of energy demand

Step 3: Calculate the additional energy demand that needs to be satisfied.
* Additional energy demand = 11,500 person-units - 840
