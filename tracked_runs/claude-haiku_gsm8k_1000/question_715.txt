Question ID: 964

Question:
John just started watching a new show.  Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode.  How many minutes will John spend watching the show if he watches every episode?


Reference Answer:
Since there are half as many episodes as the number of minutes per episode, we perform 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 episodes in total.
Since each episode is 20 minutes long, to find the total run time we perform 10*20= <<10*20=200>>200 minutes of run time in total.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Each episode is 20 minutes long.
- There are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode.

Step 1: Find the number of episodes in the show.
Let's say the number of episodes is x.
According to the given information, the number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode.
Therefore, x = 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show.
Total minutes = Number of episodes × Minutes per episode
Total minutes = 10 episodes × 20 minutes per episode
Total minutes = 200 minutes

Therefore, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

Final answer: John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.
