Question ID: 317

Question:
John fills a 6 foot by 4 foot pool that is 5 feet deep.  It cost $.1 per cubic foot to fill.  How much does it cost to fill?


Reference Answer:
The pool has a base of 6*4=<<6*4=24>>24 square feet
So its volume was 24*5=<<24*5=120>>120 cubic feet
So it cost 120*.1=$<<120*.1=12>>12 to fill the pool
#### 12

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the volume of the pool and then calculate the cost of filling it.

Given information:
- The pool dimensions are 6 feet by 4 feet by 5 feet deep.
- The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per cubic foot.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
Volume of the pool = Length × Width × Depth
Volume of the pool = 6 feet × 4 feet × 5 feet
Volume of the pool = 120 cubic feet

Step 2: Calculate the cost of filling the pool.
Cost of filling the pool = Volume of the pool × Cost per cubic foot
Cost of filling the pool = 120 cubic feet × $0.10 per cubic foot
Cost of filling the pool = $12.00

Therefore, the cost to fill the 6 foot by 4 foot pool that is 5 feet deep is $12.00.

Final answer: $12.00
