Question ID: 1133

Question:
Grandma walks 3 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 2 miles of walking on the beach and 1 mile of walking on the sidewalk.  On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach.  If 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, in minutes?


Reference Answer:
On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.
To walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Grandma 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to walk her favorite route.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

Given information:
- Grandma walks 3 miles every day on her favorite walking trail.
- The trail includes 2 miles of walking on the beach and 1 mile of walking on the sidewalk.
- Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.
- Grandma spends 40 minutes of her walk on the beach.

Step 1: Find the time it takes for Grandma to walk the 2 miles on the beach.
Time spent on the beach = 40 minutes

Step 2: Find the time it takes for Grandma to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk.
Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, the time it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk will be half the time it takes her to walk the 2 miles on the beach.
Time spent on the sidewalk = 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Grandma walks 3 miles every day on her favorite walking trail.
- The trail includes 2 miles of walking on the beach and 1 mile of walking on the sidewalk.
- Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.
- Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes Grandma to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk.
Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, we can use the following equation:
Time on sidewalk = Time on beach / 2
Time on sidewalk = 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total time it takes Grandma to complete the 3-mile walk.
Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

Therefore, it takes Grandma 60 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Grandma walks 3 miles every day on her favorite walking trail.
- The trail includes 2 miles of walking on the beach and 1 mile of walking on the sidewalk.
- Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.
- Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes Grandma to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk.
Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, we can use the following equation:
Time on sidewalk = Time on beach / 2
Time on sidewalk = 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total time it takes Grandma to complete the 3-mile walk.
Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

Therefore, it takes Grandma 60 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile
