Question:
The power goes out in Brianna's house one night so she and her family gather all their candles and flashlights. There are 8 rooms in the house and 4 people living there, including Brianna. There is a flashlight for every person to carry and two for each room. They have a variety of candles available; 4 small candles each for half the rooms and 5 medium candles each for the other half of the rooms. With everything combined, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?


Reference Answer:
For every one of the 8 rooms in the house, there are 2 flashlights, 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 flashlights.
For every person there is 1 flashlight, 1 x 4 people = <<1*4=4>>4 flashlights.
Total, there are 16 + 4 = <<16+4=20>>20 flashlights in the house being used by Brianna and her family.
For half of the 8 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, 8/2 x 4 = <<8/2*4=16>>16 small candles in half the rooms.
For the other half of the 8 rooms, there are 5 medium candles each, 8/2 x 5 = <<8/2*5=20>>20 medium candles in all the rooms.
Total, there are 16 + 20 = <<16+20=36>>36 candles in the house.
Combined, there are 20 flashlights + 36 candles = <<20+36=56>>56 flashlights and candles in the house.
