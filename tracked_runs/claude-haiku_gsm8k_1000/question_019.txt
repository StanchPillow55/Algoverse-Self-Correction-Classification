Question ID: 1172

Question:
Alice likes to count the puffs of clouds in the sky while she eats her lunch outside at school. On Monday she counts just 3 puffs of clouds. Each day after that through Friday, though, she sees double the number of clouds in the sky as the day before. At the end of the week, how many clouds will she have counted in the sky at lunch across all five days?


Reference Answer:
On Monday Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds in the sky, and double that on Tuesday, 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 puffs of clouds.
On Wednesday she sees twice that amount, 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 puffs of clouds.
On Thursday she sees twice that amount, 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 puffs of clouds.
On Friday she sees twice the amount of the day before, 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 puffs of clouds.
In total, across all five days, she sees 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = <<3+6+12+24+48=93>>93 total cloud puffs.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On Monday, Alice counted 3 puffs of clouds.
- Each day after Monday, she saw double the number of clouds as the day before.
- We need to find the total number of clouds she counted across all 5 days (Monday through Friday).

Step 1: Calculate the number of clouds Alice counted each day.
Monday: 3 clouds
Tuesday: 3 x 2 = 6 clouds
Wednesday: 6 x 2 = 12 clouds 
Thursday: 12 x 2 = 24 clouds
Friday: 24 x 2 = 48 clouds

Step 2: Calculate the total number of clouds counted across all 5 days.
Total clouds = Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday + Friday
Total clouds = 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days (Monday through Friday) is 93 clouds.
