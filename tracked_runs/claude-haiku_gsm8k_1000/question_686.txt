Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Raphael bought 4 pens, each costing $1.5
- Raphael bought 2 notebooks, each costing $4
- Raphael bought a rim of bond paper, costing $20

To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the pens.
Cost of 4 pens = 4 × $1.5 = $6

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the notebooks.
Cost of 2 notebooks = 2 × $4 = $8

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the rim of bond paper.
Cost of 1 rim of bond paper = $20

Step 4: Calculate the total amount spent by adding the costs of all the items.
Total amount spent = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of bond paper
Total amount spent = $6 + $8 + $20 = $34

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $34 on
