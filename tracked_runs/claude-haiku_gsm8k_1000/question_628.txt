Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the fastest car based on the given information.

Given information:
- The fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
- The 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car.
- The average car can go 120 miles per hour.

Step 1: Find the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 × Speed of the average car
Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 × 120 miles per hour = 600 miles per hour

Step 2: Find the speed of the fastest car.
Speed of the fastest car = 1.25 × Speed of the 2nd fastest car
Speed of the fastest car = 1.25 × 600 miles per hour = 750 miles per hour

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour.
