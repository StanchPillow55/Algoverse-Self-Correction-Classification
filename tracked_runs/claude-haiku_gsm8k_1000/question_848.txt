Question:
Jayden had $70 from selling pictures he took as a hobby.  His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance to help him buy a new camera that costs $200. How much more does Jayden need to buy the camera?


Reference Answer:
Ava gave $90/2 = $<<90/2=45>>45 to Jayden.
Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $<<70+45=115>>115
So, Jayden needs $200 - $115 = $<<200-115=85>>85 to buy the new camera
#### 85

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jayden had $70 from selling pictures
- Ava gave Jayden half of her $90 allowance
- The new camera costs $200

Step 1: Calculate how much money Ava gave Jayden.
Ava's allowance = $90
Jayden received half of Ava's allowance = $90 / 2 = $45

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Jayden has.
Jayden's initial money = $70
Money received from Ava = $45
Total money Jayden has = $70 + $45 = $115

Step 3: Calculate how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera.
Cost of the camera = $200
Total money Jayden has = $115
Amount Jayden still needs = $200 - $115 = $85

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the new camera.

Final answer: Jayden needs $85 more to buy the new camera.
