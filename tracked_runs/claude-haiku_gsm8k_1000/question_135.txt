Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 4 roses in the vase.
- There are 7 more dahlias than roses in the vase.

Step 1: Find the number of dahlias in the vase.
Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7 = 11

Step 2: Find the total number of flowers in the vase.
Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11 = 15

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.

Final answer: There are 15 flowers in the vase in total.
