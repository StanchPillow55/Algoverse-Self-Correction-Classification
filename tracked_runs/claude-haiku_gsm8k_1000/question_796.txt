Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Amy made 20 more friends than Lily.
- Lily made 50 friends.

Step 1: Find the number of friends Amy made.
Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, we can add 20 to the number of friends Lily made to find the number of friends Amy made.
Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20 = 70 friends

Step 2: Find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together.
Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70 = 120 friends

Therefore, Lily and Amy have a total of 120 friends together.

Final answer: Lily and Amy have a total of 120 friends together.
