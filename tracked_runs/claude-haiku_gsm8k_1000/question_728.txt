Question:
Colby loves going to the movies and every month his parents give him $150 to spend at the movies. Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10. Tickets for any other day cost $7. Popcorn costs $8 and boxes of candy cost $2. It is the last day of the month and it's a Friday. He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. How many movies can he see if he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month?


Reference Answer:
He has spent $50 on Fri/Sat movies because 5 x 10 = <<50=50>>50
He has spent $56 on movies the rest of the day because 8 x 7 = <<8*7=56>>56
He has spent $16 on popcorn because 2 x 8 = <<16=16>>16
He has spent $8 on candy because 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8
He has spent 130 in total because 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = <<50+56+16+8=130>>130
He plans to spend $10 on popcorn and candy because 8 + 2 = <<8+2=10>>10
He has $10 left to spend because 150 - 130 - 10 = <<150-130-10=10>>10
He can see 1 movie because 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Colby has spent on movies, popcorn, and candy, and then determine how many more movies he can see with the remaining budget.

Given information:
- Colby's monthly movie budget is $150.
- Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10.
- Tickets for any other day cost $7.
- Popcorn costs $8 per tub.
- Boxes of candy cost $2 each.
- Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and 4 boxes of candy.
- It's the last day of the month, and it's a Friday.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the movies Colby has already seen.
Cost of movies on Fridays and Saturdays = 5 × $10 = $50
Cost of movies on other days = 8 × $7 = $56
Total cost of movies already seen = $50 + $56 = $106
