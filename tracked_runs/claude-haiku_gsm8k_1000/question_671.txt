Question ID: 1236

Question:
Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother wanted to make grape juice and used up 5 times as many grapes then Madeline to make a full glass. Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. How many grapes were there at the beginning if the pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie?


Reference Answer:
Madeline's brother used 6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 grapes
Their mother used 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 grapes
There were 30 + 48 + 6 = <<30+48+6=84>>84 grapes at the beginning
#### 84

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Madeline ate 6 grapes.
- Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of grape juice.
- Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies.
- The pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie.

Step 1: Calculate the number of grapes used by Madeline's brother to make the grape juice.
Madeline's brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline.
Grapes used by Madeline's brother = 5 × 6 = 30 grapes

Step 2: Calculate the number of grapes remaining after Madeline and her brother used their grapes.
Total grapes at the beginning - Grapes used by Madeline - Grapes used by Madeline's brother = Remaining grapes
Remaining grapes = Unknown - 6 - 30 = Unknown - 36

Step 3: Calculate the number of grapes used by their mother to make the 4 pies

Step 1: Calculate the number of grapes used by Madeline's brother to make the grape juice.
Grapes used by brother = 5 × 6 = 30 grapes

Step 2: Calculate the number of grapes remaining after Madeline and her brother used some.
Grapes remaining = Total grapes - Grapes used by Madeline - Grapes used by brother
Grapes remaining = Total grapes - 6 - 30 = Total grapes - 36

Step 3: Calculate the number of grapes used by their mother to make the 4 pies.
Grapes used for pies = 4 pies × 12 grapes per pie = 48 grapes
