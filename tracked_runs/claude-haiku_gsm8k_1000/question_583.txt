Question:
Jane has saved $4 of her allowance every week for the past 8 weeks. If she continues to save the same amount each week, how many more weeks will it take for her to have saved a total of $60?


Reference Answer:
She has already saved 8 * $4 = $<<8*4=32>>32.
She needs to save an additional $60 - $32 = $<<60-32=28>>28.
It will take her 28 / 4 = <<28/4=7>>7 more weeks to save the rest of the money.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jane saves $4 of her allowance every week.
- She has been saving for the past 8 weeks.
- She wants to save a total of $60.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far.
Amount saved per week = $4
Number of weeks = 8
Total amount saved = $4 × 8 = $32

Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount Jane needs to save to reach her goal of $60.
Remaining amount to save = $60 - $32 = $28

Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks it will take Jane to save the remaining $28.
Amount saved per week = $4
Remaining amount to save = $28
Number of weeks = Remaining amount to save / Amount saved per week
Number of weeks = $28 / $4 = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

Final answer: It will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.
