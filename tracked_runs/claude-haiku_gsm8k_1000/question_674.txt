Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of votes the winner got and then subtract it from the total number of votes to find the number of votes the loser got.

Given information:
- The winner got 3/4 of the votes.
- The total number of students who voted in the class was 80.

Step 1: Find the number of votes the winner got.
Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got as follows:
Number of votes the winner got = 3/4 × 80 = 60 votes

Step 2: Find the number of votes the loser got.
The total number of votes is 80, and the winner got 60 votes. Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is the difference between the total votes and the winner's votes.
Number of votes the loser got = Total votes - Winner's votes
Number of votes the loser got = 80 - 60 = 20 votes

Therefore, the loser got 20 votes.

Final answer: The loser got 20 votes.
