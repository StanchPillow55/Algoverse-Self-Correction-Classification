Question ID: 1013

Question:
Janet gets a job as a waitress.  She makes $10 an hour from wages and another $15 an hour from tips.  She wants to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment.  If she works 40 hours a week how many weeks will she need to work to save the down payment?


Reference Answer:
She makes 10+15=$<<10+15=25>>25 an hour from working
That means each week she makes 25*40=$<<25*40=1000>>1000
She wants to make 10000*.2=$<<10000*.2=2000>>2000
So she needs to work 2000/1000=<<2000/1000=2>>2 weeks

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment and then calculate the number of weeks she needs to work to save that amount.

Given information:
- Janet makes $10 per hour from wages.
- Janet makes $15 per hour from tips.
- Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car for a down payment.
- Janet works 40 hours per week.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment.
Down payment = 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 × $10,000 = $2,000

Step 2: Calculate Janet's total hourly rate.
Total hourly rate = Wages per hour + Tips per hour = $10 + $15 = $25 per hour

Step 3: Calculate Janet's weekly earnings.
Weekly earnings = Total hourly rate × Hours worked per week = $25 × 40 = $1,000 per week

Step 4: Calculate the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment.
Number of weeks = Down payment

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Janet makes $10 per hour from wages
- Janet makes $15 per hour from tips
- Janet wants to save 20% of a $10,000 car for a down payment
- Janet works 40 hours per week

Step 1: Calculate Janet's total hourly rate.
Hourly wage + Hourly tips = Total hourly rate
$10 + $15 = $25 per hour

Step 2: Calculate the down payment amount Janet needs to save.
20% of $10,000 = 0.20 × $10,000 = $2,000

Step 3: Calculate Janet's weekly earnings.
Total hourly rate × Hours worked per week = Weekly earnings
$25 × 40 hours = $1,000 per week

Step 4: Calculate how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment.
Down payment amount / Weekly earnings = Number of weeks
$2,000 / $1,000 per week = 2 weeks

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks
