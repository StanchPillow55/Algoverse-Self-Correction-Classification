Question:
Carlos and Benji are at the beach. Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour. If Carlos uses the boat for 3 hours and Benji uses the raft for 5 hours, how much will they pay for their rentals, altogether?


Reference Answer:
Carlos would have to pay $30 x 3 = $<<30*3=90>>90
Benji would have to pay $18 x 5 = $<<18*5=90>>90
All together, Carlos and Benji will have to pay $90 + $90 = $<<90+90=180>>180
#### 180

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 per hour
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 per hour
- Carlos uses the boat for 3 hours
- Benji uses the raft for 5 hours

Step 1: Calculate the cost for Carlos' canoe rental.
Cost of Carlos' canoe rental = $30 per hour × 3 hours = $90

Step 2: Calculate the cost for Benji's banana boat raft rental.
Cost of Benji's banana boat raft rental = $18 per hour × 5 hours = $90

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for both rentals.
Total cost = Cost of Carlos' canoe rental + Cost of Benji's banana boat raft rental
Total cost = $90 + $90 = $180

Therefore, the total amount Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals is $180.
