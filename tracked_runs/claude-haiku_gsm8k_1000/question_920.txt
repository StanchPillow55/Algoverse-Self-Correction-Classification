Question ID: 318

Question:
If a classroom has 3 times as many girls as they do boys, and 1/10 as many nongendered children as they do boys, and the classroom has 30 boys.  How many total children does it have?


Reference Answer:
The classroom has 3 * 30 boys = <<3*30=90>>90 girls.
The classroom has 1/10 nongendered children so 10/100 * 30 boys = <<10/100*30=3>>3 nongendered children.
In total the classroom has 90 + 30 + 3 = <<90+30+3=123>>123 students.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys.
- The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys.
- The classroom has 30 boys.

Step 1: Find the number of girls in the classroom.
Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:
Number of girls = 3 × Number of boys
Number of girls = 3 × 30 = 90 girls

Step 2: Find the number of nongendered children in the classroom.
The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so we can calculate the number of nongendered children as follows:
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 × Number of boys
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 × 30 = 3 nongendered children

Step 3: Find the total number of children in the classroom.
Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
