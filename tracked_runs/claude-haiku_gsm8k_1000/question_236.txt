Question:
Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months at an interest rate of 10%. She has to pay an equal amount every month. How much does she have to pay per month?


Reference Answer:
Karan's interest is $3,650 × 0.1 = $<<3650*0.1=365>>365.
In total Karan has to pay $3650 + $365 = $<<3650+365=4015>>4015.
Every month she has to pay $4015 / 5 = $<<4015/5=803>>803.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the monthly payment Karan has to make to repay the loan, including the interest.

Given information:
- Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months.
- The interest rate is 10% per annum (per year).

Step 1: Calculate the total interest Karan has to pay.
Total interest = Principal × Interest rate × Time (in years)
Total interest = $3,650 × 0.10 × (5/12) = $152.08

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Karan has to repay.
Total amount to be repaid = Principal + Total interest
Total amount to be repaid = $3,650 + $152.08 = $3,802.08

Step 3: Calculate the monthly payment.
Monthly payment = Total amount to be repaid / Number of months
Monthly payment = $3,802.08 / 5 = $760.42

Therefore, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month to repay the loan.

Final answer: Karan has to pay $760.42 per

Response:
Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months.
- The interest rate is 10% per annum (per year).

To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total amount Karan has to pay, including the principal and the interest, and then divide it by the number of months.

Step 1: Calculate the total interest Karan has to pay.
Interest rate per annum = 10%
Interest rate per month = 10% / 12 = 0.833%
Total interest = Principal × Interest rate per month × Number of months
Total interest = $3,650 × 0.00833 × 5 = $152.03

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Karan has to pay.
Total amount = Principal + Total interest
Total amount = $3,650 + $152.03 = $3,802.03

Step 3: Calculate the monthly payment.
Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months
Monthly payment = $3,802.03 / 5 = $760.
