Question:
Colby works for a manufacturing company in the packaging division.  He gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. If he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, how much money, in dollars, does he earn in a typical eight-hour workday?


Reference Answer:
Ten less than fifty is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 packages per hour.
At $0.20 per completed package. if he completes 40 packages per hour he earns 40*$0.20=$<<40*0.20=8>>8 per hour.
Thus, in a typical eight-hour day, he earns 8*$8=$<<8*8=64>>64.
#### 64

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes.
- He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour.
- He works an eight-hour workday.

Step 1: Calculate the number of packages Colby completes per hour.
Number of packages per hour = 50 - 10 = 40 packages

Step 2: Calculate the total number of packages Colby completes in an eight-hour workday.
Total packages completed in a workday = Packages per hour × Number of hours worked
Total packages completed in a workday = 40 packages × 8 hours = 320 packages

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday.
Total money earned = Total packages completed × Pay per package
Total money earned = 320 packages × $0.20 per package = $64.00

Therefore, Colby earns $64.00 in a typical eight-hour workday.
