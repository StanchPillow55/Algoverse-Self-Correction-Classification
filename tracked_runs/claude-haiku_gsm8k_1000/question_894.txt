Question ID: 326

Question:
Some people got on a bus at the terminal. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. Then at the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. If there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop, how many people got on the bus at the terminal?


Reference Answer:
There were 20 - 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 people on the bus before 8 people got in at the second stop.
There were a total of 12 + 7 =<<12+7=19>>19 people at the second stop before 7 people went down.
So, 19 - 5 = <<19-5=14>>14 people got on the bus at the terminal.
#### 14

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.

Given information:
- At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in.
- At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in.
- There were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop.

Let's call the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as "x".

Step 1: Find the number of people on the bus after the first bus stop.
Number of people on the bus after the first bus stop = x + 5

Step 2: Find the number of people on the bus after the second bus stop.
Number of people on the bus after the second bus stop = (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6

Step 3: Set up an equation to find the value of "x".
Total number of people heading to the third stop = x + 6
20 = x + 6
x = 14

Therefore, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

Final answer: 14 people
