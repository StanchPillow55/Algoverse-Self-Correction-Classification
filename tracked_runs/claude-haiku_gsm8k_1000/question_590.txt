Question:
Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes for an online task she does. If she works between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. and pauses in between for half an hour, how much money does she earn for the online task?


Reference Answer:
Because she rests for half an hour, the time she works is 11 - 8 - 0.5 = <<11-8-0.5=2.5>>2.5 hours.
So she works 2.5 * 60 = <<2.5*60=150>>150 minutes
She earns $5 per 10 minutes, so for the online task she earns in total 150 * 5/10=$<<150*5/10=75>>75.
#### 75

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes for an online task.
- She works between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m.
- She pauses for half an hour in between.

Step 1: Calculate the total time Susan works.
Total time = 11 a.m. - 8 a.m. = 3 hours
Pause time = 0.5 hours
Net working time = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours = 150 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the number of 10-minute intervals Susan works.
Number of 10-minute intervals = 150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Susan earns.
Money earned per interval = $5
Total money earned = 15 intervals Ã— $5 per interval = $75

Therefore, the amount of money Susan earns for the online task is $75.
