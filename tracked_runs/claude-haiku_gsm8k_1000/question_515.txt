Question ID: 653

Question:
Sally has realized she did not receive a full wage this week. Her bank account, which held $200 at the start of the week, now holds $420. She has received no other money into her bank account this week. If her weekly wage should be $300, how many dollars were withheld from Sally’s wage?


Reference Answer:
The wage she received was $420 – $200 = $<<420-200=220>>220
This means her wage was $300 – $220 = $<<300-220=80>>80 short
#### 80

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between Sally's expected weekly wage and the actual amount that was deposited into her bank account.

Given information:
- Sally's bank account held $200 at the start of the week.
- Sally's bank account now holds $420.
- Sally's weekly wage should be $300.
- Sally has received no other money into her bank account this week.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount that was deposited into Sally's bank account this week.
Total amount deposited = Ending balance - Starting balance
Total amount deposited = $420 - $200 = $220

Step 2: Calculate the difference between Sally's expected weekly wage and the actual amount deposited.
Amount withheld from Sally's wage = Expected weekly wage - Total amount deposited
Amount withheld from Sally's wage = $300 - $220 = $80

Therefore, $80 were withheld from Sally's wage this week.

Final answer: $80 were withheld from Sally's wage.
