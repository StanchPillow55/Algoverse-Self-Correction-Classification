Question ID: 378

Question:
Lindsay is doing the laundry, and thinks she has missed some socks. There are 50 socks that need washing. If she washes 10 pairs of socks and 15 loose socks, how many socks has Lindsay missed?


Reference Answer:
Splitting the pairs shows there were 10 pairs of socks * 2 socks/pair = <<10*2=20>>20 socks paired together.
This means she has washed a total of 20 paired socks + 15 loose socks = <<20+15=35>>35 socks.
She has therefore missed 50 socks – 35 socks = <<50-35=15>>15 socks.
#### 15

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 50 socks that need washing.
- Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks and 15 loose socks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of socks washed.
Number of socks in 10 pairs = 10 × 2 = 20 socks
Number of loose socks = 15 socks
Total number of socks washed = 20 + 15 = 35 socks

Step 2: Calculate the number of socks missed.
Total socks that need washing = 50 socks
Total socks washed = 35 socks
Number of socks missed = Total socks that need washing - Total socks washed
Number of socks missed = 50 - 35 = 15 socks

Therefore, Lindsay has missed 15 socks.
