Question ID: 725

Question:
A cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes. A dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes. Calculate the average time the two take the eat the sausages.


Reference Answer:
If the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages, the dog takes 2/3*30 = <<30*2/3=20>>20 minutes.
The total amount of time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages is 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 minutes.
The average time in minutes that the two take to eat the sausages is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for the dog to eat the same number of sausages as the cat, and then calculate the average time for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages.

Given information:
- The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes.
- The dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes.

Step 1: Find the time it takes for the dog to eat the same number of sausages as the cat.
Time taken by the cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by the dog = 2/3 × 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the average time for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages.
Average time = (Time taken by the cat + Time taken by the dog) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2 = 25 minutes

Therefore, the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- A cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes.
- A dog can eat the same number of sausages (9) in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes for the dog to eat the 9 sausages.
Time taken by the cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by the dog = 2/3 × 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat the 9 sausages.
Average time = (Time taken by the cat + Time taken by the dog) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2 = 25 minutes

Therefore, the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the 9 sausages is 25 minutes.
