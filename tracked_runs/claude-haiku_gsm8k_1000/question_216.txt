Question:
It takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig a small hole for shrubs and 10 minutes to dig a large hole for trees.  How many hours will it take him to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes?


Reference Answer:
It takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole and he needs to dig 30 small holes so it will take 3*30 = <<3*30=90>>90 minutes
It takes 10 minutes to dig a large hole and he needs to dig 15 large holes so it will take him 15*10 = <<10*15=150>>150 minutes
It will take 90 minutes to dig the small holes and 150 minutes to dig the large holes for a total of 90+150 = <<90+150=240>>240 minutes
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour and he needs to dig for 240 minutes so that's 240/60 = <<240/60=4>>4 hours

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total time it takes Matthew to dig all the small holes and all the large holes, and then convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Given information:
- It takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig a small hole for shrubs.
- It takes Matthew 10 minutes to dig a large hole for trees.
- Matthew needs to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

Step 1: Calculate the total time to dig all the small holes.
Time to dig 1 small hole = 3 minutes
Time to dig 30 small holes = 30 × 3 minutes = 90 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total time to dig all the large holes.
Time to dig 1 large hole = 10 minutes
Time to dig 15 large holes = 15 × 10 minutes = 150 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time to dig all the holes.
Total time = Time to dig all small holes + Time to dig all large holes
Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes
