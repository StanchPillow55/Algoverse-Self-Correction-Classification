Question ID: 636

Question:
Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as her less-experienced colleague Jewel. Daily, Jewel processes 50 customers. What is the total weekly production for the two if they work all days of the week?


Reference Answer:
While Jewel is processing 50 orders in a day, Julie processes 50 orders/day * 2 = <<50*2=100>>100 orders/day.
In a day, they process 100 orders/day + 50 orders/day = <<100+50=150>>150 orders together.
The total number of orders the two processes in a week is 150 orders/day * 7 days/week = <<150*7=1050>>1050 orders
#### 1050

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel.

Given information:
- Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel.
- Jewel processes 50 customers daily.
- They work all days of the week.

Step 1: Find the number of customers Julie processes daily.
Since Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, she can process twice the number of customers that Jewel can.
Julie's daily production = 2 × Jewel's daily production
Julie's daily production = 2 × 50 = 100 customers

Step 2: Find the total weekly production for Jewel.
Jewel's weekly production = Jewel's daily production × Number of days in a week
Jewel's weekly production = 50 customers × 7 days = 350 customers

Step 3: Find the total weekly production for Julie.
Julie's weekly production = Julie's daily production × Number of days in a week
Julie's weekly production = 100 customers × 7 days = 700 customers

Step 4: Find the total

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as her less-experienced colleague Jewel.
- Jewel processes 50 customers daily.

To find the total weekly production for the two, we need to calculate the number of customers processed by each person per day, and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

Step 1: Calculate the number of customers processed by Jewel per day.
Jewel processes 50 customers daily.

Step 2: Calculate the number of customers processed by Julie per day.
Since Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, she can process 2 times the number of customers that Jewel can.
Julie's daily customers = 2 × Jewel's daily customers = 2 × 50 = 100 customers

Step 3: Calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel per day.
Total daily customers = Jewel's daily customers + Julie's daily customers
Total daily customers = 50 + 100 = 150 customers
