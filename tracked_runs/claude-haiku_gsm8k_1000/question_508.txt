Question:
For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. Today is December 31st. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?


Reference Answer:
January, March, and May have 31 days, February has 28, and April and June have 30, and Andy's birthday is on the 19th day of July. So there are 3 * 31 days + 28 + 2 * 30 days + 19 days = 93 days + 28 + 60 days + 19 days = <<3*31+28+2*30+19=200>>200 days until Andy's birthday.
He wants to lose 30 lbs. At 3500 calories per pound, this is 30 * 3500 = <<30*3500=105000>>105,000 calories total,
To reach his goal, he will have to burn 105,000 calories / 200 days = <<105000/200=525>>525 calories per day more than he consumes.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the daily calorie deficit required for Andy to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday.

Given information:
- Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th.
- Today is December 31st.
- Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound.

Step 1: Calculate the number of days between December 31st and July 19th.
Number of days = July 19th - December 31st = 200 days

Step 2: Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
Total calories to burn = 30 lbs. × 3500 calories/lb. = 105,000 calories

Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit required to reach the goal.
Daily calorie deficit = Total calories to burn / Number of days
Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories

Therefore, Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday on July

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday on July 19th.
- Today is December 31st.
- Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound.

Step 1: Calculate the number of days between December 31st and July 19th.
Number of days = July 19th - December 31st = 200 days

Step 2: Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
Calories needed to lose 1 lb. = 3500 calories
Calories needed to lose 30 lbs. = 30 × 3500 = 105,000 calories

Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit needed to reach the goal.
Daily calorie deficit = Total calories needed / Number of days
Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories

Therefore, to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs. by his birthday, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525
