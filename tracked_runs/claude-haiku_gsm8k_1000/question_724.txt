Question ID: 540

Question:
$18 is shared among 3 boys. The eldest added $5 to his share and added another $10 the following day. He later needed some money and spent $8 from his total so far. After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. How much does he have now?


Reference Answer:
Each boy gets $18/3 = $<<18/3=6>>6.
The eldest had $5+$6=$<<5+6=11>>11 after adding $5 to his share.
He added another $10 so he had $11+$10=$<<11+10=21>>21.
Then he had $21-$8=$<<21-8=13>>13 after spending $8.
So, he now has $13*3=$<<13*3=39>>39.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- $18 is shared among 3 boys.
- The eldest boy added $5 to his share.
- The next day, he added another $10 to his share.
- He later spent $8 from his total so far.
- After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8.

Step 1: Calculate the initial share of the eldest boy.
Initial share = $18 รท 3 = $6

Step 2: Calculate the amount the eldest boy had after adding $5 and $10.
Amount after adding $5 = $6 + $5 = $11
Amount after adding $10 = $11 + $10 = $21

Step 3: Calculate the amount the eldest boy had after spending $8.
Amount after spending $8 = $21 - $8 = $13

Step 4: Calculate the amount the eldest boy had after tripling the remaining amount.
Amount after tripling = $13 ร 3 = $39

Therefore
