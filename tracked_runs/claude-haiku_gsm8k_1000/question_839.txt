Question ID: 1206

Question:
John decides to get a loan by mortgaging his home.  His house is worth $250,000.  He gets a loan worth 40% of that.  He uses 60% of that to pay off his debts.  How much money did he have leftover after paying debt?


Reference Answer:
His loan is worth 250,000*.4=$<<250000*.4=100000>>100,000
That means he uses 100,000*.6=$<<100000*.6=60000>>60,000 to pay off debts
So he has 100,000-60,000=$<<100000-60000=40000>>40,000 leftover
#### 40,000

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John's house is worth $250,000.
2. He gets a loan worth 40% of that:
   * 40% of $250,000 = 0.4 x $250,000 = $100,000

3. He uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts:
   * 60% of $100,000 = 0.6 x $100,000 = $60,000

4. To find the amount of money he had leftover after paying off his debts, we need to subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the total loan amount:
   * $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts is $40,000.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John's house is worth $250,000.
2. He gets a loan worth 40% of the house value:
   * Loan amount = 40% of $250,000 = 0.4 x $250,000 = $100,000

3. He uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts:
   * Amount used to pay off debts = 60% of $100,000 = 0.6 x $100,000 = $60,000

4. To find the amount of money he had leftover after paying off his debts, we need to subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the total loan amount:
   * Leftover amount = Total loan amount - Amount used to pay off debts
   * Leftover amount = $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts is $40,000.
