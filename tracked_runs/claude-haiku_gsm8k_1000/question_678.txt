Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds.
- Daisy bought a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes.
- Daisy bought a bag of carrots that weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes.
Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 × Weight of potatoes
Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 × 5 pounds = 10 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the weight of the carrots.
Weight of carrots = Weight of sweet potatoes - 3 pounds
Weight of carrots = 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots.

Final answer: Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots.
