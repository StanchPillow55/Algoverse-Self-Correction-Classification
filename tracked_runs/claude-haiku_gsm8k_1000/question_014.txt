Question ID: 1055

Question:
James has to buy insurance.  Since he had an accident it was 60% more than normal.  The normal cost is $120 a month.  How much does he pay a year?


Reference Answer:
The insurance is 120*.6=$<<120*.6=72>>72 per month more expensive than normal
So he paid 120+72=$<<120+72=192>>192 a month
That means he pays 12*192=$<<12*192=2304>>2304
#### 2304

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The normal cost of the insurance is $120 per month.
- Due to an accident, the cost is 60% more than normal.

Step 1: Calculate the increased cost of the insurance.
Normal cost = $120 per month
Increase = 60% of $120 = 0.60 × $120 = $72
New cost = Normal cost + Increase = $120 + $72 = $192 per month

Step 2: Calculate the total cost per year.
Total cost per year = New cost per month × 12 months
Total cost per year = $192 × 12 = $2,304

Therefore, James pays $2,304 per year for the insurance.

Final answer: James pays $2,304 per year for the insurance.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The normal cost of the insurance is $120 per month.
- Due to an accident, the cost is 60% more than normal.

Step 1: Calculate the increased cost of the insurance per month.
Normal cost per month = $120
Increase in cost = 60% of $120 = 0.60 × $120 = $72
New cost per month = Normal cost + Increase in cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the insurance per year.
Cost per month = $192
Cost per year = Cost per month × 12 months = $192 × 12 = $2,304

Therefore, James pays $2,304 per year for the insurance.

Final answer: James pays $2,304 per year for the insurance.
