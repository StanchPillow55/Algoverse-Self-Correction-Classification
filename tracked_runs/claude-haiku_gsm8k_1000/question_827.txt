Question:
Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden. The wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long. How many pieces did she obtain?


Reference Answer:
If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 inches.
Since the wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long, Tracy obtained 48/6=<<48/6=8>>8 pieces

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pieces of wire Tracy obtained from the 4-foot-long wire.

Given information:
- The wire is 4 feet long.
- The wire is cut into pieces 6 inches long.

Step 1: Convert the length of the wire from feet to inches.
1 foot = 12 inches
4 feet = 4 Ã— 12 inches = 48 inches

Step 2: Divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece.
Total length of the wire / Length of each piece = Number of pieces
48 inches / 6 inches = 8 pieces

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire from the 4-foot-long wire.

Final answer: Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.
