Question ID: 427

Question:
Kenny is selling his Pokemon cards to buy a ticket to an amusement park, which costs $100. He has a collection of cards and plans to sell them for $1.5 each. He keeps 1/3 of them and gets to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash. How many cards did he start with?


Reference Answer:
He made $150 selling the cards because 100 + 50 = <<100+50=150>>150
He sold 100 cards because 150 / 1.5 = <<150/1.5=100>>100
The cards he sold were 2/3 of his collection because 1 - (1/3) = 2/3
He started with 150 cards because 100 / (2/3) = <<100/(2/3)=150>>150
#### 150

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cards Kenny started with.

Given information:
- The amusement park ticket costs $100.
- Kenny sells the cards for $1.5 each.
- Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards and gets $50 in spending cash.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Kenny needs to buy the amusement park ticket and have $50 in spending cash.
Total amount needed = Amusement park ticket cost + Spending cash
Total amount needed = $100 + $50 = $150

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Kenny will get from selling the cards.
Total amount from selling cards = (2/3) × Total number of cards × $1.5

Step 3: Set up an equation to find the total number of cards.
Total amount from selling cards = Total amount needed
(2/3) × Total number of cards × $1.5 = $150

Step 4: Solve the equation for the total number of cards.
(2/3) × Total number of cards × $1.5 = $150
Total number
