Question ID: 1204

Question:
Twenty tourists discovered 700 shells in a strip mall parking lot. They had divided into three groups, Alphas, The finders, and Gogetters to find as many shells as possible. If team Alphas found 40% of the shells, and team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, how many shells did team Gogetters find?


Reference Answer:
Team Alphas found 40/100*700 = <<40/100*700=280>>280 shells.
If team Alphas found 280 shells, the other teams found 700-280 = 420 shells.
Team The Finders found 60% of the remaining shells, a total of 60/100*420 = <<60/100*420=252>>252 shells.
If The finders found 252 shells, team Gogetters found 420-252 = 168 shells.
#### 168

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas.
2. Calculate the number of shells remaining after team Alphas' findings.
3. Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders.
4. Calculate the number of shells remaining after team The finders' findings.
5. Calculate the number of shells found by team Gogetters.

Step 1: Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas.
Total shells found = 700
Alphas found 40% of the shells
Shells found by Alphas = 700 × 0.40 = 280 shells

Step 2: Calculate the number of shells remaining after team Alphas' findings.
Shells remaining = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
Shells remaining = 700 - 280 = 420 shells

Step 3: Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders.
The finders found 60% of the remaining shells
Shells found by The finders = 420 × 0.60 = 252 shells

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Total number of shells found: 700

2. Team Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells:
   * 40% of 700 = 0.40 x 700 = 280 shells

3. Remaining shells after Team Alphas:
   * 700 - 280 = 420 shells

4. Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:
   * 60% of 420 = 0.60 x 420 = 252 shells

5. Remaining shells after Team The finders:
   * 420 - 252 = 168 shells

6. Therefore, the number of shells found by Team Gogetters is:
   * 168 shells

Final answer: Team Gogetters found 168 shells.
