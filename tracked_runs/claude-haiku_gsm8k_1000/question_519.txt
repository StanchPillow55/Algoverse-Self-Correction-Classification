Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes.
- One pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- One pair of pants costs $22.50.
- One pair of shoes costs $42.

To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them up.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the shorts.
Cost of 3 pairs of shorts = 3 × $16.50 = $49.50

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the pants.
Cost of 3 pairs of pants = 3 × $22.50 = $67.50

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the shoes.
Cost of 3 pairs of shoes = 3 × $42 = $126

Step 4: Calculate the total amount Mishka spent.
Total amount spent = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
Total amount spent = $49.50 + $67.50 +


Extracted Answer: 126
