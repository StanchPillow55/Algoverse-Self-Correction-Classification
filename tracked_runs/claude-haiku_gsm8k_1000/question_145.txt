Question ID: 9

Question:
Eliza's rate per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. She also receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. If Eliza worked for 45 hours this week, how much are her earnings for this week?


Reference Answer:
Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.
Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.
So, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.
Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate Eliza's earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours, then add them together to find her total earnings for the week.

Given information:
- Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
- Eliza's overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.
- Eliza worked for 45 hours this week.

Step 1: Calculate Eliza's earnings for the regular hours.
Regular hours = 40 hours
Regular earnings = Regular hourly rate × Regular hours
Regular earnings = $10 × 40 hours = $400

Step 2: Calculate Eliza's earnings for the overtime hours.
Overtime hours = Total hours - Regular hours
Overtime hours = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours
Overtime pay rate = Regular hourly rate × 1.2
Overtime pay rate = $10 × 1.2 = $12 per hour
Overtime earnings = Overtime pay rate × Overtime hours
Overtime earnings = $12 × 5 hours = $60

Step 3: Calculate

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10 for the first 40 hours she works each week.
- Eliza's overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.
- Eliza worked for 45 hours this week.

To calculate Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to find the amount she earned for her regular hours and the amount she earned for her overtime hours, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the amount Eliza earned for her regular hours.
Regular hours = 40 hours
Regular hourly rate = $10
Amount earned for regular hours = 40 hours × $10 per hour = $400

Step 2: Calculate the amount Eliza earned for her overtime hours.
Overtime hours = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours
Overtime hourly rate = 1.2 × $10 per hour = $12 per hour
Amount earned for overtime hours = 5 hours × $12 per hour = $60
