Question:
Lori needed 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves.  She anticipates that each of her guests will eat 3 deviled egg halves.  If she is inviting 16 guests to her party, how many dozens of eggs will she need?


Reference Answer:
She is inviting 16 guests that will eat 3 deviled egg halves each so she needs 16*3 =<<16*3=48>>48 halves
1 whole egg is needed to make 2 halves so 48 halves is 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 whole eggs
1 dozen is equal to 12 and she needs 24 eggs so she needs 24/12 = <<24/12=2>>2 dozen eggs

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of deviled egg halves required for the party and then calculate the number of whole eggs needed to make them. Finally, we can convert the number of eggs to dozens.

Given information:
- Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves.
- Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
- Lori is inviting 16 guests to the party.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required for the party.
Number of deviled egg halves per guest × Number of guests = Total number of deviled egg halves
3 deviled egg halves × 16 guests = 48 deviled egg halves

Step 2: Calculate the number of whole eggs needed to make the deviled egg halves.
Total number of deviled egg halves ÷ 2 = Number of whole eggs needed
48 deviled egg halves ÷ 2 = 24 whole eggs

Step 3: Convert the number of eggs to dozens.
Number of whole eggs ÷

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves.
2. Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
3. Lori is inviting 16 guests to her party.

To calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:
* Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves
* 16 guests x 3 deviled egg halves = 48 deviled egg halves

Now, to calculate the number of whole eggs needed:
* Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves
* 48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 whole eggs

Finally, to convert to dozens:
* 24 whole eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 2 dozens of eggs

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs for her party.
