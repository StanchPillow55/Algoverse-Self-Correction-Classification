Question:
Bruce works for 5 hours on Tuesday. On Wednesday he works twice the time he works on Tuesday. On Thursday he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. How many hours does Bruce work in all these three days?


Reference Answer:
On Wednesday, Bruce works for 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 hours.
On Thursday, Bruce works for 10 – 2 = <<10-2=8>>8 hours.
On these three days, Bruce works for 5 + 10 + 8 = <<5+10+8=23>>23 hours.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.
- On Wednesday, Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday.
- On Thursday, Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday.

Step 1: Calculate the number of hours Bruce works on Wednesday.
Time worked on Wednesday = 2 × Time worked on Tuesday
Time worked on Wednesday = 2 × 5 hours = 10 hours

Step 2: Calculate the number of hours Bruce works on Thursday.
Time worked on Thursday = Time worked on Wednesday - 2 hours
Time worked on Thursday = 10 hours - 2 hours = 8 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours Bruce works in all three days.
Total hours worked = Time worked on Tuesday + Time worked on Wednesday + Time worked on Thursday
Total hours worked = 5 hours + 10 hours + 8 hours = 23 hours

Therefore, Bruce works a total of 23 hours in all three days.
