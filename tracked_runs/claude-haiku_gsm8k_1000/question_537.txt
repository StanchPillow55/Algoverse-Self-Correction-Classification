Question ID: 583

Question:
Judy bought a dozen cups and twice as many dishes as cups to take to the church's charity event. At the event, she found out that her friend had brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than she had brought. What's the total number of utensils brought by the two?


Reference Answer:
Judy brought a dozen cups, which is <<12=12>>12.
Judy's number of plates was twice as many as cups which totals 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24
All the utensils brought by Judy is 24 dishes+12 cups = <<24+12=36>>36
Her friend brought 24+ 20 = <<24+20=44>>44 dishes.
The total number of utensils brought by Judy's friend is 44 dishes+40 cups = <<44+40=84>>84
When they combined their utensils, they brought together 84+36 = <<84+36=120>>120

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Judy bought a dozen cups (12 cups)
- Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups
- Judy's friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy

Step 1: Calculate the number of dishes Judy bought.
Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups, so:
Number of dishes = 2 × Number of cups
Number of dishes = 2 × 12 = 24 dishes

Step 2: Calculate the number of dishes Judy's friend brought.
Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so:
Number of dishes Judy's friend brought = 24 + 20 = 44 dishes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of utensils brought by the two.
Total number of utensils = Number of cups Judy brought + Number of dishes Judy brought + Number of cups Judy's friend brought + Number of dishes Judy's friend brought
Total number of utensils = 12 + 24 + 40 + 44 = 120
