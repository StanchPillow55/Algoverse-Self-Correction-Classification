Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs.
- There are 12 blue gumballs.

Step 1: Find the relationship between the number of pink gumballs and the number of blue gumballs.
Let x = the number of blue gumballs
Then, the number of pink gumballs = 4x + 22

Step 2: Substitute the given information into the equation.
We know that the number of blue gumballs is 12, so:
x = 12

Step 3: Solve for the number of pink gumballs.
Number of pink gumballs = 4x + 22
Number of pink gumballs = 4(12) + 22
Number of pink gumballs = 48 + 22
Number of pink gumballs = 70

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs in the candy machine is 70.
