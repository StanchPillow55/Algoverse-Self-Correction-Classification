Question ID: 84

Question:
A football team played 22 games. They won 8 more than they lost. How many did they win?


Reference Answer:
Let L be the number of losses.
The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.
The team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.
So, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14
So L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.
Therefore, the team won 22 â€“ 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of games the football team won.

Given information:
- The football team played a total of 22 games.
- They won 8 more games than they lost.

Let's represent the number of games they won as "x".

Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they lost can be represented as "x - 8".

The total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and the games lost.

Therefore, we can write the equation:
x + (x - 8) = 22

Simplifying the equation:
2x - 8 = 22
2x = 30
x = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

Final answer: The football team won 15 games.
