Question:
To make a profit of $2000, Isaias has to sell the chickens he planned to take to the market from his farm at $50 per chicken. If Isaias has 300 chickens on his farm and plans to sell 3/5 of them, for how much money did Isaias buy the chicken he took to the market for sale?


Reference Answer:
Isaias plans to sell 3/5*300 = <<3/5*300=180>>180 chickens from his farm.
To make his profit, Isaias sells all the chicken he took to the market for $50*180 = $<<50*180=9000>>9000
The price at which Isaias bought the chicken is $9000-$2000 = $<<9000-2000=7000>>7000.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000 by selling the chickens.
- Isaias plans to sell the chickens at $50 per chicken.
- Isaias has 300 chickens on his farm.
- Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of the chickens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
Total number of chickens = 300
Proportion of chickens to be sold = 3/5
Number of chickens to be sold = 300 × 3/5 = 180 chickens

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue Isaias will receive from selling the chickens.
Total revenue = Number of chickens sold × Price per chicken
Total revenue = 180 × $50 = $9,000

Step 3: Calculate the total cost Isaias incurred to buy the chickens.
Total cost = Total revenue - Desired profit
Total cost = $9,000 - $2,000 = $7,000

Therefore,
