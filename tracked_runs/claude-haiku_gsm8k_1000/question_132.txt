Question ID: 1012

Question:
Maria was charging her power bank before going to the park when she disconnected it and noticed the power bank wasn’t fully charged yet. Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. While charging her friends’ phones, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. 5 hours later the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?


Reference Answer:
At first, the power bank lost 9% per hour * 5 hours = 45%.
Later on, the power bank lost 7% per hour * 3 hours = 21%.
The power bank charge remaining was 28%, so the power bank charge before going to the park was 45 + 21 +28 = 94%.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the final charge of the power bank to find the initial charge when Maria went out to the park.

Given information:
- The power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour for the first 5 hours.
- After 5 hours, the power bank started losing 7% of the total capacity each hour for the next 3 hours.
- The final charge remaining was 28%.

Step 1: Calculate the charge remaining after the first 5 hours.
Initial charge = 100%
Charge remaining after 5 hours = 100% - (9% × 5 hours) = 55%

Step 2: Calculate the charge remaining after the next 3 hours.
Charge remaining after 5 hours = 55%
Charge remaining after 3 more hours = 55% - (7% × 3 hours) = 28%

Step 3: Find the initial charge when Maria went out to the park.
Final charge remaining = 28%
We know that the final charge remaining is 28%, so we can work backward to find the initial charge.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Maria's power bank was not fully charged when she left for the park.
2. At the park, her friends asked to charge their phones, and the power bank started losing 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
3. After 5 hours, the power bank started losing 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
4. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%.

Let's calculate the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park.

First, let's calculate the charge lost in the first 5 hours:
* 9% loss per hour for 5 hours = 45% total loss

Now, let's calculate the charge lost in the next 3 hours:
* 7% loss per hour for 3 hours = 21% total loss

The total charge lost is 45% + 21% = 66%.

We know the final charge remaining was 28%, so the initial charge must have been:
* 28% + 66% = 94%

Therefore, the charge of
