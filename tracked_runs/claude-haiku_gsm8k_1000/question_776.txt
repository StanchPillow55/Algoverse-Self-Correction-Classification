Question:
Emma can make and upload 72 vlogs per month. But she was only able to make 18 vlogs for the first week, 21 vlogs for the second week, and 15 vlogs for the third week. How many vlogs should she do to complete the 72 vlogs per month?


Reference Answer:
Emma was able to make 18 + 21 + 15 = <<18+21+15=54>>54 vlogs for 3 weeks.
Therefore, Emma needs to do 72 - 54 = <<72-54=18>>18 more vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs.
#### 18

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of vlogs Emma has made so far and then subtract it from the total number of vlogs she needs to make per month to determine the remaining number of vlogs she should do.

Given information:
- Emma can make and upload 72 vlogs per month.
- Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of vlogs Emma has made so far.
Vlogs made in the first week = 18
Vlogs made in the second week = 21
Vlogs made in the third week = 15
Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Step 2: Calculate the remaining number of vlogs Emma should do to complete the 72 vlogs per month.
Total vlogs per month = 72
Vlogs made so far = 54
Remaining vlogs to be made = 72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

Therefore, Emma should make

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Emma can make and upload 72 vlogs per month.
- In the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
- In the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
- In the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

To find how many vlogs she should do to complete the 72 vlogs per month, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of vlogs she has made so far.
2. Subtract the total number of vlogs made from the target of 72 vlogs per month.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of vlogs made so far.
Vlogs made in the first week: 18
Vlogs made in the second week: 21
Vlogs made in the third week: 15
Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Step 2: Calculate the remaining number of vlogs needed to complete the 72 vlogs per month.
Target vlogs per month: 72

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Emma can make and upload 72 vlogs per month.
2. In the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
3. In the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
4. In the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

To find out how many more vlogs she needs to complete the 72 vlogs per month, we need to add up the vlogs she has already made and subtract that from the total of 72 vlogs.

Vlogs made in the first 3 weeks:
* Week 1: 18 vlogs
* Week 2: 21 vlogs 
* Week 3: 15 vlogs
* Total vlogs made in the first 3 weeks = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Now, we subtract the 54 vlogs made from the total of 72 vlogs per month:
* 72 vlogs - 54 vlogs = 18 vlogs

Therefore, Emma should make 18 more
