Question:
A car is on a road trip and drives 60 mph for 2 hours, and then 30 mph for 1 hour. What is the car's average speed in mph during this trip?


Reference Answer:
The car drives 60*2=<<60*2=120>>120 miles for 2 hours.
The car drives 30*1=<<30*1=30>>30 miles for 1 hour.
It drives a total of 120+30=<<120+30=150>>150 miles.
Let S be the average speed, M be the number of miles, and H the number of hours spent driving.
Then we have, S=M/H, so, S=150 miles/3 hours = <<150/3=50>>50 mph

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the car and the total time taken for the trip, and then find the average speed.

Given information:
- The car drives 60 mph for 2 hours.
- The car then drives 30 mph for 1 hour.

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours.
Distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour.
Distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled during the trip.
Total distance traveled = Distance traveled at 60 mph + Distance traveled at 30 mph
Total distance traveled = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Step 4: Calculate the total time taken for the trip.
Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Step 5: Calculate the

Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled during the trip.
Total distance traveled = Distance traveled at 60 mph + Distance traveled at 30 mph
Total distance traveled = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Step 4: Calculate the total time taken for the trip.
Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The car drives 60 mph for 2 hours.
- The car then drives 30 mph for 1 hour.

To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time.

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours.
Distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour.
Distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled.
Total distance traveled = Distance traveled at 60 mph + Distance traveled at 30 mph
Total distance traveled = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Step 4: Calculate the total time of the trip.
Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Step 5: Calculate the average
