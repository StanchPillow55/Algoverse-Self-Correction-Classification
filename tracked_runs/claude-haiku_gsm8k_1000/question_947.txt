Question:
A house and a lot cost $120,000. If the house cost three times as much as the lot, how much did the house cost?


Reference Answer:
Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.
The cost of the house is 3/4 of the total cost, which is $120,000. 3/4 * $120,000 = $<<3/4*120000=90000>>90,000.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of the house given that the house and the lot cost $120,000 and the house costs three times as much as the lot.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the cost of the lot.
- Then, the cost of the house is 3x.

Given information:
- The house and the lot cost $120,000.
- The house costs three times as much as the lot.

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the given information.
Total cost = Cost of the house + Cost of the lot
$120,000 = 3x + x
$120,000 = 4x

Step 2: Solve for the cost of the lot (x).
$120,000 = 4x
x = $120,000 / 4
x = $30,000

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the house.
Cost of the house = 3x
Cost of the house = 3 × $30,000
Cost of the house = $90,000

Therefore, the house cost $90,000.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The house and the lot cost $120,000 in total.
- The house cost three times as much as the lot.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the cost of the lot.
- Then, the cost of the house is 3x.

We can set up an equation to solve for the cost of the house:

Total cost = Cost of the house + Cost of the lot
$120,000 = 3x + x
$120,000 = 4x

Solving for x:
x = $120,000 / 4
x = $30,000

Therefore, the cost of the lot is $30,000.

Now, we can find the cost of the house:
Cost of the house = 3 × $30,000 = $90,000

Therefore, the house cost $90,000.

Final answer: The house cost $90,000.
