Question:
Marilyn wants to buy a pair of boots online. On Amazon.com, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4. On eBay, those same pair of shoes are only $13, but shipping costs twice as much as it does on Amazon. How much more expensive do the boots work out to be on eBay?


Reference Answer:
The total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $<<16+4=20>>20
Shipping on eBay costs $4 x 2 = $<<4*2=8>>8
The total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $<<13+8=21>>21
The boots cost $21 - $20 = $<<21-20=1>>1 more on eBay

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both Amazon and eBay, and then find the difference between the two.

Given information:
- On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and the shipping cost is $4.
- On eBay, the boots cost $13, and the shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the boots on Amazon.
Total cost on Amazon = Cost of boots + Shipping cost
Total cost on Amazon = $16 + $4 = $20

Step 2: Calculate the shipping cost on eBay.
Shipping cost on eBay = 2 × Shipping cost on Amazon
Shipping cost on eBay = 2 × $4 = $8

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the boots on eBay.
Total cost on eBay = Cost of boots + Shipping cost
Total cost on eBay = $13 + $8 = $21

Step 4: Calculate the difference in cost between eBay and Amazon.
Difference in cost = Total cost on eBay - Total
