Question:
Antoine's french onion soup recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions. He likes to double that amount. His soup serves 6 people. The onions are currently on sale for $2.00 a pound. He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, that are also on sale for $2.00 a box.  What is the cost per serving? (Round to the nearest integer.)


Reference Answer:
His recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions but he wants to double that amount so he needs 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 pounds of onions
Onions are currently on sale for $2.00 a pound so they will cost 4*2 = $8.00
He needs 2 boxes of stock which are also on sale for $2.00 so they will cost 2*2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00
The onions are $8.00 and the stock is $4.00 for a total of 8+4 = $<<8+4=12.00>>12.00
The soup serves 6 people and the total cost is $12.00 so each serving is 12/6 = $<<12/6=2.00>>2.00 a serving

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions.
2. He likes to double that amount, so he uses 4 pounds of onions.
3. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound.
4. So the cost of the onions is:
   * 4 pounds x $2.00 per pound = $8.00

5. The recipe also requires 2 boxes of beef stock.
6. The beef stock is on sale for $2.00 per box.
7. So the cost of the beef stock is:
   * 2 boxes x $2.00 per box = $4.00

8. The total cost of the ingredients is:
   * $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00

9. The recipe serves 6 people.
10. To calculate the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:
    * $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00
