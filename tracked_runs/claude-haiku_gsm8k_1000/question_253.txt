Question ID: 441

Question:
Two sisters, Elizabeth and Margareth, bought beads. Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads, while Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. How many more beads do one sister have than the other, if each pack of beads contains 20 pieces of beads?


Reference Answer:
Elizabeth bought 1 + 2 = <<1+2=3>>3 packs.
So Elizabeth bought 3 x 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 pieces of beads.
Margareth bought 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 packs.
So Margareth bought 7 x 20 = <<7*20=140>>140 pieces of beads.
Therefore, Margareth bought 140 - 60 = <<140-60=80>>80 more beads than Elizabeth.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of beads each sister bought and then calculate the difference between them.

Given information:
- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack of beads contains 20 pieces of beads.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought.
Red beads: 1 pack × 20 beads per pack = 20 red beads
Clear beads: 2 packs × 20 beads per pack = 40 clear beads
Total beads Elizabeth bought = 20 red beads + 40 clear beads = 60 beads

Step 2: Calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought.
Blue beads: 3 packs × 20 beads per pack = 60 blue beads
Red beads: 4 packs × 20 beads per pack = 80 red beads
Total beads Margareth bought
