Question:
The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house. The sun is moving at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house. If the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves for 10 hours, how many degrees will there be from the ground to the sun?


Reference Answer:
5 degrees an hour for 10 hours 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 degrees
the pyramid is 32 degrees from the ground so 32+50=<<32+50=82>>82 degrees
#### 82

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Understand the given information:
   - The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.
   - The sun is moving at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house.
   - The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves for 10 hours.

2. Calculate the total angle change of the sun:
   - The sun moves 5 degrees per hour.
   - The sun moves for 10 hours.
   - Total angle change of the sun = 5 degrees/hour Ã— 10 hours = 50 degrees.

3. Calculate the final angle from the ground to the sun:
   - The initial angle from the ground to the tip of the pyramid is 32 degrees.
   - The sun has moved 50 degrees upward from the tip of the pyramid.
   - The final angle from the ground to the sun = 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.

Therefore, the final angle from the
