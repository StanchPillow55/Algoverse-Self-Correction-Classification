Question:
Two trains leave San Rafael at the same time. They begin traveling westward, both traveling for 80 miles. The next day, they travel northwards, covering 150 miles. What's the distance covered by each train in the two days?


Reference Answer:
On the first day, the trains covered 2 trains * 80 miles/train = <<2*80=160>>160 miles together.
They also covered 150 miles/train * 2 trains = <<150*2=300>>300 miles together on the second day.
The combined distance the two trains covered in the two days is 300 miles + 160 miles = <<300+160=460>>460 miles
The average distance for the two days is 460 miles / 2 trains = <<460/2=230>>230 miles/train

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance covered by each train in the two-day journey.

Given information:
- Two trains leave San Rafael at the same time and travel westward for 80 miles.
- The next day, they travel northwards for 150 miles.

Step 1: Calculate the distance covered by each train on the first day.
Distance covered on the first day = 80 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance covered by each train on the second day.
Distance covered on the second day = 150 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total distance covered by each train in the two-day journey.
Total distance covered = Distance covered on the first day + Distance covered on the second day
Total distance covered = 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two-day journey is 230 miles.

Final answer: The distance covered by each train in the two-day journey is 230 miles.
