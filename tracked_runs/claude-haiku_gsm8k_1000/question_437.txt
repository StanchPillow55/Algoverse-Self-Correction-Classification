Question ID: 879

Question:
At a spa, Iris spent $400 to do her hair, 1/4 as much to do a manicure, and 3/4 as much money as a manicure to do a pedicure. How much money did she spend at the spa?


Reference Answer:
The total amount of money that Iris used to do a manicure is 1/4*$400 = $<<1/4*400=100>>100
Together, she used $400+$100 = $<<400+100=500>>500 to do her hair and manicure,
If Iris also spent 3/4 as much money as a manicure to do a pedicure, she used 3/4*$100 = $<<3/4*100=75>>75 to do a pedicure.
At the spa, Iris spent a total of $500+$75 = $<<500+75=575>>575
#### 575

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Iris spent $400 to do her hair.
- Iris spent 1/4 as much to do a manicure.
- Iris spent 3/4 as much money as a manicure to do a pedicure.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the manicure.
Cost of manicure = 1/4 of $400 = $100

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the pedicure.
Cost of pedicure = 3/4 of $100 = $75

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Iris spent at the spa.
Total amount spent = Cost of hair + Cost of manicure + Cost of pedicure
Total amount spent = $400 + $100 + $75 = $575

Therefore, Iris spent a total of $575 at the spa.
