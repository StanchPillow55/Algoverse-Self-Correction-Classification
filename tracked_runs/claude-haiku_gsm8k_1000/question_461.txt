Question ID: 775

Question:
Henry needs to assemble some toys, specifically 57 cars and 73 motorcycles. Henry knows that to assemble all the toys he will need 4 wheels for each car and 2 wheels for each motorcycle. How many wheels will be left if he has a box with 650 wheels in it?


Reference Answer:
The total number of wheels needed for all the cars is 57 cars x 4 wheels/car = <<57*4=228>>228 wheels
The total number of wheels needed for all the motorcycles is 73 motorcycles x 2 wheels/motorcycle = <<73*2=146>>146 wheels
Combining the number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles gives a total of 228 wheels + 146 wheels = <<228+146=374>>374 wheels
The number of wheels left in the bag will be 650 wheels â€“ 374 wheels = <<650-374=276>>276 wheels

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Henry needs to assemble 57 cars and 73 motorcycles.
2. For each car, he needs 4 wheels.
3. For each motorcycle, he needs 2 wheels.
4. So, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is:
   * 57 cars x 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels
5. The total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is:
   * 73 motorcycles x 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels
6. The total number of wheels needed for all the toys is:
   * 228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels
7. Henry has a box with 650 wheels.
8. To find the number of wheels left, we subtract the total wheels needed from the total wheels in the box:
   * 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

Therefore, the final answer is that there will be 276 wheels left in the box.
