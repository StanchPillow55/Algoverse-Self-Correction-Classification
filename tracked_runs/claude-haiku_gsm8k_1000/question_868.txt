Question ID: 1084

Question:
If Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam, how much is left over for Sam?


Reference Answer:
Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+60=100
Subtracting the 60 from both sides, we get 2x=40
We divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.
#### 20

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence between them.
- Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

To find the amount of fence left over for Sam, we need to first find out how much fence each person gets.

Step 1: Let's represent Sam's portion as x.
Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry's portion can be represented as x + 60.

Step 2: We know that the total fence is 100 feet, so we can set up an equation:
x + (x + 60) = 100

Step 3: Simplify the equation:
2x + 60 = 100

Step 4: Solve for x:
2x = 100 - 60
2x = 40
x = 20

Therefore, Sam's portion is 20 feet.

Step 5: To find the amount of fence left over for Sam, we subtract Sam's portion from the total fence:
Total fence - Sam's portion = Fence left over for Sam
100 feet
