Question ID: 1254

Question:
Louise is an artist and needs to apply a coat of varnish to her latest paintings. Usually it takes 7 minutes for the coat of varnish to dry on one painting. However, today she is using a new varnish and it takes 12 minutes for the coat to dry. How much longer will it take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish?


Reference Answer:
Usually, the varnish on all 6 paintings would be dry in 7*6=<<7*6=42>>42 minutes
With the new varnish, all 6 paintings would be dry in 12*6=<<6*12=72>>72 minutes
With the new varnish, it will take 72-42=<<72-42=30>>30 more minutes

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the new varnish and the time it takes with the old varnish, then find the difference between the two.

Given information:
- With the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes for the coat of varnish to dry on one painting.
- With the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes for the coat of varnish to dry on one painting.
- Louise needs to apply the coat of varnish to 6 paintings.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the old varnish.
Time for 1 painting with old varnish = 7 minutes
Time for 6 paintings with old varnish = 6 × 7 minutes = 42 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the new varnish.
Time for 1 painting with new varnish = 12 minutes

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- With the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes for the coat to dry on one painting.
- With the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes for the coat to dry on one painting.
- Louise needs to apply the coat of varnish to 6 paintings.

Step 1: Calculate the total time it would take for the 6 paintings to dry with the old varnish.
Time for 1 painting with old varnish = 7 minutes
Time for 6 paintings with old varnish = 6 × 7 minutes = 42 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total time it would take for the 6 paintings to dry with the new varnish.
Time for 1 painting with new varnish = 12 minutes
Time for 6 paintings with new varnish = 6 × 12 minutes = 72 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the difference in time between the new varnish and the old varnish.
Time difference = Time with new varn
