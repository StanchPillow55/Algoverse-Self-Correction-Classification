Question:
Oscar has 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school.  He passes 14 out to his friends.  He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends.  He eats 3 more that night and 2 more in the morning.  How many lollipops does Oscar have?


Reference Answer:
He has 24 lollipops, eats 2 and passes 14 out to his friends so that’s 24-2-14 = <<24-2-14=8>>8 lollipops are left
On his way home he buys twice the amount of the 14 that he passed out so he bought 2*14 = <<2*14=28>>28 lollipops
He now has 8+28 = <<8+28=36>>36 lollipops
He has 36, eats 3 that night and 2 more in the morning leaving him with 36-3-2 = <<36-3-2=31>>31 lollipops

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
- He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.
- He passes out 14 lollipops to his friends.
- He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends.
- He eats 3 more lollipops that night and 2 more in the morning.

Step 1: Calculate the number of lollipops Oscar has after eating 2 on his way to school.
Number of lollipops after eating 2 = 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops

Step 2: Calculate the number of lollipops Oscar passes out to his friends.
Number of lollipops passed out to friends = 14 lollipops

Step 3: Calculate the number of lollipops Oscar buys on his way home.
Number of lollipops bought on the way home = 2 × 14 = 28 lollipops

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.
   * 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops remaining

3. He passes out 14 lollipops to his friends.
   * 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops remaining

4. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends.
   * 14 x 2 = 28 lollipops bought
   * 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops

5. He eats 3 more lollipops that night.
   * 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops

6. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning.
   * 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops

Therefore, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.
