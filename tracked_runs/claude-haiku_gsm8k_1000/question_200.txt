Question ID: 288

Question:
A landscaping company is delivering flagstones to a customer’s yard. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. If the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, how many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip?


Reference Answer:
The 80 flagstones weight 75 * 80 = <<75*80=6000>>6000 pounds.
Thus, the landscaping company will need 6000 / 2000 = <<6000/2000=3>>3 trucks to transport the flagstones in one trip.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total weight of the flagstones and then determine how many trucks are required to transport them.

Given information:
- Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds.
- The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds.
- The customer needs to transport 80 flagstones.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones.
Total weight of the flagstones = Number of flagstones × Weight of each flagstone
Total weight of the flagstones = 80 × 75 pounds = 6000 pounds

Step 2: Determine the number of trucks needed to transport the flagstones.
Number of trucks needed = Total weight of the flagstones / Total weight capacity of each truck
Since each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds, we need to find how many trucks are required to transport the 6000 pounds of flagstones.

Number of trucks needed = 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds per truck = 3 trucks

Therefore, the landscaping company will need 3 trucks to transport 80 flag

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that each flagstone weighs 75 pounds.
2. The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds.
3. The landscaping company needs to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

To find the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones and then divide that by the maximum weight capacity of the trucks.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones.
Total weight of flagstones = 80 flagstones × 75 pounds per flagstone = 6000 pounds

Step 2: Divide the total weight of the flagstones by the maximum weight capacity of the trucks.
Number of trucks needed = Total weight of flagstones / Maximum weight capacity of each truck
Number of trucks needed = 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds per truck = 3 trucks

Therefore, the landscaping company will need 3 trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.
