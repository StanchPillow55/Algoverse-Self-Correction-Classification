Question ID: 450

Question:
You can buy a movie super ticket for $20 that includes rights to watch any movie and you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. Or you can buy a movie ticket for $12 and buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price. What's the regular price of popcorn if the soda costs $3 and you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2?


Reference Answer:
The super ticket costs $20 and for $1 extra I can get a popcorn and a soda, there I'd pay in total $20+$1 = $<<20+1=21>>21
If I didn't buy the ($21) super ticket but bought everything included on it and still saved $2, then I spent in total $21-$2 = $<<21-2=19>>19
If the regular movie ticket costs $12 and the soda costs $3 then the popcorn would cost $19-$12-$3=$4

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Movie super ticket costs $20 and includes a movie ticket and a popcorn with a soda for $1 extra.
- Regular movie ticket costs $12.
- Soda costs $3.
- If you didn't buy the super ticket, you ended up saving $2.

To find the regular price of the popcorn, we need to set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the regular price of the popcorn.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of buying a regular movie ticket, popcorn, and soda.
Regular movie ticket + Popcorn + Soda = $12 + x + $3 = $15 + x

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of buying the movie super ticket.
Movie super ticket + $1 (for popcorn and soda) = $20 + $1 = $21

Step 3: Set up the equation to find the savings.
Total cost of regular ticket, popcorn, and soda - Total
