Question ID: 201

Question:
John wins an award at work.  The award has a 1 time monetary reward of $5000 and a 5% raise in salary.  If he makes 2000 a week, every week of the year and he got the award on the first day of the year how much money did he make that year?


Reference Answer:
He makes 2000*52=$<<2000*52=104000>>104,000 a year
So the raise is worth .05*104,000=$<<.05*104000=5200>>5200
So he makes 104,000+5200=$<<104000+5200=109200>>109,200 from his salary
So in total he made 109,200+5,000=$<<109200+5000=114200>>114,200
#### 114,200

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- John wins an award at work with a one-time monetary reward of $5,000.
- The award also includes a 5% raise in his salary.
- John makes $2,000 per week, every week of the year.
- John received the award on the first day of the year.

To calculate the total amount of money John made that year, we need to find the following:
1. His original annual salary before the raise.
2. His new annual salary after the 5% raise.
3. The total amount of money he made that year, including the one-time monetary reward.

Step 1: Calculate John's original annual salary before the raise.
Original weekly salary = $2,000
Original annual salary = $2,000 × 52 weeks = $104,000

Step 2: Calculate John's new annual salary after the 5% raise.
Raise percentage = 5%
Raise amount = $104,000 × 0.05 = $5,200
New annual salary = $104,000 + $

- The award also includes a 5% raise in his salary.
- John makes $2,000 per week.
- The award was given on the first day of the year.

Step 1: Calculate John's original annual salary.
John's original weekly salary = $2,000
John's original annual salary = $2,000 × 52 weeks = $104,000

Step 2: Calculate the new annual salary after the 5% raise.
New annual salary = Original annual salary + (Original annual salary × 0.05)
New annual salary = $104,000 + ($104,000 × 0.05)
New annual salary = $104,000 + $5,200 = $109,200

Step 3: Calculate the total income for the year, including the one-time monetary reward.
Total income for the year = New annual salary + One-time monetary reward
Total income for the year = $109,200 + $5
