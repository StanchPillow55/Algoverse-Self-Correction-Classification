Question:
While working at the restaurant, each of the forty customers who came into the restaurant gave Rafaela a $20 tip. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. How much money did Julieta and Rafaela receive as tips altogether?


Reference Answer:
The total amount of money that Rafaela received as tips from the forty customers is 40*$20 = $<<40*20=800>>800
Julieta got 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, a total of 10/100*$800 = $<<10/100*800=80>>80
The total amount of money that Julieta received as tips is $800-$80 = $<<800-80=720>>720
Altogether, Julieta, and Rafaela received $720+$800 = $<<720+800=1520>>1520
#### 1520

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 40 customers came into the restaurant
- Each customer gave Rafaela a $20 tip
- Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received.
Total tips for Rafaela = Number of customers × Tip per customer
Total tips for Rafaela = 40 × $20 = $800

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of tips Julieta received.
Julieta's tips = Rafaela's tips - 10% of Rafaela's tips
Julieta's tips = $800 - (0.10 × $800) = $800 - $80 = $720

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela and Julieta received altogether.
Total tips = Rafaela's tips + Julieta's tips
Total tips = $800 + $720 = $1,520

Therefore, Julieta and Rafaela
