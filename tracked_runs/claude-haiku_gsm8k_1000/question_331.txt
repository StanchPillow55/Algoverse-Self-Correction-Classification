Question:
Benny saw a 10-foot shark with 2 6-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?


Reference Answer:
First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 6 inches/remora * 2 remoras = <<6*2=12>>12 inches
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1=1>>1 foot
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1 foot / 10 feet * 100% = 10%

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the combined length of the remoras and then calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras represent.

Given information:
- The shark's body length is 10 feet.
- Each remora is 6 inches long.

Step 1: Convert the shark's body length from feet to inches.
10 feet × 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

Step 2: Calculate the combined length of the two remoras.
Length of one remora = 6 inches
Combined length of two remoras = 2 × 6 inches = 12 inches

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents.
Percentage = (Combined length of remoras / Shark's body length) × 100
Percentage = (12 inches / 120 inches) × 100
Percentage = 0.1 × 100
Percentage = 10%

Therefore, the combined length of the two remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

Final answer: The combined length of the two remoras is

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The shark is 10 feet long.
- There are 2 remoras, each 6 inches long.

Step 1: Convert the shark's length from feet to inches.
10 feet × 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

Step 2: Calculate the combined length of the two remoras.
2 remoras × 6 inches each = 12 inches

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined remora length represents.
Percentage = (Combined remora length / Shark's body length) × 100
Percentage = (12 inches / 120 inches) × 100
Percentage = 0.1 × 100
Percentage = 10%

Therefore, the combined length of the two remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

Final answer: The combined length of the two remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- The shark's body length is 10 feet.
- There are 2 remoras attached to the shark, each with a length of 6 inches.

Step 1: Convert the shark's body length from feet to inches.
10 feet × 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

Step 2: Calculate the combined length of the two remoras.
Length of one remora = 6 inches
Combined length of two remoras = 2 × 6 inches = 12 inches

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents.
Percentage = (Combined length of remoras / Shark's body length) × 100
Percentage = (12 inches / 120 inches) × 100
Percentage = 0.1 × 100
Percentage = 10%

Therefore, the combined length of the two remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

Final answer: The combined length of the two remoras is 10% of the shark
