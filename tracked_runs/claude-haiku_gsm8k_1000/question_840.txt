Question:
On a particular week, a tow truck pulled ten cars for each of the first three days and then four fewer cars on each of the remaining days of the week. Calculate the total number of cars it towed that week.


Reference Answer:
On the first three days, towing ten cars a day, the tow truck pulled 3*10 = <<3*10=30>>30 cars.
It pulled four fewer cars each day, which is 10-4 = <<10-4=6>>6 cars on the remaining days.
If it pulled ten cars for three days and four less on the remaining days, then it pulled for 7-3 = 4 days, four cars less each day.
For the four days, the car pulled 6*4= <<6*4=24>>24 cars.
The total number of cars it pulled that week is 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 cars.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- The tow truck pulled 10 cars for each of the first three days.
- The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars on each of the remaining days of the week.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days.
Number of cars towed on the first three days = 10 cars × 3 days = 30 cars

Step 2: Calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining days of the week.
Assuming the week has 7 days, the remaining days would be 4 days.
Number of cars towed on each of the remaining 4 days = 10 cars - 4 cars = 6 cars
Total number of cars towed on the remaining 4 days = 6 cars × 4 days = 24 cars

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cars towed that week.
Total number of cars towed = Number of cars towed on the first three days + Number of cars towed on the remaining days

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The tow truck pulled 10 cars for each of the first three days.
- The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars on each of the remaining days of the week.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days.
Number of cars towed on each of the first three days = 10
Total number of cars towed on the first three days = 10 × 3 = 30 cars

Step 2: Determine the number of remaining days in the week.
There are 7 days in a week, and the first three days have already been accounted for.
Number of remaining days = 7 - 3 = 4 days

Step 3: Calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining days.
Number of cars towed on each of the remaining days = 10 - 4 = 6 cars
Total number of cars towed on the remaining days = 6 × 4 = 24 cars

Step 4: Calculate the total number of cars towed that week

Step 2: Determine the number of remaining days in the week.
There are 7 days in a week, and the first 3 days have been accounted for.
Number of remaining days = 7 - 3 = 4 days

Step 3: Calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining 4 days.
Number of cars towed on each of the remaining 4 days = 10 - 4 = 6 cars
Total number of cars towed on the remaining 4 days = 6 × 4 = 24 cars
