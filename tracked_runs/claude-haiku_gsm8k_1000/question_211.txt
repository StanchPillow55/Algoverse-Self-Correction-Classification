Question ID: 128

Question:
Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost. Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. What's the total amount of money he will spend if each pepper costs 15$?


Reference Answer:
A watermelon costs three times what pepper costs, which is 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
An orange price is 45 - 5= $<<45-5=40>>40.
Dillon buys four watermelons at a total cost of 45 * 4 = $<<45*4=180>>180.
He also purchases peppers at a total price of 20 * 15 = $<<20*15=300>>300.
The oranges cost him a total of 10 * 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
He used a total of 400 + 300 + 180 = $<<400+300+180=880>>880.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
- An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
- Each pepper costs $15.
- Dillon needs to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.

Step 1: Find the cost of a watermelon.
Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, we can calculate the cost of a watermelon as follows:
Cost of a watermelon = 3 × Cost of a pepper
Cost of a watermelon = 3 × $15 = $45

Step 2: Find the cost of an orange.
An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so we can calculate the cost of an orange as follows:
Cost of an orange = Cost of a watermelon - $5
Cost of an orange = $45 - $5 = $40

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the items Dillon needs to buy.
Total cost = (Cost of

Step 2: Find the cost of an orange.
An orange costs $5 less than what a watermelon costs, so:
Cost of an orange = $45 - $5 = $40

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the items.
Total cost = (4 watermelons × $45) + (20 peppers × $15) + (10 oranges × $40)
Total cost = $180 + $300 + $400
