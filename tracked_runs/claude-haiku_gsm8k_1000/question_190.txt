Question ID: 491

Question:
Jaime places eggs on the tray. Each tray can hold 24 eggs. If he has 64 eggs and 2 trays, how many eggs won't he be able to place on the tray?


Reference Answer:
Jaime will be able to place a total of 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48.
Therefore, there are 64 - 48 = <<64-48=16>>16 eggs that he won't be able to place on the tray.
#### 16

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each tray can hold 24 eggs.
- Jaime has 64 eggs.
- Jaime has 2 trays.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the 2 trays.
Total capacity of the 2 trays = 2 Ã— 24 = 48 eggs

Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs that won't be able to be placed on the trays.
Number of eggs that won't be placed on the trays = Total eggs - Total capacity of the trays
Number of eggs that won't be placed on the trays = 64 - 48 = 16 eggs

Therefore, 16 eggs won't be able to be placed on the trays.

Final answer: 16 eggs won't be able to be placed on the trays.
