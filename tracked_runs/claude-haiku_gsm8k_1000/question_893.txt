Question ID: 198

Question:
Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?


Reference Answer:
In the first month, Elaine collected 3*20= <<3*20=60>>60 pokemon cards.
In the second month, she collected 60-20 = <<60-20=40>>40 cards.
After the two months, the new pokemon cards she'd collected is 40+60 = <<40+60=100>>100
The number of cards in the third month is twice the combined number in the first and second month, which totals 2*100 = <<2*100=200>>200 pokemon cards.
In total, Elaine has 20 cards she initially had+100 cards collected in the first and second month +200 cards collected in the third month = <<20+100+200=320>>320 cards

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it.

Given information:
- Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
- After the first month, she collected three times the initial number of cards.
- In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
- In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cards Elaine collected in the first month.
Initial number of cards = 20
Cards collected in the first month = 3 × 20 = 60 cards

Step 2: Calculate the number of cards Elaine collected in the second month.
Cards collected in the second month = Cards collected in the first month - 20
Cards collected in the second month = 60 - 20 = 40 cards

Step 3: Calculate the combined number of cards Elaine collected in the first and second months.
Combined cards collected in the first and second months = 60 + 40 = 100 cards

Step 4: Calculate the number of cards

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initial number of Pokemon cards Elaine had: 20

2. After the first month, she collected three times that number:
   * 3 x 20 = 60 cards

3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month:
   * 60 - 20 = 40 cards

4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months:
   * First month: 60 cards
   * Second month: 40 cards
   * Combined cards from first and second months: 60 + 40 = 100 cards
   * Twice the combined cards: 2 x 100 = 200 cards

5. Total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now:
   * Initial cards: 20
   * First month: 60
   * Second month: 40
   * Third month: 200
   * Total: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards

Therefore, the
