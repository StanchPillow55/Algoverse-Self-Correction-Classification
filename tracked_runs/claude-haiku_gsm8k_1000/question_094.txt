Question ID: 771

Question:
Bennet is a farmer. He sells 20 of his eggplants for $3 each. He has 25 ears of corn that he can sell as well. If Bennet wants to make a total of $135, how much should he sell each ear of corn for?


Reference Answer:
From his eggplants, Bennet makes 20 * $3 = $<<20*3=60>>60
Bennet needs to make $135 - $60 = $<<135-60=75>>75 from the sale of his corn
Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $75 / 25 = $<<75/25=3>>3

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Bennet can make from selling the eggplants and then calculate the price per ear of corn he needs to charge to reach his desired total of $135.

Given information:
- Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each.
- Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell.
- Bennet wants to make a total of $135.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Bennet can make from selling the eggplants.
Total money from eggplants = Number of eggplants × Price per eggplant
Total money from eggplants = 20 × $3 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount of money Bennet needs to make from selling the corn.
Remaining amount needed = Desired total - Total money from eggplants
Remaining amount needed = $135 - $60 = $75

Step 3: Calculate the price per ear of corn Bennet needs to charge to make the remaining $75.
Price per ear of corn = Remaining amount neede

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each.
- Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell.
- Bennet wants to make a total of $135.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggplants.
Revenue from eggplants = 20 eggplants × $3 per eggplant = $60

Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount Bennet needs to make from selling the corn.
Remaining amount needed = Total desired revenue - Revenue from eggplants
Remaining amount needed = $135 - $60 = $75

Step 3: Calculate the price per ear of corn Bennet needs to charge to make the remaining $75.
Price per ear of corn = Remaining amount needed / Number of ears of corn
Price per ear of corn = $75 / 25 ears of corn = $3 per ear of corn

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3 in order to make a total of $135.

Step 3: Calculate the price per ear of corn Bennet needs to charge to make the remaining $75.
Price per ear of corn = Remaining amount needed / Number of ears of corn
Price per ear of corn = $75 / 25 ears = $3 per ear of corn

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3 to make a total of $135.
