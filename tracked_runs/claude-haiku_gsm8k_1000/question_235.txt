Question ID: 1286

Question:
James likes to check the coin return of the vending machine for change. One day he finds a quarter, two nickels, and 7 dimes. How much money in cents does James have?


Reference Answer:
First figure out how much the nickels are worth: 2 * 5 cents = <<2*5=10>>10 cents
Then figure out how much the dimes are worth: 7 * 10 cents = <<7*10=70>>70 cents
Finally, add the value of the nickels, dimes and quarter: 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = <<25+10+70=105>>105 cents
#### 105

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- James found a quarter, two nickels, and 7 dimes in the coin return of the vending machine.

To find the total amount of money in cents, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the value of the quarter.
1 quarter = 25 cents

Step 2: Calculate the value of the two nickels.
2 nickels = 2 × 5 cents = 10 cents

Step 3: Calculate the value of the 7 dimes.
7 dimes = 7 × 10 cents = 70 cents

Step 4: Add the values of all the coins together.
Total value = Value of quarter + Value of nickels + Value of dimes
Total value = 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents
Total value = 105 cents

Therefore, James has 105 cents in the coin return of the vending machine.

Final answer: James has 105 cents.
