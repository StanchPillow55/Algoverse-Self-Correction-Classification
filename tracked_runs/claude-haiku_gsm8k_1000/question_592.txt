Question ID: 548

Question:
Mark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month. If his final weight was 70 pounds, what was his initial weight?


Reference Answer:
Since Mark was losing 10 pounds each month, in 3 months he lost 10 * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 pounds.
Adding the weight lost to the final weight gives an initial weight of 70 + 30 = <<70+30=100>>100 pounds.
Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find Mark's initial weight before he lost weight due to being unwell.

Given information:
- Mark was unwell for 3 months.
- He lost 10 pounds per month during this period.
- His final weight was 70 pounds.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight loss during the 3-month period.
Weight loss per month × Number of months = Total weight loss
10 pounds × 3 months = 30 pounds

Step 2: Calculate Mark's initial weight.
Final weight + Total weight loss = Initial weight
70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds

Therefore, Mark's initial weight before he lost weight due to being unwell was 100 pounds.

Final answer: Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.
