Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the average cost of each pair of shoes that James buys.

Given information:
- James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month.
- He spends $2640 on shoes each year.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
Number of pairs of shoes per month × Number of months in a year = Total number of pairs of shoes per year
2 pairs × 12 months = 24 pairs of shoes

Step 2: Calculate the average cost of each pair of shoes.
Total amount spent on shoes per year / Total number of pairs of shoes per year = Average cost per pair of shoes
$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair of shoes

Therefore, James pays an average of $110 for each pair of shoes.

Final answer: The average cost of each pair of shoes that James buys is $110.
