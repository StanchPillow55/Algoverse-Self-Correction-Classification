Question ID: 1234

Question:
Regina wrote 9 novels last year. If this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, how many novels has she written this year?


Reference Answer:
Number of novels she wrote last year = (3/4)*number of novels she wrote this year
9 = (3/4)*number of novels she wrote this year
Multiplying both sides by 4/3 gives the number of novels she has written this year = (4/3)*9 = <<4/3*9=12>>12 novels
#### 12


=== Turn 1 ===


Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of novels Regina has written this year.

Given information:
- Regina wrote 9 novels last year.
- The 9 novels written last year is 3/4 of the number of novels she has written this year.

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of novels written last year and this year.
Let x = the number of novels Regina has written this year.
Then, 9 = 3/4 × x

Step 2: Solve the equation for x.
9 = 3/4 × x
x = 9 / (3/4)
x = 9 × (4/3)
x = 12

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

Final answer: Regina has written 12 novels this year.
