Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of punches Joe threw during the entire fight.

Given information:
- Joe throws 25 punches per minute on average.
- The fight lasts 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes long.

Step 1: Calculate the total duration of the fight.
Total duration of the fight = Number of rounds × Duration of each round
Total duration of the fight = 5 rounds × 3 minutes per round = 15 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of punches Joe threw during the fight.
Total number of punches = Average punches per minute × Total duration of the fight
Total number of punches = 25 punches per minute × 15 minutes = 375 punches

Therefore, Joe threw a total of 375 punches during the fight.

Final answer: Joe threw 375 punches during the fight.
