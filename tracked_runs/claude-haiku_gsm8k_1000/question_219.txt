Question ID: 186

Question:
Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?


Reference Answer:
In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.
Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.
This means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of rats in each cage.

Given information:
- The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
- Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
- 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.
- A total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of straw used for the hamsters.
Number of hamster cages × Pieces of straw per hamster = Total pieces of straw for hamsters
10 × 5 = 50 pieces of straw

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pieces of straw used for the rabbits.
20 pieces of straw

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pieces of straw used for the rats.
Total pieces of straw distributed among small rodents - Pieces of straw for hamsters - Pieces of straw for rabbits = Pieces of straw

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups
- Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw
- 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits
- 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of straw used for the rats.
Total pieces of straw for rats = Number of rats × 6 pieces per rat
Let's call the number of rats in each cage 'x'.
Total pieces of straw for rats = 3 × x × 6 = 18x

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pieces of straw used for the hamsters.
Total pieces of straw for hamsters = Number of hamsters × 5 pieces per hamster
Number of hamsters = 10 cages
Total pieces of straw for hamsters = 10 × 5 = 50

Step 3:

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 3 cages of rats, with equal groups of rats in each cage.
- Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, each with one hamster.
- Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
- There is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed.
- A total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents.

To find the number of rats in each cage, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of pieces of straw used for the rats.
2. Calculate the total number of pieces of straw used for the hamsters.
3. Subtract the total straw used for rats and hamsters from the total 160 pieces to get the straw used for the rabbits.
4. Divide the total straw used for the rats by the number of rats to get the number of rats in each cage.
