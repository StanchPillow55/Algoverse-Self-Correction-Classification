Question:
Lloyd has an egg farm. His chickens produce 252 eggs per day and he sells them for $2 per dozen. How much does Lloyd make on eggs per week?


Reference Answer:
In a week, Lloyd's egg farm produces 252 x 7 = <<252*7=1764>>1764 eggs.
There are 1764/12 = <<1764/12=147>>147 dozens of eggs produced in a week.
So, Lloyd makes 147 x $2 = $<<147*2=294>>294 on eggs.
#### 294

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of eggs produced per week and then calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

Given information:
- Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.
- Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs produced per week.
Eggs produced per day × Number of days in a week = Total eggs produced per week
252 eggs per day × 7 days = 1,764 eggs per week

Step 2: Convert the total number of eggs to dozens.
Total eggs produced per week / 12 eggs per dozen = Total dozens of eggs per week
1,764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozens of eggs per week

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.
Total dozens of eggs per week × Price per dozen = Total revenue per week
147 dozens of eggs per week × $2 per dozen = $294 per week

Therefore, Lloyd makes $294 per week on eggs.

Final answer: Lloyd makes $294 per week on eggs.
