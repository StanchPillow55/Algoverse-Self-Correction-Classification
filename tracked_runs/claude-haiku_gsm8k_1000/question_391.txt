Question ID: 203

Question:
Carl’s favorite food is cheese. He ate a sandwich every day this week for lunch and used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it. How many slices of cheese did he use?


Reference Answer:
His 2-slice sandwiches used 2 * 7 = <<2*7=14>>14 slices of cheese for all 7 days of the week.
His cheese and egg omelets used one more slice than his sandwiches, so they used 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 slices of cheese each.
He made 3 omelets, so they used 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 slices of cheese.
Carl’s sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni used 14 + 9 + 8 = <<14+9+8=31>>31 slices of cheese in all.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices of cheese used by Carl throughout the week.

Given information:
- Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
- Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich.
- Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese in it.

Step 1: Calculate the number of slices of cheese used for the sandwiches.
Number of sandwiches per week = 7 (one per day)
Slices of cheese per sandwich = 2
Slices of cheese used for sandwiches = 7 × 2 = 14 slices

Step 2: Calculate the number of slices of cheese used for the omelets.
Number of omelets per week = 3 (3 days)
Slices of cheese per omelet = 2 + 1 = 3 (one more than per sandwich)
Slices of cheese used for ome

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Cheese used for sandwiches:
   * Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch this week, which is 7 days.
   * He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   * So, the total cheese used for sandwiches is:
     * 7 days x 2 slices per sandwich = 14 slices of cheese

2. Cheese used for omelets:
   * Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   * He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, which is 3 slices.
   * So, the total cheese used for omelets is:
     * 3 days x 3 slices per omelet = 9 slices of cheese

3. Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:
   * Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese that lasted him several dinners for the week.
   * He used 8 slices of cheese in the dish.

4. Total cheese used:
