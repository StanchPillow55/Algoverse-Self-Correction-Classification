Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the discounted cost of the grooming service.

Given information:
- The original cost of the grooming service is $100.
- The groomer offers a 30% discount for being a new customer.

Step 1: Calculate the discount amount.
Discount percentage = 30%
Discount amount = Original cost × Discount percentage
Discount amount = $100 × 0.30 = $30

Step 2: Calculate the discounted cost of the grooming service.
Discounted cost = Original cost - Discount amount
Discounted cost = $100 - $30 = $70

Therefore, the cost of the grooming service for John is $70.

Final answer: The grooming cost for John is $70.
