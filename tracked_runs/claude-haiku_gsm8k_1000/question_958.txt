Question:
Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20. This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5 and the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. What was the final value of the number train?


Reference Answer:
If Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20, half the number is 1/2*20=<<20-10=10>>10
The starting value plus half the number is 20+10=<<20+10=30>>30
This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5, giving a total of 30/5 = <<30/5=6>>6
The starting value minus 12 is 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8
The resulting value after dividing by 5 was times by the starting value minus 12, a total of 8*6 = <<8*6=48>>48
#### 48

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
- The starting value plus half the number was divided by 5.
- The resulting value was then multiplied by the starting value minus 12.

Step 1: Find the value of the number train after the first operation.
Starting value + (1/2 × starting value) = 20 + (1/2 × 20) = 20 + 10 = 30
Value after the first operation = 30 ÷ 5 = 6

Step 2: Find the value of the number train after the second operation.
Starting value - 12 = 20 - 12 = 8
Final value = 6 × 8 = 48

Therefore, the final value of the number train is 48.
