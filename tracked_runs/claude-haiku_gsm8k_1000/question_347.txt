Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking.
- We need to find how much she would earn after 12 hours of dog walking.

Step 1: Calculate Ella's hourly rate for dog walking.
Hourly rate = Total earnings / Total hours worked
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Step 2: Calculate the total earnings for 12 hours of dog walking.
Total earnings = Hourly rate × Total hours worked
Total earnings = $11 per hour × 12 hours
Total earnings = $132

Therefore, if Ella continues to walk dogs at the same rate, she would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking.

Final answer: Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking.
