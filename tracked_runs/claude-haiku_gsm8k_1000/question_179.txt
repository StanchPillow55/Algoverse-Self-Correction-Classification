Question:
On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. At the till she got $2 off because she had a voucher. The next day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, but the store also offered a 10% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 20 pomegranates. What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?


Reference Answer:
On Tuesday, the pomegranates cost Clara 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranates = $<<20*20=400>>400
Using the voucher, she paid $400 - $2 = $<<400-2=398>>398
On Wednesday, the pomegranates cost Sheila 20 pomegranates * $30 = $<<20*30=600>>600.
She then got a discount of 10/100 * $600 = $<<10/100*600=60>>60
Sheila ended up paying $600 - $60 = $<<600-60=540>>540
The difference is therefore $540 - $398 = $<<540-398=142>>142

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Tuesday's Purchase:
* Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each
* Total cost before discount: 20 x $20 = $400
* Discount from voucher: $2
* Final price paid on Tuesday: $400 - $2 = $398

Wednesday's Purchase:
* Price per pomegranate increased to $30
* Sheila bought 20 pomegranates
* Total cost before discount: 20 x $30 = $600
* Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 x $600 = $60
* Final price paid on Wednesday: $600 - $60 = $540

Difference between the final prices paid on the two days:
* Final price on Tuesday: $398
* Final price on Wednesday: $540
* Difference: $540 - $398 = $142

Therefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142.
