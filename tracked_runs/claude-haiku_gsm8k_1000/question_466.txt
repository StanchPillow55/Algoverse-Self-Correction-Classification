Question ID: 1242

Question:
Skyler has 100 hats on his hand with the colors red, blue, and white. Half of the hats are red, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, and the rest are white. How many white hats does Skyler have?


Reference Answer:
If half of the hats are red, there are 1/2*100= <<1/2*100=50>>50 red hats.
The remaining number of hats which are not red is 100-50 = <<100-50=50>>50
3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, a total of 3/5*50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30 hats
If the rest of the remaining hats are white, then there are 50-30 = <<50-30=20>>20 white hats.
#### 20

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Skyler has 100 hats in total
- Half of the hats are red
- 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue
- The rest are white

Step 1: Calculate the number of red hats.
Half of 100 hats = 100 / 2 = 50 red hats

Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining hats (non-red hats).
Total hats - Red hats = Remaining hats
100 - 50 = 50 remaining hats

Step 3: Calculate the number of blue hats.
3/5 of the remaining 50 hats = 3/5 Ã— 50 = 30 blue hats

Step 4: Calculate the number of white hats.
Total remaining hats - Blue hats = White hats
50 - 30 = 20 white hats

Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats.
