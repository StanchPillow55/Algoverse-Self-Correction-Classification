Question:
Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal and half as many bananas as Jamal. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. How many fruits are there if Andrea has 52 apples?


Reference Answer:
Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, if Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal has 52-8 = <<52-8=44>>44 apples.
The total number of apples is 44+52 = <<44+52=96>>96
Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44+4 = 48 bananas.
Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which totals 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 bananas.
There are a total of 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 bananas.
Altogether, there are 96 apples + 72 bananas = <<96+72=168>>168 fruits
#### 168

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
- Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
- Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
- Andrea has 52 apples.

Step 1: Find the number of apples Jamal has.
Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can use the following equation:
Andrea's apples = Jamal's apples + 8
52 = Jamal's apples + 8
Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44 apples

Step 2: Find the number of bananas Jamal has.
Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so:
Jamal's bananas = Jamal's apples + 4
Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48 bananas

Step 3: Find the number of bananas Andrea has.
Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal
