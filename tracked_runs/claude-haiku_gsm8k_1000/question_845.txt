Question ID: 712

Question:
Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. How much more candy does Amy have after two weeks?


Reference Answer:
First find the the difference in the number of pieces of candy the two people each per day: 4 pieces/day - 3 pieces/day = <<4-3=1>>1 piece/day
Then find the number of days in 2 weeks: 2 weeks * 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14 days
Then multiply the difference per day by the number of days to find the total difference after 14 days: 1 piece/day * 14 days = <<1*14=14>>14 pieces

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy.
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- We want to find how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

Step 1: Calculate how much candy Ginger has left after two weeks.
Ginger's candy per day = 4 pieces
Ginger's candy in two weeks = 4 pieces/day × 14 days = 56 pieces
Ginger's remaining candy = 100 pieces - 56 pieces = 44 pieces

Step 2: Calculate how much candy Amy has left after two weeks.
Amy's candy per day = 3 pieces
Amy's candy in two weeks = 3 pieces/day × 14 days = 42 pieces
Amy's remaining candy = 100 pieces - 42 pieces = 58 pieces

Step 3: Calculate the difference between Amy's and Ginger's remaining candy.
Difference = Amy's remaining candy -

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy.
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- We need to find how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

Step 1: Calculate how much candy Ginger has left after two weeks.
Ginger's candy after two weeks = 100 - (4 pieces/day × 14 days) = 100 - 56 = 44 pieces

Step 2: Calculate how much candy Amy has left after two weeks.
Amy's candy after two weeks = 100 - (3 pieces/day × 14 days) = 100 - 42 = 58 pieces

Step 3: Calculate the difference between Amy's and Ginger's remaining candy.
Difference = Amy's candy - Ginger's candy = 58 - 44 = 14 pieces

Therefore, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.
