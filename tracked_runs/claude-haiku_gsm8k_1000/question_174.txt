Question ID: 284

Question:
Alani's family decided that the children should write stories of any kind. They were then required to read all of the stories they'd written to the family at the end of the weekend. Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, her brother Braylen wrote 40 stories, and her sister Margot wrote 60 stories. If they each doubled the number of stories they'd written in the first week in the second week, calculate the total number of stories they wrote altogether.


Reference Answer:
In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, and if she doubled the number in the second week, the total number of stories in the second week is 20*2 = <<20*2=40>>40.
In total, Alani had written 40+20 = <<40+20=60>>60 stories in the two weeks.
Braylen also wrote 40 stories in the first week, and on doubling that number in the second week the number became 2*40 =<<40*2=80>>80
His total number of stories in the two weeks is 80+40 = <<80+40=120>>120
Together, Alani and her brother Braylen had written 120+60 = <<120+60=180>>180 stories.
When Margot doubled the number of stories she wrote in the first week in the second week, she wrote 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 stories in the second week.
In total, she wrote 60+120= <<60+120=180>>180 stories.
Altogether, the three siblings wrote 180+180 = <<180+180=360>>360 stories in the two weeks.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.
- Each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the second week.

Step 1: Calculate the number of stories written in the second week.
Alani's stories in the second week = 20 × 2 = 40 stories
Braylen's stories in the second week = 40 × 2 = 80 stories
Margot's stories in the second week = 60 × 2 = 120 stories

Step 2: Calculate the total number of stories written in both weeks.
Total stories written in the first week:
Alani: 20 stories
Braylen: 40 stories
Margot: 60 stories
Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories

Total stories written in the second week:

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.
- Each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the second week.

Step 1: Calculate the number of stories written by each person in the second week.
Alani's stories in the second week = 20 × 2 = 40 stories
Braylen's stories in the second week = 40 × 2 = 80 stories
Margot's stories in the second week = 60 × 2 = 120 stories

Step 2: Calculate the total number of stories written in the first week.
Total stories in the first week = Alani's stories + Braylen's stories + Margot's stories
Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories

Step 3: Calculate the total number of stories written in the second week.
