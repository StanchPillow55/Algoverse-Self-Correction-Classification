Question:
Jack decides to visit a museum 150 miles from home.  He drives 75 mph there and back.  He spends 6 hours at the museum.  How long is he gone from home?


Reference Answer:
He drove a total of 150+150=<<150+150=300>>300 miles
So he drove for 300/75=<<300/75=4>>4 hours
That means he was gone from home for 4+6=<<4+6=10>>10 hours

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Jack spends on the trip, including the time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

Given information:
- The distance to the museum is 150 miles.
- Jack drives 75 mph there and back.
- Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum.
Time to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to drive back home.
Time to drive back home = Distance / Speed
Time to drive back home = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total time spent on the trip.
Total time = Time to drive to the museum + Time spent at the museum + Time to drive back home
Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for a total of 10 hours.

Final answer: Jack is gone from home for
