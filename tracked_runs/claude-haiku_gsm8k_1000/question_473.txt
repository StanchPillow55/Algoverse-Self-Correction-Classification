Question ID: 783

Question:
Bob had 7 fish in his ornamental fish pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. He decided he wanted to get some more, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?


Reference Answer:
Bob started with 7 fish and bought seventeen, so he had 7 + 17 = <<7+17=24>>24 fish.
Let x = the number of white fish.
Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, so 2*x + x = 24 fish
3*x = 24
x = 24/3 = <<24/3=8>>8 white fish.
Bob started with 4 white fish, so he bought 8 - 4 = 4 white fish at the store.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.
- Bob went to the pet store and had the sales assistant dip out 17 more fish.
- After adding the new fish to his pond, Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Step 1: Determine the total number of fish Bob has in his pond after adding the new fish.
Initial number of fish + New fish = Total number of fish
7 + 17 = 24 fish

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the relationship between the orange and white fish.
Let x = number of white fish Bob bought at the store
Then, 2x = number of orange fish Bob bought at the store

Step 3: Write an equation to represent the total number of fish.
Total number of fish = Initial orange fish + New orange fish + Initial white fish + New white fish
24 = 3 + 2x + 4 + x
24 = 3 + 2x + 4 + x
24

- After adding the new fish to his pond, Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Step 1: Determine the total number of fish Bob has in his pond after adding the new fish.
Initial number of fish + New fish = Total number of fish
7 + 17 = 24 fish

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of orange and white fish.
Let x = number of white fish bought at the store
Then, the number of orange fish bought at the store is 17 - x

We know that after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish.
Number of orange fish = 2 Ã— Number of white fish
(3 + 17 - x) = 2x

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.
- Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store.
- After adding the new fish, Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Step 1: Find the total number of fish Bob has after adding the new fish.
Initial fish in pond: 7
New fish bought: 17
Total fish after adding new fish: 7 + 17 = 24

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the relationship between the orange and white fish.
Let x = number of white fish bought
Then, the number of orange fish bought = 2x

Step 3: Write an equation to represent the total number of fish.
Total fish = Initial orange fish + Initial white fish + New orange fish + New white fish
24 = 3 + 4 + 2x + x
24 = 7 + 3x

Step 4: Solve the equation for x.
24 = 7 + 3x
