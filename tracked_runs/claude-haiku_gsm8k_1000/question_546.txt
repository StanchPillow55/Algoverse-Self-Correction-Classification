Question ID: 129

Question:
A hospital sees 500 people a day.  Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.  The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital and the hospital charges the patients $200 an hour.  How much profit does the hospital make from these visits?


Reference Answer:
The hospital sees patients for 500*24=<<500*24=12000>>12000 minutes a day
That means they see patients for 12000/60=<<12000/60=200>>200 hours a day
They profit 200-150=$<<200-150=50>>50 per hour
So they make a profit of 200 hours * $50/hour = $<<200*50=10000>>10000 a day from patient visits

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost for the hospital, and then find the difference between them to determine the profit.

Given information:
- The hospital sees 500 people a day.
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
- The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital.
- The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour.

Step 1: Calculate the total time spent on patient visits per day.
Total time spent on patient visits per day = Number of patients × Average time per patient
Total time spent on patient visits per day = 500 × 24 minutes = 12,000 minutes

Step 2: Convert the total time spent on patient visits from minutes to hours.
Total time spent on patient visits per day in hours = Total time spent on patient visits per day in minutes / 60 minutes per hour
Total time spent on patient visits per day in hours = 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 200 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue for the hospital.
Total revenue = Number of patients × Hospital's charge per hour
Total revenue =

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The hospital sees 500 people a day.
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
- The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital.
- The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour.

Step 1: Calculate the total time spent on patient visits per day.
Total time spent = Number of patients × Average time per patient
Total time spent = 500 × 24 minutes = 12,000 minutes

Step 2: Convert the total time spent from minutes to hours.
Total time spent in hours = Total time spent in minutes / 60 minutes per hour
Total time spent in hours = 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 200 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total cost the hospital pays the doctors.
Total cost to the hospital = Doctors' hourly rate × Total time spent in hours
Total cost to the hospital = $150 per hour × 200 hours = $30,000

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue the hospital receives from the patients.
Total revenue =

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The hospital sees 500 people a day.
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
- The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital.
- The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour.

Step 1: Calculate the total time spent on patient visits per day.
Total time spent = Number of patients × Average time per patient
Total time spent = 500 × (24 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 200 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total cost the hospital pays the doctors.
Cost to the hospital = Doctors' hourly rate × Total time spent
Cost to the hospital = $150 × 200 hours = $30,000

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue the hospital receives from the patients.
Revenue from patients = Hospital's hourly rate × Total time spent
Revenue from patients = $200 × 200 hours = $40,000

Step 4: Calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits.
Profit = Revenue from patients - Cost to the hospital
Profit =
