Question ID: 328

Question:
The cell-phone recharges at the rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes. Now, the phone is at 60% charged. How long will it take to fully charge, in hours?


Reference Answer:
100-60=<<100-60=40>>40 percentage points.
Then 40*3=<<40*3=120>>120 minutes to fully charge.
And 120/60=<<120/60=2>>2 hours.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for the phone to go from 60% charged to 100% charged.

Given information:
- The cell phone recharges at the rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes.
- The phone is currently at 60% charged.

Step 1: Calculate the remaining percentage of charge needed to reach 100%.
Remaining percentage of charge = 100% - 60% = 40%

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to charge the remaining 40%.
Time to charge the remaining 40% = (40 percentage-points Ã— 3 minutes/percentage-point) = 120 minutes

Step 3: Convert the time from minutes to hours.
Time in hours = 120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: It will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.
