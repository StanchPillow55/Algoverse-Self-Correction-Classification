Question ID: 706

Question:
The local firefighters are doing a “fill the boot” fundraiser. Their goal is to raise $6300. After the first 3 hours, they have raised $2100.  For how many hours do they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal, assuming an equal amount raised in every hour?


Reference Answer:
The fireman raise 2100 / 3 = $<<2100/3=700>>700 per hour.
They have to fundraise for 6300 / 700 = <<6300/700=9>>9 hours.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal of $6300, assuming an equal amount is raised in every hour.

Given information:
- The firefighters' goal is to raise $6300.
- After the first 3 hours, they have raised $2100.

Step 1: Calculate the amount raised per hour.
Amount raised in the first 3 hours = $2100
Amount raised per hour = $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour

Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount to be raised.
Remaining amount to be raised = Goal - Amount raised in the first 3 hours
Remaining amount to be raised = $6300 - $2100 = $4200

Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount.
Total hours needed = Remaining amount to be raised / Amount raised per hour
Total hours needed = $4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for a total of 9 hours (3 hours already completed + 6

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The firefighters' goal is to raise $6300.
- After the first 3 hours, they have raised $2100.
- We assume an equal amount is raised in every hour.

Step 1: Calculate the amount raised per hour.
Amount raised in 3 hours = $2100
Amount raised per hour = $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour

Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount to be raised.
Goal amount - Amount raised so far = Remaining amount to be raised
$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Step 3: Calculate the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount.
Remaining amount to be raised / Amount raised per hour = Number of hours needed
$4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for a total of 3 hours (the initial 3 hours) + 6 hours (the remaining hours) = 9 hours to reach their goal of $6300.

Final answer: The firefighters

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The fundraising goal is $6300.
- After the first 3 hours, they have raised $2100.
- Assume an equal amount is raised in every hour.

Step 1: Calculate the amount raised per hour.
Amount raised in 3 hours = $2100
Amount raised per hour = $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour

Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount to be raised.
Remaining amount to be raised = Goal - Amount raised so far
Remaining amount to be raised = $6300 - $2100 = $4200

Step 3: Calculate the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount.
Remaining amount to be raised / Amount raised per hour = Number of hours needed
$4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for a total of 3 hours (the initial 3 hours) + 6 hours (the remaining hours) = 9 hours to reach their goal of $6300.
