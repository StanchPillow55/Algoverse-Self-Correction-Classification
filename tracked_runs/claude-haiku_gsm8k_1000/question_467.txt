Question ID: 950

Question:
Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. How many points did Azibo score?


Reference Answer:
Let B = the number of points Bahati scored
Azibo = B - 20
Dinar = B - 10
B + B -20 + B - 10 = 45
3B - 30 = 45;
3B = 75
B = <<25=25>>25
Azibo = 25 - 20 = <<25-20=5>>5 points
Azibo scored 5 points.
#### 5

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of points scored by Azibo.

Given information:
- The team scored a total of 45 points.
- Bahati scored the most points, which was 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of points scored by Azibo.
- Let x + 10 be the number of points scored by Dinar.
- Let x + 20 be the number of points scored by Bahati.

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the total points scored.
Bahati's points + Azibo's points + Dinar's points = Total points
(x + 20) + x + (x + 10) = 45

Step 2: Simplify the equation.
3x + 30 = 45

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
3x + 30 = 45
3x = 15
x = 5

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

Final answer: Azibo score
