=== Turn 1 ===


Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir eats.
- Amir eats 5 cookies.

Step 1: Find how many cookies Cody eats.
Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, we can multiply Amir's cookies by 3 to find Cody's cookies.
Cody's cookies = Amir's cookies × 3
Cody's cookies = 5 × 3 = 15 cookies

Step 2: Find the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir.
Total cookies eaten = Cody's cookies + Amir's cookies
Total cookies eaten = 15 + 5 = 20 cookies

Therefore, the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir is 20 cookies.

Final answer: Cody and Amir eat a total of 20 cookies together.
