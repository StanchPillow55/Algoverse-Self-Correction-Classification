Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has.
- Ethel has $8.

Step 1: Find how much money Ethel has.
Ethel has $8.

Step 2: Find how much money Jimmy has.
Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has.
Twice the money Ethel has = 2 Ã— $8 = $16
Jimmy has $2 more than $16, so Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Jimmy is having $18.
