Question ID: 291

Question:
4 adults and 8 children are to share 8 packets of chocolate bars. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. If each adult gets 6 chocolate bars and the rest are to be shared equally among the children, how many will each child get?


Reference Answer:
Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars so 8 packets contain a total of 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40 bars
Each adult gets 6 bars so 4 adults will get 6*4 = <<6*4=24>>24 bars in total
There are now 40-24 = <<40-24=16>>16 bars left
16 bars are shared equally among 8 children, so each child will get 16/8 = <<16/8=2>>2 bars

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 4 adults and 8 children.
- There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
- The remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among the children.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of chocolate bars.
Total number of chocolate bars = 8 packets × 5 chocolate bars per packet = 40 chocolate bars

Step 2: Calculate the number of chocolate bars the adults will get.
Number of chocolate bars for the adults = 4 adults × 6 chocolate bars per adult = 24 chocolate bars

Step 3: Calculate the number of chocolate bars remaining for the children.
Number of chocolate bars remaining for the children = Total number of chocolate bars - Number of chocolate bars for the adults
Number of chocolate bars remaining for the children = 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars

Step 4: Calculate the number of chocolate bars each child will get.
Number of chocolate bars per child = Number of chocolate bars remaining for the children

- There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of chocolate bars.
Total number of chocolate bars = 8 packets × 5 chocolate bars per packet = 40 chocolate bars

Step 2: Calculate the number of chocolate bars the adults will get.
Number of chocolate bars for adults = 4 adults × 6 chocolate bars per adult = 24 chocolate bars

Step 3: Calculate the number of chocolate bars remaining for the children.
Number of chocolate bars remaining for children = Total chocolate bars - Chocolate bars for adults
Number of chocolate bars remaining for children = 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars

Step 4: Calculate the number of chocolate bars each child will get.
Number of chocolate bars per child = Chocolate bars remaining for children / Number of children
Number of chocolate bars per child = 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars
