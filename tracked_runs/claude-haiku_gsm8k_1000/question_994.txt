Question:
For his 30th birthday, Elvira chose a new computer with many accessories as a gift. She has a budget of €1500 donated by her whole family and thinks that she will be able to keep a little money to afford a garment. She goes to a computer store and chooses a machine that costs €1090 with a screen, keyboard and mouse. She also takes a scanner for €157, a CD burner worth €74 and a printer for €102. How much money will she have left for her clothing?


Reference Answer:
First, let’s look at the total cost of computer equipment: 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = <<1090+157+74+102=1423>>1423 euros
Let us now calculate what is left for the garment: 1500 - 1423 = <<1500-1423=77>>77 euros

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the computer and accessories, and then subtract it from the total budget to determine the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing.

Given information:
- Elvira's budget is €1500.
- The computer costs €1090 with a screen, keyboard, and mouse.
- The scanner costs €157.
- The CD burner costs €74.
- The printer costs €102.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories.
Cost of computer = €1090
Cost of scanner = €157
Cost of CD burner = €74
Cost of printer = €102
Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing.
Total budget = €1500
Total cost of computer and accessories = €1423
Amount left for clothing = Total budget - Total cost
Amount left for clothing = €1500 - €1423 = €77

Therefore, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.
