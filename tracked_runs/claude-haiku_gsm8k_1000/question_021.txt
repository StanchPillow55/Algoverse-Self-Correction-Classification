Question ID: 51

Question:
Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour.  He is sailing from 1 to 4 PM.  He then travels back at a rate of 6 mph.  How long does it take him to get back?


Reference Answer:
He was travelling at full speed for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours
So he went 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 miles
That means it takes 30/6=<<30/6=5>>5 hours to get back

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Tom travels and then calculate the time it takes him to travel back at a rate of 6 miles per hour.

Given information:
- Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour.
- He is sailing from 1 PM to 4 PM.
- He then travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Tom travels.
Time traveled = 4 PM - 1 PM = 3 hours
Distance traveled = Speed × Time
Distance traveled = 10 miles per hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes Tom to travel back.
Distance traveled back = 30 miles
Speed traveling back = 6 miles per hour
Time taken to travel back = Distance / Speed
Time taken to travel back = 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

Final answer: It takes Tom 5 hours to get back.
