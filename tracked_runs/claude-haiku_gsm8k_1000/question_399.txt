Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- David has $12.48
- David wants to buy 16 bolts
- Each bolt costs $0.03

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 16 bolts.
Cost per bolt = $0.03
Total cost of 16 bolts = 16 Ã— $0.03 = $0.48

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money David has left after paying for the bolts.
David's initial amount = $12.48
Total cost of bolts = $0.48
Amount of money left = $12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after paying for the 16 bolts.

Final answer: David has $12.00 left after paying for the 16 bolts.
