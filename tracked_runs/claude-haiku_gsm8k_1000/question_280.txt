Question:
If every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, how many jellyfish would 5 springs working at the same rate create in 4 hours?


Reference Answer:
Since an hour has 3600 seconds, if every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, it will create 4*3600 = <<4*3600=14400>>14400 jellyfish in four hours.
Five springs working at the same rate will create 14400*5 =<<14400*5=72000>>72000 jellyfish in four hours.
#### 72000

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours.

Given information:
- Every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish.
- There are 5 springs working at the same rate.
- The time period is 4 hours.

Step 1: Convert the time period from hours to seconds.
4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

Step 2: Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours.
Number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours = 14,400 seconds

Step 3: Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours.
Number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours = 5 × 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72,000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

Final answer: 72,000 jellyfish

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Every second, a single bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish.
- There are 5 springs working at the same rate.
- We need to find how many jellyfish would be created in 4 hours.

Step 1: Convert the time from hours to seconds.
4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

Step 2: Calculate the number of jellyfish created by a single spring in 4 hours.
Number of jellyfish created by a single spring in 4 hours = 14,400 seconds

Step 3: Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours.
Number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours = 5 × 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72,000 jellyfish in 4 hours.
