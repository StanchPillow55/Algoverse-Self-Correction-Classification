Question ID: 850

Question:
Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y. How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?


Reference Answer:
There are 55 - 10 = <<55-10=45>>45 goats left in Farm X.
Mr. Smith sold 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 goats from Farm Y.
Thus, 45 - 20 = <<45-20=25>>25 goats are left in Farm Y.
Therefore, there are a total of 45 + 25 = <<45+25=70>>70 goats left in the two farms altogether.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mr. Smith has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.
- He sold 10 goats from Farm X.
- He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X.

Step 1: Calculate the number of goats sold from Farm Y.
Goats sold from Farm Y = 2 × Goats sold from Farm X
Goats sold from Farm Y = 2 × 10 = 20 goats

Step 2: Calculate the number of goats left in Farm X.
Goats left in Farm X = Initial goats in Farm X - Goats sold from Farm X
Goats left in Farm X = 55 - 10 = 45 goats

Step 3: Calculate the number of goats left in Farm Y.
Goats left in Farm Y = Initial goats in Farm Y - Goats sold from Farm Y
Goats left in Farm Y = 45 - 20 = 25 goats

Step

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mr. Smith has two farms: Farm X and Farm Y.
- Farm X has 55 goats.
- Farm Y has 45 goats.
- Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X.
- Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X.

Step 1: Calculate the number of goats sold from Farm Y.
Goats sold from Farm X = 10
Goats sold from Farm Y = 2 × 10 = 20

Step 2: Calculate the number of goats left in each farm.
Goats left in Farm X = 55 - 10 = 45
Goats left in Farm Y = 45 - 20 = 25

Step 3: Calculate the total number of goats left in the two farms.
Total goats left = Goats left in Farm X + Goats left in Farm Y
Total goats left = 45 + 25 = 70

Therefore, there are 70 go
