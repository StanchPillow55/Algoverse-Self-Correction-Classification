Question ID: 809

Question:
Dale is selling butterscotch candies to raise money for his club at school. He doesn't have the candies yet and is instead just taking orders. He started off with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell, but he ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies. Then he ordered 100 more. How many does Dale still need to sell to sell all of his candy?


Reference Answer:
Dale starts off selling 100 butterscotch candies that he ordered, but ends up selling 150, 100 - 150 = <<100-150=-50>>-50 candies.
So Dale orders 100 more candies to make up for the deficit and to sell even more, -50 candies + 100 candies = <<100-50=50>>50 candies Dale has left and still needs to sell.
#### 50

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of butterscotch candies Dale has and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold to determine how many he still needs to sell.

Given information:
- Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies.
- He sold 150 butterscotch candies.
- He then ordered 100 more butterscotch candies.

Step 1: Find the total number of butterscotch candies Dale has.
Total butterscotch candies = Initial order + Additional order
Total butterscotch candies = 100 + 100 = 200 candies

Step 2: Find the number of butterscotch candies Dale has left to sell.
Butterscotch candies left to sell = Total butterscotch candies - Butterscotch candies sold
Butterscotch candies left to sell = 200 - 150 = 50 candies

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

Final answer: Dale still needs to sell 50
