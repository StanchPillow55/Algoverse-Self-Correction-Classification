Question ID: 586

Question:
Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. How many ml of water does she need to drink?


Reference Answer:
First find the total calories burned on aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = <<2*500=1000>>1000 calories
Then add the calories burned running to find the total calories burned: 600 calories + 1000 calories = <<600+1000=1600>>1600 calories
Finally, divide that number by the ratio of calories burned to water drunk to find how many water Hannah needs to drink: 1600 calories * 100 ml/200 calories = <<1600*100/200=800>>800 ml

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour.
- She spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories burned during the aerobics session.
Calories burned during aerobics = 500 calories/hour × 2 hours = 1,000 calories

Step 2: Calculate the total number of calories burned during the running session.
Calories burned during running = 600 calories/hour × 1 hour = 600 calories

Step 3: Calculate the total number of calories burned.
Total calories burned = Calories burned during aerobics + Calories burned during running
Total calories burned = 1,000 calories + 600 calories = 1,600 calories

Step 4: Calculate the amount of water Hannah needs to drink.
Water needed = (Total calories burned / 200 calories) × 100 ml

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Hannah burns 500 calories per hour during aerobics for 2 hours.
   * Calories burned during aerobics = 500 calories/hour x 2 hours = 1,000 calories

2. Hannah burns 600 calories per hour during running for 1 hour.
   * Calories burned during running = 600 calories/hour x 1 hour = 600 calories

3. Total calories burned = Calories burned during aerobics + Calories burned during running
   * Total calories burned = 1,000 calories + 600 calories = 1,600 calories

4. For every 200 calories burned, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water.
   * Water needed = (1,600 calories / 200 calories) x 100 ml = 800 ml

Therefore, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is 800 ml.
