Question ID: 500

Question:
Together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. Lily found 7 more than David. David found half of what Bodhi found. How many insects did Lily find?


Reference Answer:
Let B = the number of insects Bodhi collected
David = B/2
Lily = B/2 + 7
B + B + 7 = 43
2B = <<36=36>>36
B = <<18=18>>18 insects
David = 18/2 = <<18/2=9>>9 insects
Lily = 9 + 7 = <<9+7=16>>16 insects
Lily found <<16=16>>16 insects.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Lily, David, and Bodhi collected a total of 43 insects.
- Lily found 7 more than David.
- David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's start by representing the number of insects found by each person with variables:
- Let x = the number of insects found by Bodhi.
- Let y = the number of insects found by David.
- Let z = the number of insects found by Lily.

Step 1: Find the relationship between the number of insects found by each person.
David found half of what Bodhi found, so:
y = x/2

Lily found 7 more than David, so:
z = y + 7

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the total number of insects collected.
Total insects collected = Bodhi's insects + David's insects + Lily's insects
43 = x + y + z

Step 3: Substitute the expressions for y and z into the equation.
43 = x + (x/2) + (x/2

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Together, Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects.
- Lily found 7 more than David.
- David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of insects Bodhi found.
- Then, David found x/2 insects.
- And Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of insects Lily found.

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can write:
Bodhi's insects + David's insects + Lily's insects = 43
x + (x/2) + (x/2 + 7) = 43

Simplifying the equation:
2x + x + x/2 + 7 = 43
3.5x + 7 = 43
3.5x = 36
x = 10.29 (rounded to two decimal places)

Now, we can calculate the number of insects Lily

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Together, Lily, David, and Bodhi collected a total of 43 insects.
- Lily found 7 more insects than David.
- David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of insects Bodhi found.
- Then, David found x/2 insects.
- And Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43, so we can write an equation:
Bodhi's insects + David's insects + Lily's insects = 43
x + (x/2) + (x/2 + 7) = 43

Simplifying the equation:
2x + x + x/2 + 7 = 43
3.5x + 7 = 43
3.5x = 36
x = 10.29 (rounded to two decimal places)

Since the number of insects must be a whole number, we can round down to 10.
Therefore
