Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find out how much meat Prince can sell in a day and then calculate how many days it will take him to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

Given information:
- Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour he works.
- Prince works 10 hours a day.
- Bill gives Prince a bull that weighs 750 kg.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of meat Prince can sell in a day.
Meat sold per hour × Hours worked per day = Meat sold per day
15 kg × 10 hours = 150 kg

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of meat from Bill's bull.
Weight of the bull = 750 kg

Step 3: Calculate the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull.
Total meat from the bull / Meat sold per day = Number of days
750 kg / 150 kg = 5 days

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

Final answer: It will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.
