Question ID: 1287

Question:
In a family, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters. All sisters are the same age, which is 16. One of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. What is the total age of all these siblings?


Reference Answer:
Three sisters are in total 3 * 16 = <<3*16=48>>48 years old.
The younger brother is only half the age of the older one, which leads us to the older brother being 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 years old.
So all family members in total are 48 + 12 + 24 = <<48+12+24=84>>84 years old.
#### 84

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 2 brothers and 3 sisters in the family.
- All sisters are the same age, which is 16 years old.
- One of the brothers is 12 years old.
- The older brother's age is twice the younger brother's age.

Step 1: Find the age of the older brother.
Since the younger brother is 12 years old, and his age is half the age of the older brother, we can calculate the older brother's age as follows:
Older brother's age = 2 × Younger brother's age
Older brother's age = 2 × 12 = 24 years old

Step 2: Calculate the total age of all the siblings.
Total age of the siblings = Age of the younger brother + Age of the older brother + Age of the 3 sisters
Total age of the siblings = 12 + 24 + (3 × 16) = 12 + 24 + 48 = 84 years old

Therefore, the total age of all the siblings in
