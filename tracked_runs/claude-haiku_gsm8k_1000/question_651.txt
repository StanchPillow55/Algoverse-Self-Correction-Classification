Question ID: 1157

Question:
Carl has a cane that is half as long as he is tall.  Carl is one foot taller than his brother, Ned.  And Ned is two feet shorter than his cousin, Isabel.  If Isabel is 7 feet tall, how long is Carl's cane, in feet?


Reference Answer:
If Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, then Ned is 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 feet tall.
If Carl is one foot taller than Ned, then Carl is 5+1=<<5+1=6>>6 feet tall.
Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, or 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 feet long.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall.
- Carl is 1 foot taller than his brother, Ned.
- Ned is 2 feet shorter than his cousin, Isabel.
- Isabel is 7 feet tall.

Step 1: Find Ned's height.
Isabel's height = 7 feet
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 feet - 2 feet = 5 feet

Step 2: Find Carl's height.
Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 feet + 1 foot = 6 feet

Step 3: Find the length of Carl's cane.
Carl's cane length = 1/2 of Carl's height
Carl's cane length = 1/2 Ã— 6 feet = 3 feet

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet.
