Question ID: 1019

Question:
On a busy Saturday morning, a hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.  24 guests elected an early checkout and 15 elected for a late checkout.  In the afternoon twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.  7 more people checked in after dinner was served.  How many guests does the hotel now have?


Reference Answer:
24 guests checked out early and 15 checked out late so 24+15 = <<24+15=39>>39 guests checked out
The hotel was completely booked with 100 guests and 39 of those guest checked out so now there are 100-39 = <<100-39=61>>61 guests
Twice as many checked in that afternoon than the 15 who opted for a late check out so 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30 guests checked in that afternoon
The hotel was down to 61 guests and 30 checked in that afternoon and an additional 7 checked in after dinner for a total of 61+30+7 = <<61+30+7=98>>98 guests
#### 98

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- The hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.
- 24 guests elected an early checkout.
- 15 guests elected for a late checkout.
- In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
- 7 more people checked in after dinner was served.

Step 1: Calculate the number of guests who checked out early.
Number of guests who checked out early = 24

Step 2: Calculate the number of guests who checked out late.
Number of guests who checked out late = 15

Step 3: Calculate the number of guests who checked in during the afternoon.
Number of guests who checked in during the afternoon = 2 Ã— 15 = 30

Step 4: Calculate the number of guests who checked in after dinner.
Number of guests who checked in after dinner = 7

Step 5: Calculate the total number of guests in the hotel.
Total number of guests = Initial number of guests - Number of guests who checked out early - Number of guests who checked out late + Number of guests

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected an early checkout, so the number of guests is now 100 - 24 = 76.
3. 15 guests elected a late checkout, so the number of guests is now 76 - 15 = 61.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30 people. So the number of guests is now 61 + 30 = 91.
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests.
