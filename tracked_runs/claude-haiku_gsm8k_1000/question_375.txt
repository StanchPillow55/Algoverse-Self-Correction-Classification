Question ID: 459

Question:
A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?


Reference Answer:
The farmer is buying 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pounds of sugar cubes.
He is buying 4 * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 pounds of carrots.
He is buying 42 * 75 = <<42*75=3150>>3150 pounds of hay bales.
He is buying 20 * 65 = <<20*65=1300>>1300 pounds of oat sacks.
The weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = <<2+48+3150+1300=4500>>4500 pounds.
Thus, the farmer needs 4500 / 2250 = <<4500/2250=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed the farmer is buying and then determine how many trips the farm truck needs to make to transport all the feed.

Given information:
- 2 boxes of 1-pound sugar cubes
- 4 bags of 12-pound carrots
- 42 bales of 75-pound hay
- 20 sacks of 65-pound oats

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the sugar cubes.
Weight of sugar cubes = 2 boxes × 1 pound per box = 2 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the carrots.
Weight of carrots = 4 bags × 12 pounds per bag = 48 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the hay.
Weight of hay = 42 bales × 75 pounds per bale = 3,150 pounds

Step 4: Calculate the total weight of the oats.
Weight of oats = 20 sacks × 65 pounds per sack = 1,300 pounds

Step 5: Calculate the total

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Sugar Cubes:
   * The farmer buys 2 boxes of 1-pound sugar cubes
   * Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 x 1 pound = 2 pounds

2. Carrots:
   * The farmer buys 4 bags of 12-pound carrots
   * Total weight of carrots = 4 x 12 pounds = 48 pounds

3. Hay:
   * The farmer buys 42 bales of 75-pound hay
   * Total weight of hay = 42 x 75 pounds = 3,150 pounds

4. Oats:
   * The farmer buys 20 sacks of 65-pound oats
   * Total weight of oats = 20 x 65 pounds = 1,300 pounds

5. Total weight of all feed:
   * Total weight = Sugar Cubes + Carrots + Hay + Oats
   * Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3,150
