Question ID: 729

Question:
At 8:00, 5000 people lined up at a polling station to cast their vote on election day. By midday 2/5 of the people had voted and by 16:00 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. What's the number of those who had not voted by 16:00?


Reference Answer:
If the number of people who turned up to vote was 5000, by midday 2/5*5000 = <<2/5*5000=2000>>2000 had voted.
The number of voters who had not cast their vote is 5000-2000 = <<5000-2000=3000>>3000
By 16:00, the additional number of voters who had cast their vote is 2/3*3000 = <<2/3*3000=2000>>2000
The number of people who had not cast their votes by 16:00 is 3000-2000 = <<3000-2000=1000>>1000 voters.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of people who had voted by midday (12:00).
2. Calculate the number of people who had voted by 16:00.
3. Calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people who had voted by midday (12:00).
* At 8:00, there were 5000 people lined up to vote.
* By midday (12:00), 2/5 of the people had voted.
* To calculate the number of people who had voted by midday, we multiply the total number of people by 2/5:
* 5000 × 2/5 = 2000 people had voted by midday.

Step 2: Calculate the number of people who had voted by 16:00.
* By midday (12:00), 2000 people had voted.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- At 8:00, 5000 people lined up at a polling station.
- By midday (12:00), 2/5 of the people had voted.
- By 16:00 (4:00 PM), 2/3 of the remaining people had voted.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people who had voted by midday (12:00).
2/5 of 5000 people = 2/5 × 5000 = 2000 people

Step 2: Calculate the number of people who had not voted by midday (12:00).
Number of people who had not voted by midday = 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people

Step 3: Calculate the number of people who had voted by 16:00 (4:00 PM).
2/3 of the remaining 3000 people = 2/3 × 3000 = 2000 people

Step 4: Calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. At 8:00, 5000 people lined up to vote.

2. By midday (12:00), 2/5 of the 5000 people had voted.
   * 2/5 of 5000 = 2000 people had voted by 12:00.
   * That means 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people were still waiting to vote.

3. By 16:00 (4:00 PM), 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted.
   * 2/3 of 3000 = 2000 people had voted between 12:00 and 16:00.
   * That means 3000 - 2000 = 1000 people were still waiting to vote.

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000.
