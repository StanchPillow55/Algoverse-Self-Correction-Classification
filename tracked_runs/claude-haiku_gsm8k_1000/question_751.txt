Question ID: 870

Question:
Madeline and her roommate, Keenan, share the cost of groceries. In total, they spend about $400 per month. In a four-week month, how many dollars does Keenan spend per week if Madeline pays 60% of the cost?


Reference Answer:
They spend $400/4=$<<400/4=100>>100 per week.
Keenan pays for 100-60=<<100-60=40>>40% of the groceries.
Thus, she spends $100*(40/100)=$<<100*40/100=40>>40 per week.
#### 40

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Madeline and Keenan spend about $400 per month on groceries.
- Madeline pays 60% of the cost.
- The question is asking for how much Keenan spends per week in a four-week month.

Step 1: Calculate Madeline's monthly contribution.
Madeline's contribution = 60% of $400 = 0.60 Ã— $400 = $240

Step 2: Calculate Keenan's monthly contribution.
Keenan's contribution = Total monthly cost - Madeline's contribution
Keenan's contribution = $400 - $240 = $160

Step 3: Calculate Keenan's weekly contribution.
Keenan's weekly contribution = Keenan's monthly contribution / 4 weeks
Keenan's weekly contribution = $160 / 4 = $40

Therefore, in a four-week month, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries.

Final answer: Keenan spends $40
