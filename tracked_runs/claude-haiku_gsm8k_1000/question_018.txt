Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Juice Box A costs $4
- Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A
- Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A

Step 1: Calculate the cost of Juice Box B.
Juice Box B = Juice Box A + $5
Juice Box B = $4 + $5 = $9

Step 2: Calculate the cost of Juice Box C.
Juice Box C = Juice Box A + $7
Juice Box C = $4 + $7 = $11

Step 3: Calculate the difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B.
Difference = Juice Box C - Juice Box B
Difference = $11 - $9 = $2

Therefore, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B.

Final answer: Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B.
