Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Gerald works at a daycare that pays him $30 every day.
- He worked for an entire week.
- He spent a total of $100.

Step 1: Calculate how much Gerald earned for the week.
Since he worked for an entire week, that means he worked 7 days.
Earnings per day = $30
Earnings for the week = $30 Ã— 7 days = $210

Step 2: Calculate how much money Gerald has left.
Total earnings for the week = $210
Total amount spent = $100
Amount left = Total earnings - Total amount spent
Amount left = $210 - $100 = $110

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left.

Final answer: Gerald has $110 left.
