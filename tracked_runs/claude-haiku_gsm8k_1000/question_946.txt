Question ID: 417

Question:
Tom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day, and over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all. During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?


Reference Answer:
In the first four days, Tom made 4 * 200 = <<4*200=800>>800 kilometers.
For the next two days, he made only 30/100 * 800 = <<30/100*800=240>>240 kilometers.
During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day, which means 7 * 300 = <<7*300=2100>>2100 kilometers during the whole week.
During his whole trip, Tom made 800 + 240 + 2100 = <<800+240+2100=3140>>3140 kilometers.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Tom traveled for 2 weeks (14 days)
- In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day
- Over the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first 4 days
- On the next day, he didn't travel at all
- During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days.
Distance traveled in the first 4 days = 4 days × 200 kilometers/day = 800 kilometers

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the next 2 days.
Distance traveled in the next 2 days = 30% of 800 kilometers = 0.3 × 800 kilometers = 240 kilometers

Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled on the day he didn't travel.
Distance traveled on the day he didn't travel = 0 kilometers

Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled during the second week.
Distance traveled during the second week = 7

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days.
* Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for the first 4 days.
* Total distance traveled in the first 4 days = 200 km x 4 days = 800 km

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the next 2 days.
* Tom traveled 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days.
* 30% of 800 km = 0.3 x 800 km = 240 km

Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled in the first week.
* Total distance traveled in the first week = 800 km + 240 km = 1,040 km

Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the second week.
* Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day for the second week.
* Total distance traveled in the second week = 300 km x 7 days = 2,100 km

Step 5: Calculate the total distance traveled during the two-week-long trip.
* Total distance

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- Tom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe.
- In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day.
- Over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days.
- On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all.
- During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day.

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days.
Distance traveled in the first 4 days = 200 km × 4 days = 800 km

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the next two days.
Distance traveled in the next two days = 30% of 800 km = 0.3 × 800 km = 240 km

Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled in the first week.
Total distance traveled in the first week = Distance traveled in the first 4 days + Distance traveled in the next two days
Total distance traveled in the first week = 800 km +
