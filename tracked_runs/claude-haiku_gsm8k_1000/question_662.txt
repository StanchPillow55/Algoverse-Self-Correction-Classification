Question:
If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, how much would a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?


Reference Answer:
When the price of the bag of marble increase by 20%, the price increases by 20/100*20 = $<<20/100*20=4>>4
If the price increases after every two months, in 36 months, it will increase 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 times.
If each increase is $4, the total amount the price of the bag of marbles will have increased by after 36 months is 18*$4 = $<<18*4=72>>72
After the total increase of the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, the total cost will be $20+$72 = $<<20+72=92>>92

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The initial cost of a bag of marbles is $20.
- The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.
- We need to find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months.

Step 1: Calculate the price increase every two months.
Original price = $20
Price increase = 20% of $20 = 0.20 × $20 = $4

Step 2: Calculate the new price after every two-month period.
Initial price = $20
After 2 months: $20 + $4 = $24
After 4 months: $24 + $4 = $28
After 6 months: $28 + $4 = $32
After 8 months: $32 + $4 = $36
After 10 months: $36 + $4 = $40
After 12 months: $40 + $4 = $44
After 14 months: $44 + $4 = $48

- The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.
- We need to find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months.

Step 1: Calculate the price increase every two months.
Original price: $20
Price increase: 20% of $20 = 0.20 × $20 = $4

Step 2: Calculate the price of the bag of marbles after each two-month interval.
Initial price: $20
After 2 months: $20 + $4 = $24
After 4 months: $24 + $4 = $28
After 6 months: $28 + $4 = $32
After 8 months: $32 + $4 = $36
After 10 months: $36 + $4 = $40
After 12 months: $40 + $4 = $44
After 14 months: $44 + $4
