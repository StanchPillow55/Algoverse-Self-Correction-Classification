Question:
Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kelly’s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?


Reference Answer:
Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.
She therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   * Cost of 1 pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2

2. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, each costing twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   * Cost of 1 packet of chicken = 2 x $2 = $4
   * Total cost of 6 packets of chicken = 6 x $4 = $24

3. Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each costing $4.
   * Total cost of 3 packs of strawberries = 3 x $4 = $12

4. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, each costing half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   * Cost of 1 pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2
   * Total cost of 7 packs of apples = 7 x $2 = $14

5. Now, let's calculate
