Question:
Brenda invested $300 into a scheme that accumulates simple interest at the rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year. How much in total will she have after 3 years?


Reference Answer:
Three-quarters of $300 is (3/4)*$300 = $<<(3/4)*300=225>>225
After 3 years, interest of $225*3 = $<<225*3=675>>675 has been accumulated
She now has a total of $300+$675 = $<<300+675=975>>975
#### 975

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, including the initial investment and the accumulated simple interest.

Given information:
- Brenda invested $300.
- The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year.
- The time period is 3 years.

Step 1: Calculate the simple interest earned each year.
Simple interest = Principal × Interest rate × Time
Simple interest per year = $300 × 0.75 × 1 = $225

Step 2: Calculate the total simple interest earned over 3 years.
Total simple interest = Simple interest per year × Number of years
Total simple interest = $225 × 3 = $675

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years.
Total amount = Initial investment + Total simple interest
Total amount = $300 + $675 = $975

Therefore, Brenda will have a total of $975 after 3 years.

Final answer: Brenda will have a total of $975 after 3 years.
