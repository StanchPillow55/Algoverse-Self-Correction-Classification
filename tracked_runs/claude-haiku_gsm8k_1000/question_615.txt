Question:
A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba. If there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in a snake park, what is half the number of spots they all have combined?


Reference Answer:
A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba, meaning a mamba has 70/2= <<70/2=35>>35 spots.
If there are 40 cobras in a snake park, they all have a total of 70*40 = <<40*70=2800>>2800 spots.
60 mambas in a snake park, each having 35 spots, have 60*35 = <<60*35=2100>>2100 spots total.
Together, all the snakes in the park have 2100+2800=<<2100+2800=4900>>4900 spots.
Half the number of spots they all have combined is 1/2*4900=<<1/2*4900=2450>>2450

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- A cobra has 70 spots.
- A cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba.
- There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in the snake park.

Step 1: Find the number of spots on a mamba.
Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can divide the number of spots on a cobra by 2 to find the number of spots on a mamba.
Number of spots on a mamba = 70 ÷ 2 = 35 spots

Step 2: Find the total number of spots on all the cobras.
Total spots on all cobras = Number of spots on a cobra × Number of cobras
Total spots on all cobras = 70 × 40 = 2,800 spots

Step 3: Find the total number of spots on all the mambas.
Total spots on all mambas = Number of spots on a mamba × Number of mambas
Total spots on all mambas = 35 × 60 =

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that a cobra has 70 spots.
2. We also know that a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba.
   * This means that a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

3. There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in the snake park.
   * The total number of spots on the cobras is 40 * 70 = 2,800 spots.
   * The total number of spots on the mambas is 60 * 35 = 2,100 spots.

4. The total number of spots on all the snakes is the sum of the spots on the cobras and the mambas:
   * 2,800 + 2,100 = 4,900 spots.

5. The question asks for half the number of spots they all have combined.
   * Half of 4,900 is 4,900 / 2 = 2,450 spots.

Therefore, the final answer is 2,450
