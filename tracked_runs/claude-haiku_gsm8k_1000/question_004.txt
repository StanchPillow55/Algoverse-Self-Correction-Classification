Question:
The Science Center hosted field trips Monday through Friday last week. On Monday, 32 classes visited. Twice as many visited on Tuesday and three times as many visited on Wednesday. Another 30 classes visited on Thursday and 25 visited on Friday. In all, how many classes visited the Science Center last week?


Reference Answer:
On Tuesday, 32 classes x 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, 32 classes x 3 = <<32*3=96>>96 classes visited.
In all, last week 32 classes on Monday + 64 on Tuesday + 96 on Wednesday + 30 on Thursday + 25 on Friday = <<32+64+96+30+25=247>>247 classes visited the Science Center last week.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of classes that visited the Science Center each day and then add them up to get the total number of classes that visited last week.

Given information:
- On Monday, 32 classes visited.
- On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited as on Monday.
- On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited as on Monday.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Step 1: Find the number of classes that visited on Tuesday.
Number of classes on Tuesday = 2 × 32 = 64 classes

Step 2: Find the number of classes that visited on Wednesday.
Number of classes on Wednesday = 3 × 32 = 96 classes

Step 3: Find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week.
Total classes visited = Classes on Monday + Classes on Tuesday + Classes on Wednesday + Classes on Thursday + Classes on Friday
Total classes visited = 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247 classes

Therefore, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center
