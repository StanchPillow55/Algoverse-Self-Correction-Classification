Question:
Tim decides to light off some fireworks for the fourth of July.  He buys a package of fireworks worth $400 and another pack worth twice that much.  He gets a 20% discount on them.  He also buys a finale firework that costs $150.  How much did he spend in total?


Reference Answer:
The second package was worth 400*2=$<<400*2=800>>800
So the two packages were worth 400+800=$<<400+800=1200>>1200
That means he got a discount of 1200*.2=$<<1200*.2=240>>240
So the packages cost 1200-240=$<<1200-240=960>>960
So he spent a total of 960+150=$<<960+150=1110>>1110
#### 1110

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Tim buys a package of fireworks worth $400.
2. He also buys another pack worth twice that much, which is $400 x 2 = $800.
3. He gets a 20% discount on both packages of fireworks.
   * The 20% discount on the $400 package is $400 x 0.20 = $80.
   * The 20% discount on the $800 package is $800 x 0.20 = $160.
   * So the total discount is $80 + $160 = $240.
4. The total cost of the two packages of fireworks after the 20% discount is:
   * $400 - $80 = $320
   * $800 - $160 = $640
   * Total = $320 + $640 = $960
5. Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150.
6. To calculate the total amount Tim spent, we add the cost of the two packages of fireworks after the discount ($960) and the

2. He also buys another pack worth twice that much, which is $400 x 2 = $800.
3. He gets a 20% discount on both packages of fireworks.
   * The discount on the $400 package is 20% of $400, which is $80.
   * The discount on the $800 package is 20% of $800, which is $160.
   * So the total discount is $80 + $160 = $240.
4. The total cost of the two packages of fireworks after the discount is:
   * $400 - $80 = $320 for the first package
   * $800 - $160 = $640 for the second package
   * Total cost of the two packages = $320 + $640 = $960
5. Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150.
6. The total amount Tim spent is the cost of the two packages of fireworks ($960) plus the cost of the

1. Tim buys a package of fireworks worth $400.
2. He also buys another pack worth twice that much, which is $400 x 2 = $800.
3. He gets a 20% discount on both packages of fireworks.
   - The discount on the $400 package is $400 x 0.20 = $80.
   - The discount on the $800 package is $800 x 0.20 = $160.
4. So the total cost of the two packages of fireworks after the 20% discount is:
   - $400 - $80 = $320
   - $800 - $160 = $640
   - Total cost of the two packages = $320 + $640 = $960
5. Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150.

To calculate the total amount Tim spent, we add the cost of the two packages of fireworks after the discount and the cost of the finale firework:
Total amount spent = $960 + $150 = $1,110
