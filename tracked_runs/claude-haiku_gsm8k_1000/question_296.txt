Question ID: 355

Question:
There are three trees in Eddy's backyard. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet, and the second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. How tall is the tallest tree?


Reference Answer:
The height of the second tree is 6 + 5 = <<6+5=11>>11 feet.
Thus, the combined height of the two trees is 6 + 11 = <<6+11=17>>17 feet.
Therefore the height of the tallest tree is 2 x 17 = <<2*17=34>>34 feet.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.
- The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree.
- The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined.

Step 1: Find the height of the second tree.
Height of the second tree = Height of the shortest tree + 5 feet
Height of the second tree = 6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet

Step 2: Find the combined height of the two trees.
Combined height of the two trees = Height of the shortest tree + Height of the second tree
Combined height of the two trees = 6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet

Step 3: Find the height of the tallest tree.
Height of the tallest tree = 2 × Combined height of the two trees
Height of the tallest tree = 2 × 17 feet = 34 feet

Therefore, the tallest tree in Eddy's backyard is 34 feet tall.
