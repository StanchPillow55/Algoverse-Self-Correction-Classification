Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of 52 miles.
- Amber ran 8 miles.
- Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran.

Step 1: Find how many miles Micah ran.
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran.
Amber ran 8 miles.
Therefore, Micah ran 3.5 Ã— 8 = 28 miles.

Step 2: Find how many miles Ahito ran.
The total miles run by the three of them is 52 miles.
Amber ran 8 miles, and Micah ran 28 miles.
Therefore, Ahito ran the remaining miles.
Ahito's miles = Total miles - Amber's miles - Micah's miles
Ahito's miles = 52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles.
