Question ID: 814

Question:
A new arcade opens up and Jack decides to play with his 3 friends.  Jack can play a game with 1 quarter for 20 minutes.  Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  One of them is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long.  They play for 4 hours.  How much money is used?


Reference Answer:
Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour
So he spends 3*.25=$<<3*.25=.75>>.75 an hour
His two friends add change 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 times an hour
So they spend 6*.25=$<<6*.25=1.5>>1.5 an hour
His last friend puts in money 3/1.5=<<3/1.5=2>>2 times an hour
So he spends 2*.25=$<<2*.25=.50>>.50 an hour
So in total they spend .75+1.5+.5=$<<.75+1.5+.5=2.75>>2.75 an hour
So they spend 2.75*4=$<<2.75*4=11>>11 in the 4 hours

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total time each person can play and then calculate the total amount of money used.

Given information:
- Jack can play a game with 1 quarter for 20 minutes.
- Two of his friends can only play half as long as Jack.
- One of his friends can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack.
- They play for 4 hours (240 minutes).

Step 1: Calculate the time each person can play.
Jack's playing time = 20 minutes per quarter
Two friends' playing time = 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter
One friend's playing time = 20 minutes Ã— 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter

Step 2: Calculate the total number of quarters used by each person.
Jack's quarters used = 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
Two friends' quarters used = 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters each
One friend's quarters used = 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters
