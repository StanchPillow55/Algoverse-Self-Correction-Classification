Question:
Dylan attended a wedding where there were 100 guests in the reception. Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door as a thank you for helping in the wedding reception. If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, how many people were in the church next door?


Reference Answer:
If each of the 100 guests brought a plate of 15 cookies, then the total number of cookies brought is 100*15 = <<100*15=1500>>1500 cookies.
If the next church was given 1/2 the number of cookies, then they got 1/2*1500 = <<1/2*1500=750>>750 cookies.
If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, then there were 750/15 = <<750/15=50>>50 people.
#### 50

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There were 100 guests at the wedding reception.
- Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.
- The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door.
- Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies brought to the wedding reception.
Total cookies = Number of guests × Cookies per guest
Total cookies = 100 × 15 = 1,500 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies given to the church next door.
Cookies given to the church = 1/2 of the total cookies
Cookies given to the church = 1/2 × 1,500 = 750 cookies

Step 3: Calculate the number of people in the church next door.
Number of people in the church = Cookies given to the church / Cookies per person
Number of people in the church = 750 / 15 = 50 people

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is 50.
