Question:
Baldur gets water from a well. He gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. If each pail contains 5 liters of water, how many liters of water does he get every day?


Reference Answer:
Baldur gets 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 liters of water in the morning.
He gets 6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 liters of water in the afternoon.
Therefore, the total liters of water he gets every day is 30 + 25 = <<30+25=55>>55.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning.
- Baldur gets 6 pails of water every afternoon.
- Each pail contains 5 liters of water.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pails of water Baldur gets every day.
Morning pails of water + Afternoon pails of water = Total pails of water per day
5 pails + 6 pails = 11 pails

Step 2: Calculate the total liters of water Baldur gets every day.
Total pails of water per day × Liters per pail = Total liters of water per day
11 pails × 5 liters per pail = 55 liters

Therefore, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.

Final answer: Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.
