Question:
Zoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest. Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. They each get one watermelon. Zoey's has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?


Reference Answer:
Zoey spits a total distance of 400 feet because 40 x 10 = <<40*10=400>>400
Sydney spits a total distance of 420 feet because 35 x 12 = <<35*12=420>>420
This totals to 820 feet because 400 + 420 = <<400+420=820>>820
The average total distance is 410 because 820 / 2 = <<820/2=410>>410

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance spat by each person and then calculate the average of the total distances.

Given information:
- Zoey's watermelon has 40 seeds, and she spits each one 10 feet.
- Sydney's watermelon has 35 seeds, and she spits each one 12 feet.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance spat by Zoey.
Zoey's total distance = Number of seeds × Distance per seed
Zoey's total distance = 40 × 10 feet = 400 feet

Step 2: Calculate the total distance spat by Sydney.
Sydney's total distance = Number of seeds × Distance per seed
Sydney's total distance = 35 × 12 feet = 420 feet

Step 3: Calculate the average total distance spat.
Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
Average total distance = (400 feet + 420 feet) / 2 = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

Therefore, the average total distance spat is

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Zoey has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet.
- Sydney has 35 seeds and she spits each one 12 feet.

Step 1: Calculate Zoey's total distance spat.
Zoey's total distance = Number of seeds × Distance per seed
Zoey's total distance = 40 × 10 feet = 400 feet

Step 2: Calculate Sydney's total distance spat.
Sydney's total distance = Number of seeds × Distance per seed
Sydney's total distance = 35 × 12 feet = 420 feet

Step 3: Calculate the total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney.
Total distance spat = Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance
Total distance spat = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

Step 4: Calculate the average total distance spat.
Average total distance = Total distance spat / (Number of participants)
Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet
