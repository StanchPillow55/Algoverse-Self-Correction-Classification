Question:
Jamaal is at the gym. He has been using an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight that he uses by 50%. It turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. What is the weight, in pounds, that he now uses?


Reference Answer:
An increase of 50% of 8 is 1.5*8=12.
He switches to a 12-2=<<12-2=10>>10 pound weight.
#### 10


=== Turn 1 ===


Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Jamaal is initially using an 8-pound weight.

2. He increases the weight by 50%. To calculate the new weight:
   * 50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 Ã— 8 = 4 pounds
   * New weight = 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds

3. The 12-pound weight is too heavy, so he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter.
   * Weight that he now uses = 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds

Therefore, the weight that Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

Final answer: 10 pounds
