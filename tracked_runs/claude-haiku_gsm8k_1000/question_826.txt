Question ID: 567

Question:
The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 in exchange for the first tooth Sharon lost.  Then, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 for each of the next three teeth Sharon lost.  And for each of the last 2 teeth Sharon lost, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth.  How much money did the tooth fairy leave Sharon, in dollars?


Reference Answer:
She got $1.00 on three teeth so she got 1*3 = $<<1*3=3.00>>3.00
On the next two, she got 1/2 the amount of $1.00 so she received 1*.5 = $<<1*.5=0.50>>0.50
She received $0.50 on 2 teeth so she received .50*2 = $<<.50*2=1.00>>1.00
When you add her first tooth that was $5.00, $3.00 for the next 3 and $1.00 on the next 2 she made 5+3+1 = $<<5+3+1=9.00>>9.00

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth she lost.
- The tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 for each of the next three teeth she lost.
- For each of the last 2 teeth Sharon lost, the tooth fairy gave her half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money the tooth fairy gave Sharon for the first tooth.
Amount for the first tooth = $5.00

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money the tooth fairy gave Sharon for the next three teeth.
Amount for each of the next three teeth = $1.00
Total amount for the next three teeth = 3 × $1.00 = $3.00

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money the tooth fairy gave Sharon for the last two teeth.
Amount for each of the last two teeth = $1.00 ÷ 2 = $0.50
Total amount for the last two teeth = 2 × $0.50 = $1.00

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.

2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 per tooth.
   * 3 teeth x $1.00 per tooth = $3.00

3. For the last 2 teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount per tooth as the previous 3 teeth.
   * Previous 3 teeth: $1.00 per tooth
   * Last 2 teeth: $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth
   * 2 teeth x $0.50 per tooth = $1.00

4. Adding up the total:
   * First tooth: $5.00
   * Next 3 teeth: $3.00
   * Last 2 teeth: $1.00
   * Total: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

Therefore, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is $9.00.
