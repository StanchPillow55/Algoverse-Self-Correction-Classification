Question:
Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. While Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin. How many fish were they able to catch?


Reference Answer:
Locsin caught 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 starfishes.
They caught 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 starfishes.
Locsin caught 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 seahorses
They caught 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 seahorses
Locsin caught 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 clownfish.
So, they caught 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 clownfish.
Therefore, Anakin and Locsin were able to catch a total of 15 + 9 + 8 = <<15+9+8=32>>32 fish.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin.

Given information:
- Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fish caught by Anakin.
Anakin's catch:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish

Step 2: Calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin.
Locsin's catch:
- Starfish: 10 - 5 = 5
- Sea horses: 6 - 3 = 3
- Clownfish: 3 + 2 = 5
Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 +

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Anakin caught:
  - 10 starfish
  - 6 sea horses
  - 3 clownfish
- Locsin caught:
  - 5 fewer starfish than Anakin
  - 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin
  - 2 more clownfish than Anakin

Step 1: Calculate the number of starfish Locsin caught.
Anakin caught 10 starfish, and Locsin caught 5 fewer.
Locsin's starfish = 10 - 5 = 5 starfish

Step 2: Calculate the number of sea horses Locsin caught.
Anakin caught 6 sea horses, and Locsin caught 3 fewer.
Locsin's sea horses = 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses 

Step 3: Calculate the number of clownfish Locsin caught.
Anakin caught 3 clownfish, and Locsin caught 2 more.

Step 1: Calculate the number of starfish Locsin caught.
Anakin caught 10 starfish, and Locsin caught 5 fewer, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Step 2: Calculate the number of sea horses Locsin caught.
Anakin caught 6 sea horses, and Locsin caught 3 fewer, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Step 3: Calculate the number of clownfish Locsin caught.
Anakin caught 3 clownfish, and Locsin caught 2 more, so Locsin caught 3
