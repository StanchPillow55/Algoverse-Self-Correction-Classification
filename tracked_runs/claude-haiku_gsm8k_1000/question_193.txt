Question:
The amount of water passing through a river at one point in time is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles at the same point. If the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases by 6000 gallons on the third day, calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point.


Reference Answer:
After a day of rain, the volume of water in the river passing at one point in time doubled to 2*4000 = <<2*4000=8000>>8000 gallons.
After more heavy rains, the volume of water passing through the river on the third day is 8000+6000 = <<8000+6000=14000>>14000 gallons.
#### 14000

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the second day.
2. Calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day.
3. Add the amounts of water from all three days to get the total amount of water passing through the river.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the second day.
* On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river was 4000 gallons.
* On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubled, so it was 4000 gallons × 2 = 8000 gallons.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day.
* On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increased by 6000 gallons.
* The amount of water passing through the river on the third day was 8000 gallons + 6000 gallons = 14000 gallons.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water passing through the river.
* Total amount of water = Amount on first day

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.
- On the second day, after a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles.
- On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the second day.
Amount of water on the second day = 4000 gallons × 2 = 8000 gallons

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day.
Amount of water on the third day = Amount of water on the second day + 6000 gallons
Amount of water on the third day = 8000 gallons + 6000 gallons = 14000 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water passing through the river.
Total amount of water = Amount of water on the first day + Amount of water on the second day + Amount of water on the third day
Total amount of water

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day.
Amount of water on the third day = Amount of water on the second day + 6000 gallons
Amount of water on the third day = 8000 gallons + 6000 gallons = 14000 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water passing through the river.
Total amount of water = Amount of water on the first day + Amount of water on the second day + Amount of water on the third day
Total amount of water
