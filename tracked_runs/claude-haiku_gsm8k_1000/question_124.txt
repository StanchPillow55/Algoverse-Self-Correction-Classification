Question ID: 135

Question:
Brian's friend Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does.  If Brian has 20 video games but lost 5 right before the comparison was made, how many does Bobby have?


Reference Answer:
If Brian previously had 20 video games but lost 5, that means he now has 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 video games
Brian has 15 video games, so if Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many as Brian does we must first perform 15*3=45
We then subtract 5 from the previous total for 45-5=40 games in total.
#### 40

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Brian has 20 video games, but lost 5 right before the comparison was made.
- Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian.

Step 1: Find the number of video games Brian had before he lost 5.
Brian's original number of video games = 20 + 5 = 25 video games

Step 2: Find 3 times the number of video games Brian had.
3 times Brian's original number of video games = 3 Ã— 25 = 75 video games

Step 3: Find the number of video games Bobby has.
Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian.
Bobby's number of video games = 75 - 5 = 70 video games

Therefore, Bobby has 70 video games.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Brian has 20 video games, but lost 5 right before the comparison was made. So, the number of video games Brian has is 20 - 5 = 15.

2. The question states that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. 
   * This means that Bobby's video games = (3 x Brian's video games) - 5
   * Plugging in the value for Brian's video games, we get:
   * Bobby's video games = (3 x 15) - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40

Therefore, the final answer is that Bobby has 40 video games.
