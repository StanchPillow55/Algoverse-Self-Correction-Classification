Question ID: 92

Question:
Emily has 4 kids named Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. If James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey, how old is Jackson?


Reference Answer:
James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = <<10+1=11>>11 years old
Amy is 2 years younger than Corey so is 11 - 2 = 9 years old
Amy is also 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = <<9-5=4>>4 years old

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Emily has 4 kids: Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James.
- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
- Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
- James is 10 years old.
- James is 1 year younger than Corey.

Step 1: Find Corey's age.
Since James is 1 year younger than Corey, and James is 10 years old, we can calculate Corey's age.
Corey's age = James' age + 1
Corey's age = 10 + 1 = 11 years old

Step 2: Find Amy's age.
Since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, and Corey is 11 years old, we can calculate Amy's age.
Amy's age = Corey's age - 2
Amy's age = 11 - 2 = 9 years old

Step 3: Find Jackson's age.
Since Amy is 5 years
