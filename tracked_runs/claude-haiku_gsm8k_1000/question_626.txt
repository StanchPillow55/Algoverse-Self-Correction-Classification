Question ID: 170

Question:
The marching band is ordering new uniforms. Each uniform comes with a hat that costs $25, a jacket that costs three times as much as the hat, and pants that cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. How much does each uniform cost total?


Reference Answer:
First find the cost of the jacket: $25 * 3 = $<<25*3=75>>75
Then add the cost of the jacket and hat: $25 + $75 = $<<25+75=100>>100
Then divide that amount by 2 to find the average cost, which is the cost of the pants: $100 / 2 = $<<100/2=50>>50
Then add the cost of each item of clothing to find the total cost of the uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $<<25+75+50=150>>150

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of each component of the uniform and then add them up to get the total cost of the uniform.

Given information:
- The hat costs $25.
- The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
- The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket.

Step 1: Find the cost of the jacket.
Cost of the jacket = 3 × Cost of the hat
Cost of the jacket = 3 × $25 = $75

Step 2: Find the cost of the pants.
Cost of the pants = (Cost of the hat + Cost of the jacket) / 2
Cost of the pants = ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50

Step 3: Find the total cost of the uniform.
Total cost of the uniform = Cost of the hat + Cost of the jacket + Cost of the pants
Total cost of the uniform = $25 + $75 + $50 = $150

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $150.
