Question:
Bill is signing up for a new streaming service. He got a special introductory deal where the first 6 months were $8 a month, then it went up to the normal price of $12 a month. After 8 months of the normal rate, the service increased its price to $14 a month. How much do 2 years of the service cost him?


Reference Answer:
There are 12 months in a year, so there are 2 years * 12 months per year = 24 months in 2 years.
He has 6 months at the special rate, followed by 8 months of the normal rate, so out of 24 months he pays the increased rate for 24 months - 6 months - 8 months = <<24-6-8=10>>10 months.
He pays the special rate of $8 a month for 6 months, or 6 months * $8 per month = $<<6*8=48>>48.
He pays the normal rate of $12 a month for 8 months, or 8 months * $12 per month = $<<8*12=96>>96.
He pays the new raised rate of $14 a month for 10 months, or 10 months * $14 per month = $<<10*14=140>>140.
Over two years, he pays a total of $48 + $96 + $140 = $<<48+96+140=284>>284.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Bill gets a special introductory deal for the first 6 months where the service costs $8 per month.
   * For the first 6 months, the total cost is:
     * 6 months x $8 per month = $48

2. After the introductory deal, the normal price is $12 per month.
   * For the next 8 months at the normal price, the total cost is:
     * 8 months x $12 per month = $96

3. After 14 months (6 months introductory + 8 months normal), the service increases the price to $14 per month.
   * For the remaining 10 months at the new price, the total cost is:
     * 10 months x $14 per month = $140

4. To calculate the total cost for 2 years (24 months):
   * Total cost = $48 (introductory) + $96 (normal) + $140 (new price)
   * Total cost = $48

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The first 6 months were $8 per month.
- After the first 6 months, the normal price was $12 per month.
- After 8 months at the normal price, the price increased to $14 per month.
- We need to find the total cost for 2 years (24 months) of the service.

Step 1: Calculate the cost for the first 6 months.
Cost for the first 6 months = 6 × $8 = $48

Step 2: Calculate the cost for the next 8 months at the normal price.
Cost for the next 8 months = 8 × $12 = $96

Step 3: Calculate the cost for the remaining 10 months at the increased price.
Cost for the remaining 10 months = 10 × $14 = $140

Step 4: Calculate the total cost for 2 years (24 months) of the service.
Total cost = Cost for the first 6 months + Cost for the next 8

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Bill gets the introductory deal for the first 6 months at $8 per month.
   * 6 months x $8 per month = $48 for the introductory period.

2. After the introductory period, the normal price is $12 per month.
   * For the next 8 months, Bill pays $12 per month.
   * 8 months x $12 per month = $96 for the normal price period.

3. After 14 months (6 months introductory + 8 months normal), the price increases to $14 per month.
   * For the remaining 10 months (2 years - 14 months), Bill pays $14 per month.
   * 10 months x $14 per month = $140 for the increased price period.

4. To calculate the total cost for 2 years:
   * Introductory period: $48
   * Normal price period: $96
   * Increased price period: $140
   * Total cost
