Question:
Mia and Emma are currently 16 years apart in age. If Mia, who is younger than Emma, is 40 years old, what's the average of their ages?


Reference Answer:
If Mia is 40 years old, Emma is 40+16 = <<40+16=56>>56 years old.
The sum of their ages is 56+40 = <<56+40=96>>96 years
The average age of the two is 96/2 = <<96/2=48>>48 years

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mia and Emma are currently 16 years apart in age.
- Mia, who is younger than Emma, is 40 years old.

Step 1: Find Emma's age.
Since Mia is 40 years old and 16 years younger than Emma, we can add 16 to Mia's age to find Emma's age.
Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16 = 56 years old

Step 2: Calculate the average of Mia and Emma's ages.
Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48 years old

Therefore, the average of Mia and Emma's ages is 48 years old.
