Question ID: 1123

Question:
Elijah has one dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog and another dog that is half the weight of Kory’s dog. If Kory’s dog is 60 pounds, how much do Elijah and Kory’s dogs weigh altogether, in pounds?


Reference Answer:
Elijah’s first dog is 60 / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 pounds
Elijah’s second dog is 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 pounds
The total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs is 15 + 30 + 60 = <<15+30+60=105>>105 pounds
#### 105
