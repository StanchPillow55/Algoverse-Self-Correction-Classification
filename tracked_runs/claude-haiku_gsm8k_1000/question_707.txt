Question:
Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. How much more did Kelly pay than Becky?


Reference Answer:
Before the discount, Becky would have paid 20 apples x $0.45/apple = $<<20*0.45=9>>9
With the discount, Becky paid $9 - $1 = $<<9-1=8>>8.
Before the discount Kelly would have paid 20 apples x $0.50/apple = $<<20*0.5=10>>10
With a 10 percent discount Kelly paid ($10 x 10)/100 = $<<(10*10)/100=1>>1 less
In total Kelly paid $10 - $1 = $<<10-1=9>>9.
Kelly paid $9 - $8 = $<<9-8=1>>1 more than Becky.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount.
- Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost for Becky's apples.
Total cost for Becky = (20 apples × $0.45 per apple) - $1 discount
Total cost for Becky = $9 - $1 = $8

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for Kelly's apples.
Original cost for Kelly = 20 apples × $0.50 per apple = $10
Discount for Kelly = 10% of $10 = $1
Total cost for Kelly = $10 - $1 = $9

Step 3: Calculate the difference between what Kelly paid and what Becky paid.
Difference = Kelly's total cost - Becky's total cost
Difference = $9 - $8 = $1

Therefore, Kelly paid $1 more than
