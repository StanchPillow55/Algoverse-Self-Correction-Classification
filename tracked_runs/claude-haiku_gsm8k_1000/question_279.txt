Question ID: 996

Question:
Four children are playing together—Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, and the total age of the children is 20. If Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old, calculate the age of Wilfred.


Reference Answer:
If the combined age of the children is 20, the average age of the group is 20 years / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 years.
Helene is twice as old as the group's average age, meaning Helene is 2 * 5 years = <<2*5=10>>10 years old.
The total age of the three children is 10 years + 3 years + 4 years = <<10+3+4=17>>17 years.
Wilfred's age is 20 years - 17 years = <<20-17=3>>3 years.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Wilfred based on the given information.

Given information:
- There are four children: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred.
- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.
- The total age of the children is 20.
- Akbar is 3 years old, and Alessandro is 4 years old.

Step 1: Find the average age of the group.
Total age of the children = 20 years
Number of children = 4

Average age = Total age / Number of children
Average age = 20 / 4 = 5 years

Step 2: Find Helene's age.
Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.
Helene's age = 2 × Average age
Helene's age = 2 × 5 = 10 years

Step 3: Find Wilfred's age.
Total age of the children = 20 years
Akbar's age = 3 years
Alessandro's age = 4
