Question ID: 66

Question:
There are four schools competing at a basketball tournament. Each school has sent a girls’ basketball team and a boys’ basketball team and each team has 5 players each. Each school has also sent a coach for each team. In total, how many people have all of the schools sent?


Reference Answer:
Each school has sent 1 girls’ basketball team + 1 boys’ basketball team = <<1+1=2>>2 teams.
So each school has sent 2 teams * 5 players per team = <<2*5=10>>10 players.
They have also each sent 2 teams * 1 coach per team = <<2*1=2>>2 coaches.
In total, each school has sent 10 players + 2 coaches = <<10+2=12>>12 people.
Therefore, the schools have sent a total of 12 people per school * 4 schools = <<12*4=48>>48 people.
#### 48

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of people sent by all four schools to the basketball tournament.

Given information:
- There are four schools competing in the tournament.
- Each school has sent a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team.
- Each team has 5 players.
- Each school has also sent a coach for each team.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of players.
Number of players per team = 5
Number of teams per school = 2 (girls' team and boys' team)
Number of schools = 4
Total number of players = 5 players per team × 2 teams per school × 4 schools = 40 players

Step 2: Calculate the total number of coaches.
Number of coaches per school = 2 (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team)
Number of schools = 4
Total number of coaches = 2 coaches per school × 4 schools = 8 coaches

Step 3: Calculate the total number of people sent by all four schools.
Total number of people = Total number of players + Total number of coaches
Total

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 4 schools competing in the basketball tournament.
- Each school has sent a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team.
- Each team has 5 players.
- Each school has also sent a coach for each team.

To find the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to calculate the following:
1. Total number of players
2. Total number of coaches

Step 1: Calculate the total number of players.
Number of players per team = 5
Number of teams per school = 2 (girls' team and boys' team)
Number of schools = 4

Total number of players = Number of players per team × Number of teams per school × Number of schools
Total number of players = 5 × 2 × 4 = 40

Step 2: Calculate the total number of coaches.
Number of coaches per school = 2 (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team)
Number of schools = 4

Total number of coaches = Number of coaches per school × Number of schools
