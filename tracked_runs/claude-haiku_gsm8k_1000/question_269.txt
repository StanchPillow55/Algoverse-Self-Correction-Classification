Question ID: 855

Question:
I am three years younger than my brother, and I am 2 years older than my sister. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. When you add all our ages, you get 87. How old am I?


Reference Answer:
Let X be my age. My brother is X + 3 years old. My sister is X - 2 years old.
My mom is (X + 3) * 3 - 1 years old.
The sum of our ages is X + (X+3) + (X-2) + [(X+3)*3 - 1] = 87 years old.
Multiplying through the parentheses and combining like terms, you get X*6 + 9 = 87 years old.
Subtracting nine from both sides and dividing both sides by 6, you get X = 13 years old.
#### 13

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- You are 3 years younger than your brother.
- You are 2 years older than your sister.
- Your mom's age is 1 less than 3 times your brother's age.
- The sum of all your ages is 87.

Let's define the variables:
- Let your brother's age be x.
- Then, your age is x - 3.
- Your sister's age is x - 5 (since you are 2 years older than her).
- Your mom's age is 3x - 1.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for your age:

Sum of all ages = 87
(x - 3) + x + (x - 5) + (3x - 1) = 87
6x - 9 = 87
6x = 96
x = 16

Therefore, your brother's age is 16.

Now, we can calculate your age:
Your age = x - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13
