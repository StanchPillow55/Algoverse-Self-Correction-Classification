Question:
Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits that her child no longer needed.  At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits.  Then, Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.  How many outfits does she have for her baby?


Reference Answer:
Her friend gave her 24 outfits and she received twice as many at the baby shower so she received 2*24 = 48 baby outfits
Her friend gave her 24 outfits, she received 48 at the baby shower and her mom gave her another 15 for a total of 24+48+15 = <<24+48+15=87>>87 baby outfits
#### 87

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of baby outfits Laurel has after receiving the gifts from her friend, the baby shower, and her mom.

Given information:
- Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.
- Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits at her baby shower.
- Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

Step 1: Calculate the number of new baby outfits Laurel received at her baby shower.
Number of new baby outfits from the baby shower = 2 Ã— 24 = 48 outfits

Step 2: Calculate the total number of baby outfits Laurel has.
Total number of baby outfits = Baby outfits from friend + New baby outfits from baby shower + Baby outfits from mom
Total number of baby outfits = 24 + 48 + 15 = 87 outfits

Therefore, Laurel has a total of 87 baby outfits.

Final answer: Laurel has 87 baby out
