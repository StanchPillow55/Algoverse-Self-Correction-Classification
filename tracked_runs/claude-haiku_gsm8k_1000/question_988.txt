Question:
Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month.  She sets 25% of her paycheck aside to put towards fancy shoes.  Each pair of shoes she buys costs $1,000.00.  How many shoes can she buy in a year?


Reference Answer:
She is paid $2,000.00 a month and she saves 25% for shoes so she saves 2000*.25 = $<<2000*.25=500.00>>500.00
She saves $500.00 a month for 12 months so she saves 500*12 = $<<500*12=6000.00>>6,000.00
Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00 and she has saved $6,000.00 so she can buy 6000/1000 = 6 pair of shoes per year

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month.
2. She sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes.
3. To calculate how much she sets aside each month:
   * 25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 x $2,000.00 = $500.00

4. Now, we need to calculate how much she can save in a year:
   * $500.00 per month x 12 months = $6,000.00 saved in a year

5. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.
6. To calculate how many shoes she can buy in a year:
   * $6,000.00 saved / $1,000.00 per pair = 6 pairs of shoes

Therefore, the final answer is:
Jessica can buy 6 pairs of fancy shoes in a year.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month.
- She sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

Step 1: Calculate how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month.
25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 × $2,000.00 = $500.00

Step 2: Calculate how much Jessica can save for shoes in a year.
Amount saved per month = $500.00
Amount saved in a year = $500.00 × 12 months = $6,000.00

Step 3: Calculate how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year.
Cost per pair of shoes = $1,000.00
Number of pairs of shoes = Total amount saved / Cost per pair
Number of pairs of shoes = $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6 pairs

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of fancy shoes in a year.
