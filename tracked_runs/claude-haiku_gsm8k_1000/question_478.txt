Question:
A company spends $15000 on advertising for a year, and then spends a third of that amount on advertising for another year.  What's the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years?


Reference Answer:
15000/3 = <<15000/3=5000>>5,000 is spent on advertisement in the second year.
The total on advertisement for the two years is 15000+5000 = <<15000+5000=20000>>20000 dollars.
#### 20000

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The company spends $15,000 on advertising for the first year.
- The company spends a third of $15,000 on advertising for the second year.

Step 1: Calculate the amount spent on advertising for the second year.
Amount spent on advertising for the second year = 1/3 × $15,000 = $5,000

Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent on advertising for both years.
Total amount spent on advertising = Amount spent on advertising for the first year + Amount spent on advertising for the second year
Total amount spent on advertising = $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20,000.
