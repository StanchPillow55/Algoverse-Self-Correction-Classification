Question:
Mark buys a fleet of 12 cars for his company.  Each car sells for $20,000.  He pays 10% tax on the cars and then another $1000 for registration on each of them.  How much does he pay for everything?


Reference Answer:
The cars cost 20000*12=$<<20000*12=240000>>240,000
So the tax came out to 240,000*.1=$<<240000*.1=24000>>24,000
So the cars cost 240,000+24,000=$<<240000+24000=264000>>264,000
Registration cost another 12*1000=<<12*1000=12000>>12,000
So his total cost is 264,000+12,000=$<<264000+12000=276000>>276,000
#### 276,000

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mark buys a fleet of 12 cars
- Each car sells for $20,000
- He pays 10% tax on the cars
- He pays $1,000 for registration on each car

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration.
Total cost of cars = Number of cars × Cost per car
Total cost of cars = 12 × $20,000 = $240,000

Step 2: Calculate the tax amount.
Tax amount = Total cost of cars × Tax rate
Tax amount = $240,000 × 0.10 = $24,000

Step 3: Calculate the total registration cost.
Total registration cost = Number of cars × Registration cost per car
Total registration cost = 12 × $1,000 = $12,000

Step 4: Calculate the total amount Mark pays for everything.
Total amount paid = Total cost of cars + Tax amount + Total registration cost
Total amount paid = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mark buys a fleet of 12 cars for his company.
2. Each car sells for $20,000.
3. He pays 10% tax on the cars.
4. He pays an additional $1,000 for registration on each car.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 12 cars before tax and registration:
* 12 cars x $20,000 per car = $240,000

Next, let's calculate the 10% tax on the $240,000:
* 10% of $240,000 = $24,000

Now, let's calculate the total registration fees for the 12 cars:
* 12 cars x $1,000 per car = $12,000

Finally, we can add up the total cost:
* Cost of cars: $240,000
* Tax: $24,000
* Registration fees: $12,000
* Total: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for
