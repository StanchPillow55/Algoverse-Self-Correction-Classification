Question ID: 811

Question:
Felix notices that kids in the neighborhood are always getting things stuck in trees. Since he is an expert tree climber, he decided to start charging kids to get their stuff out. He charges based on how high he has to climb. Every branch he has to climb up costs $.25. During the week he made $105. On average, how many branches did he climb per day?


Reference Answer:
He climbed 420 branches in total because 105 / .25 = <<105/.25=420>>420
He climbed on average 60 branches a day because 420 / 7 = <<420/7=60>>60
#### 60

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day.

Given information:
- Felix charges $0.25 per branch he climbs.
- During the week, he made a total of $105.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
Total amount earned / Cost per branch = Total number of branches climbed
$105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Step 2: Calculate the average number of branches climbed per day.
Total number of branches climbed / Number of days in a week = Average number of branches climbed per day
420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day.

Final answer: On average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Felix charges $0.25 per branch he has to climb up to retrieve items.
- During the week, he made a total of $105.

To find the average number of branches he climbed per day, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of branches he climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week (7).

Step 1: Calculate the total number of branches climbed during the week.
Total amount earned / Cost per branch = Total number of branches climbed
$105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Step 2: Calculate the average number of branches climbed per day.
Total number of branches climbed / Number of days in a week = Average branches climbed per day
420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Felix charges $0.25 per branch he has to climb up.
- During the week, he made $105.

To find the average number of branches he climbed per day, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of branches he climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week (7).

Step 1: Calculate the total number of branches he climbed during the week.
Total amount earned during the week = $105
Cost per branch = $0.25
Total number of branches climbed = Total amount earned / Cost per branch
Total number of branches climbed = $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Step 2: Calculate the average number of branches climbed per day.
Average number of branches climbed per day = Total number of branches climbed / Number of days in a week
Average number of branches climbed per day = 420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day.
