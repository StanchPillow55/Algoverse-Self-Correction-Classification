Question:
Ralph has a record store where people can trade their own records for new ones. People can trade 2 old records for 1 new one. 5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records between them. How many old records did the 5 people bring in?


Reference Answer:
People can bring in 2 old records = get 1 new record.
5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records, 7 new records x 2 old records traded for each = <<7*2=14>>14 old records that the 5 people brought in.
#### 14

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of old records that the 5 people brought in.

Given information:
- People can trade 2 old records for 1 new record.
- 5 people came in with old records and left with 7 new records between them.

Step 1: Determine the relationship between the number of old records and the number of new records.
Since people can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, the number of new records is half the number of old records.

Let's represent the number of old records as x.
Then, the number of new records is x/2.

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the given information.
We know that the 5 people left with a total of 7 new records, so we can write the equation:
x/2 = 7

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
x/2 = 7
x = 2 × 7
x = 14

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

Final answer: The 5 people brought

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- People can trade 2 old records for 1 new one.
- 5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records between them.

To find the number of old records the 5 people brought in, we need to work backwards from the number of new records they received.

Step 1: Determine the number of new records each person received.
Total new records received = 7
Number of people = 5
New records per person = 7 / 5 = 1.4 (rounded down to 1 new record per person)

Step 2: Determine the number of old records each person traded in.
Old records per person = 2 (since 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record)

Step 3: Calculate the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people.
Total old records = Old records per person × Number of people
Total old records = 2 × 5 = 10

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 10

Response:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know that 5 people came in with old records and left with 7 new records between them.
2) The problem states that people can trade 2 old records for 1 new one.
3) So, if the 5 people left with 7 new records, that means they traded in a certain number of old records to get those 7 new records.
4) We can set up an equation to solve for the number of old records:
   * Let x = the number of old records the 5 people brought in
   * Since they traded 2 old records for 1 new record, the number of new records they got is x/2
   * The problem states they left with 7 new records, so we can write the equation:
     x/2 = 7
   * Solving for x, we get:
     x = 14
5) Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records.

Final answer: The 5 people brought in 14 old records.
