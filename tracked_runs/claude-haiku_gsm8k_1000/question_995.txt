Question ID: 819

Question:
Twenty students are working together to raise money for a charity. Each earns the same amount. The charity raises a total of $175,000. $50,000 comes from organizations and the rest from the students. How much did each student raise?


Reference Answer:
Amount raised by all students was 175,000-50,000 = <<175000-50000=125000>>125,000 dollars.
Amount raised by each student was 125,000/20 = <<125000/20=6250>>6,250 dollars.
#### 6,250

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money raised by the students and then divide it by the number of students to determine the amount raised by each student.

Given information:
- The charity raised a total of $175,000.
- $50,000 came from organizations.
- There are 20 students working together.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money raised by the students.
Total amount raised - Amount from organizations = Amount raised by students
$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Step 2: Calculate the amount raised by each student.
Amount raised by students / Number of students = Amount raised by each student
$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

Therefore, each student raised $6,250 for the charity.

Final answer: Each student raised $6,250.
