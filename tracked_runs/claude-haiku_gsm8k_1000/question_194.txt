Question ID: 740

Question:
A class of 50 students has various hobbies. 10 like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and the rest like to either play video games or play music. How many like to play video games if the number that like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball?


Reference Answer:
The number of students that like to play music is twice as many as the number who like basketball, so 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10
The number that like to play video games is 50 total students - 10 baking - 5 basketball - 10 music = <<50-10-5-10=25>>25

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The class has 50 students
- 10 students like to bake
- 5 students like to play basketball
- The remaining students like to either play video games or play music
- The number of students who like to play music is twice the number who prefer playing basketball

Step 1: Find the number of students who like to play music.
Number of students who like to play basketball = 5
Number of students who like to play music = 2 Ã— 5 = 10

Step 2: Find the number of students who like to play video games.
Total number of students = 50
Number of students who like to bake = 10
Number of students who like to play basketball = 5
Number of students who like to play music = 10
Number of students who like to play video games = Total students - (students who like to bake + students who like to play basketball + students who like to play music)
Number of students who like to play video games = 50 - (10 + 5 + 10) = 25

Therefore
