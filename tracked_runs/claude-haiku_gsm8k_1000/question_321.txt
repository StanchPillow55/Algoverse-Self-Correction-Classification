Question ID: 381

Question:
Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour and stopped after 5 hours. How many kilometers farther did Cho hike?


Reference Answer:
Cho = 14 * 8 = <<14*8=112>>112 km
Chloe = 9 * 5 = <<9*5=45>>45 km
112 - 45 = <<112-45=67>>67 km
Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.
#### 67

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance hiked by Cho and Chloe, and then find the difference between them.

Given information:
- Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours.
- Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance hiked by Cho.
Cho's distance = Cho's speed × Cho's time
Cho's distance = 14 kilometers per hour × 8 hours
Cho's distance = 112 kilometers

Step 2: Calculate the total distance hiked by Chloe.
Chloe's distance = Chloe's speed × Chloe's time
Chloe's distance = 9 kilometers per hour × 5 hours
Chloe's distance = 45 kilometers

Step 3: Calculate the difference between Cho's and Chloe's distances.
Difference in distance = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
Difference in distance = 112 kilometers - 45 kilometers
Difference in distance

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours.
- Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance Cho hiked.
Cho's speed × Cho's time = Cho's total distance
14 kilometers per hour × 8 hours = 112 kilometers

Step 2: Calculate the total distance Chloe hiked.
Chloe's speed × Chloe's time = Chloe's total distance
9 kilometers per hour × 5 hours = 45 kilometers

Step 3: Calculate the difference between Cho's and Chloe's total distances.
Cho's total distance - Chloe's total distance = Difference in distance hiked
112 kilometers - 45 kilometers = 67 kilometers

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.
