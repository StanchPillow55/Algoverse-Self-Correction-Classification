Question:
Jo has been making face masks. She can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material and 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. How much material would she need to make 20 small and 8 large masks for her class?


Reference Answer:
It takes 2 yards of material / 4 small masks = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 yards of material per mask.
It takes 2.25 yards of material / 3 large masks = <<2.25/3=0.75>>0.75 yards of material per mask.
For the small masks, it will take 20 masks x 0.5 yards = <<20*0.5=10>>10 yards of material.
For the large masks, it will take 8 masks x 0.75 yards = <<8*0.75=6>>6 yards of material.
In all, it will take 10 yards + 6 yards = <<10+6=16>>16 yards of material.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of material required to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

Given information:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of material needed for the small masks.
Number of small masks needed = 20
Amount of material needed for 4 small masks = 2 yards
Amount of material needed for 20 small masks = (20 ÷ 4) × 2 = 10 yards

Step 2: Calculate the amount of material needed for the large masks.
Number of large masks needed = 8
Amount of material needed for 3 large masks = 2.25 yards
Amount of material needed for 8 large masks = (8 ÷ 3) × 2.25 = 6 yards

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of material needed.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   * This means she needs 0.5 yards of material per small mask (2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards/mask).

2. Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   * This means she needs 0.75 yards of material per large mask (2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards/mask).

3. We need to find the total amount of material required to make 20 small and 8 large masks.
   * For the 20 small masks, we need 20 * 0.5 = 10 yards of material.
   * For the 8 large masks, we need 8 * 0.75 = 6 yards of material.
   * The total material required is 10 + 6 = 16 yards.

Therefore, the amount of material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   * This means that 1 small mask requires 2 / 4 = 0.5 yards of material.

2. Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   * This means that 1 large mask requires 2.25 / 3 = 0.75 yards of material.

3. We need to find the total amount of material required to make 20 small and 8 large masks.
   * For the 20 small masks, we need 20 * 0.5 = 10 yards of material.
   * For the 8 large masks, we need 8 * 0.75 = 6 yards of material.
   * The total material required is 10 + 6 = 16 yards.

Therefore, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks for her class.
