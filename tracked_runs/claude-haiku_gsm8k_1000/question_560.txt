Question ID: 193

Question:
Sue lives in a fun neighborhood.  One weekend, the neighbors decided to play a prank on Sue.  On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard.  On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put these newly painted white flamingos back out on Sue's front yard.  Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos?


Reference Answer:
On Saturday, one third of the original 18 pink flamingos were removed and painted white: 18*1/3=<<18*1/3=6>>6 white flamingos.
This left 18 pink - 6 = <<18-6=12>>12 pink flamingos.
On Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added, for a total of 12 + 18 = <<12+18=30>>30 pink flamingos on the front lawn.
Altogether, there were 30 pink and 6 white flamingos on the lawn, so there were 30 pink - 6 white =<<30-6=24>>24 more pink flamingos.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On Friday, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard.
- On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put them back out.
- On Sunday, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.

Step 1: Calculate the number of flamingos taken back and painted white on Saturday.
One third of 18 flamingos = 18 รท 3 = 6 flamingos

Step 2: Calculate the total number of flamingos in the yard on Sunday.
Friday: 18 pink flamingos
Saturday: 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos, plus 6 white flamingos
Sunday: 18 additional pink flamingos
Total flamingos = 12 + 6 + 18 = 36 flamingos

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos.
Number of pink flamingos = 12

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard.

4. On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   * So now there are 18 + 18 = 36 pink flamingos

5. At noon on Sunday, the total number of flamingos in Sue's front yard is:
   * 36 pink flamingos
   * 6 white flamingos

3. On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   * 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos

4. At noon on Sunday, there were 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.
   * The difference between the pink and white flamingos is 30 - 6 = 24 more pink flamingos than white flamingos.

Therefore, the final answer is:
At noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos out than white plastic flamingos
