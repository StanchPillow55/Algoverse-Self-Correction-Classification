Question:
The ratio of the electric poles and electric wires needed to connect and supply the electricity in a certain neighborhood is 1:3. If the total number of electric wires needed to connect the electricity in the neighborhood is 45, calculate the total number of electric poles required by an electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood.


Reference Answer:
The total ratio representing the number of electric poles and wires is 1+3=<<1+3=4>>4
The fraction representing the number of wires required to connect the neighborhood's electricity is <<3/4=3/4>>3/4
If 3/4 represents 45, the number of wires required for the connections, then the total fraction which is 4/4, representing the poles and wires needed, represents 4/4*45*4/3=60
Since the total number of wires and poles required is 60, and the number of electric wires to be used is 45, the number of poles required is 60-45=<<60-45=15>>15

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of electric poles and the number of electric wires, and then use the given information to calculate the total number of electric poles required.

Given information:
- The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3.
- The total number of electric wires needed is 45.

Step 1: Understand the ratio of electric poles to electric wires.
The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, which means that for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of electric poles and the number of electric wires.
Let the number of electric poles be x.
Then, the number of electric wires will be 3x, as per the given ratio.

Step 3: Use the given information to set up an equation and solve for the number of electric poles.
Total number of electric wires = 45
3x = 45
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply
