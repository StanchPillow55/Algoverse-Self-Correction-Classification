Question ID: 404

Question:
Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each, a zebra with 36 stripes, and another zebra with half that many stripes. How many stripes do the zebras have on average?


Reference Answer:
First find the number of stripes the last zebra has: 36 stripes / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18 stripes
Then find the total number of stripes the first two zebras have: 2 zebras * 17 stripes/zebra = <<2*17=34>>34 stripes
Then add the number of stripes the last two zebras have: 18 stripes + 34 stripes + 36 stripes = <<18+34+36=88>>88 stripes
Then divide the number of stripes by the number of zebras to find the average number of stripes per zebra: 88 stripes / 4 zebras = <<88/4=22>>22 stripes/zebra

Response:
Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each.
- Jane counts a zebra with 36 stripes.
- Jane counts another zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of stripes on all the zebras.
Zebra 1: 17 stripes
Zebra 2: 17 stripes
Zebra 3: 36 stripes
Zebra 4: 36 stripes / 2 = 18 stripes

Total number of stripes = 17 + 17 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes

Step 2: Calculate the average number of stripes on the zebras.
Average number of stripes = Total number of stripes / Number of zebras
Average number of stripes = 88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes

Therefore, the zebras have an average of 22 stripes.
