Question ID: 1180

Question:
A company sold 4000 gallons of milk in jars to Mr. Marcellus' store at the cost of $3.5 per gallon. However, Mr. Marcellus later realized 2/5 of the amount of milk he purchased had passed the expiry date and could not be sold. He returned the sour milk to the company and ordered a refund. Calculate how much he got in refunds.


Reference Answer:
If he purchased 4000 gallons, the number of gallons expired is 2/5 * 4000 gallons = <<2/5*4000=1600>>1600 gallons.
If each gallon costs $3.5, and he returned 1600 gallons for refund, the total amount he got from the refund is $3.5/gallon * 1600 gallons = $<<3.5*1600=5600>>5600
#### 5600

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased by Mr. Marcellus.
2. Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date and could not be sold.
3. Calculate the refund amount for the sour milk.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased by Mr. Marcellus.
Total gallons of milk purchased = 4000 gallons
Cost per gallon = $3.5
Total cost of milk purchased = 4000 gallons × $3.5 per gallon = $14,000

Step 2: Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date and could not be sold.
Proportion of milk that passed the expiry date = 2/5 or 40%
Amount of milk that passed the expiry date = 4000 gallons × 2/5 = 1600 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the refund amount for the sour milk.
Refund amount = Amount of sour milk × Cost per gallon
Refund amount = 1600 gallons
