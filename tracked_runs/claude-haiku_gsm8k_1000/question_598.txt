Question:
Steve put together a puzzle that took 10 hours of hard work to complete. Anna put together the same puzzle in 2 hours more than half Steve's time. How long did it take Anna to finish the difficult puzzle?


Reference Answer:
Half the time it took Steve to put together the puzzle is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5
If Anna put together the same puzzle in 2 hours more than half the time it took Steve, she took 5+2=7 hours to finish the puzzle.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the time it took Anna to complete the puzzle.

Given information:
- Steve took 10 hours to complete the puzzle.
- Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time to complete the puzzle.

Step 1: Find half of Steve's time.
Half of Steve's time = 10 hours / 2 = 5 hours

Step 2: Find the time it took Anna to complete the puzzle.
Anna's time = Half of Steve's time + 2 hours
Anna's time = 5 hours + 2 hours = 7 hours

Therefore, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the difficult puzzle.

Final answer: It took Anna 7 hours to complete the puzzle.
