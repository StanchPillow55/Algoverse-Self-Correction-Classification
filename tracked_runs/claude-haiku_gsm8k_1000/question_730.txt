Question:
Walter is collecting money for charity. First he collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well. How much is Walter's lawyer going to contribute?


Reference Answer:
Walter collects $500 + $1500 + $200 = $<<500+1500+200=2200>>2,200 he collects from everyone for charity.
His lawyer has offered to donate 3 times that amount, $2,200 x 3 = $<<3*2200=6600>>6,600 that Walter's lawyer is going to donate.
#### 6,600

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Walter collects $500 from his neighbors.
- Walter collects $1500 from an online fund.
- Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates.
- Walter's friend gives him an additional $200.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund.
Total amount collected = $500 (from neighbors) + $1500 (from online fund) = $2000

Step 2: Determine the amount the lawyer will contribute.
The lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates.
Total amount donated by everyone else = $2000
Amount the lawyer will contribute = 3 × $2000 = $6000

Step 3: Verify the final amount.
The problem states that Walter will tell his lawyer about the neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well.
Total amount collected = $2000 (from neighbors and online fund) + $200 (from friend) = $2200
Amount the lawyer will contribute = 3 × $
