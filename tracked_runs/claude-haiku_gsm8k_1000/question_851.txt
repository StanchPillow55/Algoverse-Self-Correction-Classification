Question ID: 426

Question:
Aleksandra went to a restaurant for dinner. She ordered some soup, a bagel, and a piece of cake. The bagel cost $4, and the soup 25% more. The cake is only half of the price of the bagel. How much did Aleksandra need to pay for the dinner she ordered?


Reference Answer:
The soup cost 4 * 25/100 = $<<4*25/100=1>>1 more than the bagel.
So the soup cost is 4 + 1 = $<<4+1=5>>5.
The cake is half the price of the bagel, so it is 4 * 0.5 = $<<4*0.5=2>>2.
Aleksandra needed to pay 4 + 5 + 2 = $<<4+5+2=11>>11 for dinner.
#### 11

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- The bagel costs $4.
- The soup costs 25% more than the bagel.
- The cake costs half the price of the bagel.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the soup.
Cost of the soup = Cost of the bagel + 25% of the cost of the bagel
Cost of the soup = $4 + (0.25 × $4) = $4 + $1 = $5

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the cake.
Cost of the cake = 1/2 × Cost of the bagel
Cost of the cake = 1/2 × $4 = $2

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner.
Total cost = Cost of the bagel + Cost of the soup + Cost of the cake
Total cost = $4 + $5 + $2 = $11

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.
