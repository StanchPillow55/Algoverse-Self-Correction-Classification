Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day.
- The sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles daily.
- There are 28 days in February.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of articles published by the news website in February.
Number of articles per day × Number of days in February = Total articles published by news website
20 articles per day × 28 days = 560 articles

Step 2: Calculate the total number of articles published by the sister company in February.
Number of articles per day × Number of days in February = Total articles published by sister company
10 articles per day × 28 days = 280 articles

Step 3: Calculate the total number of articles published by both websites together in February.
Total articles published by news website + Total articles published by sister company = Total articles published
560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

Therefore, the total number of articles the two websites published together in February is 840 articles.
