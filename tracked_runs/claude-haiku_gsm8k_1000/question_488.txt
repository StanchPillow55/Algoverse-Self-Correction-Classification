Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of children participating in the mass drills.

Given information:
- There are 8 children in each row.
- There are 7 rows for each school.
- There are 5 different schools participating.

Step 1: Calculate the number of children in each school.
Number of children in each school = Number of children in each row × Number of rows
Number of children in each school = 8 × 7 = 56 children

Step 2: Calculate the total number of children participating in the mass drills.
Total number of children = Number of children in each school × Number of schools
Total number of children = 56 × 5 = 280 children

Therefore, there can be 280 children in the mass drills for the children's day celebration.

Final answer: 280 children
