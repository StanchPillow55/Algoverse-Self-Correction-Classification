Question:
The Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. How many eggs did the friends find?


Reference Answer:
The Smith twins found, 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 eggs.
The number that remained hidden was 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40 eggs
Since 10 eggs were not found, this means the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs
#### 30

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs.
- The Smith twins each found 30 eggs.
- All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins.
Eggs found by the Smith twins = 30 + 30 = 60 eggs

Step 2: Calculate the total number of eggs found by their friends.
Total eggs hidden - Eggs found by the Smith twins - Eggs not found = Eggs found by their friends
100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs

Therefore, the friends found 30 eggs.

Final answer: The friends found 30 eggs.
