Question:
Mike was a pen pal with 5 people.  He stopped being penpals with 2 of them.  They each send 2 letters a week that are 5 pages long.  He responds in kind.  He can write a page every 6 minutes.  How many hours does he spend writing a week?


Reference Answer:
He is penpals with 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 people
Thus he gets 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 letters a week
So he writes 6*5=<<6*5=30>>30 pages a week
So he writes for 30*6=<<30*6=180>>180 minutes a week
So he writes 180/60=<<180/60=3>>3 hours a week

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Mike was a pen pal with 5 people.
- He stopped being penpals with 2 of them.
- Each of the remaining 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week that are 5 pages long.
- Mike responds in kind.
- Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages Mike receives per week.
Number of remaining pen pals = 3
Number of letters received per week from each pen pal = 2
Number of pages per letter = 5
Total number of pages received per week = 3 × 2 × 5 = 30 pages

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pages Mike needs to write per week.
Since Mike responds in kind, the total number of pages he needs to write per week is also 30 pages.

Step 3: Calculate the total time Mike spends writing per week.
Time to write 1 page = 6 minutes
Total time to write 30 pages = 30 × 6
