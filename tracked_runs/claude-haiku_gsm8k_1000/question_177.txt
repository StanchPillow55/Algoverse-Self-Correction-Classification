Question ID: 1093

Question:
Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet. A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and cost $12. How much will it cost to paint the room?


Reference Answer:
The north and south walls are 80 square feet each because 10 x 8 = <<10*8=80>>80
The east and west walls are 40 square feet because 5 x 8 = <<5*8=40>>40
The south and north walls total 160 square feet because 80 x 2 = <<80*2=160>>160
The East and west walls total 80 square feet because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
All the walls total 240 square feet because 160 + 80 = <<160+80=240>>240
He will need 12 gallons of paint because 240 / 20 = <<240/20=12>>12
It will cost $144 because 12 x 12 = <<12*12=144>>144

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then calculate the number of gallons of paint required and the total cost.

Given information:
- The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet.
- A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and costs $12.

Step 1: Calculate the area of the north and south walls.
Area of north and south walls = 2 × (10 feet × 8 feet) = 160 square feet

Step 2: Calculate the area of the east and west walls.
Area of east and west walls = 2 × (5 feet × 8 feet) = 80 square feet

Step 3: Calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.
Total area = Area of north and south walls + Area of east and west walls
Total area = 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet

Step 4: Calculate the number of gallons of paint required.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted:
   * North wall: 10 ft x 8 ft = 80 sq ft
   * South wall: 10 ft x 8 ft = 80 sq ft
   * East wall: 5 ft x 8 ft = 40 sq ft
   * West wall: 5 ft x 8 ft = 40 sq ft
   * Total area = 80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 sq ft

2. Calculate how many gallons of paint are needed:
   * 1 gallon of paint can cover 20 sq ft
   * Total area to be painted = 240 sq ft
   * Number of gallons needed = 240 sq ft / 20 sq ft per gallon = 12 gallons

3. Calculate the total cost of the paint:
   * 1 gallon of paint costs $12
   * Total cost of paint = 12 gallons x $12 per gal

   * Total area = 80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 sq ft

2. Calculate how many gallons of paint are needed:
   * 1 gallon of paint can cover 20 sq ft
   * Total area / coverage per gallon = 240 sq ft / 20 sq ft per gallon = 12 gallons

3. Calculate the total cost of the paint:
   * 1 gallon of paint costs $12
   * Total cost = 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144

Therefore, the total cost to paint the room
