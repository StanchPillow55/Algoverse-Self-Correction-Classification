Question ID: 523

Question:
The bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. How many loaves of bread did they have left?


Reference Answer:
The Bakery sold 93 + 39 = <<93+39=132>>132 loaves.
The Bakery made 200 loaves and sold 132, leaving 200 - 132 = <<200-132=68>>68 loaves remaining.
The grocery store returned 6 loaves, so there were 6 + 68 = <<6+68=74>>74 loaves left.
#### 74

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loaves of bread sold.
2. Calculate the number of loaves returned by the grocery store.
3. Subtract the total number of loaves sold and returned from the initial number of loaves baked to find the number of loaves left.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of loaves of bread sold.
Loaves sold in the morning = 93
Loaves sold in the afternoon = 39
Total loaves sold = 93 + 39 = 132

Step 2: Calculate the number of loaves returned by the grocery store.
Loaves returned = 6

Step 3: Subtract the total number of loaves sold and returned from the initial number of loaves baked to find the number of loaves left.
Initial number of loaves baked = 200
Total loaves sold = 132
Loaves returned = 6
Loaves left = Initial number of loaves baked - Total loaves sold + Loaves returned
Loaves left = 200 - 132 + 6 = 74
