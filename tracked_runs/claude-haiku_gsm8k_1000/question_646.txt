Question:
Peter plans to go to the movies this week. He always gets a ticket for $7 and popcorn for $7. If he has 42 dollars for the week, how many times can he go to the movies?


Reference Answer:
It costs him $14 to go to the movies because 7 + 7 = <<7+7=14>>14
He can go to the movies 3 times because 42 / 14 = <<42/14=3>>3

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find out how many times Peter can go to the movies with the $42 he has for the week.

Given information:
- Ticket price: $7
- Popcorn price: $7
- Total amount of money Peter has for the week: $42

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of one movie trip.
Cost of one movie trip = Ticket price + Popcorn price
Cost of one movie trip = $7 + $7 = $14

Step 2: Calculate the number of times Peter can go to the movies.
Number of times Peter can go to the movies = Total amount of money / Cost of one movie trip
Number of times Peter can go to the movies = $42 / $14 = 3 times

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

Final answer: Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Peter needs $7 for a movie ticket
- Peter needs $7 for popcorn
- Peter has $42 for the week

To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost for each trip to the movies and then divide the total amount of money he has by the cost per trip.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost per trip to the movies.
Cost of movie ticket + Cost of popcorn = Total cost per trip
$7 + $7 = $14

Step 2: Calculate the number of trips Peter can make to the movies.
Total amount of money / Total cost per trip = Number of trips
$42 / $14 = 3 trips

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

Final answer: Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.
