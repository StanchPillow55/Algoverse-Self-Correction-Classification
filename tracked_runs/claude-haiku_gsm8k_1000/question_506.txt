Question ID: 746

Question:
Jake's family wants to compare the cost of the two different amusement parks. The first amusement park has a $26 fee for each adult and a $12 fee for each child; while the second amusement park has a $14 fee for each adult and $10 for each child. If there are 2 adults and 2 children in their family, how much will they be able to save if they choose the second amusement park over the first?


Reference Answer:
The two adults pay $26 x 2 = $<<26*2=52>>52 for the first amusement park.
While the two children's tickets cost $12 x 2 = $<<12*2=24>>24 for the first amusement park.
So, they will pay a total of $52 + $24 = $<<52+24=76>>76 for the first amusement park.
The two adults pay $14 x 2 = $<<14*2=28>>28 for the second amusement park.
While the two children's tickets for the second amusement park cost $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.
So, they will pay a total of $28 + $20 = $<<28+20=48>>48 for the second amusement park.
Thus, they will save $76 - $48 = $<<76-48=28>>28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for each amusement park and then find the difference to determine the savings.

Given information:
- First amusement park:
  - Adult fee: $26
  - Child fee: $12
- Second amusement park:
  - Adult fee: $14
  - Child fee: $10
- Family size: 2 adults and 2 children

Step 1: Calculate the total cost for the first amusement park.
Total cost for the first amusement park = (2 adults × $26) + (2 children × $12)
Total cost for the first amusement park = $52 + $24 = $76

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for the second amusement park.
Total cost for the second amusement park = (2 adults × $14) + (2 children × $10)
Total cost for the second amusement park = $28 + $20 = $48

Step 3: Calculate the savings by choosing the second amusement park over the first.
Savings = Total cost for the first a
