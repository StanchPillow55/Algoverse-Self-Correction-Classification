Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jeff's work is 3 miles away.
- He walks there and back each day he works.
- He has to work 5 times a week.

To find the total distance Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Jeff walks each day.
Distance to work = 3 miles
Distance back from work = 3 miles
Total distance walked each day = 3 miles + 3 miles = 6 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total distance Jeff walks in a week.
Number of days worked per week = 5 days
Total distance walked in a week = Distance walked each day × Number of days worked per week
Total distance walked in a week = 6 miles × 5 days = 30 miles

Therefore, the total distance Jeff walks in a week is 30 miles.

Final answer: Jeff walks a total of 30 miles in a week.
