Question ID: 971

Question:
Robert is building a 15 foot long, 10 foot wide, rectangular wooden fence around his garden.  He needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing he builds.  How many wooden slats will he need?


Reference Answer:
A rectangle has 2 long sides and Robert wants them to be 15 feet long so 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30 feet long
A rectangle has 2 short sides and Robert wants them to be 10 feet wide so 2*10= <<2*10=20>>20 feet wide
Together, he will need 30 feet and 20 feet of fencing so 30+20 = <<30+20=50>>50 feet of fencing
He needs 2 wooden slats per 1 foot of fencing and he is building 50 feet of fencing so he needs 50*2 = <<2*50=100>>100 wooden slats

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total length of the fence and then calculate the number of wooden slats required.

Given information:
- The fence is rectangular.
- The length of the fence is 15 feet.
- The width of the fence is 10 feet.
- Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing.

Step 1: Calculate the total length of the fence.
Total length of the fence = 2 × (length) + 2 × (width)
Total length of the fence = 2 × 15 feet + 2 × 10 feet
Total length of the fence = 30 feet + 20 feet
Total length of the fence = 50 feet

Step 2: Calculate the number of wooden slats required.
Number of wooden slats required = Total length of the fence × 2
Number of wooden slats required = 50 feet × 2
Number of wooden slats required = 100 wooden slats

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats to build the 15-foot by 10-foot rectangular wooden fence around his garden.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We are given the dimensions of the rectangular fence:
   - Length: 15 feet
   - Width: 10 feet

2. To calculate the total length of fencing needed, we need to add up the lengths of all four sides:
   - Total fencing length = 2 x (15 feet) + 2 x (10 feet) = 50 feet

3. We are told that Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing he builds.
   - Total number of wood slats needed = 50 feet x 2 slats/foot = 100 slats

Therefore, the final answer is that Robert will need 100 wooden slats to build the fence around his garden.
