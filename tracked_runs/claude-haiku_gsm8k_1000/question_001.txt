Question ID: 1039

Question:
Jim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. He needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. How many square feet of fabric does Jim need to buy?


Reference Answer:
First find the length of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's length: 6 feet + 2 feet = <<6+2=8>>8 feet
Then find the width of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's width: 8 feet + 2 feet = <<8+2=10>>10 feet
Then find the square footage of each piece of fabric by multiplying its length and width: 8 feet * 10 feet = <<8*10=80>>80 square feet
Then double that amount since Jim needs two pieces of fabric: 80 square feet/piece * 2 pieces = <<80*2=160>>160 square feet
#### 160

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The king-sized bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.
- Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

Step 1: Calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces.
Length of the fabric pieces = 6 feet + 2 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet
Width of the fabric pieces = 8 feet + 2 feet + 2 feet = 12 feet

Step 2: Calculate the area of each fabric piece.
Area of each fabric piece = Length × Width
Area of each fabric piece = 10 feet × 12 feet = 120 square feet

Step 3: Calculate the total area of fabric needed.
Total area of fabric needed = Area of 2 fabric pieces
Total area of fabric needed = 2 × 120 square feet = 240 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 240 square feet of fabric to make the comforter for his king-sized bed.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The king-sized bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.
- Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

Step 1: Calculate the dimensions of the fabric needed.
Bed dimensions: 6 feet long by 8 feet wide
Fabric dimensions: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet long, 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet wide

Step 2: Calculate the area of one piece of fabric.
Area of one piece of fabric = Length × Width
Area of one piece of fabric = 8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet

Step 3: Calculate the total area of fabric needed.
Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric needed is:
Total area of fabric = 2 × Area of one piece of fabric
Total area of fabric = 2 × 80 square feet = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of
