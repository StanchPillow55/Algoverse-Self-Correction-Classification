Question:
Jada, Rory, and Kora make clay dishes to present as art for their school project. Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, while Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora. If Kora made 20 dishes, how many clay dishes they all make together?


Reference Answer:
If Kora made 20 clay dishes, Rory made 20 clay dishes + 20 clay dishes = <<20+20=40>>40 clay dishes.
Jada made twice as many clay dishes as Rory, which totals 2 * 40 clay dishes = <<2*40=80>>80 clay dishes.
The total number of clay dishes made by the three is 80 from Jada + 40 from Rory + 20 from Kora = <<80+40+20=140>>140 clay dishes
#### 140

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory.
- Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora.
- Kora made 20 dishes.

Step 1: Find the number of clay dishes Rory made.
Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora.
Kora made 20 dishes.
Therefore, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 clay dishes.

Step 2: Find the number of clay dishes Jada made.
Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory.
Rory made 40 clay dishes.
Therefore, Jada made 2 Ã— 40 = 80 clay dishes.

Step 3: Find the total number of clay dishes they all made together.
Total clay dishes = Jada's dishes + Rory's dishes + Kora's dishes
Total clay dishes = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140 clay dishes

Therefore, the total number of clay
