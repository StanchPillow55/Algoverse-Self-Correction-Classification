Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jordan has 2 children who wear diapers.
- Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.
- Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of diaper changes per day for both children.
Total diaper changes per day = 2 children × 5 diaper changes per child per day = 10 diaper changes per day

Step 2: Calculate the number of diaper changes that Jordan's wife does per day.
Diaper changes done by Jordan's wife = 1/2 × 10 diaper changes per day = 5 diaper changes per day

Step 3: Calculate the number of diaper changes that Jordan does per day.
Diaper changes done by Jordan = Total diaper changes per day - Diaper changes done by Jordan's wife
Diaper changes done by Jordan = 10 diaper changes per day - 5 diaper changes per day = 5 diaper changes per day

Therefore, the final answer is:
Jordan changes 5
