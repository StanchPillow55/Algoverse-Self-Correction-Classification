Question:
Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills from the bank account.  He loses 10 bills while getting home.  After that, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.  Thomas then triples his money.  He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.  How many 5 dollar bills does he have?


Reference Answer:
He withdrew 1000/20=<<1000/20=50>>50 bills
So he has 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 bills left over
He uses half the bills to pay for something, so he has 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 bills
He triples his money which gives him 20*3=<<20*3=60>>60 bills
So he has 60*20=$<<60*20=1200>>1200
Converting to 5s means he has 1200/5=<<1200/5=240>>240 bills
#### 240

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills:
   * $1000 / $20 per bill = 50 bills

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home:
   * 50 bills - 10 lost bills = 40 bills remaining

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill:
   * 40 bills / 2 = 20 bills used to pay the bill
   * 40 bills - 20 bills = 20 bills remaining

4. Thomas then triples his money:
   * 20 bills x $20 per bill = $400
   * $400 x 3 = $1200

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills:
   * $1200 / $5 per bill = 240 bills

Therefore, the final answer is that Thomas has 240 five-dollar bills.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and show the complete reasoning and work.

Given information:
- Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills from the bank.
- He loses 10 bills while getting home.
- He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
- He then triples his money.
- He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.

Step 1: Calculate the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas withdrew from the bank.
Number of 20 dollar bills = $1000 / $20 = 50 bills

Step 2: Calculate the number of bills remaining after losing 10 bills.
Number of bills remaining = 50 - 10 = 40 bills

Step 3: Calculate the number of bills used to pay for a bill.
Number of bills used = 40 / 2 = 20 bills

Step 4: Calculate the number of bills remaining after paying the bill.
Number of bills remaining = 40 - 20 = 20 bills

Step 5: Calculate the total amount of money Thomas has after tripling
