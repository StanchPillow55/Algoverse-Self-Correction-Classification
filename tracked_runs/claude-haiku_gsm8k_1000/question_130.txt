Question:
To have the car for the weekend, Wilson's report card needs to show that he received 80 or higher in his math class.  His math grade is calculated by the average of 5 test scores.  On those tests, he received: 65, 94, 81, 86 and 74.  What is his current math grade?


Reference Answer:
He received 65, 94, 81, 86 and a 74 on his 5 math tests so that's 65+94+81+86+74 = <<400=400>>400
His math grade is calculated by the average test grade on his 5 tests so his math grade is 400/5 = <<400/5=80>>80
#### 80

Response:
Certainly! Let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Wilson needs to have a math grade of 80 or higher to have the car for the weekend.
- His math grade is calculated by the average of 5 test scores.
- The test scores he received are: 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of the 5 test scores.

Step 1: Add up the 5 test scores.
65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

Step 2: Divide the sum by the number of test scores to find the average.
Average = 400 รท 5 = 80

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

Final answer: Wilson's current math grade is 80.
