Question:
John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.  The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.  He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties?


Reference Answer:
He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties
So he bought 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 red ties
Each red tie cost $40 * .5 = $<<40*.5=20>>20 more than blue ties
So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60
So he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties
So he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
- The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties.
- He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.

Step 1: Find the number of blue ties John bought.
Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties:
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties

Step 2: Find the number of red ties John bought.
Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:
Number of red ties = 2 × 5 = 10 red ties

Step 3: Find the cost of the red ties.
The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is:
Cost of red tie = $40 + (50% of $40) = $40 + $20 = $60 per red tie

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the re

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
- The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties.
- He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.

Step 1: Calculate the number of blue ties John bought.
Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can divide the total cost by the cost per tie to find the number of blue ties.
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties

Step 2: Calculate the number of red ties John bought.
Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is twice the number of blue ties.
Number of red ties = 2 × 5 = 10 red ties

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the red ties.
The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is $40 + (50% of $40) = $40 + $20 = $60 per red tie.
