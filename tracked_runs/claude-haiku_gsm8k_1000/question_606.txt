Question:
Three friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets to the fair. They also spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. They also went on 2 different rides which costs $33 for each ride. If they agreed to split all the costs evenly, how much did each of them pay?


Reference Answer:
They spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $<<20.25-4.5=15.75>>15.75 on food.
They spent $33 x 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66 for the rides.
They spent a total of $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.
So each of them paid $102/3 = $<<102/3=34>>34.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- The three friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets to the fair.
- They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets.
- They went on 2 different rides, which cost $33 for each ride.
- They agreed to split all the costs evenly.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the tickets per person.
Cost of 3 tickets = $20.25
Cost of 1 ticket = $20.25 / 3 = $6.75
Cost of tickets per person = $6.75

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the food.
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the rides.
Cost of 2 rides = $33 × 2 = $66

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the fair.
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost

- They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets.
- They went on 2 different rides, which cost $33 for each ride.
- They agreed to split all the costs evenly.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the tickets.
Cost of 3 tickets = $20.25
Cost of 1 ticket = $20.25 / 3 = $6.75

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the food.
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the fair visit.
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + ($33 × 2) = $102.00

Step 4: Calculate the amount each friend paid.

- They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets.
- They went on 2 different rides, which cost $33 for each ride.
- They agreed to split all the costs evenly.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the tickets.
Cost of 3 tickets = $20.25

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the food.
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the fair visit.
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + ($33 × 2) = $102.00

Step 4: Calculate the amount each friend paid.
Amount paid by each friend = Total cost / 3
Amount paid by each friend = $102.00 / 3
