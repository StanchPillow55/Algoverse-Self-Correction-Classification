Question ID: 803

Question:
Kris is trying to earn a video game achievement for playing a total of 30 hours. If Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks then plays for 2 hours every day for a week, how many hours does she still need to play to earn the achievement?


Reference Answer:
Two weeks is the same as 2 weeks * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 days.
So playing for half an hour every day means Kris will have played for 0.5 hours * 14 days = <<0.5*14=7>>7 hours.
Playing for 2 hours every day for another week will be an additional 2 hours * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 hours.
She therefore still needs to play 30 – 7 – 14 = <<30-7-14=9>>9 hours.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the video game achievement.
- Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks.
- Kris then plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week.

Step 1: Calculate the total hours Kris has played so far.
Hours played in the first 2 weeks:
- 0.5 hours per day × 14 days = 7 hours

Hours played in the third week:
- 2 hours per day × 7 days = 14 hours

Total hours played so far:
- 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

Step 2: Calculate the remaining hours Kris needs to play.
Total hours needed for the achievement - Total hours played so far = Remaining hours to play
- 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the video game achievement.

Final answer: Kris still needs
