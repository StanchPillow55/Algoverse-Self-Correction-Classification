Question:
Sandy wants to lose as much weight as Joey does but needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. If Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, how many weeks will it take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight?


Reference Answer:
Joey loses 8 pounds / 4 weeks = <<8/4=2>>2 pounds per week.
In order to match Joey, Sandy should lose 2 pounds / 4 = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 of a pound per week.
To find the number of weeks it will take, divide the number of pounds by the rate of weight loss: 8 pounds / 0.5 pounds/week = <<8/0.5=16>>16 weeks

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the weight loss of Sandy and Joey, and then use it to calculate the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

Given information:
- Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week.
- Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.

Step 1: Find the amount of weight Joey loses in a single week.
Joey's weight loss per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Step 2: Find the amount of weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks.
Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we can say that Sandy loses the same amount of weight as Joey in 4 weeks.
Sandy's weight loss in 4 weeks = Joey's weight loss in 1 week = 2 pounds

Step 3: Find the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey (8 pounds).
Since Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, we can set

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week.
- Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.

Step 1: Calculate how much weight Joey loses in a single week.
Joey's weight loss per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Step 2: Calculate how much weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks.
Sandy's weight loss in 4 weeks = Joey's weight loss in 1 week
Sandy's weight loss in 4 weeks = 2 pounds

Step 3: Calculate how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey (8 pounds).
Sandy's weight loss per week = Joey's weight loss per week / 4 = 2 pounds / 4 = 0.5 pounds per week
Time for Sandy to lose 8 pounds = 8 pounds / 0.5 pounds per week = 16 weeks

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of
