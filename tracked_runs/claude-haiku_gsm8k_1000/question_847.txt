Question ID: 487

Question:
Uncle Ben has four horses. Each horse can consume five pounds of oats per meal. He feeds his horses twice a day. If one bag contains 50-pounds of oats,  how many bags of oats does he need to fed his horses for five days?


Reference Answer:
The four horses can consume 4 x 5 pounds = <<4*5=20>>20 pounds of oats per meal.
Thus, they can consume 2 x 20 pounds = <<2*20=40>>40 pounds of oats a day.
So, uncle Ben needs 5 x 40 pounds = <<5*40=200>>200 pounds of oats to fed his horses for five days.
Therefore, uncle Ben needs 200/50 = <<200/50=4>>4 bags of oats.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of oats required to feed the horses for five days and then calculate the number of bags needed.

Given information:
- Uncle Ben has 4 horses.
- Each horse can consume 5 pounds of oats per meal.
- The horses are fed twice a day.
- One bag contains 50 pounds of oats.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of oats required per day.
Amount of oats per horse per meal = 5 pounds
Number of meals per day = 2
Total amount of oats per horse per day = 5 pounds × 2 meals = 10 pounds
Total amount of oats required for all 4 horses per day = 10 pounds × 4 horses = 40 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of oats required for five days.
Total amount of oats required for five days = 40 pounds × 5 days = 200 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the number of bags of oats needed.
Number of bags of oats needed = Total amount of oats required / Amount of oats

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Uncle Ben has 4 horses
- Each horse can consume 5 pounds of oats per meal
- He feeds his horses twice a day
- One bag contains 50 pounds of oats
- We need to find how many bags of oats he needs for 5 days

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by the horses per day.
Oats consumed per horse per meal = 5 pounds
Oats consumed per horse per day = 5 pounds x 2 meals = 10 pounds
Total oats consumed by 4 horses per day = 10 pounds x 4 horses = 40 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by the horses for 5 days.
Total oats consumed for 5 days = 40 pounds x 5 days = 200 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the number of bags of oats needed.
Number of bags of oats needed = Total oats consumed / Oats per bag
Number of bags of oats needed =
