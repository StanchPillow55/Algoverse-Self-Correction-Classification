Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 6 girls in the park.
- The number of boys in the park is twice the number of girls.

Step 1: Find the number of boys in the park.
Number of boys = 2 × Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 × 6 = 12 boys

Step 2: Find the total number of kids in the park.
Total number of kids = Number of girls + Number of boys
Total number of kids = 6 + 12 = 18 kids

Therefore, the final answer is:
There are 18 kids in the park.
