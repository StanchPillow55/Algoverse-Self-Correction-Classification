Question ID: 250

Question:
Each class in a school has 20 students. There are 3 classes. The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. The first class has 15 girls. The second class has 12 girls. How many boys are in the third class?


Reference Answer:
The school has 60 students because 3 x 20 = <<3*20=60>>60
The school has 30 girls because 60 x .5 = <<60*.5=30>>30
The third class has 3 girls because 30 - 15 - 12 = <<30-15-12=3>>3
The third class has 17 boys because 20 - 3 = <<20-3=17>>17

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of boys and girls in the third class.

Given information:
- Each class has 20 students.
- There are 3 classes in the school.
- The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls.
- The first class has 15 girls.
- The second class has 12 girls.

Step 1: Find the total number of students in the school.
Total number of students = Number of students per class × Number of classes
Total number of students = 20 × 3 = 60 students

Step 2: Find the number of boys and girls in the school.
Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls is equal.
Number of boys = Number of girls = 60 / 2 = 30 students

Step 3: Find the number of girls in the first two classes.
Number of girls in the first class = 15
Number of girls in the second class = 12
Total number of girls in the first two classes = 15 + 12 = 27 students

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Each class has 20 students.
2. There are 3 classes in total.
3. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
4. The first class has 15 girls.
5. The second class has 12 girls.

To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of students in the school.
2. Calculate the total number of girls in the school.
3. Calculate the total number of boys in the school.
4. Subtract the number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys to get the number of boys in the third class.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of students in the school.
Total students = 3 classes x 20 students per class = 60 students

Step 2: Calculate the total number of girls in the school.
Total girls = 15 (in first class) + 12 (in second class) + (60 - 15 - 12) = 33 girls
