Question ID: 612

Question:
The basketball team went to the steakhouse to eat dinner.  The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.  The second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size.  The third player ate a one-pound steak.  And the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals.  In total, how many ounces of meat were consumed by the team?


Reference Answer:
The second player consumed 8 1-ounce beef tips, for a total weight of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 ounces.
Thus, the total combined weight includes 6 ounces from the first player, 8 ounces from the second player, and 1 pound, which is 16 ounces, from the third player, for a combined total of 6+8+16=<<6+8+16=30>>30 ounces.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of meat consumed by the basketball team.

Given information:
- The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
- The second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size.
- The third player ate a one-pound steak.
- The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of meat consumed by the first player.
Amount of meat consumed by the first player = 6 ounces

Step 2: Calculate the amount of meat consumed by the second player.
Amount of meat consumed by the second player = 8 beef tips Ã— 1 ounce per beef tip = 8 ounces

Step 3: Calculate the amount of meat consumed by the third player.
Amount of meat consumed by the third player = 1 pound = 16 ounces

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of meat consumed by the team.
Total amount of meat consumed = Amount of meat consumed by the first player + Amount of meat consumed by the second player + Amount of meat consumed by the third player

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
   * Ounces of meat consumed by the first player: 6 ounces

2. The second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size.
   * Ounces of meat consumed by the second player: 8 ounces

3. The third player ate a one-pound steak.
   * 1 pound = 16 ounces
   * Ounces of meat consumed by the third player: 16 ounces

4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, let's add up the total ounces of meat consumed by the team:
* Total ounces of meat consumed = 6 ounces + 8 ounces + 16 ounces = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team at the steakhouse was 30 ounces.
