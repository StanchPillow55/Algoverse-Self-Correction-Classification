Question:
Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125. In April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half in order to hit his target. How much does he have to save for each day in the second half of the month?


Reference Answer:
Let the amount he has to save for each day of the second half of April be y
Since y is twice as much what he saved in each day of the first half, he saved y/2 in each day of the first half
April has 30 days, 15 days in each half, so he is saving (15*(y/2)) in the 1st half, (15*y) in the 2nd half to give (15*(y/2))+(15*y)=$1125
Solving the equation gives 15(3y/2) = $1125
45y/2 = $1125
y = $1125*(2/45)
y = $<<50=50>>50
#### 50

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the amount Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to hit his monthly saving target.

Given information:
- Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125.
- In April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half.

Step 1: Determine the number of days in April.
April has 30 days.

Step 2: Determine the number of days in the first half and second half of April.
First half of April: 15 days
Second half of April: 15 days

Step 3: Calculate the amount Elvis needs to save each day in the first half of April.
Total saving target for the month: $1125
Amount to be saved in the first half: $1125 / 2 = $562.50
Amount to be saved each day in the first half: $562.50 / 15 days = $37.50

Step 4: Calculate the amount Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April.
Amount to be saved in the second half: $1125 - $562.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125.
- In April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he saves in the first half, in order to hit his target.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Elvis needs to save in April.
Total savings target = $1125

Step 2: Divide the total savings target by the number of days in April to get the average daily savings.
Number of days in April = 30 days
Average daily savings = $1125 / 30 days = $37.50 per day

Step 3: Determine the amount Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month.
First half of the month = 15 days
Amount to save in the first half = 15 days × $37.50 per day = $562.50

Step 4: Determine the amount Elvis needs to save in the second half of the month.
Second half of the month = 15 days
Total savings target - Amount saved in first half = Amount to save in second half
