Question:
Sally received the following scores on her math quizzes: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60. Find her mean score.


Reference Answer:
Sally's total score is 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = <<50+80+80+60+40+90+100+70+60=630>>630.
Her mean score is 630 / 9/quizzes = <<630/9=70>>70/quiz.

Response:
To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

Given information:
- Sally's math quiz scores: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

Step 1: Add up all the scores.
50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

Step 2: Count the total number of scores.
There are 9 scores in total.

Step 3: Divide the sum of the scores by the total number of scores to find the mean.
Mean = Sum of scores / Total number of scores
Mean = 630 / 9
Mean = 70

Therefore, Sally's mean score on her math quizzes is 70.
