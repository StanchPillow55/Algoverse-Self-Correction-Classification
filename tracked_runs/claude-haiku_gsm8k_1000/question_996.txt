Question ID: 737

Question:
Peter wants to make different sized ice cubes with 32 ounces of water. He can make giant cubes that use 4 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 2 ounces, and small cubes that use 1/2 an ounce. If he makes 3 giant cubes, 7 medium cubes, and 8 small cubes, how many ounces of water does he have left?


Reference Answer:
The giant cubes used up 12 ounces of water because 3 times 4 equals <<3*4=12>>12.
The medium cubes used up 14 ounces of water because 7 times 2 equals <<7*2=14>>14.
The small cubes used up 4 ounces of water because 8 times 1/2 equals 4.
This means that Peter has used up 30 ounces of water because 12 plus 14 plus 4 equals 30.
Peter has 2 ounces of water left because 32 minus 30 equals <<32-30=2>>2.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Peter has 32 ounces of water
- He can make:
  - Giant cubes that use 4 ounces per cube
  - Medium cubes that use 2 ounces per cube
  - Small cubes that use 1/2 ounce per cube
- He makes:
  - 3 giant cubes
  - 7 medium cubes
  - 8 small cubes

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of water used for the giant cubes.
Water used for giant cubes = 3 cubes × 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of water used for the medium cubes.
Water used for medium cubes = 7 cubes × 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water used for the small cubes.
Water used for small cubes = 8 cubes × 1/2 ounce per cube =
