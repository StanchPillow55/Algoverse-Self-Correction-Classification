Question ID: 889

Question:
Joelle has 5 orchids and 4 African daisies on her balcony.  If the orchids have 5 petals and daisies have 10 petals, how many more petals do the daisies have compared to the orchids?


Reference Answer:
The number of petals on orchids is 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25.
The number of petals on daisies is 4 x 10 = <<4*10=40>>40.
Daisy petals outnumber orchid petals by 40 - 25 = <<40-25=15>>15.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Joelle has 5 orchids and 4 African daisies on her balcony.
- Orchids have 5 petals each.
- Daisies have 10 petals each.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of petals on the orchids.
Number of orchids × Number of petals per orchid = Total petals on orchids
5 × 5 = 25 petals

Step 2: Calculate the total number of petals on the daisies.
Number of daisies × Number of petals per daisy = Total petals on daisies
4 × 10 = 40 petals

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the total petals on the daisies and the total petals on the orchids.
Total petals on daisies - Total petals on orchids = Difference in petals
40 - 25 = 15 petals

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.
