Question:
Walter bought 60 apples from the store. He ate 2/5 of them and gave his sister 25% of the remaining number. If he then sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each, how much money did he receive?


Reference Answer:
From the 60 apples that Walter bought, he ate 2/5*60=<<2/5*60=24>>24 apples
The number of apples remaining was 60-24=<<60-24=36>>36
Walter gave 25/100*36=<<25/100*36=9>>9 apples to his sister.
He remained with 36-9=<<36-9=27>>27 apples.
He then sold the apples for 27*$3=$<<27*3=81>>81 to his uncle.

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Walter bought 60 apples from the store.
- He ate 2/5 of the apples.
- He gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples.
- He then sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apples Walter ate.
2/5 of 60 apples = 2/5 × 60 = 24 apples

Step 2: Calculate the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 apples.
Remaining apples = 60 - 24 = 36 apples

Step 3: Calculate the number of apples Walter gave to his sister.
25% of 36 apples = 0.25 × 36 = 9 apples

Step 4: Calculate the number of apples remaining after Walter gave 9 apples to his sister.
Remaining apples = 36 - 9 = 27 apples

Step 5: Calculate the amount of money Walter received from

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Walter bought 60 apples from the store.

2. He ate 2/5 of the apples:
   * 2/5 of 60 = 0.4 x 60 = 24 apples eaten

3. Remaining apples after he ate:
   * 60 - 24 = 36 apples

4. He gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples:
   * 25% of 36 = 0.25 x 36 = 9 apples given to his sister

5. Remaining apples after giving to his sister:
   * 36 - 9 = 27 apples

6. He sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each:
   * 27 apples x $3 per apple = $81

Therefore, the amount of money Walter received from selling the remaining apples to his uncle is $81.
