Question:
Milly needs to return a book she decided was really boring. The book weighs 4 pounds, cost $32, and needs to be returned to a distribution center 20 miles away. If the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile, and Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, how much money will Milly lose?


Reference Answer:
Milly will get back from Amazon $32 * .75 = $<<32*.75=24>>24 once the book is returned.
She will lose $32 - 24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 when the book is returned.
The first part of the shipping cost is $0.35 per pound * 4 pounds = $<<0.35*4=1.40>>1.40
The second part of the shipping cost is $0.08 per mile * 20 miles = $<<0.08*20=1.60>>1.60
Milly loses $8 + $1.40 + $1.60 = $<<8+1.4+1.6=11>>11

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of returning the book and the refund amount from Amazon, then find the difference between the two to determine the amount of money Milly will lose.

Given information:
- The book weighs 4 pounds.
- The book cost $32.
- The distribution center is 20 miles away.
- The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.
- Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.

Step 1: Calculate the shipping cost.
Shipping cost per pound = $0.35
Shipping cost per mile = $0.08
Total shipping distance = 20 miles
Total shipping cost = (4 pounds × $0.35) + (20 miles × $0.08) = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Step 2: Calculate the refund amount from Amazon.
Refund percentage = 75%
Refund amount = $32 × 0.75 = $24.00

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Milly will

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The book weighs 4 pounds
- The book cost $32
- The book needs to be returned to a distribution center 20 miles away
- The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile
- Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price

Step 1: Calculate the shipping cost.
Shipping cost per pound = $0.35
Shipping cost per mile = $0.08
Total shipping distance = 20 miles
Total shipping cost = (4 pounds × $0.35) + (20 miles × $0.08) = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Step 2: Calculate the refund amount from Amazon.
Amazon refund = 75% of $32 = 0.75 × $32 = $24.00

Step 3: Calculate the total loss.
Total loss = Book cost - Amazon refund + Shipping cost
Total loss = $32 - $24.00 + $3.00
