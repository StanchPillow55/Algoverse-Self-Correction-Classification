Question ID: 10

Question:
A new program had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, but then reduced by 30% in the third month. How many downloads did the program have total over the three months?


Reference Answer:
The number of downloads of the program in the second month increased to 3*60 = <<3*60=180>>180
In the first two months, the total number of downloads of the program was 180+60 = <<180+60=240>>240
In the third month, the number of downloads of the program reduced by 30/100*180 = <<30/100*180=54>>54
There were 180-54 = <<180-54=126>>126 downloads in the third month.
In the three months, the total number of downloads of the program was 126+240 = <<126+240=366>>366

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The program had 60 downloads in the first month.
- The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month.
- The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% compared to the second month.

Step 1: Calculate the number of downloads in the second month.
Downloads in the second month = 3 × Downloads in the first month
Downloads in the second month = 3 × 60 = 180 downloads

Step 2: Calculate the number of downloads in the third month.
Downloads in the third month = Downloads in the second month - (Downloads in the second month × 0.30)
Downloads in the third month = 180 - (180 × 0.30) = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads

Step 3: Calculate the total number of downloads over the three months.
Total downloads = Downloads in the first month + Downloads in the second month + Downloads in the third month
Total downloads = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366
