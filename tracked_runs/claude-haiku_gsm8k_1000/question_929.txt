Question:
Charisma works for 8 hours every day.  She has a timer to remind her to get up and walk for 5 minutes every hour she’s at work.  After 5 days at the office, how many minutes has she walked?


Reference Answer:
She works 8 hours every day and she sets a timer to walk 5 minutes every hour for a total of 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40 minutes of walking
If she walks 40 minutes a day while at the office then over 5 days she walks 40*5 = <<40*5=200>>200 minutes
#### 200

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Charisma works for 8 hours every day.
- She has a timer to remind her to get up and walk for 5 minutes every hour she's at work.
- We need to find out how many minutes she has walked after 5 days at the office.

Step 1: Calculate the number of times Charisma gets up and walks per day.
Since she walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours per day, she gets up and walks 8 times per day.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of minutes Charisma walks per day.
Since she walks for 5 minutes each time, the total number of minutes she walks per day is:
8 times × 5 minutes = 40 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of minutes Charisma walks over 5 days.
Since she walks for 40 minutes per day, the total number of minutes she walks over 5 days is:
40 minutes × 5 days = 200 minutes
