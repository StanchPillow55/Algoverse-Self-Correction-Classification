Question ID: 551

Question:
Carly wants to treat her friends. She orders five hamburgers at $4 each, ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each pack, and five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each can.  How much change does Carly get back if she gives one fifty-dollar bill?


Reference Answer:
The cost of 5 hamburgers is 5 x $4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
The cost of 10 packs of potato fries is 10 x $0.30 = $<<10*0.3=3>>3.
And, the cost of 5 cans of fruit drinks is 5 x $2 = $<<5*2=10>>10.
Thus, the total cost is $20 + $3 + $10 = $<<20+3+10=33>>33.
Therefore, Carly gets a change of $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carly orders 5 hamburgers at $4 each
- Carly orders 10 packs of potato fries at $0.30 each
- Carly orders 5 cans of fruit drinks at $2 each
- Carly pays with one fifty-dollar bill

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items Carly ordered.
Cost of hamburgers = 5 × $4 = $20
Cost of potato fries = 10 × $0.30 = $3
Cost of fruit drinks = 5 × $2 = $10
Total cost = $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

Step 2: Calculate the amount of change Carly will receive.
Carly paid with one fifty-dollar bill, so the amount paid is $50.
Change = Amount paid - Total cost
Change = $50 - $33 = $17

Therefore, the change Carly will receive is $17.
