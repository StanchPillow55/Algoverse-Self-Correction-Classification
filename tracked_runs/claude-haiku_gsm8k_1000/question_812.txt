Question ID: 108

Question:
Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?


Reference Answer:
Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.
He had cooked too many, so he must have needed 115 – 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double last year’s amount.
Therefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year.
- He actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to.
- He dropped 5 cookies while putting them out to cool.
- He now has a total of 110 cookies.

Let's start by finding out how many cookies Henry meant to bake this year.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies Henry meant to bake this year.
Total cookies baked = 110 + 5 (dropped cookies) = 115 cookies
Henry baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so:
Cookies Henry meant to bake = 115 - 15 = 100 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so:
Cookies Henry baked last year = 100 / 2 = 50 cookies

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Final answer: Henry baked 50 cookies last year.
