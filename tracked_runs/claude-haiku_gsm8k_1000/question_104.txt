Question ID: 1083

Question:
The bananas at the supermarket cost $0.80 each, or a bunch for $3.00.  Jenny buys 10 bunches that average 4 bananas per bunch. How much money, in dollars, did she save by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually?


Reference Answer:
Ten bunches makes 10*3=$<<10*3=30>>30.
There are 10*4=<<10*4=40>>40 bananas.
40 bananas would cost 40*0.80=$<<40*0.80=32>>32 individually.
She saved 32-30=<<32-30=2>>2 dollars

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and the cost of buying them in bunches, then find the difference to determine the amount of money saved.

Given information:
- Bananas cost $0.80 each or $3.00 per bunch.
- Jenny buys 10 bunches that average 4 bananas per bunch.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.
Number of bananas = 10 bunches × 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas
Cost of buying 40 bananas individually = 40 × $0.80 = $32.00

Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.
Cost of buying 10 bunches = 10 × $3.00 = $30.00

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money saved by buying the bananas in bunches.
Amount saved = Cost of buying the bananas individually - Cost of buying the bananas in bunches
Amount saved = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Jenny save
