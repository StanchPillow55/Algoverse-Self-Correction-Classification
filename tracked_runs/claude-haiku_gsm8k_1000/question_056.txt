Question ID: 354

Question:
Annabelle is saving for a phone that costs $400. She already has $80 in her savings. Her first job, where she earns $10 per hour, pays her for 20 hours of work. She is also paid for 15 hours of work at her second job, where she earns $5 an hour. In dollars, how much money does Annabelle still need to save?


Reference Answer:
Subtracting Annabelle’s initial savings shows that she still needs to save $400 – $80 = $<<400-80=320>>320.
From her first job, she earns $10 * 20 hours = $<<10*20=200>>200.
From her second job, she earns $5 * 15 hours = $<<5*15=75>>75.
She therefore still needs to save $320 – $200 – $75 = $<<320-200-75=45>>45.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The phone costs $400
- Annabelle already has $80 in her savings
- Her first job pays $10 per hour for 20 hours of work
- Her second job pays $5 per hour for 15 hours of work

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Annabelle earns from her two jobs.
First job earnings: $10 per hour x 20 hours = $200
Second job earnings: $5 per hour x 15 hours = $75
Total earnings = $200 + $75 = $275

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Annabelle has saved so far.
Money already in savings: $80
Money earned from jobs: $275
Total money saved = $80 + $275 = $355

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save.
Total cost of the phone: $400
Total money saved: $355
Money still needed to save = $400 - $355 = $45

Therefore, Annabelle still
