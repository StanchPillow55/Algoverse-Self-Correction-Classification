Question ID: 753

Question:
Jeff owns a catering company.  During a recent event, he sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for the party.  When they were returned, 10 glasses were broken as well as 6 plates.  How many glasses and plates does Jeff have now?


Reference Answer:
He had 8 dozen glasses so he had 8*12 = <<8*12=96>>96 glasses
He had 4 dozen plates so he had 4*12 = <<4*12=48>>48 plates
10 glasses were broken and he started with 96 so he now has 96-10= 86 glasses
6 plates were broken and he started with 48 so he now has 48-6 = <<48-6=42>>42
All total he has 86 glasses and 42 plates so 86+42 = <<86+42=128>>128 glasses and plates
#### 128

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for the party.
- 10 glasses were broken and 6 plates were broken.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of glasses and plates sent for the party.
Glasses sent = 8 dozen = 8 × 12 = 96 glasses
Plates sent = 4 dozen = 4 × 12 = 48 plates

Step 2: Calculate the number of glasses and plates that were returned.
Glasses returned = Total glasses sent - Broken glasses
Glasses returned = 96 - 10 = 86 glasses

Plates returned = Total plates sent - Broken plates
Plates returned = 48 - 6 = 42 plates

Step 3: Calculate the number of glasses and plates Jeff has now.
Glasses Jeff has now = Glasses returned = 86 glasses
Plates Jeff has now = Plates returned = 42 plates

Therefore, the final answer is:
Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates
