Question ID: 1151

Question:
Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours. If Sid then traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours, what's the average speed he was traveling?


Reference Answer:
After traveling 110 miles at first, Sid traveled 110 + 140 = <<110+140=250>>250 miles in total
Since he spends 3 hours traveling after the first 2 hours, he traveled 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 hours
On average, Sid traveled 250 miles / 5 hours = <<250/5=50>>50 miles per hour.
#### 50

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken, and then calculate the average speed.

Given information:
- Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours.
- Sid then traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled.
Total distance traveled = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total time taken.
Total time taken = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Step 3: Calculate the average speed.
Average speed = Total distance traveled / Total time taken
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

Therefore, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour.
