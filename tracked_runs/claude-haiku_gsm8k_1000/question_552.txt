Question ID: 1109

Question:
Three of the women at the cocktail party are wearing 4 inch heels and three are wearing 2 inch heels. What is the average height of heels at this party?


Reference Answer:
First find the total number of inches from the 4-inch heels: 3 women * 4 inches/woman = <<3*4=12>>12 inches
Then find the total number of inches from the 2-inch heels: 3 women * 2 inches/woman = <<3*2=6>>6 inches
Then add the total number of inches from each group of heels to find the overall total: 12 inches + 6 inches = <<12+6=18>>18 inches
Then find the total number of women at the party: 3 women + 3 women = <<3+3=6>>6 women
Then divide the total number of heel inches by the number of women to find the average heel height per woman: 18 inches / 6 women = <<18/6=3>>3 inches / woman

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the average height of the heels worn by the women at the cocktail party.

Given information:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels.

Step 1: Calculate the total height of the heels.
Total height of heels = (3 × 4 inches) + (3 × 2 inches) = 12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches

Step 2: Calculate the number of women at the party.
Number of women = 3 (wearing 4-inch heels) + 3 (wearing 2-inch heels) = 6 women

Step 3: Calculate the average height of the heels.
Average height of heels = Total height of heels / Number of women
Average height of heels = 18 inches / 6 women = 3 inches

Therefore, the average height of the heels at the cocktail party is 3 inches.
