Question:
My mom went to a gardening shop. She bought a set of pots for $19 and a sack of garden soil for $26. At checkout, she used a coupon for $7 off. How much money did my mom spend at the gardening shop?


Reference Answer:
The total cost of the pots and a sack of garden soil is $19 + $26 = $<<19+26=45>>45.
So, my mom spent $45 - $7 = $<<45-7=38>>38 at the gardening store.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Your mom bought a set of pots for $19.
- Your mom bought a sack of garden soil for $26.
- Your mom used a coupon for $7 off at checkout.

To find the total amount of money your mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items before the coupon.
Total cost of items = Cost of pots + Cost of garden soil
Total cost of items = $19 + $26 = $45

Step 2: Apply the coupon discount to the total cost.
Discount from coupon = $7
Total amount spent = Total cost of items - Discount from coupon
Total amount spent = $45 - $7 = $38

Therefore, the total amount of money your mom spent at the gardening shop is $38.

Final answer: Your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop.
