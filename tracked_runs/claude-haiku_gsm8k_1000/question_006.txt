Question ID: 245

Question:
There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. If both aquariums have the same number of fish in them, how many fish are there in each aquarium?


Reference Answer:
The difference between the number of snails is 32 - 4 = <<32-4=28>>28 snails.
There are 28/2 = <<28/2=14>>14 fish in both aquariums.
There are 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 fish in each aquarium.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium.
- The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of fish in each aquarium.

Step 1: Find the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums.
Difference in snails = 32 - 4 = 28 snails

Step 2: The difference in snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums.
Difference in snails = 2 × (total fish in both aquariums)
28 = 2 × (2x)
28 = 4x

Step 3: Solve for the number of fish in each aquarium.
4x = 28
x = 7

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

Final answer: There are 7
