Question ID: 146

Question:
Johnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.  He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, and another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces.  How many blocks does Johnny pick up if he picks up all the legos?


Reference Answer:
The first set had 500 pieces, and the second set had 3 times as many as the first set, so the second set has 500*3=<<500*3=1500>>1500 pieces
The third set had one-quarter of the 500 pieces, so that means it had 500*.25= <<500*.25=125>>125 pieces
In total, that means Johnny picked up 500 + 1500+ 125= <<500+1500+125=2125>>2125 blocks
#### 2,125

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Johnny has a Lego boxed set with 500 pieces.
- He has another Lego boxed set that has 3 times more pieces than the 500-piece set.
- He has another Lego boxed set that has 1/4 the number of pieces of the 500-piece set.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces in the second Lego boxed set.
Number of pieces in the second set = 3 × 500 = 1,500 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces in the third Lego boxed set.
Number of pieces in the third set = 1/4 × 500 = 125 pieces

Step 3: Calculate the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up.
Total number of Lego pieces = 500 + 1,500 + 125 = 2,125 pieces

Therefore, Johnny picks up a total of 2,125 Lego pieces.

Final answer: Johnny picks up 2,125

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Lego boxed set 1 has 500 pieces
- Lego boxed set 2 has 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece set
- Lego boxed set 3 has 1/4 the number of pieces as the 500 piece set

Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces in Lego boxed set 2.
Lego boxed set 2 has 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece set.
Number of pieces in Lego boxed set 2 = 500 × 3 = 1,500 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces in Lego boxed set 3.
Lego boxed set 3 has 1/4 the number of pieces as the 500 piece set.
Number of pieces in Lego boxed set 3 = 500 ÷ 4 = 125 pieces

Step 3: Calculate the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first lego boxed set has 500 pieces.

2. The second lego boxed set has 3 times more pieces than the first one. 
   * 3 x 500 = 1,500 pieces

3. The third lego boxed set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first one.
   * 1/4 x 500 = 125 pieces

4. To find the total number of pieces, we add up the pieces from all three sets:
   * 500 + 1,500 + 125 = 2,125 pieces

Therefore, the total number of lego pieces that Johnny picks up is 2,125.
