Question ID: 564

Question:
In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night before going to sleep. In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. If she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, how many pages did she read in two weeks?


Reference Answer:
Every night, Judy reads 15 minutes/1.5 minutes = <<15/1.5=10>>10 sets of 2 pages.
So, she read 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 pages every night in the first week.
In the first week, she reads a total of 20 x 7 = <<20*7=140>>140 pages.
Therefore, she read a total of 140 + 100 = <<140+100=240>>240 pages in two weeks.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks.

Given information:
- In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night before going to sleep.
- In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.
- Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week.
Number of minutes read in the first week = 15 minutes per night × 7 nights = 105 minutes
Number of pages read in the first week = (105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per 2 pages) × 2 pages = 140 pages

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks.
Total pages read in two weeks = Pages read in the first week + Pages read in the second week
Total pages read in two weeks = 140 pages + 100 pages = 240 pages

Therefore, Judy read a total of 240 pages in two weeks.
