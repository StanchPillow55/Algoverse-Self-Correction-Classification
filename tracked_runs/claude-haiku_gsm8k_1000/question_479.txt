Question:
Nate's dog can dig six holes a day. He digs for 14 days while Nate is on vacation. When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. How many weeks does it take him to fill in all the holes?


Reference Answer:
First find the number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation: 14 days * 6 holes/day = <<14*6=84>>84 holes
Then find the net number of holes Nate fill in each day: 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = <<9-6=3>>3 holes/day
Then divide the total number of holes by the daily decrease in the number of holes to find the number of days Nate spends filling in holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = <<84/3=28>>28 days
Then divide the number of days by the number of days per week to convert the answer to weeks: 28 days / 7 days/week = <<28/7=4>>4 weeks

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's vacation, and then calculate how long it will take Nate to fill in all the holes.

Given information:
- Nate's dog can dig 6 holes a day.
- The dog digs for 14 days while Nate is on vacation.
- When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day.
- The dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's vacation.
Number of holes dug per day × Number of days = Total number of holes dug
6 holes × 14 days = 84 holes

Step 2: Calculate the net number of holes that Nate needs to fill in.
Total number of holes dug - Number of holes filled in per day = Net number of holes to fill
84 holes - 9 holes per day = 75 holes

Step 3: Calculate the number of days it will take Nate to fill in all the holes.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Nate's dog can dig 6 holes per day.
- The dog digs for 14 days while Nate is on vacation.
- When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes per day.
- The dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate was on vacation.
Number of holes dug per day × Number of days = Total holes dug
6 holes/day × 14 days = 84 holes

Step 2: Calculate the number of holes Nate needs to fill in.
Total holes dug = 84 holes

Step 3: Calculate the net number of holes filled in per day.
Holes filled in per day - Holes dug per night = Net holes filled in per day
9 holes/day - 6 holes/night = 3 holes/day

Step 4: Calculate the number of days it will take Nate to fill in all the holes.
