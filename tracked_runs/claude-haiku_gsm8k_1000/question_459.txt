Question ID: 23

Question:
A candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour that it burns. How many centimeters shorter will a candle be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM?


Reference Answer:
The candle burns for 5 - 1 = <<5-1=4>>4 hours.
Thus, the candle will be 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 centimeters shorter.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of hours the candle burns and then multiply it by the rate at which the candle melts to find the total reduction in the candle's length.

Given information:
- The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour it burns.
- The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Step 1: Find the total number of hours the candle burns.
Time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM = 5 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total reduction in the candle's length.
Total reduction in length = Melting rate × Total burning time
Total reduction in length = 2 cm/hour × 5 hours
Total reduction in length = 10 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 10 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Final answer: The candle will be 10 centimeters shorter.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour it burns.
- The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

To find how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we need to calculate the total number of hours the candle burns and then multiply it by the melting rate.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours the candle burns.
Time period: 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM
Total hours = 5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total number of centimeters the candle melts.
Melting rate = 2 centimeters per hour
Total melting = Melting rate × Total hours
Total melting = 2 cm/hour × 4 hours = 8 centimeters

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Final answer: The can
