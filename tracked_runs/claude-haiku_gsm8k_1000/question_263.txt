Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Marcus is half of Leo's age
- Marcus is five years younger than Deanna
- Deanna is 26 years old

Step 1: Find Marcus's age.
Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna.
Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus's age = 26 - 5 = 21 years old

Step 2: Find the relationship between Marcus's age and Leo's age.
We know that Marcus is half of Leo's age.
Marcus's age = 1/2 × Leo's age
21 = 1/2 × Leo's age
Leo's age = 21 × 2 = 42 years old

Therefore, the final answer is:
Leo is 42 years old.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Marcus is half of Leo's age
- Marcus is five years younger than Deanna
- Deanna is 26 years old

Step 1: Find Marcus's age
Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus's age as:
Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus's age = 26 - 5 = 21 years old

Step 2: Find the relationship between Marcus's age and Leo's age
We know that Marcus is half of Leo's age, so we can write:
Marcus's age = 1/2 × Leo's age
21 = 1/2 × Leo's age
Leo's age = 2 × 21 = 42 years old

Therefore, the final answer is:
Leo is 42 years old.
