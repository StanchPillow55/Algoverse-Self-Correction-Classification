Question ID: 67

Question:
A treasure hunter found a buried treasure chest filled with gems. There were 175 diamonds, 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and twice the number of emeralds than the rubies.   How many of the gems were there in the chest?


Reference Answer:
There were 175 - 35 = <<175-35=140>>140 rubies in the treasure chest.
There were 140 x 2 = <<140*2=280>>280 emeralds in the treasure chest.
So, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 175 + 140 + 280 = <<175+140+280=595>>595.
#### 595

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There are 175 diamonds in the treasure chest.
- There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds.
- There are twice the number of emeralds than the number of rubies.

Step 1: Calculate the number of rubies.
Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35
Number of rubies = 175 - 35 = 140 rubies

Step 2: Calculate the number of emeralds.
Number of emeralds = 2 × Number of rubies
Number of emeralds = 2 × 140 = 280 emeralds

Step 3: Calculate the total number of gems in the treasure chest.
Total number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds
Total number of gems = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 gems

Therefore, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 595.

Final answer: There are 595 gems in the treasure chest.
