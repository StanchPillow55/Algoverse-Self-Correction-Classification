Question ID: 30

Question:
Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. If their total age now is 162, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.


Reference Answer:
The total ratio representing their ages is 7+11= <<7+11=18>>18
Since the fraction of the ratio that represents Allen's age is 11/18, Allen's current age is 11/18*162 = <<11/18*162=99>>99
If Allen is currently 99 years old, in 10 years he will be 99+10 = <<99+10=109>>109 years old
#### 109

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find Allen's age based on the given information and then calculate his age 10 years from now.

Given information:
- The ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages is 7:11.
- The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162.

Step 1: Find Darrell's age and Allen's age.
Let Darrell's age be x and Allen's age be y.
According to the given ratio, we have:
x : y = 7 : 11
x = 7k and y = 11k, where k is a constant.

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so:
x + y = 162
7k + 11k = 162
18k = 162
k = 9

Therefore, Darrell's age (x) = 7k = 7 × 9 = 63
Allen's age (y) = 11k = 11 × 9 = 99

Step 2: Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.
Allen's age 10 years from now

Response:
Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- The ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages is 7:11.
- The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162.

Step 1: Find Darrell's age and Allen's age.
Let Darrell's age be x and Allen's age be y.
According to the given ratio, we have:
x : y = 7 : 11
x = 7k and y = 11k, where k is a constant.

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so:
x + y = 162
7k + 11k = 162
18k = 162
k = 9

Therefore, Darrell's age (x) = 7 × 9 = 63 years
Allen's age (y) = 11 × 9 = 99 years

Step 2: Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.
Allen's age 10 years from now = Allen's current age + 10
Allen's age 10 years from now =

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages is 7:11.
- The total of their ages is 162.

Step 1: Let's represent Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, where x is a common factor.

Step 2: We know that the total of their ages is 162, so we can set up an equation:
7x + 11x = 162
18x = 162
x = 9

Step 3: Now we can calculate Darrell's age and Allen's age:
Darrell's age = 7x = 7 × 9 = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11 × 9 = 99

Step 4: To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we simply add 10 to his current age:
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.
