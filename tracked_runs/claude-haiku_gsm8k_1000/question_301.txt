Question:
John has 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each.  Each bedroom has 2 windows each.  There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.  How many total windows are there between the houses?


Reference Answer:
Each house has 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 windows for the bedrooms
So each house has 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10 windows
So the total number of windows is 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 windows
#### 20

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John has 2 houses
- Each house has 3 bedrooms
- Each bedroom has 2 windows
- Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms

Step 1: Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms for each house.
Number of bedrooms per house = 3
Number of windows per bedroom = 2
Number of windows in bedrooms per house = 3 bedrooms × 2 windows = 6 windows

Step 2: Calculate the total number of windows in each house.
Number of windows in bedrooms per house = 6 windows
Number of additional windows per house = 4 windows
Total number of windows per house = 6 windows + 4 windows = 10 windows

Step 3: Calculate the total number of windows between the two houses.
Number of houses = 2
Total number of windows between the two houses = 2 houses × 10 windows per house = 20 windows

Therefore, the total number of windows between the two houses is 20 windows.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John has 2 houses.
2. Each house has 3 bedrooms.
3. Each bedroom has 2 windows.
4. There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

To calculate the total number of windows:

* Bedrooms:
  - Each house has 3 bedrooms
  - Each bedroom has 2 windows
  - So, each house has 3 x 2 = 6 bedroom windows
  - For 2 houses, that's 6 x 2 = 12 bedroom windows

* Additional windows:
  - Each house has 4 additional windows
  - For 2 houses, that's 4 x 2 = 8 additional windows

* Total windows:
  - Bedroom windows: 12
  - Additional windows: 8
  - Total windows = 12 + 8 = 20

Therefore, the total number of windows between the two houses is 20.
