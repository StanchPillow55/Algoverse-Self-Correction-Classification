Question ID: 167

Question:
Seth is twice as old as Brooke. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. How old is Seth?


Reference Answer:
To solve this problem, we can set up an equation where x represents Brooke’s age and 2x represents Seth’s age and noting that in two years, the sum of their ages is (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28.
Then we add all the values together, 3x + 4 = 28.
And we subtract 4 from each side, 3x +4 - 4 = 28 – 4.
Then we divide each side by 3x/3 = 24/3.
We find that x = <<8=8>>8, or Brooke’s age is 8.
Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth is 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Seth is twice as old as Brooke.
- In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.

Let's represent Brooke's current age as x.

Step 1: Express Seth's current age in terms of Brooke's age.
Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age = 2x.

Step 2: Express the sum of their ages in 2 years.
Brooke's age in 2 years = x + 2
Seth's age in 2 years = 2x + 2
Sum of their ages in 2 years = (x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 3x + 4

Step 3: Set up an equation to solve for Brooke's current age.
We know that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.
3x + 4 = 28
3x = 24
x = 8

Step 4: Calculate Seth's current age.

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Seth is twice as old as Brooke.
- In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.

Let's represent Brooke's current age as x.

Step 1: Express Seth's current age in terms of Brooke's age.
Seth's current age = 2x

Step 2: Express the sum of their ages in 2 years.
Sum of their ages in 2 years = (x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 3x + 4

Step 3: Set up the equation based on the given information.
Sum of their ages in 2 years = 28
3x + 4 = 28

Step 4: Solve the equation for x.
3x + 4 = 28
3x = 24
x = 8

Step 5: Find Seth's current age.
Seth's current age = 2x = 2 × 8 = 16

Therefore, Seth is currently 16 years old.
