Question ID: 599

Question:
A pet store currently has 5 dogs, 2 cats, and 10 birds. How many legs in total do the pets in the store have?


Reference Answer:
The dogs have 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = <<5*4=20>>20 legs.
The cats have 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = <<2*4=8>>8 legs.
The birds have 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = <<10*2=20>>20 legs.
The pets have 20 legs + 8 legs + 20 legs = <<20+8+20=48>>48 legs.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

To find the total number of legs of the pets in the store, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Given information:
- The pet store has 5 dogs, 2 cats, and 10 birds.

Step 1: Calculate the number of legs for the dogs.
Dogs have 4 legs each.
Number of legs for dogs = 5 dogs × 4 legs per dog = 20 legs

Step 2: Calculate the number of legs for the cats.
Cats have 4 legs each.
Number of legs for cats = 2 cats × 4 legs per cat = 8 legs

Step 3: Calculate the number of legs for the birds.
Birds have 2 legs each.
Number of legs for birds = 10 birds × 2 legs per bird = 20 legs

Step 4: Calculate the total number of legs for all the pets.
Total number of legs = Number of legs for dogs + Number of legs for cats + Number of legs for birds
