Question:
Tyler wants to buy a dictionary that costs $18, a dinosaur book that costs $13, and a children's cookbook that costs $8. He has saved $14 from his allowance. If Tyler earns $5 per hour, how many hours does he have to work to afford his books?


Reference Answer:
Tyler wants to purchase books that cost $18 + $13 + $8 = $<<18+13+8=39>>39.
Tyler needs $39 and currently has $14, so he needs to earn $39 - $14 = $<<39-14=25>>25.
Tyler can earn $25 at a rate of $5 per hour by doing 25 / $5 = <<25/5=5>>5 hours of work.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Determine the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:
   * Dictionary: $18
   * Dinosaur book: $13
   * Children's cookbook: $8
   * Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

2. Determine how much money Tyler has saved:
   * Tyler has saved $14 from his allowance.

3. Determine how much more money Tyler needs to buy the books:
   * Total cost of books: $39
   * Money saved: $14
   * Additional money needed: $39 - $14 = $25

4. Determine how much Tyler earns per hour:
   * Tyler earns $5 per hour.

5. Calculate how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn the additional $25:
   * Additional money needed: $25
   * Hourly rate: $5 per hour
   * Hours needed to work: $25 / $5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books he wants to

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The dictionary costs $18
- The dinosaur book costs $13
- The children's cookbook costs $8
- Tyler has saved $14 from his allowance
- Tyler earns $5 per hour

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the books.
Total cost of books = Cost of dictionary + Cost of dinosaur book + Cost of children's cookbook
Total cost of books = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Tyler still needs to buy the books.
Amount of money needed = Total cost of books - Amount saved
Amount of money needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Step 3: Calculate the number of hours Tyler needs to work to earn the remaining $25.
Number of hours needed = Amount of money needed / Hourly wage
Number of hours needed = $25 / $5 per hour = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

Final answer: Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

Step 3: Calculate how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn the remaining $25.
Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly rate
Hours needed = $25 / $5 per hour = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books he wants to buy.

Final answer: Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.
