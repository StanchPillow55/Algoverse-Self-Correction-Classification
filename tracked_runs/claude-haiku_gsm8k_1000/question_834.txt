Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes James to read 18 pages of his book.

Given information:
- It takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages of his book.
- James reads 18 pages of his book.

Step 1: Find the rate at which James reads the book.
Rate of reading = Number of pages read / Time taken to read those pages
Rate of reading = 3 pages / 10 minutes
Rate of reading = 0.3 pages per minute

Step 2: Find the time it takes James to read 18 pages.
Time taken to read 18 pages = Number of pages read / Rate of reading
Time taken to read 18 pages = 18 pages / 0.3 pages per minute
Time taken to read 18 pages = 60 minutes

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading his book before going to sleep.

Final answer: James spends 60 minutes reading his book.
