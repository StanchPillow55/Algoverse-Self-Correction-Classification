Question:
Bryce and four of his friends each ordered their own pizzas after football practice. Each pizza had 12 slices. Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. How many slices of pizza were left?


Reference Answer:
Bryce and his 4 friends each ordered a pizza with 12 slices, so there were 5 pizzas x 12 slices per pizza = <<5*12=60>>60 slices of pizza.
2/3 of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 8/12 because 2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12.
Bryce and two of his friends each ate 2/3 or 8 slices of pizza, so 3 friends x 8 slices of pizza = 24 slices of pizza.
¾ of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 9/12 because ¾ x 3/3 = 9/12.
Bryce’s two remaining friends each ate ¾ or 9 slices of pizza, so 2 friends x 9 slices = <<2*9=18>>18 slices of pizza.
Together, Bryce and his friends ate 24 + 18 = <<24+18=42>>42 slices of pizza.
Of the 60 total slices of pizza, the friends ate 42, and 60 slices – 42 slices = <<60-42=18>>18 slices of pizza were left.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bryce and 4 of his friends each ordered their own pizzas.
- Each pizza had 12 slices.
- Bryce and 2 of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
- The 2 remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizza slices ordered.
Total number of pizzas = 5 (Bryce and 4 friends)
Total number of pizza slices = 5 pizzas × 12 slices per pizza = 60 slices

Step 2: Calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and 2 of his friends.
Bryce and 2 friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
Number of slices eaten by Bryce and 2 friends = 3 pizzas × 2/3 × 12 slices per pizza = 24 slices

Step 3: Calculate the number of slices eaten by the 2 remaining friends

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. There are 5 pizzas, each with 12 slices.
   * Total number of pizza slices = 5 pizzas x 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices

2. Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   * 2/3 of 12 slices = 8 slices per pizza
   * 3 pizzas x 8 slices/pizza = 24 slices eaten

3. The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   * 3/4 of 12 slices = 9 slices per pizza
   * 2 pizzas x 9 slices/pizza = 18 slices eaten

4. Total slices eaten = 24 + 18 = 42 slices

5. Total slices left = 60 - 42 = 18 slices

Therefore, the final answer is 18 slices of pizza left.
