Question ID: 14

Question:
In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance. What percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance?


Reference Answer:
There are 20 x 20/100 = <<20*20/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance.
So, 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 students are enrolled in either jazz or hip-hop dance.
There are 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.
Hence, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
This is 12/20 x 100% = 60% of the entire students.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after the contemporary dance enrollment.
3. Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance.
4. Calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
5. Calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Step 1: Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance.
20% of 20 students = 0.20 × 20 = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.

Step 2: Calculate the number of students remaining after the contemporary dance enrollment.
Total students - Students enrolled in contemporary dance = Remaining students
20 - 4 = 16 students remaining.

Step 3: Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance.
25% of the remaining 16 students = 0.25 × 16 = 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.

Step 4: Calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
Total students - Students enrolled in contemporary dance - Students enrolled in jazz dance = Students enrolled in hip-hop dance

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We have a dance class of 20 students.

2. 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance.
   * 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.

3. The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

4. 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance.
   * 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.

5. The remaining students are 16 - 4 = 12 students.

6. The rest of the students, 12, enrolled in hip-hop dance.

7. To find the percentage of the entire class enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of hip-hop students by the total number of students:
   * 12 hip-hop students / 20 total students = 0.6 or 60%

Therefore, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop
