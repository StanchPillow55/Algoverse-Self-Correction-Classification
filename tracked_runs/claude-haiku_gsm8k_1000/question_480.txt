Question ID: 181

Question:
Sandra, the florist around the corner, is very unhappy with Fred's incomplete order delivery. Sandra had ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. To keep Sandra's business, how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?


Reference Answer:
Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies / 5 = <<200/5=40>>40 white carnations.
Sandra therefore ordered 4 * 40 = <<4*40=160>>160 red roses.
#### 160

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of red roses that Fred must deliver to keep Sandra's business.

Given information:
- Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
- Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of white carnations.
- Then, the number of red roses is 4x.
- The number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, so we can set up an equation:
5x = 200
x = 40

Now, we can find the number of red roses:
Number of red roses = 4x = 4 Ã— 40 = 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. We define the variables: x is the number of white carnations, 4x is the number of red roses, and 5x is the number of pink calla lilies.
2.
