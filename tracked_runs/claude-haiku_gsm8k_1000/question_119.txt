Question:
There are 40 pupils in a class. Half of the class likes blue. One-fourth of the remaining likes green and the rest likes yellow. How many pupils like the color yellow?


Reference Answer:
There are 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 pupils who like blue.
So, there are now 40 - 20 = <<40-20=20>>20 pupils who like either green or yellow.
Hence, 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 pupils like green.
Thus, 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 pupils like yellow.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There are 40 pupils in the class.
- Half of the class likes blue.
- One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green.
- The rest like yellow.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pupils who like blue.
Half of the class likes blue = 40 รท 2 = 20 pupils

Step 2: Calculate the number of pupils who do not like blue.
Pupils who do not like blue = 40 - 20 = 20 pupils

Step 3: Calculate the number of pupils who like green.
One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green = 20 รท 4 = 5 pupils

Step 4: Calculate the number of pupils who like yellow.
Pupils who like yellow = Pupils who do not like blue - Pupils who like green
Pupils who like yellow = 20 - 5 = 15 pupils

Therefore, the final answer is:
15 pupils like the color yellow.
