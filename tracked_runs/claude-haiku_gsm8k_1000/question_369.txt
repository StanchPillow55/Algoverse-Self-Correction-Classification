Question ID: 1138

Question:
Melanie's father opens up an animal farm starting with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Milkie Cows Limited brings him 20 cows per day and Broilers Limited brings him 10 chickens per day, for three weeks. What's the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks?


Reference Answer:
Animals were brought to the farm for three weeks, which is 3*7 = <<3*7=21>>21 days.
The number of cows brought in by Milkie is 21*20 = <<21*20=420>>420 cows
The number of chickens brought in by Broilers is 10*21 = <<10*21=210>>210 chickens.
The total number of animals on the farm is 50+20+210+420 = <<50+20+210+420=700>>700 animals

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cows and chickens on the farm after three weeks.

Given information:
- Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.
- Milkie Cows Limited brings him 20 cows per day.
- Broilers Limited brings him 10 chickens per day.
- The duration is three weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cows after three weeks.
Initial number of cows = 50
Number of cows added per day = 20
Number of days in three weeks = 21 (3 weeks × 7 days per week)
Total number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows per day × 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows on the farm after three weeks = Initial number of cows + Total number of cows added
Total number of cows = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

Step 2: Calculate the number of chickens after three weeks.
Initial number of chickens = 20
Number of chickens added per

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initial number of animals on the farm:
   - 50 cows
   - 20 chickens
   - Total: 50 + 20 = 70 animals

2. Additions to the farm over 3 weeks:
   - Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day
   - Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day
   - Over 3 weeks (21 days), the total additions are:
     - Cows: 20 cows/day x 21 days = 420 cows
     - Chickens: 10 chickens/day x 21 days = 210 chickens

3. Total number of animals on the farm after 3 weeks:
   - Initial animals: 70
   - Cows added: 420
   - Chickens added: 210
   - Total: 70 + 420 + 210 = 700 animals

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700.
