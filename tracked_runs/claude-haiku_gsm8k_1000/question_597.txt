Question ID: 1225

Question:
Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats, how many cupcakes did Carly make?


Reference Answer:
First, figure out how many total treats Carly made for her class by multiplying the number of people in the class by the number of treats per person: 5 people * 2 treats/person = <<5*2=10>>10 treats
Next, express the number of brownies in terms of the number of cupcakes based on the problem information: b = 3c - 2, where b is the number of brownies and c is the number of cupcakes
We know that b + c = 10, the total number of treats, so now we can substitute in the expression for b from the last step: 3c - 2 + c = 10
Now we combine like terms to get 4c - 2 = 10
We add two to both sides of the equation to get 4c = 12
Finally, we divide both sides by 4 to get c = 3

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
- Carly's class has 5 people.
- Each person gets 2 treats.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of cupcakes Carly made.
- Then, the number of brownies Carly made is 3x - 2.

Step 1: Find the total number of treats Carly needs to make.
Total number of treats = 2 treats per person Ã— 5 people = 10 treats

Step 2: Set up an equation to find the number of cupcakes Carly made.
Total number of treats = Number of cupcakes + Number of brownies
10 = x + (3x - 2)

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
10 = x + 3x - 2
10 = 4x - 2
12 = 4x
x = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupc
