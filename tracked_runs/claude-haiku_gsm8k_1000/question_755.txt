Sarah’s basketball games are 4 quarters that are each 12 minutes long. In the last quarter, there was a tie so the game was extended for five minutes. How long did the entire game last?


Reference Answer:
The four quarters lasted for 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 minutes.
The total time of the game for the entire game was 48 + 5 = <<48+5=53>>53 minutes.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total duration of the basketball game, including the regular game time and the extended time in the last quarter.

Given information:
- The basketball game has 4 quarters.
- Each quarter is 12 minutes long.
- The last quarter was extended for 5 minutes due to a tie.

Step 1: Calculate the total duration of the regular game time.
Duration of each quarter = 12 minutes
Total number of quarters = 4
Total regular game time = 4 × 12 minutes = 48 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the additional time added due to the extension in the last quarter.
Additional time in the last quarter = 5 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total duration of the entire game.
Total game duration = Total regular game time + Additional time in the last quarter
Total game duration = 48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

Therefore, the entire basketball game lasted 53 minutes.

Final answer: The entire basketball game lasted 53 minutes.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The basketball game has 4 quarters, and each quarter is 12 minutes long.
   * 4 quarters x 12 minutes per quarter = 48 minutes

2. In the last quarter, there was a tie, so the game was extended for 5 minutes.
   * 48 minutes (for the 4 regular quarters) + 5 minutes (for the overtime) = 53 minutes

Therefore, the entire game lasted 53 minutes.
