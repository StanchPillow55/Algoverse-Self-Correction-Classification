Question ID: 716

Question:
John makes himself a 6 egg omelet with 2 oz of cheese and an equal amount of ham.  Eggs are 75 calories each.  Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.  Ham is 40 calories per ounce.  How many calories is the omelet?


Reference Answer:
The eggs contributed 6*75=<<6*75=450>>450 calories
He eats 2*120=<<2*120=240>>240 calories of cheese
He eats 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80 calories of ham
So in total he eats 450+240+80=<<450+240+80=770>>770 calories
#### 770

Response:
Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- John makes a 6 egg omelet.
- The omelet contains 2 oz of cheese and an equal amount of ham.
- Eggs are 75 calories each.
- Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.
- Ham is 40 calories per ounce.

Step 1: Calculate the calories from the eggs.
Calories from eggs = 6 eggs × 75 calories per egg = 450 calories

Step 2: Calculate the calories from the cheese.
Calories from cheese = 2 oz × 120 calories per ounce = 240 calories

Step 3: Calculate the calories from the ham.
Calories from ham = 2 oz × 40 calories per ounce = 80 calories

Step 4: Calculate the total calories in the omelet.
Total calories = Calories from eggs + Calories from cheese + Calories from ham
Total calories = 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories

Therefore, the omelet contains 770 calories
