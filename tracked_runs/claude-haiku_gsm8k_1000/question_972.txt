Question:
Digimon had its 20th anniversary.  When it came out John was twice as old as Jim.  If John is 28 now how old is Jim?


Reference Answer:
When Digimon came out John would have been 28-20=<<28-20=8>>8
So Jim was 8/2=<<8/2=4>>4 years old
That means John is now 4+20=<<4+20=24>>24

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find Jim's age based on the given information about John's age.

Given information:
- Digimon had its 20th anniversary.
- When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
- John is 28 now.

Step 1: Determine John's age when Digimon came out.
John's age now - Years since Digimon came out = John's age when Digimon came out
28 - 20 = 8 years old

Step 2: Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out.
Since John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, we can divide John's age by 2 to find Jim's age.
John's age when Digimon came out / 2 = Jim's age when Digimon came out
8 / 2 = 4 years old

Step 3: Determine Jim's current age.
Jim's age when Digimon came out + Years since Digimon came out = Jim's current age
4 + 20

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Digimon had its 20th anniversary.
- When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
- John is 28 now.

Step 1: Determine John's age when Digimon came out.
Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, we can subtract 20 years from John's current age to find his age when Digimon came out.
John's age when Digimon came out = 28 - 20 = 8 years old

Step 2: Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out.
We know that when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
Jim's age when Digimon came out = John's age when Digimon came out / 2
Jim's age when Digimon came out = 8 / 2 = 4 years old

Step 3: Determine Jim's current age.
Since 20 years have passed since Digimon came out, we can

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Digimon had its 20th anniversary.
- When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
- John is 28 years old now.

To find Jim's age, we need to work backwards from the current age of John.

Step 1: Determine John's age when Digimon came out.
Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, we can subtract 20 years from John's current age to find his age when Digimon came out.
John's age when Digimon came out = 28 - 20 = 8 years old

Step 2: Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out.
We know that when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
Jim's age when Digimon came out = John's age when Digimon came out / 2
Jim's age when Digimon came out = 8 / 2 = 4 years old

Step 3: Determine Jim's
