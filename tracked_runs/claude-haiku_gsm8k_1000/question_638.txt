Violetta wants to buy new crayons. She needs them in 5 different colors and prepared $20 for this purchase. One crayon costs $2. How much change will she get?


Reference Answer:
Violetta is going to pay 5 * 2 = $<<5*2=10>>10 for the crayons she wants.

#### 10


=== Turn 1 ===


Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors.
- She has prepared $20 for the purchase.
- Each crayon costs $2.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the crayons.
Total cost = Number of crayons × Cost per crayon
Total cost = 5 × $2 = $10

Step 2: Calculate the change Violetta will get.
Change = Amount prepared - Total cost
Change = $20 - $10 = $10

Therefore, the change Violetta will get is $10.

Final answer: Violetta will get $10 in change.
