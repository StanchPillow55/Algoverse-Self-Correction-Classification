Question ID: 582

Question:
Juan asked his neighbor, Herb, how much his house was worth. Herb answered that he paid $76,000 for the house. If Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, calculate the value of the two houses combined.


Reference Answer:
Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, meaning Juan's house is 30/100*$76000= $<<30/100*76000=22800>>22800 less expensive than Herb's house.
Juan's house is worth $76000-$22800 = $<<76000-22800=53200>>53200
The combined total value of Juan's and Herb's house is $76000+$53200 = $<<76000+53200=129200>>129200
#### 129200

Response:
Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Herb's house cost $76,000.
- Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of Juan's house.
Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, we can calculate the cost of Juan's house as follows:
Cost of Juan's house = Cost of Herb's house - (Cost of Herb's house × 0.30)
Cost of Juan's house = $76,000 - ($76,000 × 0.30)
Cost of Juan's house = $76,000 - $22,800
Cost of Juan's house = $53,200

Step 2: Calculate the combined value of the two houses.
Combined value of the two houses = Cost of Herb's house + Cost of Juan's house
Combined value of the two houses = $76,000 + $53,200
Combined value of the two houses = $129,200

Therefore, the combined value of the two houses is $129,200.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Herb's house cost $76,000.
- Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of Juan's house.
Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, we can calculate the cost of Juan's house as follows:
Cost of Juan's house = Cost of Herb's house - (Cost of Herb's house × 0.30)
Cost of Juan's house = $76,000 - ($76,000 × 0.30)
Cost of Juan's house = $76,000 - $22,800
Cost of Juan's house = $53,200

Step 2: Calculate the combined value of the two houses.
Combined value of the two houses = Cost of Herb's house + Cost of Juan's house
Combined value of the two houses = $76,000 + $53,200
Combined value of the two houses = $129,200

Therefore, the combined value of the two houses is $129,200.
