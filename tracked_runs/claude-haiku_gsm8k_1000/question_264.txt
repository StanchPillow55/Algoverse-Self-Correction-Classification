Question:
Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later?


Reference Answer:
Since Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago and received a raise that makes him earn 40% more, he received a 40/100*$40000 = $<<40/100*40000=16000>>16000 raise.
In total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000
If four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.
Four years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000
After receiving a 40% raise, Lylah earns 40/100*$28000 = $<<40/100*28000=11200>>11200
In total, four years later, Lylah earns $28000+$11200= $<<28000+11200=39200>>39200.
The total amount of salary the two earn four years later is $39200+$56000 = $<<39200+56000=95200>>95200
#### 95200

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Add Adrien's and Lylah's salaries four years later to get the total salary.

Step 1: Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
Let's represent Lylah's salary as x.
Adrien's salary = 1.3x (30% higher than Lylah's)
We know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
Therefore, 1.3x = $40,000
x = $40,000 / 1.3
x = $30,769.23

Therefore, Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,769.23.

Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
Adrien's salary four years later increased by 40% compared to four years ago

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
- Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago.
- Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously.
- Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago.

Step 1: Calculate Adrien's salary four years ago.
Adrien's salary four years ago = $40,000

Step 2: Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can use the following equation:
Adrien's salary = 1.3 × Lylah's salary
$40,000 = 1.3 × Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary four years ago = $40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769.23

Step 3: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
