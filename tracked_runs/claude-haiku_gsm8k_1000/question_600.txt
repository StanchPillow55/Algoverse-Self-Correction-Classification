Question:
In a company of 50 employees, 20% of the employees are management.  Out of this 20%, only 30% oversee the entire company.  How many employees oversee the company?


Reference Answer:
20% of 50 employees are part of management so that's .20*50 = <<.20*50=10>>10 employees
Out of these 10 employees, only 30% oversee the entire company so 10*.30 = <<10*.3=3>>3 people oversee the company

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of management employees in the company.
2. Calculate the number of employees who oversee the entire company.

Step 1: Calculate the number of management employees in the company.
* The company has 50 employees.
* 20% of the employees are management.
* To calculate the number of management employees, we multiply the total number of employees by the percentage of management employees:
* 50 employees × 20% = 10 management employees

Step 2: Calculate the number of employees who oversee the entire company.
* Out of the 10 management employees, only 30% oversee the entire company.
* To calculate the number of employees who oversee the company, we multiply the number of management employees by the percentage who oversee the entire company:
* 10 management employees × 30% = 3 employees who oversee the company

Therefore, the final answer is:
3 employees oversee the company.
