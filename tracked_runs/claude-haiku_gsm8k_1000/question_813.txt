Question ID: 916

Question:
Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance by their mother. The two girls decided to combine their allowance to surprise their father on his birthday. They bought a cake which costs $11. They also bought 1 dozen balloons which were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons. The remaining money was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?


Reference Answer:
There are 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pairs of balloons in 1 dozen.
The cost for buying a dozen balloons was $0.5 x 6 = $<<0.5*6=3>>3.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream was $7 x 2 = $<<7*2=14>>14.
The total cost of their purchases is $11 + $3 +$14 = $<<11+3+14=28>>28.
So their mother gave each of them $28/2 = $<<28/2=14>>14.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of allowance that Julia and Nadine had, and then divide it by 2 to find the amount their mother gave to each of them.

Given information:
- Julia and Nadine bought a cake for $11.
- They bought 1 dozen balloons, which were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons.
- They bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the balloons.
Cost of 1 dozen balloons = (1 dozen / 2) × $0.5 = $3

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the items they bought.
Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
Total cost = $11 + $3 + (2 × $7) = $28

Step 3: Calculate the remaining money after buying the items.
Remaining money = Total allowance - Total cost
Remaining money = Total allowance - $28

Step 4: Find the total allowance that Julia and Nadine had.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it.

Given information:
- Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance by their mother.
- They combined their allowance to buy a cake for $11.
- They bought 1 dozen balloons, which were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons.
- The remaining money was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the balloons.
1 dozen balloons = 12 balloons
Cost of 2 balloons = $0.5
Cost of 12 balloons = (12 / 2) × $0.5 = $3

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the ice cream.
2 tubs of ice cream = 2 × $7 = $14

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the items.
Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Step 4: Calculate the remaining money

- They bought 1 dozen balloons, which were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons.
- The remaining money was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the balloons.
1 dozen balloons = 12 balloons
Cost of 2 balloons = $0.5
Cost of 12 balloons = (12 / 2) × $0.5 = $3

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the ice cream.
2 tubs of ice cream = 2 × $7 = $14

Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent.
Total amount spent = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
Total amount spent = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Step 4: Calculate the remaining money
