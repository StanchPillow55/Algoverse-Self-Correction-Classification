Question ID: 557

Question:
A bag of buttons had 21 buttons in it. Seven buttons had two holes and the rest had four holes. How many holes were in all the buttons in the bag?


Reference Answer:
There were 21 - 7 = <<21-7=14>>14 buttons with four holes.
The four-holed buttons had 14 * 4 = <<14*4=56>>56 holes.
The two-holed buttons had 7 * 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 holes.
Thus, there were 56 + 14 = <<56+14=70>>70 holes in all the buttons in the bag.

Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- The bag of buttons had a total of 21 buttons.
- 7 buttons had 2 holes each.
- The remaining buttons had 4 holes each.

To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we need to calculate the number of holes for the 7 buttons with 2 holes each, and the number of holes for the remaining buttons with 4 holes each, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the number of holes for the 7 buttons with 2 holes each.
Number of holes for 7 buttons with 2 holes each = 7 × 2 = 14 holes

Step 2: Calculate the number of buttons with 4 holes each.
Total number of buttons - Number of buttons with 2 holes = Number of buttons with 4 holes
21 - 7 = 14 buttons with 4 holes

Step 3: Calculate the number of holes for the 14 buttons with 4 holes each.
Number of holes for 14 buttons with

Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- The bag of buttons had 21 buttons in total.
- 7 buttons had 2 holes each.
- The remaining buttons had 4 holes each.

Step 1: Calculate the number of buttons with 4 holes.
Total buttons - Buttons with 2 holes = Buttons with 4 holes
21 - 7 = 14 buttons with 4 holes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes.
Buttons with 2 holes × 2 holes per button = Total holes in buttons with 2 holes
7 × 2 = 14 holes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes.
Buttons with 4 holes × 4 holes per button = Total holes in buttons with 4 holes
14 × 4 = 56 holes

Step 4: Calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons.
Total holes in buttons with 2 holes + Total holes in buttons with
