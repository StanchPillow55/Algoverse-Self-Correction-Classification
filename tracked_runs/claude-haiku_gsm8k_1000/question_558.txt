Question ID: 607

Question:
The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.  The directions say to use 2 pumps of shampoo and this will give you 120 washings.  If Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash, how much will each pump cost, in cents?


Reference Answer:
2 pumps will give you 120 washes so if she only uses 1 pump per wash she doubles the number of washes so she now has 120*2 = <<120*2=240>>240 washes
The bottle costs $24.00 and she will 240 washes so each wash is 24/240 = $<<24/240=0.10>>0.10

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.
- The directions say to use 2 pumps of shampoo per wash, and this will give you 120 washings.
- Jackie uses 1 pump per wash.

To find the cost per pump, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of pumps in the jumbo bottle.
2. Calculate the cost per pump.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pumps in the jumbo bottle.
Since the directions say to use 2 pumps per wash and the bottle lasts for 120 washings, we can calculate the total number of pumps in the bottle:
Total number of pumps = 2 pumps per wash × 120 washings = 240 pumps

Step 2: Calculate the cost per pump.
Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the number of pumps she will use is the same as the number of washings, which is 120 pumps.
Cost per pump = Total cost of the jumbo bottle / Total number of

2 pumps per wash × 120 washings = 240 pumps

Step 2: Calculate the cost per pump.
Cost per pump = Total cost of the bottle / Total number of pumps
Cost per pump = $24.00 / 240 pumps
Cost per pump = $0.10 or 10 cents

Therefore, the cost per pump, in cents, is 10 cents.

Cost per pump = $24.00 / 240 pumps = $0.10 per pump

Step 3: Convert the cost per pump to cents.
Cost per pump in cents = $0.10 per pump × 100 cents/dollar = 10 cents per pump

Therefore, if Jackie uses 1 pump per wash
