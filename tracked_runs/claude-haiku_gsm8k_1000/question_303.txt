Question:
While walking down the street with his 3 younger siblings, Greg found $20. To be fair to his siblings, he decided to split the money equally. How much money did each of them get?

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Greg found $20 while walking with his 3 younger siblings.
- He decided to split the money equally among them.

To find the amount of money each person gets, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of people.

Step 1: Determine the total number of people.
Total number of people = Greg + 3 younger siblings = 4 people

Step 2: Divide the total amount of money by the number of people.
Total amount of money = $20
Number of people = 4

Amount of money each person gets = Total amount of money / Number of people
Amount of money each person gets = $20 / 4 = $5

Therefore, each of them (Greg and his 3 younger siblings) got $5.

Final answer: Each person got $5.
