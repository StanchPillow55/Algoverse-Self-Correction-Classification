Question ID: 86

Question:
Greg has an alarm set to ring three times a day as a reminder. When the alarm goes off, it continues to ring until Greg turns it off. The first time it went off today, it rang four times. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. How many times did the alarm ring in all?


Reference Answer:
The second time Greg’s alarm went off, it rang three times as long as the first, so it rang 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 times the second time.
The third time it went off, it rang half as long as the second, so it rang 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 times the third time.
In all, Greg’s alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = <<4+12+6=22>>22 times.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of times the alarm rang for each of the three instances and then add them up to get the total number of times the alarm rang.

Given information:
- The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
- The second time the alarm went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time.
- The third time the alarm went off, it rang for half as long as the second time.

Step 1: Find the number of times the alarm rang the second time.
Number of times the alarm rang the second time = 3 × 4 = 12 times

Step 2: Find the number of times the alarm rang the third time.
Number of times the alarm rang the third time = 12 ÷ 2 = 6 times

Step 3: Find the total number of times the alarm rang.
Total number of times the alarm rang = 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times

Therefore, the alarm rang a total of 22 times.
