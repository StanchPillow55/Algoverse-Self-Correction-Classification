Question ID: 722

Question:
Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?


Reference Answer:
First find the total cost of the asphalt by multiplying the number of buckets by the cost per bucket: 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $<<3*25=75>>75
Now subtract the cost of the asphalt and the fine from the cost of the damage Ron avoids: $450 - $75 - $120 = $<<450-75-120=255>>255

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the cost of the damage to Ron's car if he doesn't fix it.

Given information:
- The damage to Ron's car if the pothole is not fixed is $450.
- The city council will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself.
- Ron needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole.
Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt = 3 Ã— $25 = $75
Fine for unauthorized road maintenance = $120
Total cost of fixing the pothole = $75 + $120 = $195

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole.
Amount of money saved = Cost of damage to car - Total cost of fixing the pothole
Amount of money saved = $450 - $195 = $255

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

Final answer: Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.
