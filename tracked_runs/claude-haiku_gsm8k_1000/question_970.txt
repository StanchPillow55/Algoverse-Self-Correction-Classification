Question ID: 1316

Question:
Mark's car breaks down and he needs to get a new radiator.  The cost for a new radiator is $400 but he goes to get it at a junk shop and gets it for 80% off.  He then hires a mechanic to install it and it takes 3 hours at $50 an hour.  How much did he pay?


Reference Answer:
The discount on the radiator was 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320
So he paid 400-320=$<<400-320=80>>80
The mechanic charges 3*50=$<<3*50=150>>150
So in total he paid 80+150=$<<80+150=230>>230
#### 230

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. Cost of the new radiator:
   * The original cost of the radiator is $400
   * Mark gets an 80% discount at the junk shop
   * To calculate the discounted price:
     * 80% of $400 = 0.8 x $400 = $320
   * So, the cost of the radiator at the junk shop is $400 - $320 = $80

2. Cost of the mechanic's labor:
   * The mechanic charges $50 per hour
   * The installation takes 3 hours
   * So, the cost of the mechanic's labor is 3 hours x $50 per hour = $150

3. Total cost:
   * Cost of the radiator: $80
   * Cost of the mechanic's labor: $150
   * Total cost = $80 + $150 = $230

Therefore, the total amount that Mark paid for the new radiator and its installation is $230.

Final answer: Mark paid $230.
