Question ID: 38

Question:
John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs.  How fast does he run?


Reference Answer:
He has 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 possible running days.
He runs half of those so he runs 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 days.
So for two days, he runs 3/2=<<3/2=1.5>>1.5 hours.
So in total, he runs 3+1.5+1.5=<<3+1.5+1.5=6>>6 hours.
So he runs 60/6=<<60/6=10>>10 mph.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total time John spends running per week and then calculate his running speed.

Given information:
- John runs 60 miles a week.
- He runs 3 days a week.
- He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days.

Step 1: Calculate the time John spends running per week.
Time spent running on the first day = 3 hours
Time spent running on the other two days = 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours
Total time spent running per week = 3 hours + (2 Ã— 1.5 hours) = 6 hours

Step 2: Calculate John's running speed.
Running speed = Total distance run per week / Total time spent running per week
Running speed = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour

Therefore, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

Final answer: John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
