Question ID: 883

Question:
Elaina is holding the final concert in her tour. To celebrate her final concert, she makes the concert twice as long as her usual concerts. At the end of the concert, she also performs a 15-minute encore. If the runtime of this final concert is 65 minutes then how long, in minutes, do her usual concerts run for?


Reference Answer:
The concert, minus the encore, lasted for 65-minute concert – 15-minute encore = <<65-15=50>>50 minutes.
This is twice as long as her usual concerts so her usual concert must have a runtime of 50 minutes / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the duration of Elaina's usual concerts.

Given information:
- Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.
- The final concert includes a 15-minute encore.
- The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find the duration of the final concert without the encore.
Total runtime of the final concert - Duration of the encore = Duration of the final concert without the encore
65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes

Step 2: Find the duration of Elaina's usual concerts.
Since the final concert is twice as long as the usual concerts, we can divide the duration of the final concert without the encore by 2 to find the duration of the usual concerts.
50 minutes ÷ 2 = 25 minutes

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

Final answer: Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.
