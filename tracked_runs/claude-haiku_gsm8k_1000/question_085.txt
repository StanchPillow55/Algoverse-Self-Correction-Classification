Question ID: 780

Question:
Ava and Emma want to know who is better at the new video game Ava got for her birthday. They are each going to play one level and whoever has the highest score wins. They receive 10 points for every enemy they jump on, 5 points for each berry they collect, and 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level. If Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries, but finishes the level 4 seconds slower, what is the difference between their two scores?


Reference Answer:
For jumping on enemies, Emma earns 8 * 10 = <<8*10=80>>80 fewer points than Ava.
For collecting berries, Emma earns 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 fewer points than Ava.
For finishing the level faster, Emma earns 4 * 30 = <<4*30=120>>120 more points than Ava.
Overall, Emma has 120 – 80 - 15 = <<120-80-15=25>>25 more points than Ava.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the scores for Ava and Emma, and then find the difference between their scores.

Given information:
- Ava and Emma each play one level of the video game.
- They receive 10 points for every enemy they jump on.
- They receive 5 points for each berry they collect.
- They receive 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level.
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Step 1: Calculate Ava's score.
Ava's enemies jumped on = 8 more than Emma
Ava's berries collected = 3 more than Emma
Ava's time left on the timer = 4 seconds slower than Emma

Ava's score = (Ava's enemies jumped on × 10) + (Ava's berries collected × 5) + (Ava's time left on the timer × 30)

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ava and Emma each play one level of the video game.
- They receive:
  - 10 points for every enemy they jump on
  - 5 points for each berry they collect
  - 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Step 1: Calculate Ava's score.
Ava's enemies jumped on = Emma's enemies jumped on + 8 = x + 8
Ava's berries collected = Emma's berries collected + 3 = y + 3
Ava's time left on timer = Emma's time left on timer - 4 = z - 4

Ava's score = (x + 8) × 10 + (y + 3) × 5 + (z - 4) × 30
