Question:
Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, how many face masks does he use every 2 days?


Reference Answer:
Tyrion uses 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 face masks every day.
Therefore, the total number of face masks he uses every 2 days is 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days.

Given information:
- Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
- Tyrion goes out three times a day.

Step 1: Find the number of face masks Tyrion uses per day.
Number of face masks used per day = Number of times Tyrion goes out per day × Number of times he changes his face mask per outing
Number of face masks used per day = 3 × 2 = 6 face masks

Step 2: Find the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days.
Number of face masks used every 2 days = Number of face masks used per day × Number of days
Number of face masks used every 2 days = 6 face masks × 2 days = 12 face masks

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.

Final answer: Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
- Tyrion goes out three times a day.

To find the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of face masks used per day.
2. Multiply the number of face masks used per day by 2 to get the number used every 2 days.

Step 1: Calculate the number of face masks used per day.
Number of times Tyrion goes out per day × Number of times he changes his mask per outing = Number of face masks used per day
3 × 2 = 6 face masks used per day

Step 2: Calculate the number of face masks used every 2 days.
Number of face masks used per day × Number of days = Number of face masks used every 2 days
6 face masks per day × 2 days = 12 face masks used every 2 days

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.
