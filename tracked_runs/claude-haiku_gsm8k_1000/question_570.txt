Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Notebooks cost $1.50 each.
- Ballpens cost $0.5 each.
- William bought 5 notebooks and 1 ballpen.

To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the ballpen, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the notebooks.
Cost of 5 notebooks = 5 Ã— $1.50 = $7.50

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the ballpen.
Cost of 1 ballpen = $0.5

Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent.
Total amount spent = Cost of notebooks + Cost of ballpen
Total amount spent = $7.50 + $0.5 = $8.00

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00 at the educational shop.

Final answer: William spent a total of $8.00.
