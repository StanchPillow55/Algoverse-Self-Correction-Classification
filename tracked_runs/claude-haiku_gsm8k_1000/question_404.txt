Question ID: 802

Question:
Bubbles collects stuffed animals. She has three stuffed puppies, five stuffed koalas, two stuffed zebras and four stuffed frogs. If she wants to buy enough stuffed goats, such that the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of all of her stuffed animals, how many stuffed goats should she buy?


Reference Answer:
Let x = the number of stuffed goats.
The current number of stuffed animals are (puppies + koalas + zebras + frogs) or 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = <<3+5+2+4=14>>14 stuffed animals total.
Take the total stuffed animals, add x and divide by the number of stuffed goats to get to 30% or x / (14 + x) = .3
Cross multiply to get x = 0.42 + .3x
Subtract .3 x from each side, .7x = 0.42
Bubbles needs x = <<6=6>>6 goats added.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, and then calculate the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage of stuffed goats 30% of the total.

Given information:
- Bubbles has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs.
- Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has.
Total number of stuffed animals = 3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14 stuffed animals

Step 2: Calculate the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy to make the percentage of stuffed goats 30% of the total.
Let x be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy.
Total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats =

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. First, we need to find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:
   * 3 stuffed puppies
   * 5 stuffed koalas
   * 2 stuffed zebras
   * 4 stuffed frogs
   * Total = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

2. Now, we want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total. 
   * 30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2 stuffed goats

3. However, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, since we can't have a fraction of a stuffed goat.
   * Therefore, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats.

Final answer: Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bubbles has 3 stuffed puppies
- Bubbles has 5 stuffed koalas
- Bubbles has 2 stuffed zebras
- Bubbles has 4 stuffed frogs
- Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals

Step 1: Calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has.
Total stuffed animals = 3 puppies + 5 koalas + 2 zebras + 4 frogs = 14 stuffed animals

Step 2: Calculate the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy to make the percentage of stuffed goats 30% of the total.
Let x = the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy.
Total stuffed animals after buying the goats = 14 + x
Percentage of stuffed goats = (x / (14 + x)) Ã— 100 = 30%
Solving for x:
x / (
