Question ID: 100

Question:
Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him on a certain day. The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times, how many doorbell rings did the doorbell make?


Reference Answer:
The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend, a total of 1/4*20=<<1/4*20=5>>5 times.
Jerome's second friend pressed on the doorbell 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25
The first two friends pressed on the doorbell 25+20=<<25+20=45>>45 times altogether before Jerome could open the door.
Jerome's third friend pressed on the doorbell 60+10=<<60+10=70>>70 times before Jerome could open the door.
Altogether, Jerome's third and fourth friends pressed on the doorbell 70+60=<<70+60=130>>130 times before Jerome could open.
The number of doorbell rings that Jerome's friend made before Jerome could open the door is 130+45=<<130+45=175>>175 times.

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him.
- The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
- The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend.
- The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend.
- The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

Step 1: Calculate the number of times the second friend pressed the doorbell.
The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend.
Number of times the second friend pressed the doorbell = 20 + (20 × 1/4) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

Step 2: Calculate the number of times the third friend pressed the doorbell.
The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend.
Number of times the third friend pressed the doorbell = 60 × 10 = 600 times.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of doorbell rings.
