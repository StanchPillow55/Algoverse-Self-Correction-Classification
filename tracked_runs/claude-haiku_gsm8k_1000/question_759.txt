Question ID: 88

Question:
Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If they sold 88,000 copies combined, how many copies did Harald sell?


Reference Answer:
Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.
Substituting the second equation into the first, we get 10h + h = 88,000
Combining like terms, we get 11h = 88,000
Dividing both sides by 11, we get h = 8,000
#### 8000

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's.
- They sold 88,000 copies combined.

Let's represent the number of copies Harald sold as "x".

Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, we can represent Marilyn's sales as "10x".

The total number of copies sold is the sum of Harald's and Marilyn's sales:
Harald's sales + Marilyn's sales = Total copies sold
x + 10x = 88,000

Simplifying the equation:
11x = 88,000

Solving for x:
x = 88,000 / 11
x = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies of his record.

Final answer: Harald sold 8,000 copies of his record.
