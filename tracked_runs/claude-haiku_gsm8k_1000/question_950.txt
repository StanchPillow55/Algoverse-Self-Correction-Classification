Question:
Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. If Duncan's age is 60 now, how old will Adam be in 8 years?


Reference Answer:
Eight years ago, Duncan was 60-8 = 52 years old, the same as Adam's age four years ago.
Therefore, four years ago, Adam's age was 52/2 =<<52/2=26>>26 years.
Currently, Adam is 26+4 = <<26+4=30>>30 years old.
In 8 years from now, Adam will be 30+8 = <<30+8=38>>38 years old.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Duncan's age 8 years ago was two times Adam's age 4 years ago.
- Duncan's age is 60 now.

Step 1: Find Duncan's age 8 years ago.
Duncan's age now - 8 years = Duncan's age 8 years ago
60 - 8 = 52 years old

Step 2: Find Adam's age 4 years ago.
Since Duncan's age 8 years ago was two times Adam's age 4 years ago, we can use this equation:
Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 × Adam's age 4 years ago
52 = 2 × Adam's age 4 years ago
Adam's age 4 years ago = 52 / 2 = 26 years old

Step 3: Find Adam's age now.
Adam's age 4 years ago + 4 years = Adam's age now
26 + 4 = 30 years old

Step 4: Find Adam's age in

Since Duncan's age 8 years ago was two times Adam's age 4 years ago, we can set up an equation:
Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 × Adam's age 4 years ago
52 = 2 × Adam's age 4 years ago
Adam's age 4 years ago = 52 / 2 = 26 years old

Step 3: Find Adam's current age.
Adam's age 4 years ago + 4 years = Adam's current age
26 + 4 = 30 years old
