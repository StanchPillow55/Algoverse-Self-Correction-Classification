Question ID: 80

Question:
Two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. Then a boy got 6 liters of water. How many liters of water were left?


Reference Answer:
Each of the girls got 24 x 1/6 = <<24*1/6=4>>4 liters of water.
So the two girls got a total of 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 liters.
Thus, a total of 8 + 6 = <<8+6=14>>14 liters of water were gotten by the two girls and the boy.
Therefore, 24 - 14 = <<24-14=10>>10 liters of water were left.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 24 liters of water.
- Two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water.
- A boy got 6 liters of water.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water each girl got.
1/6 of 24 liters = 24 รท 6 = 4 liters
Each girl got 4 liters of water.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of water the two girls got.
Total water for the two girls = 4 liters + 4 liters = 8 liters

Step 3: Calculate the amount of water the boy got.
The boy got 6 liters of water.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of water taken.
Total water taken = Water for the two girls + Water for the boy
Total water taken = 8 liters + 6 liters = 14 liters

Step 5: Calculate the amount of water left.
Total water - Total water taken = Water left

Total water for the two girls = 4 liters + 4 liters = 8 liters

Step 3: Calculate the amount of water left after the two girls got their share.
Total water - Water for the two girls = 24 liters - 8 liters = 16 liters

Step 4: Calculate the amount of water left after the boy got his 6 liters.
Water left after the boy got his share = 16 liters - 6 liters = 10 liters
