Question ID: 238

Question:
Mary is two years younger than Joan, who is five years older than Jessa. If Jessa is 20 years old, what is the sum of the ages of the three girls?


Reference Answer:
Joan is 20 + 5 = <<20+5=25>>25 years old.
Mary is 25 â€“ 2 = <<25-2=23>>23 years old.
Therefore, the sum of their ages is 20 + 25 + 23 = <<20+25+23=68>>68.
#### 68

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mary is two years younger than Joan.
- Joan is five years older than Jessa.
- Jessa is 20 years old.

Step 1: Find Joan's age.
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5 years
Joan's age = 20 + 5 = 25 years

Step 2: Find Mary's age.
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2 years
Mary's age = 25 - 2 = 23 years

Step 3: Find the sum of the ages of the three girls.
Sum of the ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age
Sum of the ages = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68 years

Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68 years.
