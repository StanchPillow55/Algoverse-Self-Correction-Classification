Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Indras has 6 letters in her name.
- Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name.

Step 1: Find half of the letters in Indras' name.
Half of 6 letters = 6 / 2 = 3 letters

Step 2: Find the number of letters in the sister's name.
The sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name.
Number of letters in the sister's name = 3 + 4 = 7 letters

Step 3: Find the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names.
Total number of letters = Letters in Indras' name + Letters in sister's name
Total number of letters = 6 + 7 = 13 letters

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13 letters.

Final answer: The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13
