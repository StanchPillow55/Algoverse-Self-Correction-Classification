Question ID: 543

Question:
For each small task accomplished, Jairus gets $0.8 while Jenny gets $0.5. If each of them finished 20 tasks, how much more will Jairus get than Jenny?


Reference Answer:
The difference of the amount received by Jairus and Jenny is $0.8/task - $0.5/task = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3/task.
So, Jairus will get $0.3/task x 20 tasks = $<<0.3*20=6>>6 more than Jenny.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Jairus gets $0.8 for each small task accomplished.
- Jenny gets $0.5 for each small task accomplished.
- Each of them finished 20 tasks.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Jairus will get.
Jairus's earnings per task = $0.8
Number of tasks completed by Jairus = 20
Total amount Jairus will get = $0.8 × 20 = $16

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Jenny will get.
Jenny's earnings per task = $0.5
Number of tasks completed by Jenny = 20
Total amount Jenny will get = $0.5 × 20 = $10

Step 3: Calculate the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's earnings.
Difference = Jairus's earnings - Jenny's earnings
Difference = $16 - $10 = $6

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.

Final answer: Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jairus gets $0.8 for each small task accomplished.
2. Jenny gets $0.5 for each small task accomplished.
3. Each of them finished 20 tasks.

To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them earned.

Jairus's total earnings:
* 20 tasks x $0.8 per task = $16

Jenny's total earnings:
* 20 tasks x $0.5 per task = $10

Now, to find the difference:
* Jairus's total earnings - Jenny's total earnings = $16 - $10 = $6

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.
