Question ID: 925

Question:
There are 10000 gallons of water in a pool. Using a water pump, Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. They use water from the tank to water their vegetable garden. If the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day, how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days?


Reference Answer:
The water pump takes 1/2 *10000 = <<5000=5000>>5000 gallons of the pool's water into the tank.
If 500 gallons of water is used daily for six days, the total amount of water used after six days is 500*6 = <<500*6=3000>>3000 gallons.
The total amount of water remaining in the tank will be 5000-3000 = <<5000-3000=2000>>2000 gallons

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There are 10,000 gallons of water in the pool.
- Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool.
- The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the tank.
Amount of water in the tank = 1/2 × 10,000 gallons = 5,000 gallons

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days.
Amount of water remaining in the tank = Initial amount of water - (Rate of water usage × Number of days)
Amount of water remaining in the tank = 5,000 gallons - (500 gallons/day × 6 days)
Amount of water remaining in the tank = 5,000 gallons - 3,000 gallons = 2,000 gallons

Therefore, after 6 days, there will be 2,000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

1. The pool contains 10,000 gallons of water.
2. Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool.
   * To find the amount of water in the tank, we divide the total water in the pool by 2:
   * 10,000 gallons ÷ 2 = 5,000 gallons

3. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day.
4. We need to find the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days.

To calculate the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we need to subtract the amount of water used each day from the initial amount of water in the tank.

* Initial amount of water in the tank: 5,000 gallons
* Amount of water used per day: 500 gallons
* Number of days: 6

Calculation:
* Amount of water used in 6 days = 500 gallons/day × 6 days = 3,000 gallons

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The pool contains 10,000 gallons of water.
2. Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool.
   * Half of 10,000 gallons is 5,000 gallons.
   * So the tank is filled with 5,000 gallons of water.

3. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.
4. We need to find how many gallons will be remaining in the tank after 6 days.
   * After 1 day, 500 gallons will be used, leaving 5,000 - 500 = 4,500 gallons.
   * After 2 days, another 500 gallons will be used, leaving 4,500 - 500 = 4,000 gallons.
   * After 3 days, another 500 gallons will be used, leaving 4,000 - 500 = 3,500 gallons.
   * After 4 days, another
