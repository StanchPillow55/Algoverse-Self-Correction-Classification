Question ID: 793

Question:
Jamie earns $20 per hour for 8 hours of work each day. Should she need to work additional hours, she is paid a special hourly rate that is 150% of her regular hourly rate. Last Tuesday, she worked 11 hours. How much was she paid, in dollars, for her work that day?


Reference Answer:
The first 8 hours pay 20*8=<<20*8=160>>160.
The overtime hourly rate is 1.50*20=$<<1.50*20=30>>30/hr.
She worked 11-8=<<11-8=3>>3 overtime hours
Then the additional 3 hours pay 3*30=<<3*30=90>>90.
She was paid 160+90=<<160+90=250>>250.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate Jamie's earnings for the regular 8 hours of work and the additional 3 hours of work at the special hourly rate.

Given information:
- Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20.
- Jamie's special hourly rate is 150% of her regular hourly rate.
- Jamie worked 11 hours last Tuesday.

Step 1: Calculate Jamie's earnings for the regular 8 hours of work.
Regular hourly rate = $20
Regular hours worked = 8 hours
Earnings for regular hours = $20 × 8 hours = $160

Step 2: Calculate Jamie's earnings for the additional 3 hours of work at the special hourly rate.
Special hourly rate = 150% of regular hourly rate = 1.5 × $20 = $30
Additional hours worked = 11 hours - 8 hours = 3 hours
Earnings for additional hours = $30 × 3 hours = $90

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Jamie was paid for her work last Tuesday.
Total earnings = Earnings for regular hours + Earnings
