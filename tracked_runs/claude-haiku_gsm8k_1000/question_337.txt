Question ID: 604

Question:
Howard spends $8 dollars at the arcade on Monday. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much at the arcade as he did on Monday. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much at the arcade as he spent on Tuesday. If he originally had $100, how much money does he have left?


Reference Answer:
On Tuesday, he spends $8 * 2 = $<<8*2=16>>16.
On Wednesday, he spends $16 * 4 = $<<16*4=64>>64.
In total he spent $8 + $16 + $64 = $<<8+16+64=88>>88 at the arcade.
He has $100 - $88 = $<<100-88=12>>12 left.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On Monday, Howard spent $8 at the arcade.
- On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as he did on Monday.
- On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday.
- He originally had $100.

Step 1: Calculate how much Howard spent on Tuesday.
Spending on Tuesday = 2 × Spending on Monday
Spending on Tuesday = 2 × $8 = $16

Step 2: Calculate how much Howard spent on Wednesday.
Spending on Wednesday = 4 × Spending on Tuesday
Spending on Wednesday = 4 × $16 = $64

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Howard spent at the arcade.
Total spending = Spending on Monday + Spending on Tuesday + Spending on Wednesday
Total spending = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88

Step 4: Calculate the amount of money Howard has left.
Money left = Original amount - Total spending
Money left = $100 - $88 = $12

Therefore, Howard has $12
