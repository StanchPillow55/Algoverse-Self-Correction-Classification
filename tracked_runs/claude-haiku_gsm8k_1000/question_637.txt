Question ID: 1176

Question:
A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?


Reference Answer:
The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.
He is left with 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches of chalk.
The next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.
That leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.
The day after that, he will use 2.2 * .2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>.44 inches of chalk.
That will leave him with 2.2 - .44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches of chalk.
Since 1.76 is less than 2 inches, he will recycle this stick in 2 days.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

Given information:
- The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
- The teacher normally uses 20% of the chalk each day.
- The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
- On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of chalk used on Monday.
Amount of chalk used on Monday = 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 × 5 inches = 2.25 inches

Step 2: Calculate the amount of chalk remaining after Monday.
Amount of chalk remaining after Monday = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches

Step 3: Calculate the number of days the teacher can use the remaining chalk at the normal rate of 20% per day.
Amount of chalk used per day at 20% = 0.20 × 5 inches = 1 inch
Number of days = Remaining chalk / Chalk used per day
Number of days = 2.75 inches / 1 inch

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
- The teacher normally uses 20% of the chalk each day.
- The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
- On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of chalk used on Monday.
Since the teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday, we can calculate the amount of chalk used:
Amount of chalk used on Monday = 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 × 5 inches = 2.25 inches

Step 2: Calculate the amount of chalk remaining after Monday.
Amount of chalk remaining = Total chalk - Amount of chalk used on Monday
Amount of chalk remaining = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches

Step 3: Calculate the number of days the teacher can use the remaining chalk at the normal 20% usage rate.
Amount of chalk remaining / Chalk used per day = Number of days
2.75 inches / (0.
