Question ID: 229

Question:
A watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found out that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took them home. When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. How many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks?


Reference Answer:
When Ashlyn found out that 30% of the melons were ready, she took home 30/100 *120 = <<30/100*120=36>>36 watermelons.
The number of watermelons remaining on the farm is 120-36 =<<120-36=84>>84
When she returned two weeks later, she found that 3/4*84 = <<3/4*84=63>>63 were ready for harvest,
The number of watermelons that were not ready is 84-63 =<<84-63=21>>21

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- The watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
- After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest.
- Ashlyn took the 30% of ready watermelons home.
- Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest.

Step 1: Calculate the number of watermelons Ashlyn took home after the first two months.
30% of 120 watermelons = 0.30 × 120 = 36 watermelons

Step 2: Calculate the number of watermelons remaining after the first two months.
Remaining watermelons = Total watermelons - Watermelons taken home
Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons

Step 3: Calculate the number of watermelons Ashlyn took home after the two-week period.
3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons = 3/4 × 84 = 63 watermelons

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- The watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
- After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, and Ashlyn took them home.
- Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, and Ashlyn harvested them.

Step 1: Calculate the number of watermelons Ashlyn took home after the first two months.
30% of 120 watermelons = 0.30 × 120 = 36 watermelons

Step 2: Calculate the number of watermelons remaining after the first harvest.
Remaining watermelons = Total watermelons - Watermelons harvested
Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons

Step 3: Calculate the number of watermelons Ashlyn harvested after the two-week period.
3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons = 3/4 × 84 = 63 watermelons

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

1. The watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons.

2. After two months, Ashlyn found that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took them home.
   * To calculate how many watermelons were ready for harvest:
     * 30% of 120 = 0.30 x 120 = 36 watermelons

3. After the first harvest, the remaining watermelons were:
   * 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons

4. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so Ashlyn harvested them.
   * To calculate how many watermelons were ready for the second harvest:
     * 3/4 of 84 = 0.75 x 84 = 63 watermelons

5. The number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:
   * 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons

Therefore, the number of water
