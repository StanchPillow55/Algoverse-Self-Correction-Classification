Question ID: 295

Question:
Darren decides to do body exercises for a whole week. He does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses on the first day. On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than on the first day, ten fewer squats, and doubles the number of dumbbell presses. What's the total count of the activities he's done in the two days?


Reference Answer:
The total count of activities for the first day is 100+50+20 = <<100+50+20=170>>170
On the second day, he does 100+20 = <<100+20=120>>120 pushups
He also does 50-10 = <<50-10=40>>40 squats on the second day
For the dumbbell presses, he doubles the number of the first day, which becomes 2*20 = <<2*20=40>>40
The total count for the three activities on the second day is 40+40+120 = <<40+40+120=200>>200
For the two days, his total count for all the three activities is 200+170 = <<200+170=370>>370

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- On the first day, Darren did:
  - 100 pushups
  - 50 squats
  - 20 dumbbell presses
- On the second day, Darren did:
  - 20 more pushups than on the first day
  - 10 fewer squats than on the first day
  - Doubled the number of dumbbell presses from the first day

Step 1: Calculate the number of activities Darren did on the second day.
Pushups on the second day = 100 + 20 = 120
Squats on the second day = 50 - 10 = 40
Dumbbell presses on the second day = 20 × 2 = 40

Step 2: Calculate the total count of the activities Darren did in the two days.
Total pushups = 100 + 120 = 220
Total squats = 50 + 40 = 90
Total dumbbell presses = 20 +
