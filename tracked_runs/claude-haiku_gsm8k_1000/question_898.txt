Question:
If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, how many hours will it take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to do so?


Reference Answer:
If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed, a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, one kangaroo takes 18/3= <<18/3=6>>6 hours to cross the highway.
A turtle traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo will take 2*6 = <<2*6=12>>12 hours to cross the highway.
Four turtles will take a total of 4*12 = <<4*12=48>>48 hours to travel across the highway.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to calculate the time it would take for the turtles to travel across the highway.

Given information:
- It takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway.
- Four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, need to travel across the same highway.

Step 1: Find the speed of the kangaroos.
Let's assume the distance of the highway is 'D' units.
Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel the distance 'D', the total distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is 3 × D units.
The speed of each kangaroo = (3 × D) / 18 = D / 6 units per hour.

Step 2: Find the speed of the turtles.
The speed of each turtle = (1/2) × (speed of each kangaroo) = (1/2) × (D / 6) = D / 12 units per hour

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- It takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway.
- We need to find how many hours it will take 4 turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to travel across the same highway.

Step 1: Calculate the speed of a single kangaroo.
Since the 3 kangaroos travel the same distance in 18 hours, we can divide the total time by the number of kangaroos to find the time for a single kangaroo.
Time for a single kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours

Step 2: Calculate the speed of a single turtle.
The turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, so their speed is 1/2 of the kangaroo's speed.
Speed of a single turtle = 1/2 × Speed of a single kangaroo

Step 3: Calculate the total time for 4 turtles to travel the same distance.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed take a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway.
- 4 turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, need to travel the same distance.

To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the kangaroos and then use that to calculate the speed of the turtles and the time it will take them to travel the same distance.

Step 1: Calculate the speed of the kangaroos.
Since 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed take a total of 18 hours to travel the distance, we can calculate the speed of each kangaroo.
Let's assume the distance is D.
Speed of each kangaroo = D / 6 (since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours)

Step 2: Calculate the speed of the turtles.
Each turtle is traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle = (D / 6) / 2 = D / 12.
