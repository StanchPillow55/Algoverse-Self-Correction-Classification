Question:
A train has 172 people traveling on it. At the first stop 47 people get off and 13 more people get on, and at the next stop another 38 people get off. How many people are on the train?


Reference Answer:
At the first stop 172 people - 47 people = <<172-47=125>>125 people are on the train.
Then 13 more people get on increasing it to 125 people + 13 people = <<13+125=138>>138 people.
At the next stop 138 people - 38 people = <<138-38=100>>100 people remain on the train.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The train initially has 172 people traveling on it.
- At the first stop, 47 people get off and 13 more people get on.
- At the next stop, another 38 people get off.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people on the train after the first stop.
Initial number of people on the train = 172
Number of people who get off at the first stop = 47
Number of people who get on at the first stop = 13
Number of people on the train after the first stop = 172 - 47 + 13 = 138

Step 2: Calculate the number of people on the train after the second stop.
Number of people on the train after the first stop = 138
Number of people who get off at the second stop = 38
Number of people on the train after the second stop = 138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, the final number of people on the train is 100.

Final answer: There are 100 people on the train.
