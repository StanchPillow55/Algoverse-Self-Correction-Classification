Question ID: 721

Question:
Helga was the fastest clog dancer in all of Slovenia. With both hands at her sides, she could tap her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute, while simultaneously tapping her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute.  When she raised her arms, her tap rate slowed down to 200 taps per minute with each foot.  If she dances a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised during only 2 of those minutes, what would be the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet?


Reference Answer:
During the 5 minutes of dancing, 2 minutes were performed with hands raised and 5-2=3 minutes were performed without hands raised.
With hands not raised, her right foot tapped 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 times.
With hands not raised, her left foot tapped 3*250=<<3*250=750>>750 times.
With hands raised, her right foot tapped 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 times.
With hands raised, her left foot tapped 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 times.
Thus, in total, she tapped 900+750+400+400=<<900+750+400+400=2450>>2450 times

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps for both feet during the 5-minute dance routine, considering the different tap rates when Helga's arms are at her sides and when they are raised.

Given information:
- Helga's tap rate with her right foot is 300 taps per minute with her arms at her sides.
- Helga's tap rate with her left foot is 250 taps per minute with her arms at her sides.
- Helga's tap rate with each foot is 200 taps per minute when her arms are raised.
- Helga dances for a total of 5 minutes.
- Helga has her arms raised for 2 minutes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of taps for the right foot.
When arms are at her sides (3 minutes):
Right foot taps = 300 taps/minute × 3 minutes = 900 taps
When arms are raised (2 minutes):
Right foot taps = 200 taps/minute × 2 minutes = 400 taps
Total right foot taps =

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Helga can tap her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute with her arms at her sides.
- Helga can tap her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute with her arms at her sides.
- When Helga raises her arms, her tap rate slows down to 200 taps per minute with each foot.
- Helga dances for a total of 5 minutes.
- Helga has her arms raised for 2 of those 5 minutes.

Step 1: Calculate the number of taps with arms at her sides.
Right foot taps with arms at sides = 300 taps/minute × 3 minutes = 900 taps
Left foot taps with arms at sides = 250 taps/minute × 3 minutes = 750 taps
Total taps with arms at sides = 900 + 750 = 1650 taps

Step 2: Calculate the number of taps with arms raised.

- Helga can tap her left foot at 250 taps per minute with her arms at her sides.
- When Helga raises her arms, her tap rate slows down to 200 taps per minute with each foot.
- Helga dances for a total of 5 minutes.
- Helga has her arms raised for 2 of those 5 minutes.

Step 1: Calculate the number of taps with arms at her sides.
Right foot taps with arms at sides = 300 taps/min × 3 min = 900 taps
Left foot taps with arms at sides = 250 taps/min × 3 min = 750 taps
Total taps with arms at sides = 900 + 750 = 1650 taps

Step 2: Calculate the number of taps with arms raised.
Right foot taps with arms raised = 200 t
