Question ID: 286

Question:
Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, how many cents will she have left?


Reference Answer:
Her quarters are worth 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 cents.
The dimes are worth 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 cents
Kelly has a total of 125 + 20 = <<125+20=145>>145 cents
After buying the can of pop, Kelly will have 145 - 55 = <<145-55=90>>90 cents left.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes.
- The can of pop costs 55 cents.

Step 1: Calculate the total value of the coins Kelly has.
5 quarters = 5 x $0.25 = $1.25
2 dimes = 2 x $0.10 = $0.20
Total value of coins = $1.25 + $0.20 = $1.45

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the can of pop.
Cost of the can of pop = 55 cents

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Kelly will have left after buying the can of pop.
Amount of money left = Total value of coins - Cost of the can of pop
Amount of money left = $1.45 - $0.55 = $0.90

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left after buying the can of pop.

Final answer: Kelly will have 90 cents left.
