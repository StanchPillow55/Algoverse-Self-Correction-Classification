Question ID: 1032

Question:
Grandpa loves to eat jelly beans, but how many jelly beans he can eat depends on the size of the beans.  It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.  And eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean.  How many small beans can Grandpa eat?


Reference Answer:
If Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, then eating 75 large beans is the same as eating 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 medium-sized jelly beans.
If 1 medium-sized bean is the same as 3 small beans, then 150 medium-sized beans are equal to 150*3=<<150*3=450>>450 small jelly beans.
#### 450

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans and then use that information to determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat.

Given information:
- It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.
- Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
- 3 small beans are equivalent to 1 medium-sized bean.

Step 1: Find the number of medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat.
Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, we can calculate the number of medium-sized beans as follows:
Number of medium-sized beans = 2 × 75 = 150 medium-sized beans

Step 2: Find the number of small beans that are equivalent to the medium-sized beans.
Since 3 small beans are equivalent to 1 medium-sized bean, we can calculate the number of small beans as follows:
Number of small beans = 150 medium-sized beans × 3 = 450 small beans

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly
