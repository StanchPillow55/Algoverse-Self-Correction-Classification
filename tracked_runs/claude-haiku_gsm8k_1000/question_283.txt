Question ID: 107

Question:
Frankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?


Reference Answer:
Let W be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.
After Monday, he had 7 - 1 = <<7-1=6>>6 hours of TV left.
After Tuesday, he had 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours of TV left.
After Thursday, he had 5 - 1 - 1/2 = 3 1/2 hours of TV left.
After Friday, he had 3 1/2 - 2 = 1 1/2 hours of TV left.
Each 30-minute episode is 1/2 hour.
Thus, W = 1 1/2 / 1/2 = 3 episodes.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV each day and then determine the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday.

Given information:
- On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched a 1-hour episode each night.
- On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes.
- In total, he watched 7 hours of TV.

Step 1: Calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV on Monday and Tuesday.
Monday: 1 hour
Tuesday: 1 hour
Total time on Monday and Tuesday = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV on Thursday.
Thursday: 1 hour (1-hour episode) + 0.5 hour (30-minute show) = 1.5 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV on Friday.
