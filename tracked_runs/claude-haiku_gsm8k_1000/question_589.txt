Question ID: 1046

Question:
A team of 4 painters worked on a mansion for 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks. How many hours of work did each painter put in?


Reference Answer:
There are 24 hours in a day so 3/8ths of a day is (3/8)*24 = <<3/8*24=9>>9 hours
One week has 7 days so 3 weeks have 7*3 = <<7*3=21>>21 days
Each painter put in 9*21 = <<9*21=189>>189 hours of work
#### 189

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of hours each painter worked.

Given information:
- The team consists of 4 painters.
- They worked on the mansion for 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks.

Step 1: Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
1 day = 24 hours
3/8 of a day = (3/8) × 24 hours = 9 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total number of days the team worked.
Total number of days = 3 weeks × 7 days per week = 21 days

Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours the team worked.
Total number of hours = Number of hours per day × Number of days
Total number of hours = 9 hours × 21 days = 189 hours

Step 4: Calculate the number of hours each painter worked.
Number of hours each painter worked = Total number of hours / Number of painters
Number of hours each painter worked = 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours

Therefore, each painter put in 47.

Given information:
- There is a team of 4 painters.
- They worked on a mansion for 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks.

To find the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to calculate the following:
1. Total number of days worked
2. Total number of hours worked per day
3. Total number of hours worked by the team
4. Total number of hours worked by each painter

Step 1: Calculate the total number of days worked.
There are 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days.
Total number of days worked = 3 weeks × 7 days/week = 21 days

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours worked per day.
We know that the team worked for 3/8ths of a day every day.
1 day = 24 hours
3/8 of a day = 3/8 × 24 hours = 9 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The team consists of 4 painters.
2. They worked on the mansion for 3/8ths of a day every day.
3. They worked for 3 weeks.

To find the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to calculate the following:
* Total number of days worked
* Total number of hours worked per day
* Total number of hours worked over the 3 weeks
* Total number of hours worked per painter

Step 1: Calculate the total number of days worked.
* There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks = 21 days.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours worked per day.
* 1 day = 24 hours
* 3/8 of a day = 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours worked over the 3 weeks.
* 21 days * 9 hours per day = 189 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total number of hours worked per painter.
