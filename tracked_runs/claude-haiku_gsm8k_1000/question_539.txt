Question:
John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time.  He gets paid $25 an hour.  If his car payment is $500, how much profit does he make on his car?


Reference Answer:
He rents his car 10*3=<<10*3=30>>30 hour a month
So he makes 25*30=$<<25*30=750>>750 a month
That means he has a profit of 750-500=$<<750-500=250>>250 a month
#### 250

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total revenue John earns from renting his car and then subtract the car payment to determine his profit.

Given information:
- John rents his car out 10 times a month.
- Each rental is for 3 hours.
- John gets paid $25 per hour.
- John's car payment is $500 per month.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue John earns from renting his car.
Total rental hours per month = 10 rentals × 3 hours per rental = 30 hours
Total revenue = Total rental hours × Hourly rate
Total revenue = 30 hours × $25 per hour = $750

Step 2: Calculate John's profit by subtracting the car payment from the total revenue.
Profit = Total revenue - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500 = $250

Therefore, John makes a profit of $250 on his car.

Final answer: John makes a profit of $250 on his car.
