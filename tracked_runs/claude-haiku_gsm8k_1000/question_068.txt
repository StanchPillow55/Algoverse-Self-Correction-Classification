Question:
Nick is choosing between two jobs. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, and is in a state with a 20% total tax rate. Job B pays $42,000 a year and is in a state that charges $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax. How much more money will Nick make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job?


Reference Answer:
First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000
Next, calculate the amount of taxes Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: .2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000
Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000
Now multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600
Now subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400
Now subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income from the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400
#### 8400

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net pay for each job and then find the difference between the two.

Given information:
- Job A:
  - Hourly rate: $15
  - Hours per year: 2000
  - Total tax rate: 20%
- Job B:
  - Annual salary: $42,000
  - Property tax: $6,000
  - Tax rate on net income after property tax: 10%

Step 1: Calculate the gross pay for each job.
Gross pay for Job A = $15 × 2000 hours = $30,000
Gross pay for Job B = $42,000

Step 2: Calculate the net pay for Job A.
Taxes for Job A = 20% of $30,000 = $6,000
Net pay for Job A = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Step 3: Calculate the net pay for Job B.
Net income before property tax = $42,000
Property tax = $6,000
Net income after property tax = $42,000 - $6,000

Given information:
- Job A: $15 per hour, 2000 hours per year, 20% total tax rate
- Job B: $42,000 per year, $6,000 property tax, 10% tax rate on net income after property tax

Step 1: Calculate the gross pay for each job.
Gross pay for Job A = $15 per hour × 2000 hours per year = $30,000 per year
Gross pay for Job B = $42,000 per year

Step 2: Calculate the net pay for each job.
Net pay for Job A:
Tax for Job A = 20% of $30,000 = $6,000
Net pay for Job A = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Net pay for Job B:
Property tax = $6,000
Taxable income = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Tax for Job B = 10% of $36,000
