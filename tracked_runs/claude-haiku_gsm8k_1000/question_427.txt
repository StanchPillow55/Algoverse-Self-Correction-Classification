Question ID: 257

Question:
Each solid 10-foot section of a redwood tree weighs 400 pounds. Termites ate 30% of this redwood's wood. If the redwood is 200 feet tall, how much does it weigh?


Reference Answer:
First find how many 10-foot sections are in the redwood: 200 feet / 10 feet/section = <<200/10=20>>20 sections
Then multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = <<20*400=8000>>8000 pounds
Then find the amount of the wood the termites ate: 8000 pounds * 30% = <<8000*30*.01=2400>>2400 pounds
Then subtract that amount from the total weight of the wood: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = <<8000-2400=5600>>5600 pounds

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the weight of each 10-foot section of the redwood tree.
2. Calculate the weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate 30% of the wood.
3. Calculate the weight of the redwood tree after the termites ate 30% of the wood.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of each 10-foot section of the redwood tree.
* Each solid 10-foot section of the redwood tree weighs 400 pounds.

Step 2: Calculate the weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate 30% of the wood.
* The redwood tree is 200 feet tall.
* Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, the total weight of the redwood tree is:
* (200 feet / 10 feet per section) × 400 pounds per section = 8,000 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the weight of the redwood tree after the termites ate 30% of the wood.
* The termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that each 10-foot section of the redwood tree weighs 400 pounds.
2. The redwood tree is 200 feet tall.
3. This means the tree has 20 sections (200 feet / 10 feet per section).
4. So the total weight of the tree before the termites ate any of the wood would be:
   * 20 sections x 400 pounds per section = 8,000 pounds

5. The termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood.
6. To calculate the weight lost due to the termites, we take 30% of the total weight:
   * 8,000 pounds x 0.30 = 2,400 pounds

7. To get the final weight of the redwood tree, we subtract the weight lost from the original weight:
   * 8,000 pounds - 2,400 pounds = 5,600 pounds

Therefore, the final weight of the 200-foot tall redwood tree is 5,600 pounds.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each 10-foot section of the redwood tree weighs 400 pounds.
- Termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood.
- The redwood tree is 200 feet tall.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of the entire redwood tree before the termites ate any of the wood.
Weight of each 10-foot section = 400 pounds
Number of 10-foot sections in a 200-foot tree = 200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections
Total weight of the redwood tree = 20 sections × 400 pounds per section = 8,000 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the amount of wood eaten by the termites.
Percentage of wood eaten by termites = 30%
Amount of wood eaten by termites = 8,000 pounds × 0.30 = 2,400 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the remaining weight of the redwood tree after the termites ate 30% of the wood.
Remaining weight of the redwood tree
