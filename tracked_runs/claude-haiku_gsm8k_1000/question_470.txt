Question:
Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills. He buys six squirt guns for $2 each.  He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each.  How much money does he have left?


Reference Answer:
Craig starts off with 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.
Craig spends 6 squirt guns * $2 = $<<6*2=12>>12 on squirt guns.
Craig spends 3 packs of water balloons * $3 = $<<3*3=9>>9 on water balloons.
Total Craig has spent $12 + $9 = $<<12+9=21>>21.
Craig has $40 - $21 = $<<40-21=19>>19 remaining.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills, which means he has $40 in total.
- He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each.
- He buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the squirt guns.
Cost of 6 squirt guns = 6 × $2 = $12

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the water balloons.
Cost of 3 packs of water balloons = 3 × $3 = $9

Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent.
Total amount spent = Cost of squirt guns + Cost of water balloons
Total amount spent = $12 + $9 = $21

Step 4: Calculate the amount of money Craig has left.
Amount of money left = Total money Craig had - Total amount spent
Amount of money left = $40 - $21 = $19

Therefore, Craig has $19 left after his purchases.

Final answer: Craig has $19
