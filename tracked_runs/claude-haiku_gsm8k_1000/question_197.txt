Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- John collects peaches for 3 hours.
- He can collect 2 peaches per minute.

To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to convert the time from hours to minutes and then multiply it by the number of peaches collected per minute.

Step 1: Convert the time from hours to minutes.
3 hours = 3 × 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the number of peaches collected per minute.
John can collect 2 peaches per minute.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of peaches collected.
Total peaches collected = Number of peaches collected per minute × Total minutes
Total peaches collected = 2 peaches/minute × 180 minutes
Total peaches collected = 360 peaches

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches in 3 hours.

Final answer: John collects 360 peaches.
