Question:
Anne purchased a box of sweets that contains 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. She kept two packs and gave the rest to her 10 friends equally. How many pieces of sweets did each of her friends receive?


Reference Answer:
After Anne kept 2 packs, there were only 15 - 2 = <<15-2=13>>13 packs left.
Therefore, there were 13 x 60 = <<13*60=780>>780 pieces of sweets left.
So, each of her 10 friends received 780 / 10 = <<780/10=78>>78 pieces of sweets.
#### 78

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The box of sweets contains 15 packs.
- Each pack has 60 pieces.
- Anne kept 2 packs and gave the rest to her 10 friends equally.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces in the box.
Total pieces in the box = Number of packs × Pieces per pack
Total pieces in the box = 15 × 60 = 900 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces Anne kept.
Pieces Anne kept = Number of packs kept × Pieces per pack
Pieces Anne kept = 2 × 60 = 120 pieces

Step 3: Calculate the number of pieces Anne gave to her friends.
Pieces given to friends = Total pieces in the box - Pieces Anne kept
Pieces given to friends = 900 - 120 = 780 pieces

Step 4: Calculate the number of pieces each friend received.
Pieces per friend = Pieces given to friends / Number of friends
Pieces per friend = 780 / 10 = 78
