Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of people John lost to in the arm wrestling matches.

Given information:
- John arm wrestles 20 people.
- He beats 80% of the people.

Step 1: Find the number of people John beat.
80% of 20 people = 0.80 Ã— 20 = 16 people

Step 2: Find the number of people John lost to.
Total number of people - Number of people John beat = Number of people John lost to
20 people - 16 people = 4 people

Therefore, John lost to 4 people in the arm wrestling matches.

Final answer: John lost to 4 people.
