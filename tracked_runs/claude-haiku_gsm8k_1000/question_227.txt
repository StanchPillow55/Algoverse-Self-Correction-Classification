Question ID: 115

Question:
Sasha notices that prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months after she bought some lumber. Since she has leftovers, she decides to sell them. She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?


Reference Answer:
She bought the 2 x 4s for $100 because 10 x 10 = 100
She bought the 4 x 4s for 80 because 5 x 16 = 80
She paid $180 for the lumber because 100 + 80 = <<100+80=180>>180
The same number now sells for $270 because 180 x 1.5 = <<180*1.5=270>>270
She made $90 in profit because 270 - 180 = <<270-180=90>>90
#### 90

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought, the total revenue from selling the lumber, and then calculate the profit.

Given information:
- Sasha has 10 leftover 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each.
- Sasha has 5 leftover 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $16 each.
- The prices for lumber have gone up by 50% since Sasha bought the lumber.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.
Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards × $10 per board = $100
Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards × $16 per board = $80
Total cost of lumber = $100 + $80 = $180

Step 2: Calculate the new selling price of the lumber after the 50% increase.
New selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = $10 × 1

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sasha bought 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10 for $10 each.
- Sasha bought 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10 for $16 each.
- The prices for lumber have gone up 50% since Sasha bought the boards.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the boards Sasha bought.
Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards x $10 per board = $100
Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards x $16 per board = $80
Total cost of all boards = $100 + $80 = $180

Step 2: Calculate the new selling price of the boards after the 50% increase.
New selling price of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = $10 x 1.5 = $15 per board
New selling price of 4 x 4 x 10 boards
