Question ID: 747

Question:
A tomato vendor decides to switch who he buys his tomatoes for.  He sells 500 tomatoes a day.  He used to buy them for $.5 each but he gets a new vendor who sells them for $.4 each.  How much money does he save a week?


Reference Answer:
He buys 500*7=<<500*7=3500>>3500
He used to pay 3500*.5=$<<3500*.5=1750>>1750
He now pays 3500*.4=$<<3500*.4=1400>>1400
So he saves 1750-1400=$<<1750-1400=350>>350

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the difference in the vendor's daily and weekly expenses before and after the change in tomato suppliers.

Given information:
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.5 each.
- The vendor now buys tomatoes for $0.4 each.

Step 1: Calculate the vendor's daily expense before the change.
Daily expense before the change = Number of tomatoes sold per day × Cost per tomato
Daily expense before the change = 500 × $0.5 = $250

Step 2: Calculate the vendor's daily expense after the change.
Daily expense after the change = Number of tomatoes sold per day × New cost per tomato
Daily expense after the change = 500 × $0.4 = $200

Step 3: Calculate the daily savings.
Daily savings = Daily expense before the change - Daily expense after the change
Daily savings = $250 - $200 = $50

Step 4: Calculate the weekly savings.
Weekly savings = Daily savings × Number of days in a week
Weekly savings = $50

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The tomato vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- The vendor used to buy the tomatoes for $0.5 each.
- The vendor now buys the tomatoes for $0.4 each.

Step 1: Calculate the daily cost of tomatoes under the old vendor.
Daily cost of tomatoes = Number of tomatoes sold per day × Cost per tomato
Daily cost of tomatoes = 500 × $0.5 = $250

Step 2: Calculate the daily cost of tomatoes under the new vendor.
Daily cost of tomatoes = Number of tomatoes sold per day × Cost per tomato
Daily cost of tomatoes = 500 × $0.4 = $200

Step 3: Calculate the daily savings by switching to the new vendor.
Daily savings = Daily cost under old vendor - Daily cost under new vendor
Daily savings = $250 - $200 = $50

Step 4: Calculate the weekly savings by switching to the new vendor.
Weekly savings = Daily savings × Number of days in a week
Weekly savings

Daily savings = $250 - $200 = $50

Step 4: Calculate the weekly savings by switching to the new vendor.
Weekly savings = Daily savings × Number of days in a week
Weekly savings = $50 × 7 = $350
