Question ID: 1144

Question:
The ratio of men to women on a bus is 5:9. If the total number of passengers on the bus is 84, and 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, how many women have remained on the bus?


Reference Answer:
The total ratio representing the number of women on the bus is 5+9=<<5+9=14>>14
The fraction from the ratio representing the number of women is 9/14, and since the total number of passengers representing the full ratio is 84, there are 9/14*84=<<9/14*84=54>>54 women on the bus.
If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus becomes 54-20=<<54-20=34>>34

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the number of men and women on the bus initially.
2. Calculate the number of women who have remained on the bus after 20 women alighted.

Step 1: Find the number of men and women on the bus initially.
Given information:
- The ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9.
- The total number of passengers on the bus is 84.

Let's represent the number of men as 5x and the number of women as 9x, where x is a common factor.

Total number of passengers = Number of men + Number of women
84 = 5x + 9x
84 = 14x
x = 6

Therefore, the number of men on the bus initially is 5x = 5 × 6 = 30.
The number of women on the bus initially is 9x = 9 × 6 = 54.

Step 2: Calculate the number of women who have remained on the bus after 20 women alighted.
Number of women who have remained on the bus = Initial number of

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9.
- The total number of passengers on the bus is 84.
- 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop.

Step 1: Find the total number of men and women on the bus.
Total number of passengers = 84
Ratio of men to women = 5:9
Let's represent the number of men as 5x and the number of women as 9x, where x is a common factor.
Total number of passengers = 5x + 9x = 14x
84 = 14x
x = 6
Number of men = 5x = 5 × 6 = 30
Number of women = 9x = 9 × 6 = 54

Step 2: Find the number of women who have remained on the bus after 20 women alighted.
Number of women who alighted = 20
Number of women remaining on the bus = 54 - 20 = 34

Therefore, the number of
