Question:
Bud makes homemade macaroni and cheese once a week.  The pasta costs $1.00 a box, and he spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese and twice that amount for the gruyere cheese.  How much money does Bud spend on making macaroni and cheese in one year?


Reference Answer:
The gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the $3.00 cheddar cheese so it costs 2*3 = $<<2*3=6.00>>6.00
The pasta costs $1.00, the cheddar cheese costs $3.00 and the gruyere cheese is $6.00 for a total of 1+3+6 = $<<1+3+6=10.00>>10.00
There are 52 weeks in a year and he makes this dish once a week so it will cost him 52*10 = $<<52*10=520.00>>520.00 in one year
#### 520

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Given information:
- The pasta costs $1.00 per box.
- Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese.
- Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the gruyere cheese.
Cost of gruyere cheese = 2 × $3.00 = $6.00

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese per week.
Total cost per week = Cost of pasta + Cost of cheddar cheese + Cost of gruyere cheese
Total cost per week = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year.
Number of weeks in a year = 52 weeks
Total cost in one year = Total cost per week × Number of weeks in a year
Total cost in one year

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bud makes homemade macaroni and cheese once a week.
- The pasta costs $1.00 per box.
- Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese.
- Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the gruyere cheese.
Cost of gruyere cheese = 2 × $3.00 = $6.00

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of ingredients per week.
Cost of pasta per week = $1.00
Cost of cheddar cheese per week = $3.00
Cost of gruyere cheese per week = $6.00
Total cost of ingredients per week = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of ingredients in one year.
There are 52 weeks in a year.
Total cost of ingredients in one year = $10.00 × 52 =
