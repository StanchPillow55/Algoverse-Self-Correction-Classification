Question ID: 293

Question:
Three friends: Mike, Jim, and Tony decided to play a game. After 3 rounds Mike has 21 points, Jim 3 points less than Mike, and Tony 2 times more than Mike. In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. How many points do all three players have in total after the extra points had been distributed?


Reference Answer:
After 3 rounds Jim has 21 points - 3 points = <<21-3=18>>18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so he has 2 * 21 points = <<2*21=42>>42 points.
In total they have 42 points + 18 points + 21 points = <<42+18+21=81>>81 points.
Only two of them have over 20 points, so in total, all friends have 81 points + 2 points = <<2+81=83>>83 points.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- After 3 rounds, Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike.
- In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

Step 1: Calculate Jim's points after 3 rounds.
Jim's points = Mike's points - 3
Jim's points = 21 - 3 = 18 points

Step 2: Calculate Tony's points after 3 rounds.
Tony's points = 2 × Mike's points
Tony's points = 2 × 21 = 42 points

Step 3: Determine which players have over 20 points and will receive an extra point in the fourth round.
Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he will receive an extra point.
Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he will not receive an extra point.
Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he will receive

- After 3 rounds, Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike.
- In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

Step 1: Calculate Jim's points after 3 rounds.
Jim's points = Mike's points - 3
Jim's points = 21 - 3 = 18 points

Step 2: Calculate Tony's points after 3 rounds.
Tony's points = 2 × Mike's points
Tony's points = 2 × 21 = 42 points

Step 3: Determine which players get the extra point in the fourth round.
Players with over 20 points after 3 rounds get an extra point.
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point.

- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 x 21 = 42 points.
- In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

Step 1: Determine which players get the extra point.
- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

Step 2: Calculate the total points for each player after the extra points are distributed.
- Mike's total points = 21 + 1 = 22 points
- Jim's total points = 18 + 0 = 18
