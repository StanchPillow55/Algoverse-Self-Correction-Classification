Question:
Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.  He works 2 hours less than he sleeps and he walks his dog for an hour each day.  How much free time does Harold have left in his day?


Reference Answer:
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps and he sleeps for 10 hours so he works 10-2 = <<10-2=8>>8 hours
He sleeps for 10 hours, works for 8 hours and walks his dog for 1 hour for a total of 10+8+1 = <<10+8+1=19>>19 hours
There are 24 hours in a day and his busy for 19 hours so that leaves 24-19 = <<24-19=5>>5 hours left of free time

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total time Harold spends on his daily activities and then subtract it from the total time in a day to find his free time.

Given information:
- Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
- He works 2 hours less than he sleeps.
- He walks his dog for an hour each day.

Step 1: Calculate the time Harold spends on sleeping.
Time spent sleeping = 10 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time Harold spends on working.
Time spent working = Time spent sleeping - 2 hours
Time spent working = 10 hours - 2 hours = 8 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time Harold spends on walking his dog.
Time spent walking the dog = 1 hour

Step 4: Calculate the total time Harold spends on his daily activities.
Total time spent on daily activities = Time spent sleeping + Time spent working + Time spent walking the dog
Total time spent on daily activities = 10 hours + 8 hours + 1 hour = 19 hours

Step 5: Calculate Harold's free time.
