Question ID: 423

Question:
Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?


Reference Answer:
Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans.
So, he saved $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 on the tattered jeans.
The original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $<<22+2=24>>24.
Cole bought the tattered jeans for $<<28=28>>28
Hence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $<<28+4=32>>32.
Therefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 more than the tattered jeans.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the original cost of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans, and then calculate the difference between them.

Given information:
- The tattered jeans cost $28.
- The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
- Cole saved a total of $6.
- He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

Step 1: Find the original cost of the jogger jeans.
Let x be the original cost of the jogger jeans.
Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can write:
x = $28 - $6 = $22

Step 2: Find the total savings.
Total savings = $28 + $22 - (Total cost of both jeans)
Total savings = $50 - (Total cost of both jeans)

Step 3: Find the total cost of both jeans.
Total cost of both jeans = Total savings + $6 (the amount saved)
Total cost of both

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- The tattered jeans cost $28.
- The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
- Cole saved a total of $6.
- He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

Step 1: Find the cost of the jogger jeans.
Cost of the jogger jeans = Cost of the tattered jeans - $6
Cost of the jogger jeans = $28 - $6 = $22

Step 2: Find the original cost of the jogger jeans before the sale.
Total savings = $6
Savings from the jogger jeans = 1/3 of the total savings = 1/3 × $6 = $2
Savings from the tattered jeans = 2/3 of the total savings = 2/3 × $6 = $4

Original cost of the jogger jeans = Cost of the jogger jeans + Savings from the jogger jeans
