Question:
Toula went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 3 dozen donuts which cost $68 per dozen, 2 dozen mini cupcakes which cost $80 per dozen, and 6 dozen mini cheesecakes for $55 per dozen. How much was the total cost?


Reference Answer:
The total charge for the doughnuts was 3 x $68 = $<<3*68=204>>204.
The total charge for the mini cupcakes was 2 x $80 = $<<2*80=160>>160.
The total charge for the mini cheesecakes was 6 x $55 = $<<6*55=330>>330.
Therefore the total amount Toula paid for the pastries was $204 + $160 + $330 = $<<204+160+330=694>>694.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the donuts.
Cost of donuts = 3 dozen × $68 per dozen = $204

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes.
Cost of mini cupcakes = 2 dozen × $80 per dozen = $160

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes.
Cost of mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen × $55 per dozen = $330

Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

Therefore, the total cost of the pastries Toula bought at the bakery is $
