Question:
Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the fireman's luncheon.  She cut each pie into 8 pieces and set the five pies out on the buffet table for the guests to serve themselves.  At the end of the evening, after the guests had taken and eaten their pieces of pie, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining.  How many pieces were taken by the guests?


Reference Answer:
To start the evening, there were 5 pies, each with 8 pieces, which is 5*8=<<5*8=40>>40 pieces of pie.
If only 14 remained, then 40-14=<<40-14=26>>26 pieces of pie had been taken by guests.
#### 26

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies.
- Each pie was cut into 8 pieces.
- At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of pie that were available.
Total number of pieces = Number of pies × Number of pieces per pie
Total number of pieces = 5 × 8 = 40 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces taken by the guests.
Number of pieces taken by guests = Total number of pieces - Number of pieces remaining
Number of pieces taken by guests = 40 - 14 = 26 pieces

Therefore, the guests took 26 pieces of pie.
