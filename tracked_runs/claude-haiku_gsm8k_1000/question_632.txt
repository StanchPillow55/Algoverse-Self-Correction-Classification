Question:
A train travels between 3 different cities.  It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city.  It does this trip 3 times a day.  The train needs service every 18,000 miles so how many days does it go between services?


Reference Answer:
It takes 100+75=<<100+75=175>>175 miles for the first two legs of the trip
The third leg is 175-50=<<175-50=125>>125 miles
So the total trip is 175+125=<<175+125=300>>300 miles
So it goes 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 miles per day
So it can go 18000/900=<<18000/900=20>>20 days between services.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The train travels between 3 different cities.
- The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
- The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
- The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs.
- The train does this trip 3 times a day.
- The train needs service every 18,000 miles.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance of the trip.
Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Total distance of the first two legs: 75 + 100 = 175 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 175 - 50 = 125 miles
Total distance of the trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total distance traveled by the train in a day.
The train does this trip 3 times a day

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip:
   * Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
   * Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
   * Total distance from first city to third city: 75 + 100 = 175 miles
   * Distance from third city to first city: 175 - 50 = 125 miles
   * Total distance for one trip: 175 + 125 = 300 miles

2. Calculate the total distance the train travels in one day:
   * The train does this trip 3 times a day
   * Total distance per day: 3 x 300 miles = 900 miles

3. Calculate the number of days between services:
   * The train needs service every 18,000 miles
   * Number of days between services: 18,000 miles / 900 miles per day = 20 days

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.
