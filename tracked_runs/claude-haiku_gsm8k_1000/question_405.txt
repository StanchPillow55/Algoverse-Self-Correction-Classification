Question ID: 1006

Question:
The Smith family is getting ready for summer and needs to have their swimming pool filled. The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. How much will it cost to fill the pool?


Reference Answer:
Mr. Smith found the volume of the pool to be 14 feet wide x 25 feet long x 4 feet deep = <<14*25*4=1400>>1,400 cubic feet
He followed the pool company instructions and found his pool required 1,400 x 5.9 = <<1400*5.9=8260>>8,260 gallons of water.
The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 x 8,260 gallons = $<<0.10*8260=826>>826.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons of water needed.
3. Multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to find the total cost.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
The formula for the volume of a rectangular pool is:
Volume = Length × Width × Depth

Given information:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Calculating the volume:
Volume = 25 feet × 14 feet × 4 feet
Volume = 1,400 cubic feet

Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
The pool company instructed the Smith family to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons of water needed.
Number of gallons = Volume × 5.9
Number of gallons = 1,400 cubic feet × 5.9
Number of gallons = 8,260 gallons

Step 3:

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool:
   * The pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep.
   * Volume = length x width x depth
   * Volume = 14 feet x 25 feet x 4 feet
   * Volume = 1,400 cubic feet

2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons:
   * The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.
   * Gallons = Volume x 5.9
   * Gallons = 1,400 cubic feet x 5.9
   * Gallons = 8,260 gallons

3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool:
   * The cost is $0.10 per gallon.
   * Total cost = Gallons x $0.10 per gallon
   * Total cost = 8,260 gallons x $0.10 per gallon
   * Total cost = $826.00

Therefore, the total
