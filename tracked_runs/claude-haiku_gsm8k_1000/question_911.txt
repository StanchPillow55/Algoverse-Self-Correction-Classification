Question ID: 829

Question:
Boris owns a chocolate factory. He produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. The second week, Boris only produces half as much as the first week. But, the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. How much does he produce the fourth week?


Reference Answer:
In the second week, Boris produces 8,000/2 = <<8000/2=4000>>4,000 bars of chocolate.
In the third week, Boris produces 8,000*3 = <<8000*3=24000>>24,000 bars of chocolate.
In the first three weeks, Boris produces 8,000+4,000+24,000 = <<8000+4000+24000=36000>>36,000 bars of chocolate
In the fourth week, Boris produces 50,000-36,000 = <<50000-36000=14000>>14,000 bars of chocolate.
#### 14,000

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the production of chocolate bars for each week and then determine the production for the fourth week.

Given information:
- Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.
- In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
- In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week.
- In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week.

Step 1: Calculate the production of chocolate bars for the second week.
Production in the second week = 1/2 × 8,000 = 4,000 bars

Step 2: Calculate the production of chocolate bars for the third week.
Production in the third week = 3 × 8,000 = 24,000 bars

Step 3: Calculate the total production of chocolate bars for the first three weeks.
Total production for the first three weeks = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

Step 4: Calculate the production of chocolate bars for the fourth week.
Total production for the month = 50,

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.
- In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
- In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week.
- In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of chocolate produced in the second week.
Amount produced in the second week = 1/2 × 8,000 = 4,000 bars

Step 2: Calculate the amount of chocolate produced in the third week.
Amount produced in the third week = 3 × 8,000 = 24,000 bars

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of chocolate produced in the first three weeks.
Total amount produced in the first three weeks = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

Step 4: Calculate the amount of chocolate that needs to be produced in the fourth week to reach the monthly target of 50,000 bars.

Step 4: Calculate the production in the fourth week.
Total production in the month = 50,000 bars of chocolate
Production in the first three weeks = 36,000 bars
