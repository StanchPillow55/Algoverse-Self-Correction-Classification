Question:
Conor lives near a beach and loves going there every day to have fun. On a particular week, he found 50 people at the beach on the first day. The next day, 20 more people were present at the beach than on the first day, and on the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day. If Conor saw an average of 60 people each day the rest of the week, calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week.


Reference Answer:
There were 50 people at the beach on the first day. On the second day, the number of people at the beach increased to 50 people + 20 people = <<50+20=70>>70 people
The third day, the total number of people at the beach was twice the number on the second day: thus, 2 * 70 people = <<70*2=140>>140 people
For the remaining days of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people per day, for a total of 60 people/day * 4 days = <<60*4=240>>240 people
Conor saw a total of 240 people + 140 people + 70 people + 50 people = <<240+140+70+50=500>>500 people

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- On the first day, Conor found 50 people at the beach.
- On the second day, the number of people increased by 20 compared to the first day.
- On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day.
- For the rest of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people at the beach on the second day.
Number of people on the second day = Number of people on the first day + 20
Number of people on the second day = 50 + 20 = 70 people

Step 2: Calculate the number of people at the beach on the third day.
Number of people on the third day = 2 × Number of people on the second day
Number of people on the third day = 2 × 70 = 140 people

Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach for the rest of the week.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On the first day, there were 50 people at the beach.
- On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day.
- On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number from the second day.
- For the rest of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people on the second day.
Number of people on the second day = 50 + 20 = 70 people

Step 2: Calculate the number of people on the third day.
Number of people on the third day = 2 × 70 = 140 people

Step 3: Calculate the number of people for the rest of the week.
Number of days left in the week = 4 (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday)
Average number of people per day for the rest of the week = 60
Total number of people for the rest of the week = 4 × 60 = 240 people

Step 4: Calculate the
