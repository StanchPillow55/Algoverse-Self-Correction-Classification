Question ID: 686

Question:
Greta and Celinda are baking cookies. Greta bakes 30 cookies and Celinda bakes twice as many. If the pair eat 10 of the cookies while they are cooling and put the rest in a box, how many cookies are there in the box?


Reference Answer:
Celinda bakes 30 cookies * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 cookies.
So in total, Celinda and Greta bakes a total of 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 cookies.
After eating some of the cookies, they have 90 baked cookies – 10 eaten cookies = <<90-10=80>>80 cookies in the box.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Greta bakes 30 cookies.
- Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta.
- Greta and Celinda eat 10 cookies while they are cooling.
- The remaining cookies are put in a box.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies Celinda baked.
Celinda baked twice as many cookies as Greta.
Celinda's cookies = 2 × Greta's cookies
Celinda's cookies = 2 × 30 = 60 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the total number of cookies baked.
Total cookies baked = Greta's cookies + Celinda's cookies
Total cookies baked = 30 + 60 = 90 cookies

Step 3: Calculate the number of cookies eaten while cooling.
Cookies eaten while cooling = 10

Step 4: Calculate the number of cookies put in the box.
Cookies put in the box = Total cookies baked - Cookies eaten while cooling
Cookies put in the box =

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Greta bakes 30 cookies.
2. Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, so Celinda bakes 2 x 30 = 60 cookies.
3. The total number of cookies baked is 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.
4. Greta and Celinda eat 10 cookies while they are cooling.
5. The remaining cookies are put in a box.
6. The number of cookies in the box is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

Therefore, the final answer is that there are 80 cookies in the box.
