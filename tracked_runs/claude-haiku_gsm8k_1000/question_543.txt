Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Rachel bought 23 cookies.
- Janet gave her 42 cookies.
- Rachel's brother ate 44 of those cookies.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies Rachel had.
Total cookies = Cookies Rachel bought + Cookies Janet gave
Total cookies = 23 + 42 = 65 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies Rachel's brother ate.
Cookies eaten by Rachel's brother = 44

Step 3: Calculate the number of cookies left for Rachel.
Cookies left for Rachel = Total cookies - Cookies eaten by Rachel's brother
Cookies left for Rachel = 65 - 44 = 21 cookies

Therefore, the number of cookies left for Rachel is 21 cookies.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Rachel bought 23 cookies.
2. Janet gave her 42 cookies.
3. So the total number of cookies Rachel had is 23 + 42 = 65 cookies.
4. Her brother then ate 44 of those cookies.
5. To find the number of cookies left, we need to subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies Rachel had.
6. 65 cookies - 44 cookies = 21 cookies.

Therefore, the final answer is that Rachel has 21 cookies left.
