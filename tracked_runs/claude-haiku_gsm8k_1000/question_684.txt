Question:
A loaf of bread has 24 slices. If Abby can eat 2 slices a day while Josh can eat twice as much, how many days will the loaf of bread last?

Response:
Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- A loaf of bread has 24 slices.
- Abby can eat 2 slices a day.
- Josh can eat twice as much as Abby.

Step 1: Calculate how many slices Josh can eat per day.
Josh's daily consumption = 2 × Abby's daily consumption
Josh's daily consumption = 2 × 2 = 4 slices per day

Step 2: Calculate the total number of slices consumed per day.
Total slices consumed per day = Abby's daily consumption + Josh's daily consumption
Total slices consumed per day = 2 + 4 = 6 slices per day

Step 3: Calculate the number of days the loaf of bread will last.
Number of days the loaf of bread will last = Total number of slices in the loaf / Total slices consumed per day
Number of days the loaf of bread will last = 24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days

Therefore, the loaf of bread will
