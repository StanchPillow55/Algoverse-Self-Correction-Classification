Question ID: 1063

Question:
James gets 80 emails a day.  20% of those emails don't require any response.  He responds to the rest of them.  How many emails does he respond to in a 5 day work week?


Reference Answer:
He gets 80*.2=<<80*.2=16>>16 emails he doesn't need to respond to
So he responds to 80-16=<<80-16=64>>64 emails
So he responds to 64*5=<<64*5=320>>320 emails a week
#### 320

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- James gets 80 emails a day.
- 20% of those emails don't require any response.
- He responds to the rest of the emails.
- We need to find the number of emails he responds to in a 5-day work week.

Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response.
20% of 80 emails = 0.20 × 80 = 16 emails

Step 2: Calculate the number of emails that require a response.
Total emails - Emails that don't require a response = Emails that require a response
80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails

Step 3: Calculate the number of emails he responds to in a 5-day work week.
Emails that require a response per day × Number of days in a work week = Emails responded to in a work week
64 emails × 5 days = 320 emails

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. James gets 80 emails a day.
2. 20% of those emails don't require any response.
   * To find 20% of 80 emails:
   * 20% of 80 = 0.20 x 80 = 16 emails
   * So, 16 emails per day don't require a response.
3. He responds to the rest of the emails.
   * Total emails per day = 80
   * Emails that don't require a response = 16
   * Emails he responds to = 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.
4. He works a 5 day work week.
   * Emails responded to in 5 days = 64 emails/day x 5 days = 320 emails.

Therefore, the final answer is:
James responds to 320 emails in a 5 day work week.
