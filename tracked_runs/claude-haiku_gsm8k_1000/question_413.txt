Question ID: 383

Question:
Millie decides to open a lemonade stand. She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?


Reference Answer:
She has enough supplies to make 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 cups of lemonade.
She sells all of the lemonade for 36 * $1 = $<<36*1=36>>36.
Her total profit for selling the lemonade is $36 - $18 = $<<36-18=18>>18.
It will take Millie 36 / 4 = <<36/4=9>>9 hours of work to sell all of the lemonade.
Her hourly profit is $18 / 9 hours = $<<18/9=2>>2 per hour.

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Millie spends $18 to buy supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade.
- Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade.
- Millie sells each cup of lemonade for $1.
- Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour.
- Millie sells all of the lemonade.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make.
Total cups of lemonade = 3 pitchers × 12 cups per pitcher = 36 cups

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue Millie will make from selling all the lemonade.
Total revenue = 36 cups × $1 per cup = $36

Step 3: Calculate Millie's profit per hour.
Profit per hour = Total revenue - Cost of supplies
Profit per hour = $36 - $18 = $18

Therefore, Millie will make a profit of $18 per hour that she spends running the lemonade stan

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Millie spends $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade.
2. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade.
3. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1.
4. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour.

To calculate the profit per hour, we need to find the total revenue and total cost, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

Total Revenue:
* 3 pitchers x 12 cups per pitcher = 36 cups of lemonade
* 36 cups x $1 per cup = $36 total revenue

Total Cost:
* $18 spent on supplies

Profit per Hour:
* Total Revenue - Total Cost = $36 - $18 = $18
* Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour
* $18 profit / 4 cups per hour = $4.50 profit per hour

Therefore, Millie will make $4.50 profit per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Millie spends $18 to buy supplies for 3 pitchers of lemonade.
2. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade.
3. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1.
4. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour.

To calculate the profit per hour, we need to:
1. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade.
2. Subtract the initial cost of supplies.
3. Divide the profit by the number of hours the stand is open.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue.
* Total cups of lemonade = 3 pitchers x 12 cups per pitcher = 36 cups
* Revenue = 36 cups x $1 per cup = $36

Step 2: Calculate the profit.
* Profit = Total revenue - Initial cost of supplies
* Profit = $36 - $18 = $18

Step 3: Calculate the profit per hour.
* Profit per hour = Profit / Hours the stand is open
