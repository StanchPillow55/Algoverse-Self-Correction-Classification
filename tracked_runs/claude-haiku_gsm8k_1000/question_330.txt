Question:
Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?


Reference Answer:
The first scene has twice the number of lines as his solo song, so it has 2 * 54 = <<2*54=108>>108 lines.
A third of them are Sean’s lines, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = <<108/3=36>>36 lines.
The second scene has 54 + 6 = <<54+6=60>>60 lines.
Four fifths of the second scene’s lines are Sean’s, so he has to memorize 4 * 60 / 5 = 4 * 12 = <<4*60/5=48>>48 lines.
Sean has to memorize his entire solo song, so he has to memorize 54 + 36 + 48 = <<54+36+48=138>>138 lines in all.
#### 138

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Sean has to memorize the lyrics to one solo song, which has 54 lines.

2. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, which means it has 54 x 2 = 108 lines.
   However, only a third of those lines are Sean's, so the number of lines he has to memorize from the first scene is 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

3. The second scene has six more lines than the song, which means it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.
   Four-fifths of those lines are Sean's, so the number of lines he has to memorize from the second scene is 60 x 4/5 = 48 lines.

4. To calculate the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add up the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene:
   54 + 36 + 48 = 138 lines

Therefore, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is 138.
