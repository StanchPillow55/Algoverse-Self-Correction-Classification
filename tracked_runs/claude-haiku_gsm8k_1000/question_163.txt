Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
- Katarina has 68 cookies.

Step 1: Find the number of cookies that Max has.
Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, we can say that:
Katarina's cookies = Max's cookies - 5
68 = Max's cookies - 5
Max's cookies = 68 + 5 = 73 cookies

Step 2: Find the number of cookies that the Cookie Monster has.
Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so:
Max's cookies = Cookie Monster's cookies + 12
73 = Cookie Monster's cookies + 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 73 - 12 = 61 cookies

Step 3: Find the number of cookies that Summer has.
Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so:
Summer's cookies = Max's cookies + 23
Summer's cookies =

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max:
   * If Katarina has 68 cookies, then Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:
   * If Max has 73 cookies, then the Cookie Monster must have 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max:
   * If Max has 73 cookies, then Summer must have 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies:
* Katarina: 68 cookies
* Max: 73 cookies
* Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
* Summer: 96 cookies

Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is 298.
