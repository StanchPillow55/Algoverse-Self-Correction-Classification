Question ID: 555

Question:
John plans to save money from working.  He gets paid $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week.  If he wants to save $80 how many weeks will it take him?


Reference Answer:
He gets paid 2*5=$<<2*5=10>>10 a day.
So he gets paid 10*4=$<<10*4=40>>40 a week.
That means it would take 80/40=<<80/40=2>>2 weeks to save up the money.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money John earns per week and then calculate the number of weeks it will take him to save $80.

Given information:
- John gets paid $2 per hour.
- He works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week.
- He wants to save $80.

Step 1: Calculate John's daily earnings.
Daily earnings = Hourly rate × Hours worked per day
Daily earnings = $2 × 5 hours = $10

Step 2: Calculate John's weekly earnings.
Weekly earnings = Daily earnings × Days worked per week
Weekly earnings = $10 × 4 days = $40

Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks it will take John to save $80.
Number of weeks = Target savings / Weekly earnings
Number of weeks = $80 / $40 = 2 weeks

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

Final answer: It will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John gets paid $2 per hour.
2. He works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week.
3. He wants to save $80.

To calculate how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we need to find out how much he earns per week and then divide the target savings by that amount.

Earnings per week:
* Hourly rate: $2 per hour
* Hours per day: 5 hours
* Days per week: 4 days
* Earnings per week = $2 x 5 hours x 4 days = $40 per week

Now, to find the number of weeks:
* Target savings: $80
* Earnings per week: $40
* Weeks needed = $80 / $40 = 2 weeks

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.
