Question ID: 1245

Question:
Mary is making ice cubes with fruit frozen in them for a cocktail party. She makes some strawberry cubes, and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes total, how many blueberry cubes does she make?


Reference Answer:
Let s be the number of strawberry cubes and b be the number of blueberry cubes. We know that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116.
Substituting the first equation into the second, we get s + 5s - 4 = 116.
Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116
Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120
Dividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20
Substituting this value back into the equation b = 5s - 4, we get b = 96
#### 96

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mary makes some strawberry cubes.
- The number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.
- The total number of ice cubes made is 116.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of strawberry cubes
- Let y = the number of blueberry cubes

We know that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so:
y = 5x - 4

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
x + y = 116

Now, we can substitute the expression for y into the second equation:
x + (5x - 4) = 116
6x - 4 = 116
6x = 120
x = 20

So, the number of strawberry cubes is 20.

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:
y = 5x - 4
