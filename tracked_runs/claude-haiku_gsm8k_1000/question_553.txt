Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ted starts with $200.
- He buys 3 books for $16 each.
- He buys 3 pencils for $6 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the books.
Cost of 3 books = 3 × $16 = $48

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the pencils.
Cost of 3 pencils = 3 × $6 = $18

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Ted spent.
Total amount spent = Cost of books + Cost of pencils
Total amount spent = $48 + $18 = $66

Therefore, Ted spent a total of $66.

Final answer: Ted spent a total of $66.
