Question ID: 1194

Question:
From her science class study, Brady learned that each whale in the sea has 40 gallons of blood. She also learned that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Calculate the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have.


Reference Answer:
Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, then a shark has 3*40 = <<3*40=120>>120 gallons of blood.
10 sharks swimming in the sea will have 10*120 = <<10*120=1200>>1200 gallons of blood.
#### 1200

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each whale has 40 gallons of blood.
- A shark has three times as much blood as a whale.
- We need to calculate the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of blood a single shark has.
Amount of blood in a whale = 40 gallons
Amount of blood in a shark = 3 × 40 gallons = 120 gallons

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of blood in ten sharks.
Total amount of blood in ten sharks = 10 × 120 gallons = 1,200 gallons

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is 1,200 gallons.
