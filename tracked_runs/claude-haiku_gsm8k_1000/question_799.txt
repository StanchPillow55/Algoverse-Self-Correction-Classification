Question:
A basket of green food costs $25 and a basket of red food costs $18. If you buy 3 baskets of green food and red food, how much will you have to pay in total if you get $2 off for each basket of red food?


Reference Answer:
The 3 baskets of green food will cost $25 x 3 = $<<25*3=75>>75.
The 3 baskets of red food will cost $18 x 3 = $<<18*3=54>>54.
There will be $2 x 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6 off for the baskets of red food.
So, the 3 baskets of red food will now cost $54 - $6 = $<<54-6=48>>48.
You will have to pay $75 + $48 = $<<75+48=123>>123 for all the baskets of food.

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- A basket of green food costs $25.
- A basket of red food costs $18.
- You buy 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food.
- You get $2 off for each basket of red food.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 3 baskets of green food.
Cost of 3 baskets of green food = 3 × $25 = $75

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the 3 baskets of red food without the discount.
Cost of 3 baskets of red food = 3 × $18 = $54

Step 3: Calculate the discount for the 3 baskets of red food.
Discount for 3 baskets of red food = 3 × $2 = $6

Step 4: Calculate the total cost after the discount.
Total cost = Cost of 3 baskets of green food + Cost of 3 baskets of red food - Discount
Total cost = $75 + $54

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- A basket of green food costs $25.
- A basket of red food costs $18.
- You buy 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food.
- You get $2 off for each basket of red food.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the green food.
Cost of 3 baskets of green food = 3 × $25 = $75

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the red food before the discount.
Cost of 3 baskets of red food = 3 × $18 = $54

Step 3: Calculate the discount for the red food.
Discount per basket of red food = $2
Total discount = 3 × $2 = $6

Step 4: Calculate the total cost after the discount.
Total cost = Cost of green food + Cost of red food - Discount
Total cost = $75 + $54 - $6 = $123

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is $123.
