Question ID: 980

Question:
Adrianne is collecting different kinds of beads for making bracelets. Her mother gave her 20 metallic beads. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, and her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave.  How many beads did Adrianne have altogether?


Reference Answer:
Adrianne received 20 +10 = <<20+10=30>>30 beads from her sister.
And, she received 2 x 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 beads from her friend.
Therefore, Adrianne had 20 + 30 + 40 = <<20+30+40=90>>90 beads altogether.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
- Adrianne's sister gave her ten more beads than her mother.
- Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother.

Step 1: Calculate the number of beads Adrianne's sister gave her.
Beads from sister = Beads from mother + 10
Beads from sister = 20 + 10 = 30 beads

Step 2: Calculate the number of beads Adrianne's friend gave her.
Beads from friend = 2 × Beads from mother
Beads from friend = 2 × 20 = 40 beads

Step 3: Calculate the total number of beads Adrianne had altogether.
Total beads = Beads from mother + Beads from sister + Beads from friend
Total beads = 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads

Therefore, Adrianne had 90 beads altogether.
