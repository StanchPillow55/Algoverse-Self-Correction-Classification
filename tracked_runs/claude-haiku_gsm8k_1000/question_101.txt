Question ID: 830

Question:
Britany records 18 4-minute TikTok videos each week. She spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs to sing on TikTok, and 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup before filming herself for TikTok. How much time does Britany spend on TikTok in a month with four weeks?


Reference Answer:
First find how long Britany spends recording the videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = <<18*4=72>>72 minutes
Then find how long she spends writing songs in minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes
Then find how long Britany spending doing her makeup in a week: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = <<15*6=90>>90 minutes/week
Then add the time she spends on videos and song-writing to find the total time she spends on TikTok in a week: 72 minutes/week + 90 minutes/week + 120 minutes/week = <<72+90+120=282>>282 minutes/week
Then multiply the time spent per week by the number of weeks per month to find the total time spent per month: 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = <<282*4=1128>>1128 minutes/month
#### 1128

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Britany records 18 4-minute TikTok videos each week.
   * Time spent recording videos per week = 18 videos x 4 minutes per video = 72 minutes per week

2. Britany spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs to sing on TikTok.
   * Time spent writing songs per week = 2 hours = 120 minutes

3. Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup before filming herself for TikTok.
   * Time spent on makeup per week = 15 minutes x 6 days = 90 minutes

4. Now we need to calculate the total time spent on TikTok activities per week:
   * Total time per week = 72 minutes (recording videos) + 120 minutes (writing songs) + 90 minutes (makeup) = 282 minutes

5. To find the total time spent on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we multiply the weekly time by 4:
   * Total time in a month
