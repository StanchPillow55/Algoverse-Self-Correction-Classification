Question ID: 723

Question:
The restaurant has 170 normal chairs and 23 chairs for babies. If 20 of the normal chairs and 13 of the baby chairs were sent to the carpenter for repair, how many chairs does the restaurant have left?


Reference Answer:
Before sending the chairs and baby chairs to the carpenter the restaurant had 170 + 23 = <<170+23=193>>193 chairs.
They sent 20 + 13 = <<20+13=33>>33 chairs to the carpenter.
Now, they have 193 - 33 = <<193-33=160>>160 chairs left.
#### 160

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The restaurant has 170 normal chairs and 23 chairs for babies.
- 20 of the normal chairs and 13 of the baby chairs were sent to the carpenter for repair.

Step 1: Calculate the number of normal chairs left.
Total normal chairs - Chairs sent for repair = Normal chairs left
170 - 20 = 150 normal chairs left

Step 2: Calculate the number of baby chairs left.
Total baby chairs - Chairs sent for repair = Baby chairs left
23 - 13 = 10 baby chairs left

Step 3: Calculate the total number of chairs left.
Normal chairs left + Baby chairs left = Total chairs left
150 + 10 = 160 chairs left

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left.

Final answer: The restaurant has 160 chairs left.
