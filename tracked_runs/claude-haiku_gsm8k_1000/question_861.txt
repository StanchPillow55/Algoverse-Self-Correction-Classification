Question ID: 1164

Question:
Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard for the Easter egg hunt.  Lamar finds 5 eggs. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar.  Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy.  And Mei finds half as many as Charlie.  How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?


Reference Answer:
Cole hides 3 x 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 eggs.
Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 eggs.
Charlie finds 10 - 2 = <<10-2=8>>8 eggs.
Mei finds 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 eggs.
The children find a total of 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = <<5+10+8+4=27>>27 eggs.
The total number of hidden eggs still in the yard is 36 - 27 = <<36-27=9>>9 eggs.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard.
- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie.

Step 1: Calculate how many eggs Stacy found.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so:
Stacy's eggs = 2 × Lamar's eggs
Stacy's eggs = 2 × 5 = 10 eggs

Step 2: Calculate how many eggs Charlie found.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so:
Charlie's eggs = Stacy's eggs - 2
Charlie's eggs = 10 - 2 = 8 eggs

Step 3: Calculate how many eggs Mei found.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so:
Mei's eggs = 1/2 × Charlie's eggs
Mei's eggs = 1/2 × 8
