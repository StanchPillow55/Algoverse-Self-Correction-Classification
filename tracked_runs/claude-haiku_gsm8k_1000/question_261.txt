Question ID: 54

Question:
The Doubtfire sisters are driving home with 7 kittens adopted from the local animal shelter when their mother calls to inform them that their two house cats have just had kittens. She says that Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, while Trixie, the other cat, has had 12. How many kittens does the Doubtfire family now have?


Reference Answer:
Patchy has just had 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 kittens
Since Trixie's kittens are 12, both cats have 21 +12 = <<21+12=33>>33 kittens.
Combining the adopted kittens with those from the two cats, the Doubtfire family now has 7 + 33 = <<7+33=40>>40 kittens.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family has after the two house cats have had their litters.

Given information:
- The Doubtfire sisters have 7 adopted kittens.
- Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens.
- Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family has.
Total number of kittens = Number of adopted kittens + Number of kittens Patchy has had + Number of kittens Trixie has had
Total number of kittens = 7 + 21 + 12 = 40 kittens

Therefore, the Doubtfire family now has a total of
