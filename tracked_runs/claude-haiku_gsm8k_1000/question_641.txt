Question:
The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100. How much do both cars cost?


Reference Answer:
The red car is 40/100 * 100 = $<<40/100*100=40>>40 cheaper than the blue car.
That means, that the red car costs 100 - 40 = $<<100-40=60>>60.
So both cars cost 100 + 60 = $<<100+60=160>>160.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car.
- The price of the blue car is $100.

Step 1: Calculate the price of the red car.
Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, that means the red car's price is 60% of the blue car's price.
Price of the red car = 60% of $100 = 0.60 Ã— $100 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of both cars.
Total cost = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car
Total cost = $100 + $60 = $160

Therefore, the total cost of both the red car and the blue car is $160.

Final answer: The total cost of both cars is $160.
