Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The initial temperature was 2 degrees Celsius.
- The temperature dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight.
- The temperature then increased 3 degrees Celsius in the morning.

Step 1: Calculate the temperature after the overnight drop.
Initial temperature: 2 degrees Celsius
Temperature drop: 8 degrees Celsius
Temperature after the overnight drop = 2 degrees Celsius - 8 degrees Celsius = -6 degrees Celsius

Step 2: Calculate the temperature after the morning increase.
Temperature after the overnight drop: -6 degrees Celsius
Temperature increase in the morning: 3 degrees Celsius
Temperature in the morning = -6 degrees Celsius + 3 degrees Celsius = -3 degrees Celsius

Therefore, the temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius.

Final answer: The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius.
