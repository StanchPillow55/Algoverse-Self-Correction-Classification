Question ID: 1181

Question:
Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. How old is Colin now?


Reference Answer:
Let x be Colin's age now.
(x+7)*5=(x+25)*3
5*x+35=3*x+75
2*x=40
x=<<20=20>>20
#### 20

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the given information and then solve for Colin's current age.

Given information:
- Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
- In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be Colin's current age.
- Let y be Wendy's current age.

Step 1: Set up the first equation based on the first given information.
Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
Wendy's age = 5 × (Colin's age in 7 years)
y = 5 × (x + 7)

Step 2: Set up the second equation based on the second given information.
In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
Colin's age in 25 years = 1/3 × Wendy's current age
x + 25 = 1/3 × y

Step 3: Solve the system of equations.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
- In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = Colin's current age
- Let y = Wendy's current age

Step 1: Express Wendy's age in terms of Colin's age.
Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
Wendy's age = 5 × (x + 7)

Step 2: Express Colin's age in 25 years in terms of Wendy's current age.
In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
Colin's age in 25 years = y/3

Step 3: Set up an equation to solve for Colin's current age.
Colin's age in 25 years = x + 25
y/3 = x + 25

Step 4: Substitute Wendy's age in terms of Colin's age

Step 3: Set up an equation to solve for Colin's current age.
Colin's age in 25 years = x + 25
y/3 = x + 25

Step 4: Substitute Wendy's age in terms of Colin's age.
y/3 = x +
