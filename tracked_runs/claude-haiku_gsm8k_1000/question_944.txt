Question ID: 769

Question:
Tanya is teaching at school. She earns $15 for every hour and an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. On Monday she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours, and on Wednesday 2 classes for 2 hours. How much did Tanya earn for these two days of teaching?


Reference Answer:
Tanya worked for 5 hours + 2 hours = <<5+2=7>>7 hours.
She earned therefore 7 hours * $15/hour = $<<7*15=105>>105.
On Monday she taught more than 3 classes, so she got a bonus and in total earned $105 + $5 = $110.
