Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jeff is 10 years older than his younger sister, Martha.
- Martha is 4 years younger than her boyfriend, Mike.
- Mike is 24 years old.

Step 1: Find Martha's age.
Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate her age as:
Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4 = 20 years old

Step 2: Find Jeff's age.
Since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, we can calculate his age as:
Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10 = 30 years old

Therefore, the final answer is:
Jeff is 30 years old.
