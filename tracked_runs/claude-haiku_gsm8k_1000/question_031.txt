Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of paintball guns and then divide it equally among the four individuals.

Given information:
- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- RJ has 1 gun.
- Richard has 5 guns.

Step 1: Find the total number of paintball guns.
Total number of guns = DJ's guns + Nick's guns + RJ's guns + Richard's guns
Total number of guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 guns

Step 2: Divide the total number of guns equally among the four individuals.
Number of guns each person would have = Total number of guns / Number of individuals
Number of guns each person would have = 24 / 4 = 6 guns

Therefore, if Nick, Richard, Jason, and DJ were to share their guns equally, each of them would have 6 guns.

Final answer: Each person would have 6 guns.
