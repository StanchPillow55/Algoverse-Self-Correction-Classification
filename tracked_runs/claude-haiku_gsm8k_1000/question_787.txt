Question ID: 226

Question:
James is counting his Pokemon cards. He has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. If he loses 8 of the water type and buys 14 grass type, what's the percentage chance (rounded to the nearest integer) that a randomly picked card will be a water type?


Reference Answer:
First find the final number of grass type Pokemon: 20 grass type + 14 grass type = <<20+14=34>>34 grass type
Then find the final number of water type Pokemon: 40 water type - 8 water type = <<40-8=32>>32 water type
Then add the number of each type of Pokemon to find the total number: 34 Pokemon + 32 Pokemon + 30 Pokemon = <<34+32+30=96>>96 Pokemon
Then divide the number of water type Pokemon by the total number of Pokemon and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 32 water type / 96 Pokemon * 100% = 33.333...%, which rounds down to 33%

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type Pokemon cards.
- He loses 8 of the water type cards.
- He buys 14 grass type cards.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes.
Initial total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards
Lose 8 water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
Buy 14 grass type cards = 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards
New total cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 cards

Step 2: Calculate the number of water type cards James has after the changes.
Water type cards = 32

Step 3: Calculate the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type.
Percentage of water type cards = (Number of water type cards / Total cards) x 100
Percentage of water type cards = (32 / 96) x

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type Pokemon cards.
- He loses 8 of the water type cards.
- He buys 14 grass type cards.

Step 1: Calculate the new number of cards for each type after the changes.
Fire type: 30 (no change)
Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Step 2: Calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes.
Total cards = Fire type + Grass type + Water type
Total cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

Step 3: Calculate the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type.
Percentage of water type cards = (Number of water type cards / Total cards) × 100
Percentage of water type cards = (32 / 96) × 100 = 33.33%

Rounding to the nearest integer, the final answer is:
