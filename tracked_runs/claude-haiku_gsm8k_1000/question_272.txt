Question:
Theo bought a pen for $2 and a piece of paper that cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. She gave the cashier $10. What is the amount of change Theo received?


Reference Answer:
Three times the cost of pen is $2 x 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.
The cost of paper is $6 - $1 = $<<6-1=5>>5.
The total cost for the pen and paper is $2 + $5 = $<<2+5=7>>7.
Theo received $10 - $7 = $<<10-7=3>>3 change.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Theo bought a pen for $2.
- The piece of paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen.
- Theo gave the cashier $10.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the piece of paper.
Cost of the piece of paper = 3 Ã— $2 - $1 = $5

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the items Theo bought.
Total cost = Cost of the pen + Cost of the piece of paper
Total cost = $2 + $5 = $7

Step 3: Calculate the amount of change Theo received.
Amount of change = Amount given to the cashier - Total cost
Amount of change = $10 - $7 = $3

Therefore, the amount of change Theo received is $3.
