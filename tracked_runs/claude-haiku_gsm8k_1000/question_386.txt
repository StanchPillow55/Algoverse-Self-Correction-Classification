Question ID: 1210

Question:
To kick off summer, Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends.  They fill up 10 packs of balloons that have 30 balloons per pack.  By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left.  How many balloons did they throw?


Reference Answer:
They started off with 10 packs of balloons that had 30 balloons each for a total of 10*30 = <<10*30=300>>300 balloons
They started with 300 balloons and had 12 left which means they threw 300-12 = <<300-12=288>>288 balloons
#### 288

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jolene and her friends filled up 10 packs of balloons
- Each pack has 30 balloons
- By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left

To find the total number of balloons thrown, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of balloons filled
2. Subtract the number of balloons left at the end

Step 1: Calculate the total number of balloons filled
Total balloons filled = Number of packs × Balloons per pack
Total balloons filled = 10 × 30 = 300 balloons

Step 2: Subtract the number of balloons left at the end
Balloons thrown = Total balloons filled - Balloons left
Balloons thrown = 300 - 12 = 288 balloons

Therefore, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons during their water balloon fight.
