Question:
Carver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years less than twice the age of his son.  How old is his son, in years?


Reference Answer:
Let x be the age of Carver's son.
Since Carver's age (45) is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, then 45=(2*x)-5.
Add 5 to each side of the equation and we get 50=2*x.
Thus, the age of Carver's son is x=25 years old.
#### 25

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information and then solve for the age of Carver's son.

Given information:
- Carver just turned 45 years old.
- Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son.

Let's represent the age of Carver's son as x.

Step 1: Set up the equation.
Carver's age = 2 Ã— (Carver's son's age) - 5
45 = 2x - 5

Step 2: Solve the equation for x.
45 + 5 = 2x
50 = 2x
x = 25

Therefore, the age of Carver's son is 25 years.

Final answer: Carver's son is 25 years old.
