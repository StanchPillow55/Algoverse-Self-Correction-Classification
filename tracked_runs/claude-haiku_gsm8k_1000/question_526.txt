Question ID: 730

Question:
Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day.  A pack of gum has 15 pieces of chewing gum per pack.  How many packs of gum will he need to last him 30 days?


Reference Answer:
He chews 4 pieces of gum a day so over 30 days he will chew 4*30 = <<4*30=120>>120 pieces of gum
Each pack of gum holds 15 pieces and he needs 120 pieces for the month so he will need 120/15 = <<120/15=8>>8 packs of gum
#### 8

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day.
- A pack of gum has 15 pieces of chewing gum per pack.
- We need to find how many packs of gum he will need to last him 30 days.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days.
Total pieces of gum needed = Number of pieces per day × Number of days
Total pieces of gum needed = 4 pieces/day × 30 days = 120 pieces of gum

Step 2: Calculate the number of packs of gum needed to last 30 days.
Number of packs needed = Total pieces of gum needed / Pieces of gum per pack
Number of packs needed = 120 pieces / 15 pieces per pack = 8 packs

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

Final answer: 8 packs of gum
