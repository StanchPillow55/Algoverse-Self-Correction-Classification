Question ID: 1289

Question:
Octavia wants to make a quilt for her sister. She is going to build it from small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with. A small t-shirt is 3 square feet of fabric. A medium one is 4 square feet. A large one is 6 square feet. If she uses 11 small shirts, 8 medium, and 6 large shirts, how many square feet is the quilt?


Reference Answer:
The quilt has 33 square feet from small shirts because 11 x 3 = <<11*3=33>>33
The quilt has 32 square feet from medium shirts because 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32
The quilt has 36 square feet from large shirts because 6 x 6 = <<6*6=36>>36
The quilt is 101 square feet because 33 + 32 + 36 = <<33+32+36=101>>101

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Small t-shirt = 3 square feet of fabric
- Medium t-shirt = 4 square feet of fabric
- Large t-shirt = 6 square feet of fabric
- Octavia uses 11 small shirts, 8 medium shirts, and 6 large shirts

To find the total square feet of the quilt, we need to calculate the area contributed by each size of t-shirt and then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the area contributed by the small t-shirts.
Area of small t-shirts = 11 shirts × 3 square feet per shirt = 33 square feet

Step 2: Calculate the area contributed by the medium t-shirts.
Area of medium t-shirts = 8 shirts × 4 square feet per shirt = 32 square feet

Step 3: Calculate the area contributed by the large t-shirts.
Area of large t-shirts = 6 shirts × 6 square feet per shirt = 36 square feet

Step 4: Calculate the total area of the quilt.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Octavia is using 11 small t-shirts, each of which is 3 square feet of fabric.
   * 11 small t-shirts x 3 square feet per t-shirt = 33 square feet

2. Octavia is using 8 medium t-shirts, each of which is 4 square feet of fabric.
   * 8 medium t-shirts x 4 square feet per t-shirt = 32 square feet

3. Octavia is using 6 large t-shirts, each of which is 6 square feet of fabric.
   * 6 large t-shirts x 6 square feet per t-shirt = 36 square feet

4. To calculate the total square feet of the quilt, we add up the areas of the small, medium, and large t-shirts:
   * 33 square feet + 32 square feet + 36 square feet = 101 square feet

Therefore, the total square feet of the quilt is 101 square feet.
