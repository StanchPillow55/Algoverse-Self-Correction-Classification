Question ID: 1152

Question:
Mark buys one lottery ticket with a 20% chance of winning and a second lottery ticket that's three times more likely to win. What is the probability, expressed as a percentage, that both tickets are winners?


Reference Answer:
First triple 20% to find the second ticket's chance of winning: .2 * 3 = <<.2*3=.6>>.6
Then multiply both tickets' chances of winning to find the probability they both win, and multiply that by 100 to convert it to a percentage: .6 * .2 * 100% = 12%
#### 12

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of both tickets winning.

Given information:
- The first lottery ticket has a 20% chance of winning.
- The second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket.

Step 1: Find the probability of the second ticket winning.
Probability of the second ticket winning = 3 × Probability of the first ticket winning
Probability of the second ticket winning = 3 × 0.20 = 0.60 or 60%

Step 2: Find the probability of both tickets winning.
Probability of both tickets winning = Probability of the first ticket winning × Probability of the second ticket winning
Probability of both tickets winning = 0.20 × 0.60 = 0.12 or 12%

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners, expressed as a percentage, is 12%.
