Question ID: 778

Question:
At the local Pick Your Own fruit orchard, you could pick your own peaches for $2.00 per pound, plums were $1.00 per pound and apricots were $3.00 per pound.  If Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches, 8 pounds of plums and 6 pounds of apricots, how much did he spend on fruit?


Reference Answer:
He bought 6 pounds of peaches that are $2.00 per pound so he spent 6*2 = $<<6*2=12.00>>12.00 on peaches
He bought 8 pounds of plums that are $1.00 per pound so he spent 8*1 = $<<8*1=8.00>>8.00 on plums
He bought 6 pounds of apricots that are $3.00 per pound so he spent 6*3 = $<<6*3=18.00>>18.00 on apricots
That day, he spent 12+8+18 = $<<12+8+18=38.00>>38.00 on fruit

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruit that Winston picked.

Given information:
- Peaches: $2.00 per pound
- Plums: $1.00 per pound
- Apricots: $3.00 per pound
- Winston picked:
  - 6 pounds of peaches
  - 8 pounds of plums
  - 6 pounds of apricots

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the peaches.
Cost of peaches = 6 pounds × $2.00 per pound = $12.00

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the plums.
Cost of plums = 8 pounds × $1.00 per pound = $8.00

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the apricots.
Cost of apricots = 6 pounds × $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the fruit.
Total cost = Cost of peaches + Cost of plums + Cost of apricots
Total cost = $12.00 + $8.00

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Calculate the cost of the peaches:
   * Peaches: 6 pounds x $2.00 per pound = $12.00

2. Calculate the cost of the plums:
   * Plums: 8 pounds x $1.00 per pound = $8.00

3. Calculate the cost of the apricots:
   * Apricots: 6 pounds x $3.00 per pound = $18.00

4. Add up the total cost of all the fruit:
   * Total cost = $12.00 (peaches) + $8.00 (plums) + $18.00 (apricots) = $38.00

Therefore, the total amount Winston spent on fruit is $38.00.
