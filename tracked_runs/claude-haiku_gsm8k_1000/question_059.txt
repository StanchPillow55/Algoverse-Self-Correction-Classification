Question:
John orders some pizzas to share with his friends.  There are 20 friends in total, and John wants to make sure each can have 4 slices.  Pizzas are only sold sliced into 8 portions.  How many Pizzas does John need to order?


Reference Answer:
John's 20 friends each need 4 slices, so that means 4*20= <<4*20=80>>80 slices are needed
Each pizza has 8 slices, so to get 80 slices in total 80/8= <<80/8=10>>10 pizzas are needed
#### 10


=== Turn 1 ===


Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of slices required and then determine the minimum number of pizzas needed to provide those slices.

Given information:
- There are 20 friends in total.
- Each friend should have 4 slices.
- Pizzas are sold sliced into 8 portions.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices required.
Total number of friends × Number of slices per friend = Total number of slices required
20 × 4 = 80 slices

Step 2: Determine the minimum number of pizzas needed.
Total number of slices required / Number of slices per pizza = Number of pizzas needed
80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure that each of his 20 friends can have 4 slices.

Final answer: John needs to order 10 pizzas.
