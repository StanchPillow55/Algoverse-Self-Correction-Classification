Question ID: 153

Question:
Dave bought a large pack of french fries and ate fourteen before a hungry seagull stole the pack out of his hand. When the seagull landed, he gobbled down half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Then three pigeons bullied him away from the food, and each pigeon ate three fries. Later, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. How many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?


Reference Answer:
Dave ate 14 french fries, so the seagull ate 14 * 1/2 = 14 / 2 = <<14*1/2=7>>7 fries.
The 3 pigeons ate 3 each, so they ate 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 fries.
The ants took one french fry, so there were 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 after the racoon took some.
The raccoon left 1/3 behind, so there were 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 fries before the raccoon took any.
Thus, the pack had 14 + 7 + 9 + 18 = <<14+7+9+18=48>>48 fries in it when Dave bought it.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the final amount of french fries left to find the original number of fries in the pack.

Given information:
- Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull stole the pack.
- The seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate.
- Three pigeons each ate 3 fries.
- The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
- Ants carried off one final fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fries the seagull ate.
Seagull ate = 1/2 × 14 = 7 fries

Step 2: Calculate the number of fries remaining after the seagull's theft.
Remaining fries = 14 - 7 = 7 fries

Step 3: Calculate the number of fries eaten by the three pigeons.
Pigeons ate = 3 × 3 = 9 fries

Step 4: Calculate the number of fries remaining after the pigeons' theft.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Dave ate 14 french fries before the seagull stole the pack.

2. The seagull then ate half the amount that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   * Remaining fries = Original amount - Dave's eaten - Seagull's eaten
   * Remaining fries = Original amount - 14 - 7 = Original amount - 21

3. Three pigeons then each ate 3 fries, so 3 x 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
   * Remaining fries = Original amount - 21 - 9 = Original amount - 30

4. A raccoon then stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
   * Remaining fries = Original amount - 30
   * Raccoon took two-thirds of (Original amount - 30)
   * Remaining fries = (Original amount - 30) - (2/3 * (Original amount - 30))
   * Remaining
