Question ID: 700

Question:
Hannah's city is having a big display of fireworks for the 4th of July. They're going to set off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. How many fireworks will Hannah see in total?


Reference Answer:
First find the total number of fireworks the city sets off: 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = <<15*20=300>>300 fireworks
Then multiply that number by the proportion of the fireworks Hannah can see: 300 fireworks * 40% = <<300*40*.01=120>>120 fireworks
Then find the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her own backyard: 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = <<3*5=15>>15 fireworks
Then add the number of city fireworks to the number of personal fireworks to find the total number of fireworks: 15 fireworks + 120 fireworks = <<15+120=135>>135 fireworks
#### 135

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
- Hannah's house is at a right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks.
- Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city.
Total fireworks set off by the city = 15 boxes × 20 fireworks per box = 300 fireworks

Step 2: Calculate the number of fireworks Hannah can see from the city's display.
Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks = 0.40 × 300 = 120 fireworks

Step 3: Calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard.
Fireworks set off in Hannah's backyard = 3 boxes × 5 fireworks per box = 15 fireworks

Step 4: Calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah will see.
Total fireworks Hannah will see = Fireworks from city

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each:
   * 15 boxes x 20 fireworks per box = 300 fireworks set off by the city

2. Hannah's house can see 40% of the city's fireworks:
   * 40% of 300 fireworks = 0.4 x 300 = 120 fireworks

3. Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard:
   * 3 boxes x 5 fireworks per box = 15 fireworks

4. To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see:
   * Fireworks from the city: 120
   * Fireworks from her backyard: 15
   * Total fireworks: 120 + 15 = 135 fireworks

Therefore, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 135.
