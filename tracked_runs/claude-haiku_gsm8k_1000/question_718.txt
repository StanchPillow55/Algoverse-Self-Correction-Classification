Question ID: 999

Question:
A family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) are to divide a watermelon such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. What percentage of the watermelon does each adult get?


Reference Answer:
Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.
Since each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon
So the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage
The percentages have to sum up to 100 so 2x+2x = 100 (after simplification)
x = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.
#### 25

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets.

Given information:
- The family consists of 6 people: 2 adults and 4 kids.
- Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.

Step 1: Determine the total number of slices the watermelon is divided into.
Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can consider the watermelon to be divided into 6 equal parts.

Step 2: Determine the size of each adult's slice.
Each adult's slice = 2 × size of each kid's slice
Since the watermelon is divided into 6 equal parts, each adult's slice = 2 × (1/6) = 1/3 of the watermelon.

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets.
Percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets = (1/3) × 100% = 33.33%

Therefore, each adult gets 33.33% of the watermelon.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The family consists of 6 people: 2 adults and 4 kids.
- The adults are to get a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the total number of slices the watermelon is divided into.
Since the adults get a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can say that the total number of slices is 6 (2 adults + 4 kids).

Step 2: Determine the size of each adult's slice relative to the kid's slice.
As stated, the adult's slice is twice as big as the kid's slice. So, if the kid's slice is 1 unit, the adult's slice is 2 units.

Step 3: Calculate the total size of the watermelon.
Since the total number of slices is 6, and the adult's slice is 2 units while the kid's slice is 1 unit, the total
