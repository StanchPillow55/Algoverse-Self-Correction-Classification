Question ID: 892

Question:
Ellen is on a diet. She eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs her $6, while the yogurt is half the price. How much does Ellen pay for one carrot every day when in total she pays $11 for her goods?


Reference Answer:
Ellen's yogurt cost is half the price of the salad, so it's $6 / 2 = $<<6/2=3>>3.
For the two carrots Ellen needs to pay $11 - $6 - $3 = $<<11-6-3=2>>2.
So one carrot costs $2 / $2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of one carrot.

Given information:
- Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt is half the price of the salad.
- The total cost of her goods is $11.

Step 1: Find the cost of the yogurt.
Cost of the yogurt = 1/2 × Cost of the salad
Cost of the yogurt = 1/2 × $6 = $3

Step 2: Find the total cost of the salad and the yogurt.
Total cost of the salad and the yogurt = Cost of the salad + Cost of the yogurt
Total cost of the salad and the yogurt = $6 + $3 = $9

Step 3: Find the cost of the two carrots.
Total cost of the goods = $11
Total cost of the salad and the yogurt = $9
Cost of the two carrots = Total cost of the goods - Total cost of the salad and the yogurt
Cost of the two carrots
