Question ID: 683

Question:
Chris has a two-speed lawn mower. He can mow his entire lawn in "turtle" mode in 1 hour, or 40 minutes in "rabbit" mode. Today, he experimented by mowing half in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode. How many minutes did it take him to mow the lawn?


Reference Answer:
He spends 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 minutes in turtle mode
He spends 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 minutes in rabbit mode
He took 30+20=<<30+20=50>>50 minutes to mow the lawn.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Chris to mow the lawn by using both the "turtle" mode and the "rabbit" mode.

Given information:
- In "turtle" mode, it takes Chris 1 hour (60 minutes) to mow the entire lawn.
- In "rabbit" mode, it takes Chris 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.
- Today, Chris mowed half the lawn in "turtle" mode and the other half in "rabbit" mode.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in "turtle" mode.
Time to mow half the lawn in "turtle" mode = 1/2 × 60 minutes = 30 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in "rabbit" mode.
Time to mow half the lawn in "rabbit" mode = 1/2 × 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes to mow the entire lawn.
Total time = Time to mow half the lawn in "turtle" mode + Time to mow half the

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Chris has a two-speed lawn mower
- In "turtle" mode, it takes him 1 hour to mow the entire lawn
- In "rabbit" mode, it takes him 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn
- Today, he mowed half the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode.
Time to mow half the lawn in turtle mode = 1 hour / 2 = 30 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode.
Time to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode = 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes to mow the entire lawn by adding the time for each mode.
Total time = Time in turtle mode + Time in rabbit mode
Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the entire lawn by mowing half in
