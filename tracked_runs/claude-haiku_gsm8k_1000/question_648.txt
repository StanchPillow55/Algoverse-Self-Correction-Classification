Question:
Larry cooked dumplings for a group of friends.  There are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females among them. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. How many dumplings did Larry cook if each female ate 3 dumplings and there were no leftovers?


Reference Answer:
So each male ate 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 dumplings.
Hence, the 8 males ate a total of 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 dumplings.
The 6 females ate a total of 6 x 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 dumplings.
So, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is 18 + 32 = <<18+32=50>>50.
#### 50

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of dumplings that Larry cooked.

Given information:
- There are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females.
- Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
- Each female ate 3 dumplings.
- There were no leftovers.

Step 1: Find the number of dumplings eaten by the females.
Number of females × Number of dumplings per female = Total dumplings eaten by females
6 × 3 = 18 dumplings

Step 2: Find the number of dumplings eaten by the males.
Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, we can calculate the number of dumplings per male as:
Number of dumplings per male = Number of dumplings per female + 1
Number of dumplings per male = 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings

Now, we can calculate the total dumplings eaten by the males:
Number of males × Number of dumplings per male = Total dumplings eaten by males

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that there are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females.
2. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
3. Each female ate 3 dumplings.

To find the total number of dumplings cooked, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males and the females.

For the females:
* 6 females x 3 dumplings each = 18 dumplings

For the males:
* Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so 4 dumplings each.
* 8 males x 4 dumplings each = 32 dumplings

Total dumplings cooked:
* 18 dumplings (females) + 32 dumplings (males) = 50 dumplings

Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings for the group of friends, and there were no leftovers.
