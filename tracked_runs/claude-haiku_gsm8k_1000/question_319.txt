Question ID: 306

Question:
A bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning and half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. How many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon?


Reference Answer:
60 x 2/3 = <<60*2/3=40>>40 loaves of bread are sold in the morning.
60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon and evening.
Therefore, 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
- Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning.
- Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening.

Step 1: Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning.
Two-thirds of 60 loaves = (2/3) × 60 = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Step 2: Calculate the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales.
Loaves remaining after morning sales = Total loaves - Loaves sold in the morning
Loaves remaining after morning sales = 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Step 3: Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening.
Half of the remaining 20 loaves = (1/2) × 20 = 10 loaves.
These 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, so:
Loaves sold in the afternoon = 10 / 2 = 5
