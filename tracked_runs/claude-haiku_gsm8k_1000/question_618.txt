Question:
A company's HR hires 20 new employees every month to add to its total workforce. If the company's initial employee number is 200, and each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months?


Reference Answer:
If each month the company hire 20 new employees, the total number of employees in the company in the first month is 200 employees + 20 employees = <<200+20=220>>220 employees
If each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount of money paid by the employee to its workers in the first month is 220 employees * $4000/employee = $<<220*4000=880000>>880000
In the second month, 20 more workers are hired, bringing the total number of employees to 220 employees + 20 employees = 240 employees
The company pays a total of 240 employees * $4000/employee = $<<240*4000=960000>>960000 in wages for its employees in the second month.
When an additional 20 workers are hired in the third month, the total number of workers become 240 employees + 20 employees = <<240+20=260>>260 employees
In total, the company 260 employees * $4000/employee = $<<260*4000=1040000>>1040000 in wages on the third month.
The total amount of money the company pays to all its employees in the three months is $1040000 + $960000 + $880000 = <<1040000+960000+880000=2880000>>2880000

Given information:
- The company hires 20 new employees every month.
- The company's initial employee number is 200.
- Each employee is paid a $4,000 salary per month.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of employees after three months.
Initial employee number = 200
New employees hired in the first month = 20
New employees hired in the second month = 20
New employees hired in the third month = 20
Total number of employees after three months = 200 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 260

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months.
Total amount of money paid to employees per month = Number of employees × Salary per employee
Total amount of money paid to employees in the first month = 200 × $4,000 = $800,000
