Question ID: 320

Question:
At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women. After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. How many women are left if 22 men stayed at the party?


Reference Answer:
There were a total of 25 men + 15 women = <<25+15=40>>40 people who attended the party.
After an hour, 40 people / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 people left the party.
This means 40 people - 10 people = <<40-10=30>>30 people stayed.
Out of the 30 who stayed, 30 people - 22 men = <<30-22=8>>8 were women.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women.
- After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left.
- 22 men stayed at the party.

Step 1: Find the total number of people at the beginning of the party.
Total people = Number of men + Number of women
Total people = 25 + 15 = 40

Step 2: Calculate the number of people who left the party.
Number of people who left = 1/4 of the total number of people
Number of people who left = 1/4 Ã— 40 = 10

Step 3: Calculate the total number of people who stayed at the party.
Total people who stayed = Total people - Number of people who left
Total people who stayed = 40 - 10 = 30

Step 4: Calculate the number of women who stayed at the party.
Number of men who stayed = 22
Number of women who stayed = Total people who stayed - Number of men who stayed

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Initial number of people at the party:
   * 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

2. After 1/4 of the total number of people left:
   * 1/4 of 40 = 10 people left the party
   * Remaining people = 40 - 10 = 30 people

3. We know that 22 men stayed at the party, so:
   * Number of men left = 22
   * Number of women left = Total people left - Number of men left
   * Number of women left = 30 - 22 = 8 women

Therefore, the final answer is:
8 women are left at the party.
