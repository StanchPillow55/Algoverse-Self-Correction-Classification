Question ID: 313

Question:
Six years ago, when Noah was half as old as Cera, the population of Chile was half what it is now. Currently, Cera is 46 years old. If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, calculate the population of Chile now.


Reference Answer:
If Cera is 46 years old now, she was 46-6 = <<46-6=40>>40 years old six years ago.
Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, meaning Noah was 1/2*40 = 20 years.
If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, there were 3000*20 = <<3000*20=60000>>60000 people living in chile.
Since the population of Chile was half what it was now six years ago, currently Chile has 60000*2 = <<60000*2=120000>>120000 people
#### 120000

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find Noah's age six years ago.
2. Find Cera's age six years ago.
3. Find the population of Chile six years ago.
4. Find the population of Chile now.

Step 1: Find Noah's age six years ago.
Given information:
- Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
- Currently, Cera is 46 years old.

Cera's age six years ago = 46 - 6 = 40 years old
Noah's age six years ago = 40 / 2 = 20 years old

Step 2: Find Cera's age six years ago.
Cera's age six years ago = 46 - 6 = 40 years old

Step 3: Find the population of Chile six years ago.
Given information:
- The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah.

Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 × 20 = 60,000

Step 4: Find the population of Chile

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Six years ago, when Noah was half as old as Cera, the population of Chile was half what it is now.
- Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
- The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah.

Step 1: Find Noah's age six years ago.
Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago she was 40 years old.
When Noah was half as old as Cera, that means six years ago Noah was 20 years old (40 / 2 = 20).

Step 2: Find the population of Chile six years ago.
The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah.
Noah's age six years ago was 20 years.
Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 × 20 = 60,000.

Step 3: Find the current population of Chile.
We know that six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- Six years ago, when Noah was half as old as Cera, the population of Chile was half what it is now.
- Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
- The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah.

Step 1: Find Noah's age six years ago.
Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago she was 40 years old.
When Noah was half as old as Cera, he was 20 years old (40 / 2 = 20).

Step 2: Find the population of Chile six years ago.
The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah.
Noah's age six years ago was 20 years.
Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 × 20 = 60,000.

Step 3: Find the current population of Chile.
The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now.
