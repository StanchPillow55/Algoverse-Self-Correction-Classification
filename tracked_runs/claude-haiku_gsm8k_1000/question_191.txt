Question:
Davos bought 2 shirts from the mall that cost $30 each. If he bought them with a 40% discount, how much did Davos pay for the 2 shirts?


Reference Answer:
The total price of the 2 shirts is $30 x 2 = $<<30*2=60>>60.
The total discount on the 2 shirts is $60 x 0.40 = $<<60*0.40=24>>24.
Therefore, the total amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts is $60 - $24 = $<<60-24=36>>36.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Davos bought 2 shirts from the mall.
- Each shirt costs $30.
- There is a 40% discount on the shirts.

Step 1: Calculate the original total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount.
Original cost of 2 shirts = 2 × $30 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.
Discount percentage = 40%
Discount amount = Original cost × Discount percentage
Discount amount = $60 × 0.40 = $24

Step 3: Calculate the final amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts.
Final amount paid = Original cost - Discount amount
Final amount paid = $60 - $24 = $36

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

Final answer: Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.
