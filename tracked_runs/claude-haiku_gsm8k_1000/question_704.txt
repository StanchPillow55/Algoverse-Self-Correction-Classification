Question:
Gus spent $20.00 at the grocery store.  He bought 2 bag of chips for $2.00 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00 and a bottle of soda for $1.00.  How much did the apple pie cost?


Reference Answer:
He bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each so they cost 2*2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00
He spent $4.00 on chips, $8.00 on fried chicken and $1.00 on soda so he spent 4+8+1 = $<<4+8+1=13.00>>13.00
He spent $20.00 and all of the groceries, except for the pie cost $13.00 so that means the apple pie cost 20-13 = $<<20-13=7.00>>7.00

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount Gus spent at the grocery store and then subtract it from the given total of $20.00 to find the cost of the apple pie.

Given information:
- Gus spent $20.00 at the grocery store.
- He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each.
- He bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00.
- He bought a bottle of soda for $1.00.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought.
Cost of 2 bags of chips = 2 × $2.00 = $4.00
Cost of the bucket of fried chicken = $8.00
Cost of the bottle of soda = $1.00
Total cost of the items = $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the apple pie.
Total amount spent at the grocery store = $20.00
Total cost of the items = $13.00
Cost of the apple pie = Total amount spent

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store.
- He bought:
  - 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each
  - 1 bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
  - 1 bottle of soda for $1.00

To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the cost of the other items from the total amount spent.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought, excluding the apple pie.
Cost of 2 bags of chips = 2 × $2.00 = $4.00
Cost of 1 bucket of fried chicken = $8.00
Cost of 1 bottle of soda = $1.00
Total cost of items excluding apple pie = $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Step 2: Subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent to find the cost of the apple pie.
Total amount spent =
