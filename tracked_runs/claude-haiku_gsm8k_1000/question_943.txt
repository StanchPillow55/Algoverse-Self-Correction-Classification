Question ID: 1131

Question:
John cuts down an 80-foot tree.  He can make logs out of 80% of it. He cuts it into 4-foot logs.  From each of those logs, he cuts 5 planks.  He then sells each plank for $1.2.  How much does he make?


Reference Answer:
He can use 80*.8=<<80*.8=64>>64 feet of the tree.
That means he can make 64/4=<<64/4=16>>16 logs.
That gives him16*5=<<16*5=80>>80 planks.
So he makes 80*1.2=$<<80*1.2=96>>96.
#### 96

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- The tree is 80 feet tall.
- John can make logs out of 80% of the tree.
- He cuts the logs into 4-foot lengths.
- From each log, he cuts 5 planks.
- He sells each plank for $1.2.

Step 1: Calculate the length of the logs.
Length of the tree that can be used = 80% of 80 feet = 0.8 × 80 = 64 feet
Number of 4-foot logs = 64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Step 2: Calculate the number of planks.
Number of planks per log = 5 planks
Total number of planks = 16 logs × 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue.
Price per plank = $1.2
Total revenue = 80 planks × $1.2 per plank = $96

Therefore, John makes $96
