Question:
After Andrea saved some money, she then spent the rest of her money on an $11 sweater and gave her brother $4. If she had $36 in the beginning, how much did Andrea save?


Reference Answer:
Andrea spent and gave her brother a total of $11 + $4 = $<<11+4=15>>15.
So, she saved $36 - $15 = $<<36-15=21>>21.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Andrea had $36 in the beginning.
- She spent $11 on a sweater.
- She gave her brother $4.

To find how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the initial amount she had.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Andrea spent and gave away.
Amount spent on sweater = $11
Amount given to brother = $4
Total amount spent and given away = $11 + $4 = $15

Step 2: Subtract the total amount spent and given away from the initial amount Andrea had.
Initial amount = $36
Total amount spent and given away = $15
Amount saved = Initial amount - Total amount spent and given away
Amount saved = $36 - $15 = $21

Therefore, Andrea saved $21.

Final answer: Andrea saved $21.
