Question ID: 554

Question:
When the water is cold Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long. How much longer does Ray take to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day?


Reference Answer:
Cold water mile = <<16=16>>16 minutes
Warm water mile = 2+2(16)=34 minutes
3 miles in cold water: 3(16)=<<3*16=48>>48 minutes
3 miles in warm water: 3(34)=<<3*34=102>>102 minutes
Ray takes 102-48=<<102-48=54>>54 minutes longer

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day, and then calculate the difference between the two.

Given information:
- When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

Step 1: Find the time it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.
Time to swim a mile when the water is cold = 16 minutes
Time to swim a mile when the water is warm = 2 × 16 minutes + 2 minutes = 34 minutes

Step 2: Find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day.
Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day = 3 × 16 minutes = 48 minutes

Step 3: Find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day.
Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day = 3 × 34 minutes = 102 minutes

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.
Time to swim a mile when water is cold = 16 minutes
Time to swim a mile when water is warm = 2 × 16 minutes + 2 minutes = 34 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day.
Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day = 3 × 16 minutes = 48 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day.
Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day = 3 × 34 minutes = 102 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day.
