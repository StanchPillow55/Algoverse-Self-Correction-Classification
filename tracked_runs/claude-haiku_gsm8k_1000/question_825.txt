Question:
John decides to build a program capable of identifying cancer cells.  He gets initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.  His research ends up taking 10 times that long and every month after those first 5 took 50% more funding per month.  How much did his research cost?


Reference Answer:
The research ended up taking 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 months
So he paid for expensive research for 50-5=<<50-5=45>>45 months
Each month of research at the cheaper stage cost 100,000/5=$<<100000/5=20000>>20,000
So the more expensive research cost 20,000*1.5=$<<20000*1.5=30000>>30,000
So that research cost 45*30,000=$<<45*30000=1350000>>1,350,000
So the total cost was 1,350,000+100,000=$<<1350000+100000=1450000>>1,450,000
#### 1,450,000

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- Initial funding for the first 5 months: $100,000
- The research ended up taking 10 times longer than the initial 5 months.
- Every month after the first 5 months took 50% more funding per month.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of months the research took.
Initial funding period: 5 months
Total research period: 10 times longer = 5 × 10 = 50 months

Step 2: Calculate the funding for the first 5 months.
Funding for the first 5 months = $100,000

Step 3: Calculate the funding for the remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months).
Funding for each month after the first 5 months = $100,000 × 1.5 = $150,000
Total funding for the remaining 45 months = $150,000 × 45 = $6,750,000

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the research.
Total cost =

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John gets initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.
- The research ends up taking 10 times longer than the initial 5 months.
- Every month after the first 5 months took 50% more funding per month.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of months the research took.
Initial research period: 5 months
Total research period: 10 times longer = 5 months x 10 = 50 months

Step 2: Calculate the funding for the first 5 months.
Funding for the first 5 months = $100,000

Step 3: Calculate the funding for the remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months).
Funding for each month after the first 5 months = $100,000 + (50% of $100,000) = $150,000
Total funding for the remaining 45 months = $150,000 x 45 = $6,750,000

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John gets initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.
- The research ends up taking 10 times longer than the initial 5 months.
- Every month after the first 5 months took 50% more funding per month.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of months the research took.
Initial research period: 5 months
Total research period: 5 months x 10 = 50 months

Step 2: Calculate the funding for the first 5 months.
Funding for the first 5 months = $100,000

Step 3: Calculate the funding for the remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months).
Funding for the first 5 months after the initial period = $100,000 x 1.5 = $150,000
Funding for the next 5 months = $150,000 x 1.5 = $225,000
Funding for the final 35 months = $225,000 x 1.
