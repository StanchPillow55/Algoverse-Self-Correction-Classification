Question:
Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles.  He drives 100 miles a day for a 30 day month.  How many tune-ups does he need in that time?


Reference Answer:
He drives 100*30=<<100*30=3000>>3000 miles
So he needs 3000/1000=<<3000/1000=3>>3 tune-ups

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find out how many miles Jon drives in a 30-day month and then determine how many tune-ups he needs based on the recommended tune-up interval.

Given information:
- Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles.
- Jon drives 100 miles a day for a 30-day month.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of miles Jon drives in a 30-day month.
Total miles driven in a month = Miles per day × Number of days in a month
Total miles driven in a month = 100 miles × 30 days = 3,000 miles

Step 2: Determine the number of tune-ups needed based on the recommended tune-up interval.
Tune-up interval = 1,000 miles
Number of tune-ups needed = Total miles driven in a month / Tune-up interval
Number of tune-ups needed = 3,000 miles / 1,000 miles = 3 tune-ups

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups for his car in a 30-day month.

Final answer: Jon needs

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles.
- Jon drives 100 miles a day.
- There are 30 days in a month.

Step 1: Calculate the total miles driven in a month.
Miles driven per day × Days in a month = Total miles driven in a month
100 miles × 30 days = 3,000 miles

Step 2: Determine how many tune-ups are needed in a month.
Total miles driven in a month / Miles between tune-ups = Number of tune-ups needed
3,000 miles / 1,000 miles = 3 tune-ups

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in a 30-day month.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jon drives 100 miles per day.
2. There are 30 days in a month.
3. So, in a 30-day month, Jon drives:
   * 100 miles per day x 30 days = 3,000 miles

4. Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1,000 miles.
5. To find how many tune-ups he needs in a 30-day month, we divide the total miles driven by the tune-up interval:
   * 3,000 miles / 1,000 miles per tune-up = 3 tune-ups

Therefore, the number of tune-ups Jon needs in a 30-day month is 3.

Final answer: Jon needs 3 tune-ups in a 30-day month.
