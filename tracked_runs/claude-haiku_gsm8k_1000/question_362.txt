Question ID: 1000

Question:
Doctor Jones is scheduling his time for Monday. He is spending nine hours at the clinic where he works that day. He has to do rounds to check on inpatients staying at the clinic, which takes twenty minutes per inpatient, and he has ten appointments, which take thirty minutes each. How many hours will Doctor Jones have left to update his records if he has 9 inpatients at the clinic?


Reference Answer:
Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients, so his rounds will take 9 * 20 = <<9*20=180>>180 minutes.
He has ten appointments, which will take 10 * 30 = <<10*30=300>>300 minutes.
The rounds and appointments will take 180 + 300 = <<180+300=480>>480 minutes total.
An hour is 60 minutes, so rounds and appointments will take 480 / 60 = <<480/60=8>>8 hours.
Doctor Jones will have 9 - 8 = <<9-8=1>>1 hour left to update his records.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on his tasks and then subtract it from the total time he has available on Monday.

Given information:
- Doctor Jones is spending 9 hours at the clinic on Monday.
- He has to do rounds to check on 9 inpatients, which takes 20 minutes per inpatient.
- He has 10 appointments, which take 30 minutes each.

Step 1: Calculate the time spent on inpatient rounds.
Time spent on inpatient rounds = Number of inpatients × Time per inpatient
Time spent on inpatient rounds = 9 × 20 minutes = 180 minutes = 3 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time spent on appointments.
Time spent on appointments = Number of appointments × Time per appointment
Time spent on appointments = 10 × 30 minutes = 300 minutes = 5 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total time spent on tasks.
Total time spent on tasks = Time spent on inpatient rounds + Time spent on appointments
Total time spent on tasks = 3 hours + 5

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Doctor Jones is spending 9 hours at the clinic on Monday.
- He has to do rounds to check on 9 inpatients, which takes 20 minutes per inpatient.
- He has 10 appointments, which take 30 minutes each.

Step 1: Calculate the time spent on inpatient rounds.
Time spent on inpatient rounds = 9 inpatients × 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time spent on appointments.
Time spent on appointments = 10 appointments × 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.
Total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments = Time spent on inpatient rounds + Time spent on appointments
Total time spent = 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Step 4: Convert the total time spent from minutes to hours.
Total time spent in hours = 480 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 8 hours
