Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week for his drawing.
- Each pad of paper has 30 sheets of paper.

To find the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to:
1. Find the number of sheets of paper he uses per week.
2. Multiply the number of sheets per week by the number of weeks in a month.

Step 1: Find the number of sheets of paper he uses per week.
Number of pads of paper per week × Number of sheets per pad = Number of sheets per week
2 pads × 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets per week

Step 2: Find the number of sheets of paper he uses every month.
Number of sheets per week × Number of weeks in a month = Number of sheets per month
60 sheets/week × 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets per month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month for his drawing.

Final answer: Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month for his drawing.
