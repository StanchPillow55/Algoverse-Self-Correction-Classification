Question ID: 1173

Question:
A regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12. There's currently a special size box for the same price that has 20% more pods. How many dishwashing cycles with the new box can you run for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle?


Reference Answer:
If the regular box has 100 pods and the special one has 20% more, then the new box has 100 * 20% = 20 more pods
If the new one has 20 more pods than the regular one, the new box has a total of 20+100 = <<20+100=120>>120 pods
If the cost of the regular box ($12) is the same as the new box, then the new box also costs $12
If the new box has 120 pods and the price for the box is $12, then each pod costs $12/120 = $<<12/120=0.10>>0.10
If 1 pod costs $0.10 and is used in 1 cycle, then each cycle costs = $<<1*0.10=0.10>>0.10
If 1 cycle costs $0.10, then for $1 I could run $1/$0.1 = 10 cycles

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- A regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12.
- There is a special size box that has 20% more pods for the same price of $12.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pods in the special size box.
Regular box size = 100 pods
Special box size = Regular box size + 20% of regular box size
Special box size = 100 + (0.20 Ã— 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 pods

Step 2: Calculate the cost per pod for the regular box.
Cost per pod for regular box = $12 / 100 pods = $0.12 per pod

Step 3: Calculate the cost per pod for the special box.
Cost per pod for special box = $12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod

Step 4: Calculate the number of cycles you can run for $1 with the special box.
Cost per cycle = $0.10 per pod
Number of cycles per $1 = $1 /

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12.
2. The special size box has 20% more pods for the same price of $12.
   * To calculate the number of pods in the special box:
     * 100 pods + 20% of 100 pods = 100 + (0.20 x 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 pods
3. The question asks how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 if 1 pod is used per cycle.
   * To calculate this, we need to find out how many cycles can be run with the special box.
   * Cost of special box: $12
   * Number of pods in special box: 120
   * Cycles per $1 = (120 pods / $12) = 10 cycles per $1

Therefore, the final answer is:
You can run 10 dishwashing cycles with the new special box for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle.

   * Number of pods in special box: 120
   * Cycles per $1 = (120 pods / $12) = 10 cycles per $1

Therefore, the final answer is:
You can run 10 dishwashing cycles with the new special box for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle.
