Question ID: 1285

Question:
The recent floods in Mamouâ€™s country have left many families without food or shelter. To help, Mamou has volunteered to distribute 1,360 meals to the affected families. She gave out 64 meals on Friday, 30 meals on Saturday, and 48 meals on Sunday. How many meals does she have left to distribute?


Reference Answer:
On Friday, Saturday and Sunday, Mamou distributed a total of 64 meals + 30 meals + 48 meals = <<64+30+48=142>>142 meals
The remaining meals are 1,360 meals - 142 meals = <<1360-142=1218>>1,218 meals
#### 1218

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of meals Mamou distributed and then subtract it from the total number of meals she had to distribute.

Given information:
- Mamou has 1,360 meals to distribute.
- She gave out 64 meals on Friday.
- She gave out 30 meals on Saturday.
- She gave out 48 meals on Sunday.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of meals Mamou distributed.
Meals distributed on Friday = 64
Meals distributed on Saturday = 30
Meals distributed on Sunday = 48
Total meals distributed = 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals

Step 2: Calculate the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute.
Total meals to distribute = 1,360
Total meals distributed = 142
Meals left to distribute = 1,360 - 142 = 1,218 meals

Therefore, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.
