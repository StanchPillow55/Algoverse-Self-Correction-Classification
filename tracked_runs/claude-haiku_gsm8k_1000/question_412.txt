Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of gifts Monica has to wrap and then calculate the amount of ribbon she can use for each gift bow.

Given information:
- Monica has 6 gifts to wrap for her family.
- Monica has 4 gifts to wrap for her friends.
- Monica has 2 gifts to wrap for her teachers.
- Monica has 144 inches of ribbon.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of gifts Monica has to wrap.
Total number of gifts = 6 (for family) + 4 (for friends) + 2 (for teachers) = 12 gifts

Step 2: Calculate the amount of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow.
Total ribbon available = 144 inches
Ribbon needed for each bow = Total ribbon available / Total number of gifts
Ribbon needed for each bow = 144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift bow

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

Final answer: Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.
