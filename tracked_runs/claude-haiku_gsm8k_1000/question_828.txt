Question ID: 474

Question:
At a certain grade level, three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home. If 20 students do not have desktop computers, how many students are there at that grade level?


Reference Answer:
Twenty students represent 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 of the students at that level.
So, there are 4 x 20 students = <<4*20=80>>80 students at that level.
#### 80

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of students at the given grade level.

Given information:
- Three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home.
- 20 students do not have desktop computers.

Step 1: Represent the fraction of students who have a desktop computer at home.
Three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home.
Fraction of students with a desktop computer = 3/4

Step 2: Represent the fraction of students who do not have a desktop computer at home.
Fraction of students without a desktop computer = 1 - 3/4 = 1/4

Step 3: Find the total number of students.
Let the total number of students be x.
Fraction of students without a desktop computer = 1/4
Number of students without a desktop computer = 1/4 × x = 20

Step 4: Solve for the total number of students (x).
1/4 × x = 20
x = 20 × 4 = 80

Therefore, there are 80 students at the given grade level.
