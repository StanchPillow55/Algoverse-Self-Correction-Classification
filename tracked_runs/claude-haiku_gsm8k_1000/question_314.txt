Question ID: 246

Question:
Jeans makeup artist charges her $250 an hour.  She requires very expensive makeup for a movie she is in and it takes 6 hours to do each day and she needs it done 4 times a week.  The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.  After the movie is done the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done.  How much did Jean pay?


Reference Answer:
Jean pays 250*6=$<<250*6=1500>>1500 a day
So he pays 1500*4=$<<1500*4=6000>>6000 a week
So the work cost 6000*5=$<<6000*5=30000>>30,000
They give a discount of 30,000*.1=$<<30000*.1=3000>>3000
So the total cost paid is 30,000-3000=$<<30000-3000=27000>>27,000
#### 27000

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jeans makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- It takes 6 hours to do the makeup each day.
- The makeup is required 4 times a week.
- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
- After the movie, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist worked.
Number of hours per day = 6 hours
Number of days per week = 4 days
Number of weeks = 5 weeks
Total hours = 6 hours/day × 4 days/week × 5 weeks = 120 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the makeup services before the discount.
Cost per hour = $250
Total cost before discount = 120 hours × $250/hour = $30,000

Step 3: Calculate the discount amount.
Discount percentage = 10%
Discount amount = $30,000 × 0.10 = $3,000

- It takes 6 hours to do the makeup each day.
- The makeup is required 4 times a week.
- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
- After the movie, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist worked.
Number of hours per day = 6 hours
Number of days per week = 4 days
Number of weeks = 5 weeks
Total number of hours = 6 hours × 4 days × 5 weeks = 120 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the makeup services before the discount.
Cost per hour = $250
Total cost before discount = 120 hours × $250 per hour = $30,000

Step 3: Calculate the discount amount.
Discount percentage = 10%
Discount amount = $30,000 × 0.10 = $3,000
