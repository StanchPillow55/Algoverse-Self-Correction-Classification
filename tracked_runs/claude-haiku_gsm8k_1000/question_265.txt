Question ID: 273

Question:
Terri is knitting a sweater with two sleeves, a collar, and a decorative rosette. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete, the collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, and the rosette takes twice as many as the collar. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. How many stitches does each sleeve take?


Reference Answer:
The collar takes 900 / 10 = <<900/10=90>>90 stitches.
The rosette takes 2 * 90 = <<2*90=180>>180 stitches.
The body, collar, and rosette together take 900 + 90 + 180 = <<900+90+180=1170>>1170 stitches.
Thus, the sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = <<1800-1170=630>>630 stitches.
Thus, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = <<630/2=315>>315 stitches.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete.
- The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
- The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.

Step 1: Calculate the number of stitches for the collar.
Stitches for the collar = 1/10 of 900 stitches = 90 stitches

Step 2: Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette.
Stitches for the rosette = 2 × 90 stitches = 180 stitches

Step 3: Calculate the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette.
Total stitches for the body, collar, and rosette = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches

Step 4: Calculate the number of stitches for the two sleeves.

Step 1: Calculate the number of stitches for the collar.
Collar stitches = 1/10 of 900 = 90 stitches

Step 2: Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette.
Rosette stitches = 2 × 90 = 180 stitches

Step 3: Calculate the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette.
Total stitches for body, collar, and rosette = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches

Step 4: Calculate the number of stitches for the two sleeves.
Total stitches for the sweater = 1800

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 90 x 2 = 180 stitches.
4. The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800.

Now, we need to find the number of stitches for each sleeve.

Let's call the number of stitches for each sleeve 'x'.

We know that:
* Body: 900 stitches
* Collar: 90 stitches
* Rosette: 180 stitches
* Total: 1800 stitches

So, the equation is:
* 900 + 90 + 180 + 2x = 1800

Solving for x:
* 2x = 1800 - 900 -
