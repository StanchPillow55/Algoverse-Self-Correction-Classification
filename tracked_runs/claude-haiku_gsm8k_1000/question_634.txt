Question ID: 314

Question:
A football team has 105 members.  There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense.  How many players are on the defense?


Reference Answer:
Let x represent the number of players on the defense
Offense:2x
Special Teams:(1/2)x
Total:x+2x+(1/2)x=105
(7/2)x=105
x=105(2/7)=30 players
#### 30

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of players on the defense.

Given information:
- The football team has 105 members.
- There are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense.
- There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of players on the defense.
- Let 2x be the number of players on the offense (since there are twice as many players on the offense as on the defense).
- Let x/2 be the number of players on the special teams (since there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense).

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the total number of players on the team.
Total number of players = Number of players on the offense + Number of players on the defense + Number of players on the special teams
105 = 2x + x + x/2
105 = 3.5x

Step 2: Solve for the number of players on the defense.
3.5x = 105
x = 105 /

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The football team has 105 members.
- There are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense.
- There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of players on the defense
- Then 2x = the number of players on the offense
- And x/2 = the number of players on the special teams

We know that the total number of players is 105, so we can set up an equation:
x + 2x + x/2 = 105

Simplifying the equation:
3.5x = 105
x = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

Final answer: There are 30 players on the defense.
