Question ID: 178

Question:
Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, who has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. If Bo has 40 crabs, calculate the total number of crabs the three have together.


Reference Answer:
If Bo has 40 crabs, then Monic, who has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, has 40-4 = <<40-4=36>>36 crabs.
Bo and Monic have a total of 36+40 = <<36+40=76>>76 crabs.
Since Monic has 36 crabs, Rani's number of crabs is 36+ 10 = <<36+10=46>>46.
Together, the three have 76+46 = <<76+46=122>>122 crabs.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic.
- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
- Bo has 40 crabs.

Step 1: Find the number of crabs Monic has.
Bo has 40 crabs.
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
Monic's crabs = Bo's crabs - 4
Monic's crabs = 40 - 4 = 36 crabs

Step 2: Find the number of crabs Rani has.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic.
Rani's crabs = Monic's crabs + 10
Rani's crabs = 36 + 10 = 46 crabs

Step 3: Calculate the total number of crabs the three have together.
Total crabs = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs
Total crabs = 40 +

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic.
- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
- Bo has 40 crabs.

Step 1: Find how many crabs Monic has.
Bo has 40 crabs.
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
So, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Step 2: Find how many crabs Rani has.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic.
Monic has 36 crabs.
So, Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of crabs the three have together.
Total crabs = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs
Total crabs = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have
