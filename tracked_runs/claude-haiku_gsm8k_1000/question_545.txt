Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week.
- His original pay was $10 per hour.
- His pay was raised by $2 per hour.

Step 1: Calculate Mark's new hourly pay rate.
Original hourly pay = $10
Pay raise = $2 per hour
New hourly pay = $10 + $2 = $12 per hour

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours Mark works per week.
Hours per day = 8
Days per week = 5
Total hours per week = 8 hours/day × 5 days/week = 40 hours/week

Step 3: Calculate Mark's weekly earnings.
Weekly earnings = New hourly pay × Total hours per week
Weekly earnings = $12 per hour × 40 hours/week = $480 per week

Therefore, the final answer is that Mark makes $480 per week.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week.
   * Hours worked per week = 8 hours/day x 5 days/week = 40 hours/week

2. Mark's original pay rate was $10 per hour.
   * Original weekly pay = $10/hour x 40 hours/week = $400/week

3. Mark's pay was increased by $2 per hour.
   * New pay rate = $10/hour + $2/hour = $12/hour

4. Calculate Mark's new weekly pay:
   * New weekly pay = $12/hour x 40 hours/week = $480/week

Therefore, the final answer is that Mark now makes $480 per week.
