Question ID: 672

Question:
Christina records her mood every day on a calendar. Over the past thirty days of moods, she had twelve good days and eight bad days and the rest were neutral. Her first eight days were good, her second eight days were bad, and her third eight days were neutral. If the next three days were good, neutral, and good, how many good days were left in the month?


Reference Answer:
Christina had 30 - 12 - 8 = <<30-12-8=10>>10 neutral days in the month.
After the first three 8-day periods, she had 30 - 8 * 3 = 30 - 24 = <<30-8*3=6>>6 days of moods left.
Of those days, 12 - 8 = <<12-8=4>>4 days were good.
After the next 3 days with 2 good days, Christina had 4 - 2 = <<4-2=2>>2 good days left.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Christina recorded her mood over the past 30 days.
- She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral.
- The first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral.
- The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

Step 1: Calculate the number of neutral days.
Total days = 30
Good days = 12
Bad days = 8
Neutral days = Total days - Good days - Bad days
Neutral days = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10

Step 2: Determine the number of good days left in the month.
Good days in the first 8 days = 8
Good days in the next 3 days = 2
Good days left = 12 - 8 - 2 = 2

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 2.

Final answer: 2 good days left in the month.
