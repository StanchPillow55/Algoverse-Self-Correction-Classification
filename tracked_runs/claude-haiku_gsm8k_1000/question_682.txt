Question ID: 1166

Question:
Generally, a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits, a 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, a 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, and an 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, and then a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits. How many total fruits can an avocado tree produce during its 10 years of life?


Reference Answer:
At 5 years it produces 50 fruits
At 6 years it produces 50 * 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 fruits.
At 7 years, it produces 50 * 7 = <<50*7=350>>350 fruits
At 10 years, it produces 50 * 20 = <<50*20=1000>>1000 fruits
At 8 years, it produces 200 fewer fruits than at 10 years, so it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits
During 10 years, an avocado tree can produce a total of 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = <<50+150+350+800+1000=2350>>2350 fruits
#### 2350

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced by the avocado tree in each year and then add them up to find the total number of fruits produced during its 10 years of life.

Given information:
- A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
- A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
- An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.
- During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fruits produced by the avocado tree in each year.
Year 5: 50 fruits
Year 6: 3 × 50 = 150 fruits
Year 7: 7 × 50 = 350 fruits
Year 8:

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We don't know the 10-year-old tree's production yet, so we'll come back to this.
5. During the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.
7. Now we can calculate the 8-year-old tree's production: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Adding up the total fruits produced over the 10 years:

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits
2. 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We don't know the 10-year-old tree's production yet, so we'll come back to this.
5. 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits
6. 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's go back to the 8-year-old tree. We know it produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree, so:
* 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits
* 8-year-old tree
