Question ID: 1037

Question:
The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound. Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.  Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan and 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.  Is she starts with $50 cash, how much money, in dollars, will she have left to buy meat?


Reference Answer:
The cost for buying 2 pounds of parmesan cheese is $11 x 2 = $<<11*2=22>>22.
The cost for buying 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is $6 x 3 = $<<6*3=18>>18.
The total amount spent for the 2 kinds of cheese is $22 + $18 = $<<22+18=40>>40.
So, Amor still has $50 - $40 = $<<50-40=10>>10 left to buy for meat.

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Parmesan cheese costs $11 per pound.
- Mozzarella cheese costs $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan and 3 pounds of Mozzarella.
- Amor starts with $50 cash.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese.
Cost of Parmesan cheese = 2 pounds × $11 per pound = $22

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the Mozzarella cheese.
Cost of Mozzarella cheese = 3 pounds × $6 per pound = $18

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all the cheese.
Total cost of cheese = Cost of Parmesan + Cost of Mozzarella
Total cost of cheese = $22 + $18 = $40

Step 4: Calculate the amount of money Amor has left to buy meat.
Amount of money left = Initial cash - Total cost of cheese
Amount of money left = $50 - $
