Question ID: 171

Question:
Jake is walking through the Museum of Entomology. He sees 80 spiders with 8 legs each, 90 insects with 6 legs each, and 3 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each. How many legs does Jake see total?


Reference Answer:
First find the total number of spider legs: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = <<80*8=640>>640 legs
Then find the total number of insect legs: 90 spiders * 6 legs/spider = <<90*6=540>>540 legs
Then find the total number of mutant invertebrate legs: 3 mutants * 10 legs/mutant = <<3*10=30>>30 legs
Then add the number of each kind of leg to find the total he saw: 640 legs + 540 legs + 30 legs = <<640+540+30=1210>>1210 legs
#### 1210

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) Jake sees 80 spiders, each with 8 legs:
   * 80 spiders x 8 legs per spider = 640 legs

2) Jake sees 90 insects, each with 6 legs:
   * 90 insects x 6 legs per insect = 540 legs

3) Jake sees 3 rare mutant invertebrates, each with 10 legs:
   * 3 invertebrates x 10 legs per invertebrate = 30 legs

4) To calculate the total number of legs Jake sees, we add up the legs from each type of creature:
   * 640 legs (spiders) + 540 legs (insects) + 30 legs (invertebrates) = 1,210 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1,210.

4) To calculate the total number of legs Jake sees, we add up the legs from each group:
   * 640 legs (spiders) + 540 legs (insects) + 30 legs (invertebrates) = 1,210 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1,210.
