Question:
Sam sells bread. He has a target of selling 120 crates of bread in a week. One week he was closed on Monday and Friday. Over the weekend he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and Thursday 18 crates. By how many crates was Sam off from his target for the week?


Reference Answer:
During the whole week Sam sold 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = <<15+12+18+20=65>>65 crates.
Sam was off his target by 120 - 65 = <<120-65=55>>55 crates.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sam's target is to sell 120 crates of bread in a week.
- He was closed on Monday and Friday.
- Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of crates sold during the week.
Crates sold on the weekend: 20
Crates sold on Tuesday: 15
Crates sold on Wednesday: 12
Crates sold on Thursday: 18
Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Step 2: Calculate the target number of crates to be sold during the week.
Since Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 days to sell the 120 crates.
Target crates per day = 120 crates / 5 days = 24 crates per day

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Step 2: Calculate the target number of crates to be sold during the week.
Target crates per week = 120 crates

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the target and the actual number of crates sold.
Difference = Target crates - Actual crates sold
Difference = 120 - 65 =
