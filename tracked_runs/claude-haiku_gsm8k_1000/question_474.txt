Question ID: 442

Question:
When Marcus wakes up, his house is 40 degrees. He spends 3 hours baking, and every hour the oven is on it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees. Then Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. What is the house's final temperature?


Reference Answer:
First find the total temperature increase from the oven: 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = <<3*5=15>>15 degrees
Then add that amount to the starting temperature: 15 degrees + 40 degrees = <<15+40=55>>55 degrees
Then divide the time the window is open by 10 minutes to find how many 2-degree temperature decreases there are: 30 minutes / 10 minutes = <<30/10=3>>3
Then multiply the number of decreases by the amount of each decrease: 3 * 2 degrees = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees
Then subtract that amount from the house's temperature after baking to find the final temperature: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = <<55-6=49>>49 degrees

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees.
- Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees per hour.
- After baking, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.

Step 1: Calculate the temperature increase due to the oven.
Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
Total time the oven is on = 3 hours
Total temperature increase = 5 degrees Ã— 3 hours = 15 degrees

Step 2: Calculate the new temperature after the oven is turned off.
Initial temperature = 40 degrees
Temperature increase due to the oven = 15 degrees
New temperature after the oven is turned off = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Step 3: Calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window.
Temperature decrease per 10 minutes = 2 degrees
Total time the window is open = 30

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initial house temperature: 40 degrees

2. Baking for 3 hours:
   - Every hour the oven is on, the house temperature increases by 5 degrees
   - So for 3 hours, the temperature increases by 3 x 5 = 15 degrees
   - New temperature: 40 + 15 = 55 degrees

3. Opening the window for 30 minutes:
   - The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open
   - For 30 minutes, the house cools down 2 x (30/10) = 6 degrees
   - New temperature: 55 - 6 = 49 degrees

Final answer: The house's final temperature is 49 degrees.
