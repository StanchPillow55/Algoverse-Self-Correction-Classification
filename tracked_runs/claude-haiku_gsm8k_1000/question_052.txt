Question ID: 211

Question:
Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?


Reference Answer:
First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.
Then, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2
Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32
Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4
#### 4

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of red chickens that Jerry has.

Given information:
- Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day.
- White chickens produce 5 eggs per day.
- Jerry collects 42 eggs per day.
- Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of red chickens.
- Let x + 2 be the number of white chickens.

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the total number of eggs collected per day.
Total eggs collected per day = (Number of red chickens × 3) + (Number of white chickens × 5)
42 = (x × 3) + ((x + 2) × 5)

Step 2: Simplify the equation.
42 = 3x + 5x + 10
42 = 8x + 10

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
42 - 10 = 8x
32 = 8x
x = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4
