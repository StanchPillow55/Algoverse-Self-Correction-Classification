Question ID: 1089

Question:
Nathan has a bouncy ball that bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. If he drops it from the third-floor balcony in the mall, where each story is 24 feet high, how high does the ball go on its second bounce?


Reference Answer:
First find the total height from which Nathan drops the ball: 24 feet/story * 3 stories = <<24*3=72>>72 feet
Then multiply that number by 2/3rds to find the height of the ball after one bounce: 72 feet * 2/3 = <<72*2/3=48>>48 feet
Then multiply that number by 2/3rds to find the height of the ball after two bounces: 48 feet * 2/3 = <<48*2/3=32>>32 feet
#### 32

Response:
Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The bouncy ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce.
- The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony in the mall.
- Each story in the mall is 24 feet high.

Step 1: Calculate the starting height of the ball.
The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high.
Starting height = 3 stories × 24 feet per story = 72 feet

Step 2: Calculate the height of the first bounce.
The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce.
Height of the first bounce = 2/3 × 72 feet = 48 feet

Step 3: Calculate the height of the second bounce.
The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce.
Height of the second bounce = 2/3 × 48 feet = 32 feet

Therefore, the ball goes up to 32 feet on its second bounce
