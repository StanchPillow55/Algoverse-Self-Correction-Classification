Question ID: 395

Question:
Erica made 20 Valentine's cards to pass out.  Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each.  She passed out 24 to her classmates, 5 to her family and received 17 from family and friends.  How many Valentine's Day cards does Erica now have?


Reference Answer:
Her dad gave her 2 boxes of 15 cards so 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30
She made 20, was given 30 and received 17 so 20+30+17 = <<20+30+17=67>>67 cards
She passed out 24 and gave 5 cards to family and friends so she gave away 24+5 = <<24+5=29>>29 cards
She had 67 cards and gave away 29 cards so 67-29 = <<67-29=38>>38 cards left

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it.

Given information:
- Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.
- Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, with 15 cards in each box.
- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pre-made cards Erica received from her dad.
Number of pre-made cards = 2 boxes Ã— 15 cards per box = 30 cards

Step 2: Calculate the total number of cards Erica had initially.
Total initial cards = Cards made by Erica + Pre-made cards from her dad
Total initial cards = 20 + 30 = 50 cards

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cards Erica passed out.
Cards passed out to classmates = 24
Cards passed out to family = 5
Total cards passed out = 24 + 5 = 29 cards
