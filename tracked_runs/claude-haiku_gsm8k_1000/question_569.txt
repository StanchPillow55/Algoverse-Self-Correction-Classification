Question ID: 90

Question:
Ted the T-Rex was planning to bring potato salad to the dinosaur picnic.  He knows that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult.  If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?


Reference Answer:
Half of 10 pounds is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 pounds.
To feed 20 dinosaur adults, he will need 20*10=<<20*10=200>>200 pounds of potato salad.
To feed 5 dinosaur children, he will need 5*5=<<5*5=25>>25 pounds of potato salad.
In total, he will need to bring 200+25=<<200+25=225>>225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- An adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- A child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, which is 5 lbs.
- There will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults.
Amount of potato salad needed for adults = Number of adults × Amount of potato salad per adult
Amount of potato salad needed for adults = 20 × 10 lbs = 200 lbs

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the children.
Amount of potato salad needed for children = Number of children × Amount of potato salad per child
Amount of potato salad needed for children = 5 × 5 lbs = 25 lbs

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the picnic.
Total amount of potato salad needed = Amount of potato salad needed for adults + Amount of potato salad needed for children
Total amount of potato

Amount of potato salad needed for children = Number of children × Amount per child
Amount of potato salad needed for children = 5 × 5 lbs = 25 lbs

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the picnic.
Total amount of potato salad needed = Amount for adults + Amount for children
Total amount of potato salad needed = 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225
