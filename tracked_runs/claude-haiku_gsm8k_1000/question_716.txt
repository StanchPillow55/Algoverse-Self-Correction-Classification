Question ID: 232

Question:
Dax went to their farm to pick some apples and found half as many bugs as ants in the garden. If there were 50 ants, calculate the total number of insects in the garden.


Reference Answer:
If there were 50 ants, the total number of bugs in the garden is 1 bug/2 ants * 50 ants = 25 bugs
The total number of insects in the garden is 25 bugs + 50 ants = <<25+50=75>>75 insects
#### 75


=== Turn 1 ===


Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden.
- There were 50 ants in the garden.

Step 1: Find the number of bugs in the garden.
Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:
Number of bugs = 1/2 × Number of ants
Number of bugs = 1/2 × 50 = 25 bugs

Step 2: Find the total number of insects in the garden.
Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25 = 75 insects

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75.

Final answer: The total number of insects in the garden is 75.
