Question ID: 1203

Question:
Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is. How high is the roof from the second floor's floor in inches?


Reference Answer:
Mattison's two-story house is 60 x 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches high.
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 60 x 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 inches high.
Hence, the roof is 420 - 180 = <<420-180=240>>240 inches high from the second floor's floor.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the house and then calculate the height of the roof from the second floor's floor.

Given information:
- Mattison is 60 inches tall.
- The house is 7 times as high as Mattison.
- The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 3 times as high as Mattison.

Step 1: Calculate the height of the house.
Height of the house = Mattison's height × 7
Height of the house = 60 inches × 7 = 420 inches

Step 2: Calculate the height of the first floor.
Height of the first floor = Mattison's height × 3
Height of the first floor = 60 inches × 3 = 180 inches

Step 3: Calculate the height of the second floor.
Height of the second floor = Height of the house - Height of the first floor
Height of the second floor = 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches

Step 4: Calculate the height of the roof from the second floor's floor.
Height of the roof from the second floor's

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- Mattison is 60 inches tall.
- His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is.
- The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is.

Step 1: Calculate the height of the house.
Height of the house = 7 × Mattison's height
Height of the house = 7 × 60 inches = 420 inches

Step 2: Calculate the height of the first floor.
Height of the first floor = 3 × Mattison's height
Height of the first floor = 3 × 60 inches = 180 inches

Step 3: Calculate the height of the second floor.
Height of the house - Height of the first floor = Height of the second floor
420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches.

Final answer: The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches.
