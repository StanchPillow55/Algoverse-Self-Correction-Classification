Question ID: 1068

Question:
One meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.  Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. Then Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.  How many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained?


Reference Answer:
3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches is 10-3=<<10-3=7>>7 sub sandwiches.
After Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, 7-4=<<7-4=3>>3 remained.
Finally, after Sidney ordered three more sub sandwiches, there were a total of 3+3=<<3+3=6>>6 sub sandwiches.
If each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs, then the remaining sub sandwiches contain a total of 6*4=<<6*4=24>>24 meatballs.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches:
   * 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches

2. Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs:
   * 7 sub sandwiches x 4 meatballs per sub = 28 meatballs

3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches:
   * 4 sub sandwiches x 4 meatballs per sub = 16 meatballs eaten by Mark

4. Remaining meatballs after Mark ate 4 sub sandwiches:
   * 28 meatballs - 16 meatballs = 12 meatballs remaining

5. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches:
   * 3 sub sandwiches x 4 meatballs per sub = 12 additional meatballs

6. Total meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remaine

3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   * Sidney had 7 meatball sub sandwiches.
   * Mark ate 4 of them.
   * So Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches remaining.

4. Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.
   * So now Sidney has 3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches.

To calculate the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained:
* Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
* Sidney had 6 meatball sub sandwiches remaining.
* So the total number of meatballs = 6 sub san

2. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.

3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   * Sidney originally had 7 meatball sub sandwiches
   * Mark ate 4 of them
   * So Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches remaining

4. Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches.
   * So the total number of sub sandwiches Sidney had now is 3 + 3 = 6

5. To calculate the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained:
   * Each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs
   * Sidney had 6 sub sandwiches remaining
   * So the total number of meatballs is 6 x 4 =
