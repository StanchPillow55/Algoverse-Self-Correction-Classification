Question:
Maria invited 4 of her friends over for a water balloon fight in the backyard. At the start of the game, Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons. She had one water balloon for herself.  Then her mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons.  How many total balloons did the girls have?


Reference Answer:
Maria's 4 friends started with 2 balloons * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 balloons.
Maria started with 1 balloon + 8 balloons = <<1+8=9>>9 balloons to begin with.
Maria's mom came out and gave each girl 3 more balloons, which is 5 girls * 3 balloons = <<5*3=15>>15 balloons.
Total balloons used by the girls is 9 + 15 = <<9+15=24>>24 balloons.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of water balloons the girls had after Maria's mom gave them additional balloons.

Given information:
- Maria invited 4 of her friends over for a water balloon fight.
- At the start of the game, Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons.
- Maria had one water balloon for herself.
- Maria's mom then gave each person 3 more balloons.

Step 1: Calculate the number of water balloons the girls had at the start of the game.
Number of balloons for Maria's friends = 4 friends × 2 balloons each = 8 balloons
Number of balloons for Maria = 1 balloon
Total number of balloons at the start of the game = 8 + 1 = 9 balloons

Step 2: Calculate the number of additional balloons Maria's mom gave to each person.
Number of additional balloons for each person = 3 balloons
Total number of additional balloons = 5 people (4 friends + Maria) × 3 balloons each = 15 balloons

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. At the start of the game, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons each.
   * 4 friends x 2 balloons each = 8 balloons

2. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
   * 1 balloon for Maria

3. Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons.
   * 4 friends x 3 balloons each = 12 balloons
   * 1 balloon for Maria

4. To calculate the total number of balloons:
   * Balloons given by Maria: 8 + 1 = 9
   * Balloons given by Maria's mom: 12
   * Total balloons: 9 + 12 = 21

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is 21.
