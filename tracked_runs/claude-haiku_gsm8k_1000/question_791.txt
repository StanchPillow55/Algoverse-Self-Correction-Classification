Question ID: 772

Question:
Tatiana is deciding how much of her weekend she wants to spend playing soccer. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. She is dividing her time between soccer, video games, and reading. If she reads for 3 hours and plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, what percentage of her weekend does she spend playing soccer?


Reference Answer:
She has 12 hours for her activities because 7 + 5 = <<7+5=12>>12
After reading, she has 9 hours left because 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9
She spends 3 hours playing video games because 9 x (1/3) = <<9*(1/3)=3>>3
After video games she has 6 hours left for soccer because 9 - 3 = <<6=6>>6
The proportion of time spend on soccer is .5 because 6 / 12 = <<6/12=.5>>.5
The percentage of time spent on soccer is 50 because .5 x 100 = <<50=50>>50
#### 50

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, for a total of 12 hours over the weekend.
- She spends 3 hours reading.
- She spends 1/3 of the remaining time playing video games.

Step 1: Calculate the remaining time after reading.
Total time - Time spent reading = Remaining time
12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time spent playing video games.
Remaining time × 1/3 = Time spent playing video games
9 hours × 1/3 = 3 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time spent playing soccer.
Remaining time - Time spent playing video games = Time spent playing soccer
9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer.
(Time spent playing soccer / Total time) × 100 = Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer
(6 hours / 12 hours) × 100 = 50
