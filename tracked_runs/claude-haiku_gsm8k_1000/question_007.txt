Question ID: 374

Question:
Mary has 30 sheep. She gets 1 kg of milk from half of them and 2 kg of milk from the other half every day. How much milk does she collect every day?


Reference Answer:
Half of the sheep is 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15.
Mary gets (15 * 1) + (15 * 2) = <<15*1+15*2=45>>45 kg of milk every day.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mary has 30 sheep.
- She gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep every day.
- She gets 2 kg of milk from the other half of the sheep every day.

Step 1: Determine how many sheep are in each group.
Total number of sheep = 30
Half of the sheep = 30 / 2 = 15 sheep

Step 2: Calculate the amount of milk collected from the first group.
Milk collected from the first group = 15 sheep × 1 kg = 15 kg

Step 3: Calculate the amount of milk collected from the second group.
Milk collected from the second group = 15 sheep × 2 kg = 30 kg

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of milk collected every day.
Total milk collected = Milk from the first group + Milk from the second group
Total milk collected = 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mary has 30 sheep.
- Half of the sheep (15 sheep) give 1 kg of milk per day.
- The other half of the sheep (15 sheep) give 2 kg of milk per day.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of milk from the first half of the sheep.
Milk from the first half = 15 sheep × 1 kg/day = 15 kg/day

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of milk from the second half of the sheep.
Milk from the second half = 15 sheep × 2 kg/day = 30 kg/day

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of milk collected every day.
Total milk collected = Milk from the first half + Milk from the second half
Total milk collected = 15 kg/day + 30 kg/day = 45 kg/day

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.
