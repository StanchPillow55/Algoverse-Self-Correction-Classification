Question ID: 8

Question:
John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph and then turns around because he realizes he forgot something very important at home.  He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?


Reference Answer:
When he turned around he was 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 miles from home
He was only able to drive 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours in the first four hours
In half an hour he goes 30*.5=<<30*.5=15>>15 miles
He then drives another 2-.5=<<2-.5=1.5>>1.5 hours
In that time he goes 80*1.5=<<80*1.5=120>>120 miles
So he drove 120+15=<<120+15=135>>135 miles
So he is 180-135=<<180-135=45>>45 miles away from home

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance John traveled during each part of his journey and then find the final distance from home at the end of the 4 hours.

Given information:
- John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
- He turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours.
- He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
- He drives at a speed of 30 mph for the next half-hour.
- He drives at a speed of 80 mph for the remaining time of the 4 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the distance John traveled during the first 3 hours.
Distance traveled = Speed × Time
Distance traveled = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance John traveled during the remaining 4 hours.
Time spent in standstill traffic = 2 hours
Time spent driving at 30 mph = 0.5 hours
Time spent driving at 80 mph = 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5

Response:
Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   * Distance traveled = Speed x Time
   * Distance = 60 mph x 3 hours = 180 miles

2. John then turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours.
   * For the first 2 hours, he is in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance.

3. For the next half-hour (0.5 hours), he drives at 30 mph.
   * Distance traveled = Speed x Time
   * Distance = 30 mph x 0.5 hours = 15 miles

4. For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph.
   * Distance traveled = Speed x Time
   * Distance = 80 mph x 1.5 hours = 120 miles

5. Total distance traveled:
   * Distance traveled on the way out = 180 miles
   * Distance traveled on the way back = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135

Okay, let's break this problem down step by step:

1. John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:
   * Distance traveled = Speed × Time
   * Distance = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles

2. John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours:
   * The first 2 hours are spent in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered.
   * For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:
     * Distance traveled = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles
   * For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph:
     * Distance traveled = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles

3. Total distance traveled:
   * Distance traveled on the way out = 180 miles
   * Distance traveled on the way back = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles
   * Total distance = 180 miles + 135 miles = 315 miles
