Question ID: 243

Question:
Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month. Every day he has a 15-minute call with his boss, and he's had 300 extra minutes of call this month to other people. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 days?


Reference Answer:
First find the total time Jason spends calling his boss: 15 minutes/call * 30 calls/month = <<15*30=450>>450 minutes
Then subtract the minutes Jason has already used to find how many he has left: 1000 minutes - 450 minutes - 300 minutes = <<1000-450-300=250>>250 minutes

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of minutes Jason has used and then subtract it from the total number of minutes in his plan.

Given information:
- Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month.
- He has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
- He has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people this month.
- This month has 30 days.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of minutes used for the calls with his boss.
Number of days in a month × Duration of each call = Total minutes used for calls with boss
30 days × 15 minutes = 450 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of minutes used for the extra calls to other people.
Extra minutes used = 300 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of minutes used.
Total minutes used = Minutes used for calls with boss + Extra minutes used
Total minutes used = 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the number of minutes left in Jason's plan.
Total minutes in the plan - Total minutes used = Minutes left in the plan

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month.
- He has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
- He has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people this month.
- This month has 30 days.

Step 1: Calculate the total minutes used for the daily calls with his boss.
Daily call with boss = 15 minutes
Total days in the month = 30 days
Total minutes used for calls with boss = 15 minutes × 30 days = 450 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total minutes used for the extra calls to other people.
Extra minutes used = 300 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total minutes used in the month.
Total minutes used = Minutes used for calls with boss + Extra minutes used
Total minutes used = 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the remaining minutes in the phone plan.
Total minutes in the phone plan = 1000 minutes
Remaining minutes = Total minutes in the phone plan - Total

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month.
- He has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
- He has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people this month.
- This month has 30 days.

Step 1: Calculate the total minutes used for the daily calls with his boss.
Daily call with boss = 15 minutes
Total days in the month = 30 days
Total minutes used for boss calls = 15 minutes × 30 days = 450 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total minutes used for the extra calls to other people.
Extra minutes used = 300 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total minutes used in the month.
Total minutes used = Minutes used for boss calls + Extra minutes used
Total minutes used = 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the remaining minutes in the phone plan.
Total minutes in the phone plan = 1000 minutes
Remaining minutes = Total minutes in the phone plan - Total minutes used
