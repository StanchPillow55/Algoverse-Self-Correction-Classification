Question ID: 118

Question:
A customs officer at the main port of SeaSide clearances counted 2 containers of imported vehicles, each having 5 vehicles inside. The next day, more containers were brought in, and the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Calculate the number of containers that were imported on the second day, assuming all the containers contain 5 vehicles.


Reference Answer:
On the first day, 2*5 = <<2*5=10>>10 vehicles were Imported,
On the next day, the number of vehicles imported through the port is 30-10 = <<30-10=20>>20 vehicles
If each container has 5 vehicles, the number is 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 containers.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of containers imported on the second day, given the information provided.

Given information:
- On the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each.
- The total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day.
- All the containers contain 5 vehicles.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of vehicles on the first day.
Number of vehicles on the first day = 2 containers Ã— 5 vehicles per container = 10 vehicles

Step 2: Calculate the number of additional vehicles brought in on the second day.
Total number of vehicles - Number of vehicles on the first day = Number of additional vehicles on the second day
30 - 10 = 20 vehicles

Step 3: Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.
Number of additional vehicles on the second day / Number of vehicles per container = Number of containers imported on the second day
20 vehicles / 5 vehicles per container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4 containers.

Final answer: 4 containers
