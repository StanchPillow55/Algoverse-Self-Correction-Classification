Question:
Jerry has two pools, both with leaks emptying them out at 4 gallons/minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?


Reference Answer:
First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons
Let b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16
Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8
#### 8

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations and solve for the amount of water in the small pool.

Given information:
- Both pools have leaks that are emptying them at a rate of 4 gallons/minute.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago.
- Let y be the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago.

Step 1: Set up the first equation based on the information that the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago.
y = 2x

Step 2: Set up the second equation based on the information that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool.
y - 4 × 4 = x - 4 × 4
y - 16 = x - 16
y = x

Step 3: Substitute the second equation into the first equation to

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Both pools have leaks emptying them at 4 gallons/minute.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the amount of water in the small pool now (in gallons)
- Let 2x = the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago
- Let 4x = the amount of water in the big pool now

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water lost in 4 minutes.
Both pools are losing water at 4 gallons/minute.
Water lost in 4 minutes = 4 gallons/minute × 4 minutes = 16 gallons

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago.
Small pool 4 minutes ago = x + 16 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Both pools have leaks emptying them at 4 gallons/minute.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the amount of water in the small pool now (in gallons)
- Then, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had x gallons and the big pool had 2x gallons

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water lost in the 4 minutes.
Water lost in 4 minutes = 4 gallons/minute × 4 minutes = 16 gallons

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the small pool now.
Amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago = x gallons
Amount of water lost in 4 minutes = 16 gallons
Amount of water in the small pool now = x - 16 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the amount of water in the big pool now.
