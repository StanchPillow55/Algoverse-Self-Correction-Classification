Question ID: 150

Question:
Steve and Tim decide to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives further away than Tim, so he is allowed to ride his bike. Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school. If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?


Reference Answer:
Steve has to travel 3 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<3*5280=15840>>15840 feet to get home.
It will take Steve 15840 feet / (440 feet/minute) = <<15840/(440)=36>>36 minutes to get home.
Tim has to travel 2 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<2*5280=10560>>10560 feet to get home.
It will take Tim 10560 feet / (264 feet/minute) = <<10560/264=40>>40 minutes to get home.
Steve will finish the race in 40 minutes - 36 minutes = <<40-36=4>>4 minutes less time than Tim.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to reach their respective homes, and then calculate the difference between the two times to determine how long the winner will be waiting.

Given information:
- Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can bike at 440 feet per minute.
- Tim lives 2 miles from the school and can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute.

Step 1: Convert the distances to feet.
Steve's distance = 3 miles × 5,280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance = 2 miles × 5,280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes for Steve to reach his home.
Time for Steve = Distance / Speed
Time for Steve = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes for Tim to reach his home.
Time for Tim = Distance / Speed
Time for Tim = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes
