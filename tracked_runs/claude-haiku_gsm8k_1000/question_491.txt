Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The boy has 5 cards.
- The boy's brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy.

Step 1: Find the number of cards the boy's brother has.
The boy's brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy.
Number of cards the boy's brother has = 5 - 3 = 2 cards

Step 2: Find the total number of cards they have together.
Total number of cards = Number of cards the boy has + Number of cards the boy's brother has
Total number of cards = 5 + 2 = 7 cards

Therefore, the boy and his brother have a total of 7 cards together.

Final answer: The boy and his brother have a total of 7 cards together.
