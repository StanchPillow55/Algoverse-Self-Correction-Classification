Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes.
- In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points.
- In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points.

Step 1: Calculate the number of points Mike scored in the second 20 minutes.
In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.
In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points.
25% of 4 points = 0.25 Ã— 4 = 1 point
So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of points Mike scored.
Total points scored = Points scored in the first 20 minutes + Points scored in the second 20 minutes
Total points scored = 4 + 5 = 9 points

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is 9 points.
