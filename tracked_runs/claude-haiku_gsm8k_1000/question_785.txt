Question:
Mrs. Jameson's bamboo in the backyard grows up to 30 inches a day. Today, its height is 20 feet. In how many days will its height be 600 inches?


Reference Answer:
Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, then 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 inches.
So, the bamboo needs to grow 600 - 240 = <<600-240=360>>360 inches more.
Therefore, it will take 360/30 = <<360/30=12>>12 days for its height to be 600 inches.
#### 12

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to convert the given information into a common unit of measurement and then calculate the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach the desired height.

Given information:
- The bamboo grows up to 30 inches per day.
- The current height of the bamboo is 20 feet.
- The desired height is 600 inches.

Step 1: Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
1 foot = 12 inches
Current height in inches = 20 feet Ã— 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Step 2: Calculate the remaining height the bamboo needs to grow to reach the desired height.
Remaining height = Desired height - Current height
Remaining height = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Step 3: Calculate the number of days it will take for the bamboo to grow the remaining height.
Growth rate = 30 inches per day
Number of days = Remaining height / Growth rate
Number of days = 360 inches / 30 inches per day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12
