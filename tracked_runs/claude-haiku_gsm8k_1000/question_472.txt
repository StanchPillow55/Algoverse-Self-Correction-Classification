Question:
Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack.  They are currently on sale for buy one get one free.  She also has a $2.00 coupon.  How much will each individual razor cost, in cents, after the discount if she buys 2 packs of razors?


Reference Answer:
Buy one get one free means she gets 2 packs for the price of 1 and she has a $2.00 coupon, so the razors will cost her $4-$2 = $2.00
Each pack has 4 razors and she buys 2 packs for a total of 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 razors
The razors cost $2.00 and she bought 8 so that means each razor costs $2.00/8 = $<<2/8=0.25>>0.25 each

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the razors after the discount and then calculate the cost per individual razor.

Given information:
- Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack.
- The razors are currently on sale for buy one get one free.
- Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
- Heather wants to buy 2 packs of razors.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the razors before the discount.
Cost of 2 packs of razors = 2 ร $4.00 = $8.00

Step 2: Apply the buy one get one free discount.
Since the discount is buy one get one free, the total cost of the razors is halved.
Total cost of the razors after the discount = $8.00 รท 2 = $4.00

Step 3: Apply the $2.00 coupon.
Total cost of the razors after the discount and coupon = $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack.
2. The razors are currently on sale for buy one get one free.
3. Heather also has a $2.00 coupon.
4. Heather wants to buy 2 packs of razors.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 packs of razors without any discounts:
* 2 packs x $4.00 per pack = $8.00

Now, with the buy one get one free sale, the total cost is halved:
* $8.00 / 2 = $4.00

Finally, with the $2.00 coupon, the total cost is reduced further:
* $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Now, to find the cost per individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the total number of razors:
* 2 packs x 4 razors per pack = 8 razors

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 packs of razors without any discounts:
* 2 packs x $4.00 per pack = $8.00

Now, with the buy one get one free sale, the effective cost of the 2 packs is:
* $8.00 / 2 = $4.00

Finally, with the $2.00 coupon, the total cost is:
* $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Now, to find the cost per individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the total number of razors:
* 2 packs x 4 razors per pack = 8
