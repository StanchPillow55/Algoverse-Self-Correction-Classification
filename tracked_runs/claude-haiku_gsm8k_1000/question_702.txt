Question:
If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000/year. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. If she quits after 30 years, what will her annual pension be?


Reference Answer:
First find how many years Marcy works after 20 years: 30 years - 20 years = <<30-20=10>>10 years
Then multiply that number by the amount of her pension she gets per year: 10 years * 5% = 50%
Then multiply that percentage by the total amount of the full pension to find how much she gets: $50,000 * 50% = $<<50000*50*.01=25000>>25,000
#### 25000

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate Marcy's annual pension based on the given information.

Given information:
- Marcy works for the same company for 40 years.
- Her annual pension is $50,000/year.
- After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
- Marcy quits after 30 years.

Step 1: Calculate the total pension Marcy has earned after 20 years.
Total pension earned after 20 years = $50,000 × 20 years = $1,000,000

Step 2: Calculate the annual pension Marcy is entitled to after 20 years.
Annual pension after 20 years = 5% of the total pension earned
Annual pension after 20 years = 0.05 × $1,000,000 = $50,000

Step 3: Calculate the annual pension Marcy will receive after quitting at 30 years.
Annual pension after 30 years = $50,000 + (0.05 × $1,000,000) = $

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Marcy works for the same company for 40 years.
- She gets an annual pension of $50,000/year.
- After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
- She quits after 30 years.

Step 1: Calculate the total pension Marcy would have received if she worked for the full 40 years.
Total pension for 40 years = $50,000 x 40 years = $2,000,000

Step 2: Calculate the amount of pension Marcy is entitled to after 20 years.
Pension entitlement after 20 years = 5% of $2,000,000 = $100,000/year

Step 3: Calculate the pension Marcy will receive if she quits after 30 years.
Pension for the first 20 years = $50,000 x 20 years = $1,000,000
Pension for the remaining 10 years = $100,000 x
