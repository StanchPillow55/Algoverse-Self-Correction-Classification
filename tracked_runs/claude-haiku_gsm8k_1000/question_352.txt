Question ID: 615

Question:
Scarlett found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale.  At the pet store, she bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each and 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 apiece.  She bought 20 fish at $0.50 each and she needed fish food that cost $2.00.  How much did she spend?


Reference Answer:
a bag of rocks cost $2.50 and she bought 2 bags so 2*2.50 = $<<2*2.5=5.00>>5.00
She bought 3 pieces of coral for $2.00 each so she spent 3*2 = $<<3*2=6.00>>6.00
She bought 20 fish that costs $0.50 each so 20*.50 = $<<20*.50=10.00>>10.00
All total she spent $10 on the aquarium, $5 on the rocks, $6 on coral, $10 on fish and $2 on food so 10+5+6+10+2 = $<<10+5+6+10+2=33.00>>33.00

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items Scarlett purchased.

Given information:
- Scarlett found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale.
- She bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each.
- She bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 apiece.
- She bought 20 fish at $0.50 each.
- She bought fish food that cost $2.00.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the rocks.
Cost of 2 bags of rocks = 2 × $2.50 = $5.00

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the coral.
Cost of 3 pieces of coral = 3 × $2.00 = $6.00

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fish.
Cost of 20 fish = 20 × $0.50 = $10.00

Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
Total cost = Cost of aquarium + Cost of rocks + Cost of coral + Cost of fish + Cost of fish food
Total cost =

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Aquarium cost: $10.00
2. Rocks:
   - 2 bags at $2.50 each
   - Total cost for rocks: 2 x $2.50 = $5.00
3. Coral:
   - 3 pieces at $2.00 each
   - Total cost for coral: 3 x $2.00 = $6.00
4. Fish:
   - 20 fish at $0.50 each
   - Total cost for fish: 20 x $0.50 = $10.00
5. Fish food: $2.00

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Aquarium: $10.00
Rocks: $5.00
Coral: $6.00
Fish: $10.00
Fish food: $2.00

Total amount spent: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00

Therefore, the total
