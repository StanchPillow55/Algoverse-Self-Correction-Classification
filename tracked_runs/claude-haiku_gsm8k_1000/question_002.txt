Question ID: 886

Question:
A singer has 50 microphones that he wants to arrange in pairs on a stage. While making the arrangement, he realizes that 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. How many pairs of microphones was he able to arrange on the stage?


Reference Answer:
The number of microphones that were not able to find space on the stage is 20/100*50 = <<20/100*50=10>>10
This means the singer could set 50-10 = <<50-10=40>>40 microphones into pairs on the stage.
Since a pair has 2 microphones, the singer set up 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 pairs of microphones on the stage.
#### 20

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of microphones that were arranged in pairs on the stage.

Given information:
- The singer has 50 microphones.
- 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs.

Step 1: Calculate the number of microphones that won't find any space to fit in.
20% of 50 microphones = 0.20 Ã— 50 = 10 microphones

Step 2: Calculate the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs.
Total microphones - Microphones that won't find any space = Microphones that can be arranged in pairs
50 microphones - 10 microphones = 40 microphones

Step 3: Calculate the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged.
Microphones that can be arranged in pairs / 2 = Number of pairs
40 microphones / 2 = 20 pairs

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

Final answer: 20 pairs of microphones.
