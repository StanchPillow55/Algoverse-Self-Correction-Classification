Question:
Crista's plants need to be watered every day. She has 20 plants. 4 of her plants need half of a cup of water. 8 plants need 1 cup of water. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?


Reference Answer:
She will need 2 cups for the plants that need half of a cup of water because .5*4 = 2 cups
She will need 8 cups for the plants that need a cup of water because 1*8= <<1*8=8>>8 cups.
Since she has 20 plants, 20-4-8=<<20-4-8=8>>8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water.
Since 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, she will need 2 cups of water for these plants because .25*8=<<.25*8=2>>2 cups.
In total, she will need 2+8+2=<<2+8+2=12>>12 cups of water per day.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water required for all of Crista's plants.

Given information:
- Crista has 20 plants.
- 4 plants need half a cup of water.
- 8 plants need 1 cup of water.
- The remaining plants need a quarter of a cup of water.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water needed for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water.
Amount of water needed for 4 plants = 4 × 0.5 cup = 2 cups

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water needed for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water.
Amount of water needed for 8 plants = 8 × 1 cup = 8 cups

Step 3: Calculate the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water.
Total number of plants - (4 plants that need half a cup + 8 plants that need 1 cup) = 20 - (4 + 8) = 8 plants

Step 4: Calculate the amount of water neede

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Crista has a total of 20 plants.
2. 4 of her plants need half a cup of water each.
   * 4 plants x 0.5 cups = 2 cups

3. 8 of her plants need 1 cup of water each.
   * 8 plants x 1 cup = 8 cups

4. The remaining 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each.
   * 8 plants x 0.25 cups = 2 cups

5. To find the total amount of water needed, we add up the amounts for each group:
   * 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups

Therefore, the total amount of water Crista needs every day for her 20 plants is 12 cups.
