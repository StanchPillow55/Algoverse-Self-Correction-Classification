Question ID: 125

Question:
Julia was preparing for a dinner party at her house, where she intended to serve stew.  She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons.  Later, her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.  While Julia was making the stew, she used three of the spoons to sample her stew.  Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.  How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?


Reference Answer:
The total number of spoons from Julia and her husband was 12+3=<<12+3=15>>15 spoons.
Since the husband bought a package of five spoons, then Julia's package contained 15-5=<<15-5=10>>10 spoons.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought.

Given information:
- Julia bought a new package of spoons.
- Her husband later bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
- Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
- When Julia went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find the total number of spoons Julia had after her husband bought the additional 5 spoons.
Total spoons = Spoons from Julia's package + Spoons from her husband's package
Total spoons = Unknown + 5

Step 2: Find the number of spoons left after Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
Spoons left = Total spoons - Spoons used for sampling
Spoons left = (Unknown + 5) - 3

Step 3: Set up an equation to find the number of spoons in Julia's package.
Spoons left = 12
(Unknown + 5) - 3

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Julia bought a new package of spoons.
- Her husband later bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
- Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
- In the end, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's start by finding the total number of spoons Julia had after her husband gave her the 5 new spoons.
* Total spoons = Spoons from Julia's package + Spoons from husband's package
* Total spoons = X + 5 (where X is the number of spoons in Julia's package)

Now, we know that Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew, so the total number of spoons she had at the end was 12.
* Total spoons = X + 5 - 3 = 12
* X + 2 = 12
* X = 10

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought was 10.

Final answer: The number of spoons in the package that Julia
