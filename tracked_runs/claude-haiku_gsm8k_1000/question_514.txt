Question ID: 104

Question:
Poppy is solving a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, then her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. How many jigsaw pieces are left to be placed?


Reference Answer:
Poppy has placed 1000 pieces / 4 = <<1000/4=250>>250 pieces.
This means there are 1000 – 250 = <<1000-250=750>>750 pieces remaining.
Her mom therefore places 750 / 3 = <<750/3=250>>250 pieces.
This leaves a total of 750 – 250 = <<750-250=500>>500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.
#### 500

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The jigsaw puzzle has 1000 pieces.
- Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board.
- Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces.

Step 1: Calculate how many pieces Poppy placed on the board.
A quarter of 1000 pieces = 1000 ÷ 4 = 250 pieces

Step 2: Calculate how many pieces are left after Poppy places her pieces.
Total pieces - Pieces placed by Poppy = Remaining pieces
1000 - 250 = 750 pieces

Step 3: Calculate how many pieces Poppy's mom placed on the board.
A third of 750 pieces = 750 ÷ 3 = 250 pieces

Step 4: Calculate how many pieces are left to be placed.
Remaining pieces - Pieces placed by Poppy's mom = Pieces left to be placed
750 - 250 = 500 pieces

Therefore, there are 500 jigsaw pieces left
