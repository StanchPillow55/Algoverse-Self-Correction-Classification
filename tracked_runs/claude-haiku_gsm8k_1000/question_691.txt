Question ID: 1005

Question:
The population of porcupines in a park is 50. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. If each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, how many porcupines will be in the park after a year?


Reference Answer:
The number of female porcupines in the park is 3/5*50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30.
In a month, the 30 female porcupines give birth to 30*4 = <<30*4=120>>120 new babies.
After a year, with 12 months, the total number of new porcupines in the park is 120*12 = <<120*12=1440>>1440
The total population of porcupines in the park after a year is 50+1440 = <<50+1440=1490>>1490

Response:
Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- The total population of porcupines in the park is 50.
- The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.
- Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
- We need to find the number of porcupines in the park after a year.

Step 1: Calculate the number of female porcupines.
Number of female porcupines = 3/5 × 50 = 30 female porcupines

Step 2: Calculate the number of babies born each month.
Number of babies born per month = 30 female porcupines × 4 babies per female = 120 babies

Step 3: Calculate the total number of porcupines in the park after a year.
Number of porcupines after a year = Initial population + (Number of babies born per month × 12 months)
Number of porcupines after a year = 50 + (120 × 12) = 50 + 1,

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The total population of porcupines in the park is 50.

2. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.
   * To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5:
   * 50 x 3/5 = 30 female porcupines

3. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   * In a year, there are 12 months.
   * So each female porcupine will give birth to 4 x 12 = 48 babies in a year.

4. To find the total number of porcupines after a year, we need to add the new babies to the original population.
   * Total new babies born in a year = 30 female porcupines x 48 babies per female = 1,440 new babies
   * Original population = 50 porcupines
   * Total porcupines after a year = 50 +

   * Original population: 50
   * Number of female porcupines: 30
   * Number of babies born in a year: 30 x 48 = 1,440
