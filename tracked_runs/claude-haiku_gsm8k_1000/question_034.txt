Question:
Tobias bought a big pizza with 60 pieces. He ate 2/5 of the pieces on the first day, 10 pieces on the second day, and 7/13 of the remaining pieces on the third day. How many pizza pieces has he eaten so far?


Reference Answer:
On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5*60 = <<2/5*60=24>>24 pieces of the pizza.
On the second day, Tobias ate 10 more pieces of the pizza, totaling 24+10 = <<24+10=34>>34 pieces
The number of pieces of pizza remaining is 60-34 = <<60-34=26>>26
On the third day, Tobias ate 7/13*26 = <<7/13*26=14>>14 pieces of pizza.
So far, he has eaten 14+34 = <<14+34=48>>48 pieces of the pizza he bought.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- The pizza has 60 pieces.
- On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5 of the pieces.
- On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces.
- On the third day, Tobias ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the first day.
2/5 of 60 pieces = 2/5 Ã— 60 = 24 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces remaining after the first day.
Total pieces - Pieces eaten on the first day = Remaining pieces
60 - 24 = 36 pieces

Step 3: Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the second day.
Tobias ate 10 pieces on the second day.

Step 4: Calculate the number of pieces remaining after the second day.
Remaining pieces after the first day - Pieces eaten on the second day = Remaining pieces
36 - 10 = 26 pieces

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Tobias bought a pizza with 60 pieces.

2. On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the pieces:
   * 2/5 of 60 = 0.4 x 60 = 24 pieces

3. On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

4. On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces:
   * Remaining pieces = 60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces
   * 7/13 of 26 = 0.5384 x 26 = 14 pieces

5. Total pieces eaten:
   * First day: 24 pieces
   * Second day: 10 pieces
   * Third day: 14 pieces
   * Total = 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces

Therefore, the final answer is that Tobias has eaten 48 pizza pieces so far.
