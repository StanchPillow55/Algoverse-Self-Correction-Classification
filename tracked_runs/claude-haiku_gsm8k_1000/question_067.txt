Question:
Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?


Reference Answer:
If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the rates of walking and running, and then calculate the distance traveled during the given time.

Given information:
- Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk.
- Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run.
- Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
- Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
- The total time is 6 hours.

Step 1: Find the rate of skipping.
Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.

Step 2: Find the rate of running.
Since Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, we can use the following equation:
Rate of skipping = 1/2 × Rate of running
3 miles per hour = 1/2 × Rate of running
Rate of running = 3 × 2 = 6 miles per hour

Step 3: Find the rate of walking.
Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk.
- Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run.
- Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
- Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
- The total time is 6 hours.

Step 1: Calculate Dana's running speed.
Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can calculate her running speed as follows:
Running speed = 2 × Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 × 3 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour

Step 2: Calculate Dana's walking speed.
Since Dana's running speed is four times faster than her walking speed, we can calculate her walking speed as follows:
Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour

Step 3: Calculate the distance

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk.
- Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run.
- Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
- Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
- The total time is 6 hours.

Step 1: Find Dana's running speed.
Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can calculate her running speed as follows:
Running speed = 2 × Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 × 3 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour

Step 2: Find Dana's walking speed.
We know that Dana's running speed is four times faster than her walking speed, so we can calculate her walking speed as follows:
Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour
