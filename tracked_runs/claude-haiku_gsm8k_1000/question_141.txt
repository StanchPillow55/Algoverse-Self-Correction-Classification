Question ID: 398

Question:
Nancy is cleaning out her old woodshed. She saw 90 spiders, 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and a number of stink bugs equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. How many bugs did she count total?


Reference Answer:
First find the number of millipedes: 90 spiders / 3 spiders/millipede = <<90/3=30>>30 millipedes
Then multiply the number of millipedes by 2: 30 bugs * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 bugs
Then subtract 12 to find the number of stink bugs: 60 bugs - 12 bugs = <<60-12=48>>48 bugs
Then add the number of each kind of bug to find the total: 48 bugs + 30 bugs + 90 bugs = <<48+30+90=168>>168 bugs
#### 168

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of millipedes, stink bugs, and then the total number of bugs that Nancy counted.

Given information:
- Nancy saw 90 spiders.
- The number of millipedes is 1/3rd as many as the number of spiders.
- The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12.

Step 1: Find the number of millipedes.
Number of millipedes = 1/3 × Number of spiders
Number of millipedes = 1/3 × 90 = 30 millipedes

Step 2: Find the number of stink bugs.
Number of stink bugs = 2 × Number of millipedes - 12
Number of stink bugs = 2 × 30 - 12 = 48 stink bugs

Step 3: Find the total number of bugs.
Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 bugs

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Nancy saw 90 spiders.

2. She saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders.
   * To find the number of millipedes, we take 1/3 of the number of spiders:
   * 1/3 of 90 = 30 millipedes

3. The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
   * Number of millipedes = 30
   * Twice the number of millipedes = 2 x 30 = 60
   * Subtract 12 from 60 to get the number of stink bugs:
   * 60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs

4. To find the total number of bugs, we add up the spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:
   * Spiders: 90
   * Millipedes: 30
   * Stink bugs: 48
   * Total: 90 + 30 + 48 =

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Nancy saw 90 spiders
- The number of millipedes is 1/3rd as many as the number of spiders
- The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12

Step 1: Calculate the number of millipedes.
Number of millipedes = 1/3 × 90 = 30 millipedes

Step 2: Calculate the number of stink bugs.
Number of stink bugs = 2 × 30 - 12 = 48 stink bugs

Step 3: Calculate the total number of bugs.
Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 bugs

Therefore, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168.
