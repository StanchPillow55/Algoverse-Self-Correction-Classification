Question ID: 19

Question:
Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the next two miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) does she need to walk the remaining distance?


Reference Answer:
First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours
Next subtract the time Marissa already spent walking to find out how much time she has left: 3 hours - 1 hour - 1 hour = <<3-1-1=1>>1 hour
Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Given information:
- The total distance of the trail is 12 miles.
- Marissa took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.
- Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Marissa has already walked.
Distance walked = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles

Step 2: Calculate the remaining distance Marissa needs to walk.
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance walked
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total time Marissa has already spent walking.
Total time spent = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Step 4: Calculate the average speed Marissa needs to achieve to reach her goal.
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 12 miles / 4

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The total distance of the trail is 12 miles.
- Marissa took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
- Marissa took another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.
- Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Marissa has already walked.
Distance walked = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles

Step 2: Calculate the remaining distance Marissa needs to walk.
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance already walked
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total time Marissa has already spent walking.
Total time spent = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Step 4: Calculate the average speed Marissa needs to maintain for the remaining distance.
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 12 miles / 4 hours = 3 miles per hour

Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total time Marissa has already spent walking.
Total time spent = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Step 4: Calculate the average speed Marissa needs to maintain for the remaining distance to achieve her desired average speed of 4 miles per hour.
Desired average speed = Total distance / Total time
Desired average speed = 12
