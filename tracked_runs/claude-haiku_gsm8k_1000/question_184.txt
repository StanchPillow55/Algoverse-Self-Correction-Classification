Question ID: 1042

Question:
Johnny's dad brought him to watch some horse racing and his dad bet money. On the first race, he lost $5. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?


Reference Answer:
On the second race he won $11 because 1+ 5 x 2 = <<1+5*2=11>>11
On the third race he lost $15 because 10 x 1.5 = <<10*1.5=15>>15
He lost a total of $20 on the first and third races because 15 + 5 = <<15+5=20>>20

He lost $9 that day because 11 - 20 = <<11-20=-9>>-9
He lost an average of $3 per race because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
- On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.
- On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.

Step 1: Calculate the amount he won in the second race.
Amount he won in the second race = 2 × $5 + $1 = $11

Step 2: Calculate the amount he lost in the third race.
Amount he lost in the third race = 1.5 × $11 = $16.50

Step 3: Calculate the total amount he lost or won.
Total amount lost or won = -$5 + $11 - $16.50 = -$10.50

Step 4: Calculate the average amount he lost that day.
Average amount lost = Total amount lost or won / 3 races
Average amount lost = -$10.50 / 3 = -$3.50

Therefore, on average, Johnny's dad lost $3
