Question:
To be promoted to the next school year, Jane takes 3 tests that together must total at least 42 points. On her first test, Jane scored 15 points, on the second test she scored 18 points. What is the minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass?


Reference Answer:
Adding the points obtained in the first two tests, Jane scored 15 + 18 = <<15+18=33>>33 points.
To pass, Jane must score 42 - 33 = <<42-33=9>>9 points.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jane needs to score at least 42 points on 3 tests to be promoted to the next school year.
- On the first test, Jane scored 15 points.
- On the second test, Jane scored 18 points.

To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we need to calculate the total points she has already scored and then find the minimum points she needs to score on the third test to reach the 42-point threshold.

Step 1: Calculate the total points Jane has already scored on the first two tests.
Points scored on first test + Points scored on second test = Total points scored so far
15 points + 18 points = 33 points

Step 2: Calculate the minimum points Jane needs to score on the third test to reach the 42-point threshold.
Total points needed - Total points scored so far = Minimum points needed on third test
42 points - 33 points = 9 points

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test to pass and be promoted to the next school
