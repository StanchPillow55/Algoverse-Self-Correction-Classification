Question ID: 945

Question:
James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 20-mile lake.  He can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour.  He swims 60% of the distance.  After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed.  How long did it take him to get across the lake?


Reference Answer:
He swam 20*.6=<<20*.6=12>>12 miles.
That took him 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 hours.
So he rested 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours.
He then swam the remaining 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8 miles.
His pace was 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 mph.
So it took him 8/1=<<8/1=8>>8 hours.
So in total, he took 6+3+8=<<6+3+8=17>>17 hours.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- The lake is 20 miles long.
- James can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
- James swims 60% of the distance.
- James rests on an island for half as long as the swimming time.
- James finishes the remaining distance at half the speed.

Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims.
Distance swam = 60% of 20 miles = 0.6 × 20 miles = 12 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes James to swim the first 12 miles.
Time to swim 12 miles = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time James rests on the island.
Rest time = Half of the swimming time = 0.5 × 6 hours = 3 hours

Step 4: Calculate the distance remaining to be swam.
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swam = 20 miles - 12

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The lake is 20 miles long.
- James can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
- He swims 60% of the distance.
- He rests on an island for half as long as the swimming time.
- He finishes the remaining distance at half the speed.

Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims.
Distance swam = 60% of 20 miles = 0.6 × 20 miles = 12 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes James to swim the 12 miles.
Time to swim 12 miles = Distance / Speed
Time to swim 12 miles = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time James spends resting on the island.
Time spent resting = 1/2 × Time spent swimming
Time spent resting = 1/2 × 6 hours = 3 hours

Step 4: Calculate the distance remaining to be swam.
Distance remaining = Total distance

Step 3: Calculate the time James rests on the island.
Rest time = Half of the swimming time = 0.5 × 6 hours = 3 hours

Step 4: Calculate the distance remaining to be covered.
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swam = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles
