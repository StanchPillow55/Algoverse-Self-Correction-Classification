Question:
Melissa works as a pet groomer. This week, she has 8 dogs that need to be bathed, 5 cats that need their nails clipped, 3 birds that need their wings trimmed, and 12 horses that need to be brushed. If she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days, how many animals will she groom each day of the week?


Reference Answer:
Melissa has 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = <<8+5+3+12=28>>28 animals to groom over the next week.
Therefore, She will groom 28 / 7 = <<28/7=4>>4 animals each day.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of animals that Melissa needs to groom and then divide it by the number of days in a week to determine the number of animals she will groom each day.

Given information:
- Melissa has 8 dogs that need to be bathed.
- Melissa has 5 cats that need their nails clipped.
- Melissa has 3 birds that need their wings trimmed.
- Melissa has 12 horses that need to be brushed.

Step 1: Find the total number of animals Melissa needs to groom.
Total animals = Dogs + Cats + Birds + Horses
Total animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 animals

Step 2: Divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week to find the number of animals Melissa will groom each day.
Number of days in a week = 7 days
Number of animals groomed per day = Total animals / Number of days in a week
Number of animals groomed per day = 28 animals / 7 days = 4
