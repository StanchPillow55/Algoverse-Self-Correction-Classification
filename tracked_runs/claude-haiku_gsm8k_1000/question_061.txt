Question ID: 975

Question:
Richard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 60 cherries. If Robert has 30 cherries, and has 10 more than Richard, how many more cherries does Robert have than Jerry?


Reference Answer:
Since Robert has 30, then 60 - 30 = <<30=30>>30 cherries are left to be shared by Richard and Jerry.
Richard has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 cherries since Robert has 10 more cherries than him.
Jerry has 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 cherries.
So Robert has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 more cherries than Jerry.
#### 20

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Richard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 60 cherries.
- Robert has 30 cherries.
- Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.

Step 1: Find how many cherries Richard has.
Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, we can say:
Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Step 2: Find how many cherries Jerry has.
We know that the total number of cherries is 60, and we know how many cherries Robert and Richard have.
Total cherries = Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries + Jerry's cherries
60 = 30 + 20 + Jerry's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 10

Step 3: Find how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry.
Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10 = 20

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.
