Question:
The combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 100 years old. Find the age of Peter knowing that Paul is 10 years older than John and that Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.


Reference Answer:
Let x be the age of John. Paul’s age is x + 10
Peter’s age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10
We have (2x + 10) + (x + 1) + x = 100
Combining like terms, we get 4x + 20 = 100
Subtracting 20 from both sides and dividing by 4, we get x = 80/4 = 20 years old.
John is 20 years old, Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old, and Peter is 2 * 20 + 10 = 50 years old.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
- Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
- Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Step 1: Let's represent the ages of the three people as variables.
Let's say:
- Peter's age = x
- Paul's age = y
- Jean's age = z

Step 2: We know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so we can express Paul's age in terms of Jean's age.
Paul's age (y) = Jean's age (z) + 10

Step 3: We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.
Peter's age (x) = Paul's age (y) + Jean's age (z)
x = y + z

Step 4: We can substitute the expression for Paul's age (y) into the equation for Peter's age (x).
x = (z + 10) + z
x = 2z + 10

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
- Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
- Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

Step 1: Let's represent the ages of the three people as variables.
Let Jean's age be x.
Then, Paul's age is x + 10, and Peter's age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10.

Step 2: Set up an equation to find the combined age of the three people.
Combined age = Peter's age + Paul's age + Jean's age
100 = (2x + 10) + (x + 10) + x
100 = 4x + 20

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
4x + 20 = 100
4x = 80
x = 20

Step 4: Find the ages of the three people.
Jean's age = x = 20 years
Paul's age = x + 10 = 20

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
- Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
- Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

Let's define the variables:
- Let Peter's age be x.
- Let Paul's age be x + 10, since he is 10 years older than Jean.
- Let Jean's age be x - 10, since Paul is 10 years older than her.

Step 1: Write an equation to represent the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean.
Peter's age + Paul's age + Jean's age = 100
x + (x + 10) + (x - 10) = 100

Step 2: Simplify the equation and solve for x.
3x = 100
x = 100 / 3
x = 33.33 years

Step 3: Find Peter's age.
Peter's age = x = 33.33 years

Step 4: Find Paul's age.
Paul's
