Question:
Fred was preparing for a party to be held in four days.  So, he made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day and put them in the refrigerator cooler.  But later that evening, his children discovered the delicious nectar and robbed the cooler, drinking 4 of those gallons of root beer.  On the second day, his wife Barbie also discovered the root beer and accidentally spilled 7 gallons. On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie visited Fred's house and helped himself to the root beer, further reducing the amount remaining by 5 gallons.  On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party.  If Fred and the others shared the remaining root beer equally, how much was available for each to drink during the party?


Reference Answer:
Fred started with 24 gallons, but on day 1, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24-4=<<24-4=20>>20 gallons of root beer.
On day two, Barbie spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20-7=<<20-7=13>>13 gallons of root beer.
On day three, Ronnie helped himself to 5 gallons, leaving 13-5=<<13-5=8>>8 gallons of root beer for the party.
Three guests joined Fred for the party, resulting in 3+1=<<3+1=4>>4 party goers.
If the 4 party-goers split the root beer equally, each person gets 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 gallons

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the changes in the amount of root beer over the four days and then calculate the amount available for each person at the party.

Given information:
- Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.
- On the first day, his children drank 4 gallons.
- On the second day, Barbie spilled 7 gallons.
- On the third day, Ronnie drank 5 gallons.
- On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of root beer remaining after the first day.
Initial amount of root beer = 24 gallons
Amount of root beer consumed by children = 4 gallons
Amount of root beer remaining after the first day = 24 gallons - 4 gallons = 20 gallons

Step 2: Calculate the amount of root beer remaining after the second day.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On the first day, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.
2. On the first day, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 20 gallons.
3. On the second day, Barbie spilled 7 gallons, leaving 13 gallons.
4. On the third day, Ronnie drank 5 gallons, leaving 8 gallons.
5. On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party.

To calculate how much root beer was available for each person, we need to divide the remaining 8 gallons by the 3 people at the party.

8 gallons รท 3 people = 2.67 gallons per person

Therefore, the final answer is that each person at the party had 2.67 gallons of root beer available to drink.
