Question:
Anna is trying to buy books for her local library. She had a budget of $16, and she has already spent $4. She also bought 2 books today, and both books cost her the same amount of money. If Anna has $2 left in her budget, how much did each of the books cost?


Reference Answer:
Anna had already spent some money, so she started the day with $16 – $4 = $<<16-4=12>>12.
She has money left in the budget, so she spent a total of $12 – $2 = $<<12-2=10>>10 on the books.
Therefore each book cost her $10 / 2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Anna had a budget of $16.
- She has already spent $4.
- She bought 2 books today, and both books cost the same amount.
- She has $2 left in her budget.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Anna has spent so far.
Total amount spent = Amount already spent + Cost of the 2 books
Total amount spent = $4 + Cost of the 2 books

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Anna has left in her budget.
Total budget - Total amount spent = Amount left in the budget
$16 - Total amount spent = $2

Step 3: Set up an equation to solve for the cost of each book.
Total amount spent = $4 + Cost of the 2 books
Total amount spent = $16 - $2 = $14
$4 + Cost of the 2 books = $14
Cost of the 2 books = $14 - $4 = $10

Step 4: Calculate the cost of each book.
Cost of the 2 books

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Anna had a budget of $16.
- She has already spent $4.
- She bought 2 books today, and both books cost the same amount.
- She has $2 left in her budget.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Anna has spent so far.
Total amount spent = Amount already spent + Cost of the 2 books
Total amount spent = $4 + (2 × x), where x is the cost of each book

Step 2: Calculate the remaining budget.
Remaining budget = Total budget - Total amount spent
Remaining budget = $16 - Total amount spent
Remaining budget = $16 - ($4 + 2x)
Remaining budget = $12 - 2x

Step 3: Use the given information that Anna has $2 left in her budget.
Remaining budget = $2
$12 - 2x = $2
-2x = -$10
x = $5

Therefore, each book cost $5.

Final answer: Each book cost $5.
