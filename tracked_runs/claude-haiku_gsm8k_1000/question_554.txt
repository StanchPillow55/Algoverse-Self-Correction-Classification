Question ID: 696

Question:
Students in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior. If they get enough points in total, they can go on a trip. In the class, there are Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam has collected 50 points. Betty was better than Adam and collected 30% more. Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom, who has 30 points less than Betty. How many points is the class missing to go on the trip if the minimum threshold is 400 points?


Reference Answer:
Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.
Betty's total is therefore 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.
So the class is missing 400 - 255 = <<400-255=145>>145 points to go on the trip.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- Adam has collected 50 points.
- Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
- Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom.
- Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
- The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points.

Step 1: Calculate the number of points collected by Betty.
Betty's points = Adam's points + 30% of Adam's points
Betty's points = 50 + (0.3 × 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points

Step 2: Calculate the number of points collected by Tom.
Tom's points = Betty's points - 30
Tom's points = 65 - 30 = 35 points

Step 3: Calculate the number of points collected by Martha.
Martha's points = 3 × Tom's points
Martha's points = 3 × 35 = 105 points

Step 4: Calculate the total points collected by the class.
Total points collected = Adam's points +

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more than Adam, so her points are:
   * 50 + (50 * 0.3) = 50 + 15 = 65 points

3. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, so her points are:
   * 3 * Tom's points

4. Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so his points are:
   * 65 - 30 = 35 points

5. Martha's points are:
   * 3 * 35 = 105 points

6. The total points collected by the class are:
   * Adam: 50 points
   * Betty: 65 points
   * Martha: 105 points
   * Tom: 35 points
   * Total: 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points

7. The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points.
8. The class is missing:

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Adam has collected 50 points.
- Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
- Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom.
- Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
- The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points.

Step 1: Calculate Betty's points.
Betty's points = Adam's points + 30% of Adam's points
Betty's points = 50 + (0.3 × 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points

Step 2: Calculate Tom's points.
Tom's points = Betty's points - 30
Tom's points = 65 - 30 = 35 points

Step 3: Calculate Martha's points.
Martha's points = 3 × Tom's points
Martha's points = 3 × 35 = 105 points

Step 4: Calculate the total points collected by the class.
Total points collected = Adam's points + Betty's points + Martha's points + Tom's points
Total points
