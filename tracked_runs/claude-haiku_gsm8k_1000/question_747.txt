Question:
Tom bought a CD for $4, and a headphone set. In total, he paid $48. How many more CDs would Tom have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set?

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tom bought a CD for $4.
- Tom also bought a headphone set.
- In total, Tom paid $48.

To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set, we need to:
1. Calculate the cost of the headphone set.
2. Determine how many CDs Tom could have bought with the total amount he spent.
3. Subtract the number of CDs he actually bought from the number of CDs he could have bought.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the headphone set.
Total amount paid = $48
Cost of the CD = $4
Cost of the headphone set = Total amount paid - Cost of the CD
Cost of the headphone set = $48 - $4 = $44

Step 2: Determine how many CDs Tom could have bought with the total amount he spent.
Total amount spent = $48
Cost of each CD = $4
Number of CDs Tom could have bought = Total amount spent / Cost of each CD
Number of CDs Tom coul

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tom bought a CD for $4.
- Tom also bought a headphone set.
- The total amount Tom paid was $48.

To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set, we need to:
1. Calculate the cost of the headphone set.
2. Determine how many CDs Tom could have bought with the remaining money.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the headphone set.
Total amount paid = $48
Cost of the CD = $4
Cost of the headphone set = Total amount paid - Cost of the CD
Cost of the headphone set = $48 - $4 = $44

Step 2: Determine how many CDs Tom could have bought with the remaining money.
If Tom didn't buy the headphone set, he would have had $44 to spend on CDs.
Number of CDs Tom could have bought = Remaining money / Cost of each CD
Number of CDs Tom could have bought = $44 / $4 = 11 CDs

Therefore
