Question ID: 1235

Question:
Michael is traveling on the interstate at an average speed of 50km/hr (taking into account all the necessary stops for gas, relaxation, etc.). If he goes on like this for 3 days, and the distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km, what percentage of this distance has he covered?


Reference Answer:
There are 24 hours in each day, so he has been traveling for a total of 3*24 = <<24*3=72>>72 hours
At a rate of 50km/hr he has covered 50*72 = <<50*72=3600>>3600 km
3600km as a percentage of 6000km is (3600/6000)*100% = 60%
#### 60

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance Michael can cover in 3 days and then calculate the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that he has covered.

Given information:
- Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr.
- He travels for 3 days.
- The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance Michael can cover in 3 days.
Distance covered per day = Average speed × Hours per day
Distance covered per day = 50 km/hr × 24 hours = 1200 km/day
Total distance covered in 3 days = Distance covered per day × Number of days
Total distance covered in 3 days = 1200 km/day × 3 days = 3600 km

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.
Percentage of distance covered = (Total distance covered / Total distance between Alaska and Texas) × 100
Percentage of distance covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) × 100 = 60%

Therefore, Michael

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr
- He travels for 3 days
- The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km

Step 1: Calculate the total distance Michael can cover in 3 days.
Distance covered per day = Average speed × Hours per day
Distance covered per day = 50 km/hr × 24 hrs/day = 1200 km/day
Total distance covered in 3 days = Distance covered per day × Number of days
Total distance covered in 3 days = 1200 km/day × 3 days = 3600 km

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.
Percentage of distance covered = (Total distance covered / Total distance between Alaska and Texas) × 100
Percentage of distance covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) × 100 = 60%

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr
- He travels for 3 days
- The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km

Step 1: Calculate the total distance Michael can cover in 3 days.
Distance covered per day = Average speed × Time traveled per day
Distance covered per day = 50 km/hr × 24 hrs/day = 1200 km/day
Total distance covered in 3 days = Distance covered per day × Number of days
Total distance covered in 3 days = 1200 km/day × 3 days = 3600 km

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.
Percentage of distance covered = (Total distance covered / Total distance between Alaska and Texas) × 100
Percentage of distance covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) × 100 = 60%

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.
