Question ID: 1268

Question:
A tower is made out of 4 blue blocks, twice as many yellow blocks, and an unknown number of red blocks. If there are 32 blocks in the tower in total, how many red blocks are there?


Reference Answer:
There are 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 yellow blocks in the tower.
There are 32-4-8 = <<32-4-8=20>>20 red blocks in the tower.
#### 20

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The tower is made of 4 blue blocks
- The tower has twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks
- The tower has an unknown number of red blocks
- The total number of blocks in the tower is 32

Step 1: Determine the number of yellow blocks.
Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, we can calculate the number of yellow blocks as:
Number of yellow blocks = 2 × Number of blue blocks
Number of yellow blocks = 2 × 4 = 8 yellow blocks

Step 2: Calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks.
Total number of blue and yellow blocks = Number of blue blocks + Number of yellow blocks
Total number of blue and yellow blocks = 4 + 8 = 12 blocks

Step 3: Determine the number of red blocks.
Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, and we know the number of blue and yellow blocks is 12, we can calculate the number of red blocks as:
Number of red blocks = Total number of blocks - Number of blue an

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The tower is made of 4 blue blocks
- The tower has twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks
- The tower has an unknown number of red blocks
- The total number of blocks in the tower is 32

Step 1: Find the number of yellow blocks.
Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, we can calculate the number of yellow blocks as:
Number of yellow blocks = 2 × 4 = 8 yellow blocks

Step 2: Find the number of red blocks.
We know the total number of blocks is 32, and we know the number of blue and yellow blocks. So we can calculate the number of red blocks by subtracting the blue and yellow blocks from the total:
Total blocks = 32
Blue blocks = 4
Yellow blocks = 8
Red blocks = Total blocks - Blue blocks - Yellow blocks
Red blocks = 32 - 4 - 8 = 20 red blocks

Therefore, the tower has 20 red blocks.
