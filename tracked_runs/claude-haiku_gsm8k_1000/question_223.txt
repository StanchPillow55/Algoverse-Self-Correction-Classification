Question ID: 1053

Question:
Alison qualified for a spot on the running team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a tank top for $10, a pair of running shorts for $5 more than the top cost, and a pair of tennis shoes that were originally $48 but were on sale for half price. She had a coupon for $2 off the package of $8 athletic socks that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?


Reference Answer:
The shorts were $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $5 + $10 = $<<5+10=15>>15.
Her tennis shoes were half the original $68 price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
With her coupon, the socks were $8 - $2 = $<<8-2=6>>6.
The shirt, shorts, shoes, and socks together cost $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $<<10+15+24+6=55>>55.

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Alison bought a tank top for $10.
- She bought a pair of running shorts that cost $5 more than the tank top.
- She bought a pair of tennis shoes that were originally $48 but were on sale for half price.
- She bought a package of athletic socks that cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the running shorts.
Cost of running shorts = Cost of tank top + $5
Cost of running shorts = $10 + $5 = $15

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the tennis shoes.
Original cost of tennis shoes = $48
Discounted price of tennis shoes = $48 รท 2 = $24

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the athletic socks.
Cost of athletic socks = $8 - $2 (coupon) = $6

Step 4: Calculate the total amount spent on athletic gear.
Total amount spent = Cost of tank top + Cost of running shorts + Cost of tennis shoes + Cost

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Alison bought a tank top for $10.
2. She bought a pair of running shorts that cost $5 more than the tank top, so the shorts cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. She bought a pair of tennis shoes that were originally $48, but were on sale for half price. So the tennis shoes cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. She also bought a package of athletic socks that cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now let's add up all the costs:
* Tank top: $10
* Running shorts: $15
* Tennis shoes: $24
* Athletic socks: $6

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

Therefore, the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55.
