Question ID: 311

Question:
In a family of 5, three people eat three eggs each day while the rest eat two eggs each day. If they eat eggs every day, how many eggs will the family consume in a week?


Reference Answer:
Three persons eat 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 eggs each day.
So, 5 - 3 = <<5-3=2>>2 persons eat two eggs in a day.
Thus, 2 x 2 = 4 eggs are consumed by the two other people in a day.
So the family consumes 9 + 4 = <<9+4=13>>13 eggs each day.
Therefore, 13 x 7 = <<13*7=91>>91 eggs will be consumed by the family in a week.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The family has 5 people.
- 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
- The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.
- They eat eggs every day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs consumed by the 3 people who eat 3 eggs each day.
Number of eggs consumed by 3 people = 3 people × 3 eggs per day = 9 eggs per day

Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs consumed by the 2 people who eat 2 eggs each day.
Number of eggs consumed by 2 people = 2 people × 2 eggs per day = 4 eggs per day

Step 3: Calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family per day.
Total eggs consumed per day = Eggs consumed by 3 people + Eggs consumed by 2 people
Total eggs consumed per day = 9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs

Step 4: Calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a

Step 3: Calculate the total number of eggs consumed per day.
Total eggs consumed per day = Eggs consumed by 3 people + Eggs consumed by 2 people
Total eggs consumed per day = 9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs

Step 4: Calculate the total number of eggs consumed in a week.
Total eggs consumed in a week = Total eggs
