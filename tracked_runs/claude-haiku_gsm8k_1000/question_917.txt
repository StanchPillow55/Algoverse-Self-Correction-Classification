Question ID: 522

Question:
It's strawberry-picking time on Grandma Concetta's farm.  Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour, while Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony.  Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, and Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy.  In total, how many quarts of strawberries can Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm?


Reference Answer:
Bobby picks one fewer quart of strawberries per hour than the 6 quarts of berries per hour that Tony can pick, for a total of 6-1=<<6-1=5>>5 quarts per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, for a total of 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, or a total of 10-2=8 quarts per hour. Thus, in total, Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick 6+5+10+8=<<6+5+10+8=29>>29 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of quarts of strawberries picked per hour by each person and then add them together to get the total.

Given information:
- Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy.

Step 1: Find the number of quarts of strawberries picked per hour by Bobby.
Bobby's quarts per hour = Tony's quarts per hour - 1
Bobby's quarts per hour = 6 - 1 = 5 quarts

Step 2: Find the number of quarts of strawberries picked per hour by Kathy.
Kathy's quarts per hour = 2 × Bobby's quarts per hour
Kathy's quarts per hour = 2 × 5 = 10 quarts

Step 3: Find the number of quarts of strawberries picked per hour by

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy.

Step 1: Calculate how many quarts of strawberries Bobby can pick per hour.
Bobby's quarts per hour = Tony's quarts per hour - 1
Bobby's quarts per hour = 6 - 1 = 5 quarts

Step 2: Calculate how many quarts of strawberries Kathy can pick per hour.
Kathy's quarts per hour = 2 × Bobby's quarts per hour
Kathy's quarts per hour = 2 × 5 = 10 quarts

Step 3: Calculate how many quarts of strawberries Ricky can pick per hour.
Ricky's quarts per hour = Kathy's quarts per hour -
