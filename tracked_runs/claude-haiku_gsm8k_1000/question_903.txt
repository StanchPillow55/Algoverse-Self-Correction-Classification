Question ID: 64

Question:
Sophia is thinking of taking a road trip in her car, and would like to know how far she can drive on a single tank of gas. She has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank, and she needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again. The owner's manual for her car says that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sophia drive on a single tank of gas?


Reference Answer:
To find miles per gallon divide 100 miles / 4 gallons = <<100/4=25>>25 miles per gallon
To find how far Olivia can go on a single tank, multiply 25 miles per gallon x 12 gallons = <<25*12=300>>300 miles
#### 300

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the fuel efficiency of Sophia's car and then use that information to calculate the maximum distance she can drive on a single tank of gas.

Given information:
- Sophia has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank.
- She needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill up the tank again.
- The owner's manual says the tank holds 12 gallons of gas.

Step 1: Calculate the fuel efficiency of Sophia's car.
Fuel efficiency = Distance traveled / Amount of fuel used
Fuel efficiency = 100 miles / 4 gallons
Fuel efficiency = 25 miles per gallon (mpg)

Step 2: Calculate the maximum distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas.
Maximum distance = Fuel tank capacity × Fuel efficiency
Maximum distance = 12 gallons × 25 miles per gallon
Maximum distance = 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive up to 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

Final answer: Sophia can drive up to 300 miles on a single tank of gas.
