Question:
David and Dasha went to the carnival, where there are 9 rides.  Each ride costs 2 ride tickets at $2 per ticket.  You can also buy a ride bracelet for $30 which gives you 9 rides.  If David buys a ride bracelet and Dasha buys tickets, and they ride all 9 rides, how much money does David save?


Reference Answer:
Each ride cost 2 x $2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All 9 rides cost $4 x 9 = $<<4*9=36>>36.
By bathing the ride bracelet, David saves $36 - $30 = $<<36-30=6>>6.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for David and Dasha, and then find the difference between the two to determine how much money David saves.

Given information:
- There are 9 rides at the carnival.
- Each ride costs 2 ride tickets at $2 per ticket.
- A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives you 9 rides.
- David buys a ride bracelet, and Dasha buys tickets.
- They ride all 9 rides.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost for Dasha.
Dasha needs to buy 2 tickets per ride, and there are 9 rides.
Total cost for Dasha = 2 tickets per ride × $2 per ticket × 9 rides = $36

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for David.
David buys a ride bracelet for $30.
Total cost for David = $30

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the total cost for Dasha and the total cost for David.
Difference in cost = Dasha's total cost - David's total cost
Difference in cost =

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 9 rides at the carnival
- Each ride costs 2 ride tickets at $2 per ticket
- A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives you 9 rides

Step 1: Calculate the cost of buying individual ride tickets for 9 rides.
Cost of 9 rides with individual tickets = 9 rides × 2 tickets per ride × $2 per ticket = $36

Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying a ride bracelet.
Cost of a ride bracelet = $30

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual tickets.
Amount saved = Cost of individual tickets - Cost of ride bracelet
Amount saved = $36 - $30 = $6

Therefore, David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual tickets.
