Question:
A bumper car rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. The rink also has yellow cars.  If the rink has 75 cars in total how many yellow cars do they have?


Reference Answer:
The rink has 12-2= <<12-2=10>>10 green cars.
The rink has 10*3= <<10*3=30>>30 blue cars.
The rink has 12+10+30= <<12+10+30=52>>52 cars that are not yellow.
The rink has 75-52= <<75-52=23>>23 yellow cars.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- The rink has 12 red cars.
- The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars.
- The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars.
- The rink has a total of 75 cars.

Step 1: Find the number of green cars.
Number of green cars = Number of red cars - 2
Number of green cars = 12 - 2 = 10

Step 2: Find the number of blue cars.
Number of blue cars = 3 × Number of green cars
Number of blue cars = 3 × 10 = 30

Step 3: Find the total number of cars that are not yellow.
Total number of non-yellow cars = Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars
Total number of non-yellow cars = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52

Step 4: Find the number of yellow cars.
Total number of cars = 75
Number of yellow cars = Total number of cars -

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The rink has 12 red cars.
2. They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars. 
   * So, the number of green cars = 12 - 2 = 10 cars.
3. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars.
   * So, the number of blue cars = 3 x 10 = 30 cars.
4. The total number of cars in the rink is 75.
5. To find the number of yellow cars, we need to add up the number of red, green, and blue cars, then subtract that from the total number of cars.
   * Red cars: 12
   * Green cars: 10
   * Blue cars: 30
   * Total of red, green, and blue cars: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52
   * Number of yellow cars = Total cars - (red + green + blue)
   * Number of yellow cars = 75 - 52 = 23

Therefore,
