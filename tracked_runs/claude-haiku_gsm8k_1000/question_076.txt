Question ID: 559

Question:
A stickler for health, Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. By contract, Octavia’s husband Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks. Juan’s doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. By how many cups must Juan reduce his daily coffee intake?


Reference Answer:
Since the daily recommendation is 4 cups of coffee, Octavia drinks 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 cups
Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, which translates to 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 cups
Subtracting the daily recommended amount from Juan’s current coffee intake gives 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 cups
Juan must therefore reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups
#### 16

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of coffee Octavia drinks daily.
2. Calculate the amount of coffee Juan drinks daily.
3. Calculate the difference between Juan's current coffee intake and the recommended daily intake.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of coffee Octavia drinks daily.
* The daily recommended cups of coffee is not given, so let's assume it is 8 cups.
* Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee.
* Octavia's daily coffee intake = 8 cups / 2 = 4 cups

Step 2: Calculate the amount of coffee Juan drinks daily.
* Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks.
* Juan's daily coffee intake = 4 cups × 10 = 40 cups

Step 3: Calculate the difference between Juan's current coffee intake and the recommended daily intake.
* The recommended daily intake of coffee is 4 cups.
* Juan's current daily coffee intake is 40 cups.
* The difference between Juan's current intake and the recommended intake is:
* 40 cups - 4

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee.
   * Let's say the daily recommended cups of coffee is x.
   * Octavia drinks 1/2 * x cups of coffee.

2. Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks.
   * Octavia drinks 1/2 * x cups of coffee.
   * Juan drinks 10 * (1/2 * x) = 5x cups of coffee.

3. Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.
   * Juan currently drinks 5x cups of coffee.
   * He needs to reduce his intake to 4 cups.
   * The reduction in cups of coffee is 5x - 4 = x - 4 cups.

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by x - 4 cups.
