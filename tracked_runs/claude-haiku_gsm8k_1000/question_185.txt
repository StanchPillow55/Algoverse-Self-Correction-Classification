Question ID: 630

Question:
Tiffany is measuring how many surfers can ride a big wave without falling. She sees that when a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright. Of these riders, 60% are women. If there are 100 riders, how many men can stay upright on the wave?


Reference Answer:
25 riders stayed upright because 100 x .25 = <<100*.25=25>>25
Of these riders 10 were men because 25 x .4 = <<25*.4=10>>10

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- When a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright.
- Of the riders who can stay upright, 60% are women.
- There are 100 riders in total.

Step 1: Calculate the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave.
25% of 100 riders = 0.25 × 100 = 25 riders can stay upright

Step 2: Calculate the number of women who can stay upright on the wave.
60% of 25 riders = 0.60 × 25 = 15 women can stay upright

Step 3: Calculate the number of men who can stay upright on the wave.
Total riders who can stay upright = 25
Number of women who can stay upright = 15
Number of men who can stay upright = Total riders who can stay upright - Number of women who can stay upright
Number of men who can stay upright = 25 - 15 = 10 men

Therefore,

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- When a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright.
- Of the riders who can stay upright, 60% are women.
- There are 100 riders total.

Step 1: Calculate the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave.
25% of 100 riders = 0.25 × 100 = 25 riders can stay upright

Step 2: Calculate the number of women who can stay upright on the wave.
60% of 25 riders = 0.60 × 25 = 15 women can stay upright

Step 3: Calculate the number of men who can stay upright on the wave.
Total riders who can stay upright = 25
Number of women who can stay upright = 15
Number of men who can stay upright = Total riders - Number of women
Number of men who can stay upright = 25 - 15 = 10 men

Therefore, the final answer is:
10 men can stay up
