Question ID: 1165

Question:
John collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes.  The first two have 200 apartments each and the last one is 60% bigger than the other two combined.  He collects garbage 3 times a week from each place and he gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment.  How much money does he make in a week?


Reference Answer:
The first two complexes have 200+200=<<200+200=400>>400 apartments
The third one has 400*.6=<<400*.6=240>>240 more apartments than those 2 combined
So in total, it has 400+240=<<400+240=640>>640 apartments
So he goes to 640+400=<<640+400=1040>>1040 apartments each time
That means he visits 1040*3=<<1040*3=3120>>3120 apartments every week
So he makes 3120*$0.4=$<<3120*0.4=1248>>1248 every week
#### 1248

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from, the total number of collections per week, and then calculate the total amount of money he makes.

Given information:
- The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each.
- The third apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined.
- John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place.
- He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
Total apartments in the first two complexes = 200 + 200 = 400 apartments
Third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined:
Number of apartments in the third complex = 400 + (0.6 Ã— 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments

Step 2: Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
Total apartments = Apartments in the first two complexes + Apartments in the third complex
Total apartments = 200 + 200 + 640 = 1,040 apartments

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:
   * The first two complexes have 200 apartments each
   * The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined
   * So, the third complex has 200 + 200 = 400 apartments
   * 60% of 400 is 0.6 x 400 = 240 apartments
   * Therefore, the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments

2. Calculate the total number of apartments across all three complexes:
   * Complex 1: 200 apartments
   * Complex 2: 200 apartments
   * Complex 3: 640 apartments
   * Total: 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments

3. Calculate the number of collections per week:
   * John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place
   * Total collections per week = 3 x 3 = 9 collections

4. Calculate the total amount earned per week:
   * John

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Determine the number of apartments in the third complex:
   * The first two complexes have 200 apartments each
   * The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined
   * So, the number of apartments in the third complex is:
     - 2 x 200 = 400 apartments
     - 60% of 400 = 0.6 x 400 = 240 apartments
     - Total apartments in the third complex = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments

2. Calculate the total number of apartments across all three complexes:
   * 200 + 200 + 640 = 1,040 apartments

3. Determine the number of collections per week:
   * John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place
   * Total collections per week = 3 x 3 = 9 collections

4. Calculate the total amount earned per collection:
   * John gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment
   * Total amount earned per collection = $
