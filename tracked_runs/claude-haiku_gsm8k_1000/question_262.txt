Question ID: 1069

Question:
Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks from his store supplying fertiliser to different farmers in his hometown dispatched for delivery on a particular day. Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser packed in bags. Two hours after the trucks had departed for delivery, Mr Hezekiah got the news that a quarter of the number of lorries dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures on the road and could not deliver the fertilisers to the farmers. Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day?


Reference Answer:
If there were 20 trucks dispatched for delivery, and 1/4 of the total number had mechanical failures, there were 1/4*20 = <<20*1/4=5>>5 failed deliveries.
Out of the 20 trucks dispatched to deliver fertiliser, 20-5 = <<20-5=15>>15 trucks delivered to the farmers.
Since each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of tons of fertiliser delivered that day was 15*20 = <<15*20=300>>300 tons.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of fertiliser carried by all the trucks.
2. Determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
3. Calculate the amount of fertiliser that was not delivered due to the mechanical failures.
4. Subtract the amount of fertiliser not delivered from the total amount of fertiliser to find the final amount that reached the farmers.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of fertiliser carried by all the trucks.
* Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.
* Total amount of fertiliser = 20 trucks × 20 tons per truck = 400 tons.

Step 2: Determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
* A quarter of the number of trucks dispatched had mechanical failures.
* Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 1/4 × 20 = 5 trucks.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of fertiliser that was not delivered due to the mechanical failures.
* Amount of fertiliser not delivered = 5 trucks × 20 tons per truck = 100

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks dispatched for delivery.
- Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertilizer packed in bags.
- 2 hours after the trucks had departed, a quarter of the number of trucks had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertilizers.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of fertilizer dispatched.
Total number of trucks = 20
Fertilizer per truck = 20 tons
Total fertilizer dispatched = 20 trucks × 20 tons = 400 tons

Step 2: Calculate the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 1/4 × 20 = 5 trucks

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of fertilizer that could not be delivered.
Fertilizer per truck = 20 tons
Fertilizer not delivered = 5 trucks × 20 tons = 100 tons

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of fertilizer that reached the farmers.
Total fertilizer dispatched - Fertilizer not delivere

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks dispatched for delivery.
- Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertilizer packed in bags.
- 2 hours after the trucks had departed, a quarter of the number of trucks had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertilizers.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of fertilizer dispatched.
Total fertilizer dispatched = Number of trucks × Tons of fertilizer per truck
Total fertilizer dispatched = 20 trucks × 20 tons/truck = 400 tons

Step 2: Calculate the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 1/4 × 20 trucks = 5 trucks

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of fertilizer that reached the farmers.
Total fertilizer that reached the farmers = Total fertilizer dispatched - Fertilizer in trucks with mechanical failures
Total fertilizer that reached the farmers = 400 tons - (5 trucks × 20 tons/truck) = 400 tons - 100 tons =
