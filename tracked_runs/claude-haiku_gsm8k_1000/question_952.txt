Question ID: 475

Question:
It takes 240 minutes of walking to break in a new pair of shoes. Jason wants to try out for the track team in three weeks. If he can walk 4 days a week to break in the new shoes, how long does he have to spend walking each day?


Reference Answer:
First find how many days Jason has to prepare for the tryouts: 3 weeks * 4 days/week = <<3*4=12>>12 days
Then divide the time it takes to break the shoes in by the time Jason can spend each day to find how long he needs to walk each day: 240 minutes / 12 days = <<240/12=20>>20 minutes/day
#### 20

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of minutes Jason needs to spend walking to break in the new shoes, and then divide it by the number of days he can walk per week to find the daily walking time.

Given information:
- It takes 240 minutes of walking to break in a new pair of shoes.
- Jason wants to try out for the track team in three weeks.
- Jason can walk 4 days a week to break in the new shoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of minutes Jason needs to spend walking to break in the new shoes.
Total minutes of walking = 240 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of days Jason has to break in the new shoes.
Number of weeks = 3 weeks
Number of days per week = 4 days
Total number of days = 3 weeks Ã— 4 days per week = 12 days

Step 3: Calculate the daily walking time.
Daily walking time = Total minutes of walking / Total number of days
Daily walking time = 240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes per day

Therefore, Jason needs to spend 20 minutes walking
