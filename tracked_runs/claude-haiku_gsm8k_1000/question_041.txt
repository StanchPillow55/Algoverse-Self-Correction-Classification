Question ID: 367

Question:
3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting.  Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, how many were kicked out for other reasons?


Reference Answer:
First quadruple the number of customers kicked out for not wearing masks: 4 * 3 customers = <<4*3=12>>12 customers
Then subtract 5 from this number: 12 customers - 5 customers = 7 customers
Then triple that number to find the number of people kicked out for violence: 7 customers * 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 customers
Then subtract the number of customers kicked out for each known reason to find the number kicked out for other reasons: 50 customers - 3 customers - 21 customers - 7 customers = <<50-3-21-7=19>>19 customers
