Question:
James hires a horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.  He gets 1 hour free.  The first paid hour is $15 and each hour after that is twice the cost.  How much did he pay?


Reference Answer:
He got it for 9-5=<<9-5=4>>4 hours
He pays for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours
The first hour cost 1*15=$<<1*15=15>>15
The other 3-1=2 hours are more expensive
They cost 15*2=$<<15*2=30>>30 per hour
So those 2 hours cost 2*30=$<<2*30=60>>60
So he pays 60+15=$<<60+15=75>>75 per hours
#### 75

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- James hires a horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.
- He gets 1 hour free.
- The first paid hour is $15.
- Each hour after that is twice the cost of the previous hour.

Step 1: Determine the total number of hours James hired the carriage.
Total hours = 9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours

Step 2: Determine the number of paid hours.
Paid hours = Total hours - Free hour = 4 hours - 1 hour = 3 paid hours

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the first paid hour.
Cost of the first paid hour = $15

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the second paid hour.
Cost of the second paid hour = 2 × $15 = $30

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the third paid hour.
Cost of the third paid hour = 2 × $30 = $60

Step 6: Calculate the total cost.
Total cost = Cost of the first pai
