Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of newspapers James delivers to District B.

Given information:
- James delivers a total of 600 newspapers in a day.
- He delivers 198 newspapers to District A.
- He delivers 209 newspapers to District C.

Step 1: Find the total number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C.
Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C = 198 + 209 = 407 newspapers

Step 2: Find the number of newspapers delivered to District B.
Total newspapers delivered - Newspapers delivered to District A - Newspapers delivered to District C = Newspapers delivered to District B
600 - 198 - 209 = 193 newspapers

Therefore, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

Final answer: James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.
