Question ID: 524

Question:
Jackson is planting tulips. He can fit 6 red tulips in a row and 8 blue tulips in a row. If Jackson buys 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips, how many rows of flowers will he plant?


Reference Answer:
First, divide the number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row: 36 / 6 = <<36/6=6>>6 rows.
Next, divide the number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips per row: 24 / 8 = <<24/8=3>>3 rows.
Now add the number of rows of each color to find the total: 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 rows.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
- Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.
- Jackson buys 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips.

To find the number of rows of flowers, we need to determine how many rows of red tulips and how many rows of blue tulips Jackson will plant.

Step 1: Calculate the number of rows of red tulips.
Number of red tulips = 36
Number of red tulips per row = 6
Number of rows of red tulips = 36 ÷ 6 = 6 rows

Step 2: Calculate the number of rows of blue tulips.
Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of blue tulips per row = 8
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 ÷ 8 = 3 rows

Step 3: Calculate the total number of rows of flowers.
Total number of rows = Number of rows of red tulips + Number of rows of blue tulips
Total number of

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
- Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.
- Jackson buys 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips.

Step 1: Calculate the number of rows of red tulips.
Number of red tulips = 36
Number of red tulips per row = 6
Number of rows of red tulips = 36 ÷ 6 = 6 rows

Step 2: Calculate the number of rows of blue tulips.
Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of blue tulips per row = 8
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 ÷ 8 = 3 rows

Step 3: Calculate the total number of rows of flowers.
Total number of rows = Number of rows of red tulips + Number of rows of blue tulips
Total number of rows = 6 + 3 = 9 rows

Therefore, Jackson will plant a total of 9 rows of flowers.
