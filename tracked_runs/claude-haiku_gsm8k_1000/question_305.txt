Question:
Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens and also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red. If each pack has 5 pens, how many pens does Alain have?


Reference Answer:
Alain has a total of 5 x 5= <<5*5=25>>25 red pens.
And he has a total of 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 packs of black pens.
So, the total number of black pens he has is 10 x 5 = <<10*5=50>>50.
Therefore, the total number of pens he has is 50 + 25= <<50+25=75>>75.
#### 75

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
- Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens.
- Each pack has 5 pens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of red pens.
Number of red pens = Number of packs × Number of pens per pack
Number of red pens = 5 × 5 = 25 red pens

Step 2: Calculate the number of black pens.
Number of black pens = 2 × Number of red pens
Number of black pens = 2 × 25 = 50 black pens

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pens Alain has.
Total number of pens = Number of red pens + Number of black pens
Total number of pens = 25 + 50 = 75 pens

Therefore, Alain has a total of 75 pens.

Final answer: Alain has 75 pens.
