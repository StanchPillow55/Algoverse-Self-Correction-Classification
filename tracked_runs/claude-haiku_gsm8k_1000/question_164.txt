Question:
A fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. He sold all of them at a profit of 25%. How much was each watermelon sold?


Reference Answer:
The fruit vendor's profit for the 50 watermelons was $80 x 25/100 = $<<80*25/100=20>>20.
So, he was able to sell them all for $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100.
Thus, the vendor sold each watermelon for $100/$50 = $<<100/50=2>>2 each.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.
- The vendor sold all the watermelons at a profit of 25%.

To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons.
Total cost price = $80
Profit percentage = 25%
Profit amount = Total cost price × Profit percentage
Profit amount = $80 × 0.25 = $20
Total selling price = Total cost price + Profit amount
Total selling price = $80 + $20 = $100

Step 2: Calculate the selling price of each watermelon.
Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50 = $2

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

Final answer: Each watermelon was sold for $2.
