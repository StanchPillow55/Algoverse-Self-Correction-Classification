Question ID: 507

Question:
Janet takes two bus trips five days a week. If each bus trip costs her $2.20, how much would she save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20?


Reference Answer:
First find the total number of trips Janet takes during the week: 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = <<2*5=10>>10 trips/week
Then multiply this number by the cost per trip to find her current weekly spending: 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $<<10*2.20=22>>22/week
Then subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from this number to find her savings: $22/week - $20/week = $<<22-20=2>>2

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without a weekly pass and then compare it to the cost of the weekly pass to determine the savings.

Given information:
- Janet takes two bus trips five days a week.
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without a weekly pass.
Number of bus trips per day = 2
Number of days per week = 5
Cost per bus trip = $2.20
Total cost per week = Number of bus trips per day × Number of days per week × Cost per bus trip
Total cost per week = 2 × 5 × $2.20 = $22.00

Step 2: Calculate the savings by buying a weekly bus pass.
Cost of weekly bus pass = $20
Total cost without weekly pass = $22.00
Savings = Total cost without weekly pass - Cost of weekly bus pass
Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Janet takes two bus trips five days a week.
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips per week without the weekly pass.
Cost per bus trip = $2.20
Number of bus trips per day = 2
Number of days per week = 5
Total cost per week = 2 trips/day × $2.20/trip × 5 days/week = $22.00

Step 2: Calculate the savings by buying the weekly bus pass.
Cost of weekly bus pass = $20.00
Total cost without weekly pass = $22.00
Savings = Total cost without weekly pass - Cost of weekly pass
Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass for $20.

Final answer: Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass for $20.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Janet takes two bus trips five days a week.
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips per week without the weekly pass.
Cost per bus trip = $2.20
Number of bus trips per day = 2
Number of days per week = 5
Total cost per week = 2 trips/day × $2.20/trip × 5 days/week = $22.00

Step 2: Calculate the savings by buying the weekly bus pass.
Cost of weekly bus pass = $20.00
Total cost without weekly pass = $22.00
Savings = Total cost without weekly pass - Cost of weekly pass
Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass for $20 instead of paying for individual bus trips.

Final answer: Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass.
