Question ID: 310

Question:
Theo has $6000 he wishes to spend on his upcoming business trip to South Africa. He buys 6 business suits at $100 each, 3 suitcases at $50 each, a flight ticket that costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. He wishes to save $2000 for this trip, how much does he have to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa?


Reference Answer:
Theo buys business suits for 6 suits * $100/suit = $<<6*100=600>>600.
Theo buys suitcases for 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $<<3*50=150>>150.
Theo buys a flight ticket that costs $700 + 5 * $100 = $<<700+5*100=1200>>1200.
Theo can spend $6000 - $600 - $150 - $1200 - $2000 = $<<6000-600-150-1200-2000=2050>>2050 on gifts for his friends.
