Question:
Chatty prepared three dozen eggs for her four children's Easter activity. Assuming each child gets the same number of eggs, how many eggs does each child receive?


Reference Answer:
Chatty prepared 3 dozen x 12 eggs/dozen = <<3*12=36>>36 eggs.
Since all four children receive the same number of eggs, each child gets 36 eggs / 4 children = <<36/4=9>>9 eggs/child
#### 9

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Chatty prepared three dozen eggs.
- Chatty has four children.
- Each child should receive the same number of eggs.

Step 1: Convert three dozen eggs to the total number of eggs.
1 dozen = 12 eggs
3 dozen = 3 × 12 = 36 eggs

Step 2: Divide the total number of eggs by the number of children to find the number of eggs each child receives.
Total number of eggs = 36
Number of children = 4
Number of eggs each child receives = 36 ÷ 4 = 9 eggs

Therefore, each child receives 9 eggs.

Final answer: Each child receives 9 eggs.
