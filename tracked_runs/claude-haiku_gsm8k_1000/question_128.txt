Question:
Rory makes a cake that weighs 20 ounces. She cuts into 8 pieces. Rory and her mom each have a piece. How much does the remaining cake weigh?


Reference Answer:
Each piece of Rory’s cake weighs 20 ounces / 8 pieces = <<20/8=2.5>>2.5 ounces.
If Rory and her mom each have a slice, they will have eaten 2.5 ounces + 2.5 ounces = <<2.5+2.5=5>>5 ounces.
The rest of the cake weighs 20 ounces – 5 ounces = <<20-5=15>>15 ounces.
#### 15

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The cake weighs 20 ounces.
- The cake is cut into 8 pieces.
- Rory and her mom each have one piece.

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to calculate the weight of the two pieces that were taken.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of one piece of the cake.
Weight of the cake / Number of pieces = Weight of one piece
20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece

Step 2: Calculate the weight of the two pieces that were taken.
Weight of one piece × Number of pieces taken = Weight of the pieces taken
2.5 ounces × 2 pieces = 5 ounces

Step 3: Calculate the weight of the remaining cake.
Weight of the cake - Weight of the pieces taken = Weight of the remaining cake
20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces

Therefore, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

Final answer: The remaining cake weighs
