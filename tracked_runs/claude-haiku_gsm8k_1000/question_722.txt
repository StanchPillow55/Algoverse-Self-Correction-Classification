Question ID: 1317

Question:
Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. They have a total of 70 legs, all together. How many of the animals are chickens?


Reference Answer:
Let C be the number of chickens.
There are 20-C cows.
The cows have 4*(20-C) legs.
The cows have 2C legs.
The total number of legs is 2C+4(20-C)=70.
2C+80-4C=70
2C=10
C=<<5=5>>5

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the total number of animals and the total number of legs to determine the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.

Given information:
- Farmer Brown has a total of 20 animals on his farm.
- The animals are either chickens or cows.
- The total number of legs of all the animals is 70.

Step 1: Understand the problem.
Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs.

Let's represent the number of chickens as x and the number of cows as (20 - x).

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the total number of legs.
Total number of legs = (Number of chickens × 2) + (Number of cows × 4)
70 = (x × 2) + ((20 - x) × 4)

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
70 = 2x + 80 - 4x
70 = -2x + 80
-2x = -10
x = 5
