Question ID: 44

Question:
Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles.  For every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 tapered candles.  One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 in supplies.   If he sells each candle for $2.00 each, what is his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles?


Reference Answer:
1 pound of beeswax and the wick make 10 candles and he wants to make 20 candles so he needs 20/10 = <<20/10=2>>2 pounds of beeswax
1 pound of beeswax costs $10.00 and he needs 2 pounds so his supplies will cost 10*2 = $<<10*2=20.00>>20.00
He wants to sell each candle for $2.00 each and he's selling 20 candles so that's 2*20 = $<<2*20=40.00>>40.00
If he makes $40.00 selling candles and his supplies cost $20.00 then his net profit is 40-20 = $<<40-20=20.00>>20.00

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Charlie can make 10 tapered candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
- 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 in supplies.
- Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
- Charlie makes and sells 20 candles.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of supplies for 20 candles.
Since 1 pound of beeswax can make 10 candles, we need 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.
Total cost of supplies = 2 pounds of beeswax × $10.00 per pound = $20.00

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
Total revenue = 20 candles × $2.00 per candle = $40.00

Step 3: Calculate the net profit.
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost of supplies
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

Therefore
