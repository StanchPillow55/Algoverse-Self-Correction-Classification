Question ID: 410

Question:
Sally went to the seashore for vacation.  Her parents gave her $10 to buy whatever she wanted.  At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for "Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."  She scooped up 2 pounds.  She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each.  How much money does Sally have left?


Reference Answer:
Taffy is buying 1 pound for $3 and gets 1 pound half off. So 1/2 off of 1 pound is $3/2 = $1.50+$3.00=$4.50
4 magnets at $0.25 each is 4*.25=$<<4*0.25=1.00>>1.00
When you add all her purchases, $4.50+$1.50+$1.00 = $<<4.5+1.5+1=7.00>>7.00
She had $10 and spent $7 so she had $10-$7 = $<<10-7=3.00>>3.00 left over
