Question ID: 919

Question:
To raise money for their class fund, each of the 30 students from one class sold lollipops that cost $0.8 per lollypop. On average, each student sold 10 lollipops. If they bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, how much money was the class able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops?


Reference Answer:
The class got $0.8 - $0.5 = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3 profit from each lollipop.
So each student raised $0.3 x 10 = $<<0.3*10=3>>3 from selling 10 lollipops.
Therefore, they were able to raise a total of $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90.
#### 90

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 30 students in the class.
- Each lollipop costs $0.8 to sell.
- On average, each student sold 10 lollipops.
- The class bought the lollipops for $0.5 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
Total number of lollipops sold = Number of students × Average number of lollipops sold per student
Total number of lollipops sold = 30 × 10 = 300 lollipops

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
Total revenue = Total number of lollipops sold × Selling price per lollipop
Total revenue = 300 × $0.8 = $240

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
Total cost = Total number of lollipops sold × Cost price per lollipop
Total cost = 300 × $0.5 = $150
