Question ID: 65

Question:
Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and reads for half as long.  He does this 3 times a week.  How many hours does he spend on TV and reading in 4 weeks?


Reference Answer:
He reads for 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 hour a night
So he spends 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 hours on these activities
That means he spends 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 hours a week on them
So in 4 weeks, he spends 9*4=<<9*4=36>>36 hours on these activities

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
- He then reads for half as long as he watched TV.
- He does this 3 times a week.
- We need to find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the time spent on reading per day.
Time spent on reading = 1/2 × Time spent on TV
Time spent on reading = 1/2 × 2 hours = 1 hour

Step 2: Calculate the total time spent on TV and reading per day.
Total time per day = Time spent on TV + Time spent on reading
Total time per day = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total time spent on TV and reading per week.
Total time per week = Total time per day × Number of days per week
Total time per week = 3 hours × 3 days = 9 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long, which is 1 hour.
3. He does this 3 times a week.
4. So in 1 week, he spends:
   - 2 hours watching TV
   - 1 hour reading
   - Total of 3 hours per week

5. Now, we need to find the total for 4 weeks:
   - 3 hours per week x 4 weeks = 12 hours

Therefore, the total number of hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 12 hours.
