Question:
Ben bought a car for $20000 in 2007. The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. Find the price of the car in the year 2010.


Reference Answer:
The price of the car depreciates of 20000 * 21% = $<<20000*21*.01=4200>>4200 per year.
Ben had the car for 2010 - 2007 = <<2010-2007=3>>3 years.
The price of the car depreciates 4200 * 3 = $<<4200*3=12600>>12600 from 2007 to 2010.
So the price of the car in the year 2010 is $20000 - $12600 = $<<20000-12600=7400>>7400.
#### 7400

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the depreciation of the car over the given time period and then subtract it from the original price to find the price of the car in 2010.

Given information:
- Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007.
- The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.
- We need to find the price of the car in 2010.

Step 1: Calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.
The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

Depreciation from 2007 to 2008 = 21% of $20,000 = $4,200
Depreciation from 2008 to 2009 = 21% of ($20,000 - $4,200) = $3,318
Depreciation from 2009 to 2010 = 21% of ($20,000 - $4,200 - $3,318) = $2,621

Total depreciation from 2007 to 2010

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007.
- The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.
- We need to find the price of the car in the year 2010.

Step 1: Calculate the price of the car in 2008.
Price in 2008 = Price in 2007 × (1 - Depreciation rate)
Price in 2008 = $20,000 × (1 - 0.21)
Price in 2008 = $20,000 × 0.79
Price in 2008 = $15,800

Step 2: Calculate the price of the car in 2009.
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 × (1 - Depreciation rate)
Price in 2009 = $15,800 × (1 - 0.21)
Price in 2009 = $15,800 × 0.79
Price in 2009 = $

Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007.
- The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.
- We need to find the price of the car in the year 2010.

Step 1: Calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2008.
Depreciation rate = 21% per year
Depreciation in 2008 = $20,000 × 0.21 = $4,200
Price of the car in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Step 2: Calculate the depreciation of the car from 2008 to 2009.
Depreciation in 2009 = $15,800 × 0.21 = $3,318
Price of the car in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Step 3: Calculate the depreciation of the car from 2009 to 2010
