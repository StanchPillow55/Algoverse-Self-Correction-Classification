Question ID: 53

Question:
A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?


Reference Answer:
On Thursday the mechanic charged a total of 6*60 + 4*40 = $<<6*60+4*40=520>>520.
On Friday the mechanic charged a total of 12*40 = $<<12*40=480>>480.
Thus, on Thursday, the day with higher revenue, the mechanic had 520-480 = $<<520-480=40>>40 more revenue than on Friday.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the revenue earned by the mechanic on Thursday and Friday, and then find the difference between the higher revenue day and the lower revenue day.

Given information:
- The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire repaired and $40 for each car tire repaired.
- On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.
- On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.

Step 1: Calculate the revenue earned on Thursday.
Revenue from truck tires = 6 × $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires = 4 × $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

Step 2: Calculate the revenue earned on Friday.
Revenue from truck tires = 0 × $60 = $0
Revenue from car tires = 12 × $40 = $480
Total revenue on Friday = $0 + $480 = $480

Step 3: Determine the day with the higher revenue.
