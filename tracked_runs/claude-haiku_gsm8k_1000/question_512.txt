Question:
Kim has started his own housekeeping business and is calculating how much profit he will make from his clients. He already has 3 clients, but is talking to another 5 potential clients and feels confident enough to include them in his calculations. Each client’s home will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean. Bottles of bleach will cost $2 each and packs of cloths will cost $5 each. These are his only expenses. He calculates that his total income each week will be $92. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so how much profit, in dollars, will Lucas make each week?


Reference Answer:
Lucas counts a total of 3 confirmed clients + 5 potential clients = <<3+5=8>>8 clients.
Each week, he will need a total of 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client = <<8*2=16>>16 bottles of bleach.
Each week, he will also need a total of 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client = <<8*1=8>>8 packs of cloths.
The bottles of bleach will cost him 16 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle of bleach = $<<16*2=32>>32.
The packs of cloths will cost him 8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack of cloths = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So each week, Lucas' total expenses will be $32 for bleach + $40 for packs of cloths = $<<32+40=72>>72.
His profit will therefore be $92 total income - $72 total expenses = $<<92-72=20>>20.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total expenses and the total income, and then find the difference between them to determine the weekly profit.

Given information:
- Kim has 3 existing clients and is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Each client's home needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths.
- Bottles of bleach cost $2 each, and packs of cloths cost $5 each.
- Kim's total income each week is $92.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of clients.
Total number of clients = 3 existing clients + 5 potential clients = 8 clients

Step 2: Calculate the total expenses per week.
Expenses for bleach:
Total bottles of bleach needed = 8 clients × 2 bottles per client = 16 bottles
Total cost of bleach = 16 bottles × $2 per bottle = $32

Expenses for cloths:
Total packs of cloths needed = 8 clients × 1 pack per client = 8 packs
Total cost of cloths = 8 packs × $5

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Kim has 3 current clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so he has a total of 8 clients.
2. Each client's home needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
3. The cost of 2 bottles of bleach is $2 x 2 = $4 per client.
4. The cost of 1 pack of cloths is $5 per client.
5. The total expense per client is $4 + $5 = $9.
6. With 8 clients, the total weekly expenses are 8 x $9 = $72.
7. Kim's total weekly income is $92.
8. The profit is the difference between the total income and total expenses.
9. Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses
10. Profit = $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, the profit that Kim will make each week is $20.
