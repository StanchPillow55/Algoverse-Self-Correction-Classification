Question ID: 191

Question:
Ducks need to eat 3.5 pounds of insects each week to survive. If there is a flock of ten ducks, how many pounds of insects do they need per day?


Reference Answer:
The flock needs 35 pounds per week because 10 x 3.5 = <<10*3.5=35>>35
They need 5 pounds per day because 35 / 7 = <<35/7=5>>5

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of insects required by the flock of ten ducks per week and then divide it by the number of days in a week to get the daily requirement.

Given information:
- Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive.
- There is a flock of ten ducks.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of insects required by the flock per week.
Total insects required per week = Number of ducks × Insects required per duck per week
Total insects required per week = 10 × 3.5 pounds = 35 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the amount of insects required per day.
Insects required per day = Total insects required per week / Number of days in a week
Insects required per day = 35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

Final answer: The flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.
