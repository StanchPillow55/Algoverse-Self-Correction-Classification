Question:
Rita hand-picks Junebugs off of her plants every summer.  On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.  On both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday.  Thursday she removed 48 and on Friday she removed 57.  What is the average number of Junebugs that she removes per day?


Reference Answer:
On both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as the 39 on Monday so she removed 2*39 = <<2*39=78>>78 Junebugs
All total she has removed 39+78+78+48+57 = <<39+78+78+48+57=300>>300 Junebugs
She has removed 300 Junebugs over 5 days so she has removed, on average 300/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 Junebugs per day

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of Junebugs removed by Rita over the five-day period and then calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day.

Given information:
- On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
- On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday.
- On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
- On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Step 1: Calculate the number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 2 × 39 = 78 Junebugs per day
Total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 78 × 2 = 156 Junebugs

Step 2: Calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five-day period.
Total Junebugs removed = Junebugs removed on Monday + Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday + Junebugs removed on

Given information:
- On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
- On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday.
- On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
- On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Step 1: Calculate the number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 2 × 39 = 78 Junebugs each day

Step 2: Calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the 5 days.
Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

Step 3: Calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day.
Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
Average Junebugs removed per day = 300 /
