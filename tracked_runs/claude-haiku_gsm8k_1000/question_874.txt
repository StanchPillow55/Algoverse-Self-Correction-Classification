Question ID: 296

Question:
Each person in a certain household consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal. Supposing 5 members of the household eat rice every lunch and dinner, how many weeks will a 42 kg bag of rice last?


Reference Answer:
Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.
So, the 5 members consume 0.4 kg/day/person x 5 people = <<0.4*5=2>>2 kg of rice per day.
In a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14kg of rice.
Thus, 42 kg of rice will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = <<42/14=3>>3 weeks.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of rice consumed by the household per day and then calculate how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

Given information:
- Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal.
- There are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day.
Rice consumed per person per meal = 0.2 kg
Number of meals per day = 2 (lunch and dinner)
Number of people = 5
Total rice consumed per day = 0.2 kg × 2 meals × 5 people = 2 kg

Step 2: Calculate the number of days the 42 kg bag of rice will last.
Total rice in the bag = 42 kg
Rice consumed per day = 2 kg
Number of days the bag will last = 42 kg ÷ 2 kg per day = 21 days

Step 3: Convert the number of days to weeks.
Number of days = 21 days
Number of weeks = 21

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each person in the household consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal.
- There are 5 members in the household who eat rice for every lunch and dinner.

To find how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total rice consumption per day and then divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption.

Step 1: Calculate the total rice consumption per day.
Rice consumption per person per meal = 0.2 kg
Number of meals per day = 2 (lunch and dinner)
Number of people = 5
Total rice consumption per day = 0.2 kg × 2 meals × 5 people = 2 kg

Step 2: Calculate the number of days the 42 kg bag of rice will last.
Total amount of rice = 42 kg
Daily rice consumption = 2 kg
Number of days the rice will last = 42 kg ÷ 2 kg per day = 21 days

Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks the 42

- There are 5 members in the household who eat rice for lunch and dinner.
- The household has a 42 kg bag of rice.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day.
Rice consumed per person per meal = 0.2 kg
Number of meals per day = 2 (lunch and dinner)
Total rice consumed per person per day = 0.2 kg × 2 = 0.4 kg
Total rice consumed by 5 people per day = 0.4 kg × 5 = 2 kg

Step 2: Calculate the number of days the 42 kg bag of rice will last.
Total rice in the bag = 42 kg
Rice consumed per day = 2 kg
Number of days the rice will last = 42 kg ÷ 2 kg per day = 21 days

Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks the 42 kg bag of rice
