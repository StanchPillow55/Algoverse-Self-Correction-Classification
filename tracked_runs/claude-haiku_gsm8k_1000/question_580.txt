Question ID: 718

Question:
100 people apply for a job at Google. Of the people that apply, only 30% receive interviews. Of those who receive interviews, 20% receive a job offer. Of those who receive a job offer, a third of the people accept the position. How many people accept the position?


Reference Answer:
The number of people that receive interviews is 100 * 0.30 = <<100*0.30=30>>30 people
The number of people that receive a job offer is 30 * 0.20 = <<30*0.20=6>>6 people
The number of people that accept the position is 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 people

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- 100 people apply for a job at Google.
- 30% of the applicants receive interviews.
- 20% of the interviewees receive a job offer.
- One-third of the people who receive a job offer accept the position.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people who receive interviews.
Number of people who receive interviews = 30% of 100 people
Number of people who receive interviews = 0.30 × 100 = 30 people

Step 2: Calculate the number of people who receive a job offer.
Number of people who receive a job offer = 20% of 30 people
Number of people who receive a job offer = 0.20 × 30 = 6 people

Step 3: Calculate the number of people who accept the position.
Number of people who accept the position = One-third of 6 people
Number of people who accept the position = 1/3 × 6 = 2 people

Therefore, the final answer is that 2
