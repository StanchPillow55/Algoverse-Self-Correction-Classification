Question ID: 1259

Question:
Derrick has a bakery that makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, selling at $2 per doughnut. How much money does Derrick make in June if he sells all the doughnuts?


Reference Answer:
A dozen doughnuts have 12 doughnuts, and if Derrick makes 10 dozen in a day, the total number of doughnuts he makes is 10*12 = <<10*12=120>>120 doughnuts.
Since each doughnut sells at $2 per piece, Derrick makes 120*$2 = $<<120*2=240>>240 per day from selling his doughnuts.
In June, with 30 days, after making and selling the doughnuts every day, Derrick makes $240*30 = $<<30*240=7200>>7200
#### 7200

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Derrick's bakery makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day.
- Derrick sells each doughnut for $2.
- We need to find how much money Derrick makes in June.

Step 1: Convert the number of doughnuts made per day from dozens to individual doughnuts.
1 dozen = 12 doughnuts
10 dozen doughnuts per day = 10 × 12 = 120 doughnuts per day

Step 2: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
June has 30 days.
Total doughnuts made in June = 120 doughnuts per day × 30 days = 3,600 doughnuts

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue Derrick makes by selling all the doughnuts.
Revenue per doughnut = $2
Total revenue in June = 3,600 doughnuts × $2 per doughnut = $7,200

Therefore,
