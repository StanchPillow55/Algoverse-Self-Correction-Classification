Question:
The employees of Google went on a day trip. 4 buses were rented that have the capacity of holding 60 employees. 6 minibusses that can hold 30 employees, and 10 minivans that can hold 15 employees. How many employees can join the day trip?


Reference Answer:
60 x 4 = <<60*4=240>>240 employees can ride on the bus.
30 x 6 = <<30*6=180>>180 employees can ride on the minibusses.
15 x 10 = <<15*10=150>>150 employees can ride on the minivans.
Therefore 240 + 180 + 150 = <<240+180+150=570>>570 employees can join the day trip.
#### 570

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of employees that can be accommodated on the day trip.

Given information:
- 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each
- 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each
- 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each

Step 1: Calculate the total capacity of the buses.
Capacity of buses = 4 buses × 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

Step 2: Calculate the total capacity of the minibusses.
Capacity of minibusses = 6 minibusses × 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

Step 3: Calculate the total capacity of the minivans.
Capacity of minivans = 10 minivans × 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Step 4: Calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.
Total capacity = Capacity of buses + Capacity of minibusses + Capacity of minivans
Total capacity = 240 + 180 + 150 = 570
