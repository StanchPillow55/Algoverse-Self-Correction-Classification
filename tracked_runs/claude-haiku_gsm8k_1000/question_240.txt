Question ID: 1306

Question:
Dr. Hugo Grumpus and his assistant, Igor, were preparing to perform a laboratory experiment.  Dr. Grumpus told Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes, and to place them all on the lab bench.  By accident, Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, two more than the number of Petri dishes requested.  And while he had picked up the correct number of beakers, he lost several on the way to the lab bench.  In total, the number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.  How many beakers did Igor lose?


Reference Answer:
On the lab bench, there were half of the requested number of test tubes, or 16/2=<<16/2=8>>8 test tubes.
On the lab bench, there were 14+2=<<14+2=16>>16 Petri dishes.
Since the remaining items on the bench were beakers, there were 29-8-16=<<29-8-16=5>>5 beakers on the lab bench.
Thus, Igor lost 7-5=<<7-5=2>>2 beakers.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of beakers that Igor lost on the way to the lab bench.

Given information:
- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes.
- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, two more than the number of Petri dishes requested.
- Igor had the correct number of beakers, but lost several on the way to the lab bench.
- The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Step 1: Find the number of test tubes Igor gathered.
Number of test tubes requested = 16
Number of test tubes Igor gathered = 16 / 2 = 8

Step 2: Find the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered.
Number of Petri dishes requested = 14
Number of Petri dishes Igor gathered = 14 + 2 = 16

Step 3: Find the total number of items Igor gathered.
Total items gathered = Number of test tubes + Number of beakers + Number of Petri dishes
Total items gathered = 8 + 7

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes.
- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, two more than the number of Petri dishes requested.
- Igor lost several beakers on the way to the lab bench.
- The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Step 1: Calculate the number of test tubes Igor gathered.
Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many.
Number of test tubes Igor gathered = 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes

Step 2: Calculate the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered.
Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, and Igor gathered two more than that.
Number of Petri dishes Igor gathered = 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes

Step 3: Calculate the number of beakers Igor gathered.
Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, and Igor lost

Number of Petri dishes Igor gathered = 14 + 2 = 16

Step 3: Calculate the total number of items Igor gathered.
Total items gathered = Number of test tubes + Number of beakers + Number of Petri dishes
Total items gathered = 8 + 7 + 16 = 31
