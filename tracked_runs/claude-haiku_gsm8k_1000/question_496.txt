Question:
Russell orders his favorite bagels online.  Each pack of bagels costs $10.00 and has 9 bagels in the pack.  If he orders 4 packs of bagels, he will receive a 10% discount.  After ordering 4 bags, how much will each single bagel cost?


Reference Answer:
He orders 4 packs of bagels and each pack costs $10.00 so that's 4*10 = $<<4*10=40.00>>40.00
He orders 4 packs at $40.00 and receives a 10% discount so his discount is 40*.10 = $4.00
The bagels cost $40.00 and he has a $4.00 discount making his total 40-4 = $<<40-4=36.00>>36.00
Each pack of bagels has 9 bagels per pack and he orders 4 packs so that's 9*4 = <<9*4=36>>36 bagels
His order total was $36.00 and there are 36 bagels so each bagel costs 36/36 = $<<36/36=1.00>>1.00

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Each pack of bagels costs $10.00 and has 9 bagels in the pack.
- Russell orders 4 packs of bagels.
- He will receive a 10% discount on the total order.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
Total cost without discount = 4 packs × $10.00 per pack = $40.00

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.
Discount amount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 × $40.00 = $4.00

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the order with the 10% discount.
Total cost with discount = Total cost without discount - Discount amount
Total cost with discount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Step 4: Calculate the number of bagels Russell will receive.
Number of bagels = 4 packs × 9 bagels per pack = 36 bagels

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each pack of bagels costs $10.00 and has 9 bagels in the pack.
- Russell orders 4 packs of bagels.
- He will receive a 10% discount on the total order.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
Total cost without discount = 4 packs × $10.00 per pack = $40.00

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.
Discount amount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 × $40.00 = $4.00

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the order with the 10% discount.
Total cost with discount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Step 4: Calculate the number of bagels Russell will receive.
Number of bagels = 4 packs × 9 bagels per pack = 36 bagels

Step 5: Calculate the cost per single bagel.
