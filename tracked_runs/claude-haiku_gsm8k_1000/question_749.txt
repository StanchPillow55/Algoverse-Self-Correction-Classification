Question:
Morisette and Kael were asked to bring fruits. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, while Kael brought twice the amount of apples and half the number of oranges than Morisette. How many fruits do they have in total?


Reference Answer:
Kael brought 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 apples.
And he also brought 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 oranges.

Total apples = Morisette's apples + Kael's apples = 5 + 10 = 15 apples
Total oranges = Morisette's oranges + Kael's oranges = 8 + 4 = 12 oranges
Total fruits = Total apples + Total oranges = 15 + 12 = 27 fruits

Therefore, the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael have
