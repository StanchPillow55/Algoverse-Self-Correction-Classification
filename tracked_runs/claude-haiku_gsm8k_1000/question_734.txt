Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance James runs in a week and then calculate the time it takes him to run that distance.

Given information:
- James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week.
- James runs 10 miles per hour.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance James runs in a week.
Distance per day = 12 miles
Number of days per week = 5 days
Total distance per week = Distance per day × Number of days per week
Total distance per week = 12 miles × 5 days = 60 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes James to run the total distance in a week.
Speed = 10 miles per hour
Total distance per week = 60 miles
Time = Total distance per week / Speed
Time = 60 miles / 10 miles per hour = 6 hours

Therefore, James runs for 6 hours a week.

Final answer: James runs for 6 hours a week.
