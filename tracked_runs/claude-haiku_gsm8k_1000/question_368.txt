Question ID: 993

Question:
An airport has only 2 planes that fly multiple times a day. Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?


Reference Answer:
The second plane flies half as much as the first, so the first plane makes 44 flights * 2 = <<44*2=88>>88 flights a day.
If 3/4 of the first plane’s flights are to Greece, then flights to France or Germany make up 1 – 3/4 = 1/4 of the total daily flights.
Therefore, 88 daily flights / 4 = <<88/4=22>>22 flights to France or Germany.
Splitting these flights equally means the first plane makes 22 flights / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 flights to France in one day.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day and then calculate the number of flights to France.

Given information:
- The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
- The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.
- The second plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day.

Step 1: Find the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day.
Let the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day be x.
Three-quarters of the flights go to Greece, so the number of flights to Greece is 3/4 × x.
The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to each is (1/4 × x) / 2 = 1/8 × x.

The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
Therefore, 2 × 44 = x
x = 88 flights

Step 2: Calculate the number of flights to

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first plane has multiple flights per day.
2. Three-quarters of its flights are to Greece, and the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
3. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes.

Let's start by finding the total number of flights the first plane makes per day.

Since the second plane's 44 trips are half the number of the first plane's trips, we can say:
* First plane's total trips = 2 x 44 = 88 trips

Now, we know that three-quarters of the first plane's trips are to Greece, so:
* Trips to Greece = 3/4 x 88 = 66 trips

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so:
* Remaining flights = 1/4 x 88 = 22 flights
* Flights to France = Flights to Germany = 22 / 2 = 11 flights

Therefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in
