Question ID: 629

Question:
James gets a job selling used cars.  He sold 10 cars that cost $25,000 each.  The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars.  He got a 10% commission on the profits.  How much did he make?


Reference Answer:
He sold the car for 25000*10=$<<25000*10=250000>>250,000
Each car was bought for 25,000*.3=$<<25000*.3=7500>>7500
So they bought the cars for 7500*10=$<<7500*10=75000>>75,000
That means the cars had a profit of 250,000-75,000=$<<250000-75000=175000>>175,000
So his commission was 175,000*.1=$<<175000*.1=17500>>17,500
#### 17500

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- James sold 10 cars
- Each car cost $25,000
- The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars
- James got a 10% commission on the profits

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the 10 cars.
Total revenue = Number of cars sold × Price per car
Total revenue = 10 × $25,000 = $250,000

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of acquiring the 10 cars.
Cost per car = 30% of $25,000 = 0.3 × $25,000 = $7,500
Total cost of acquiring the cars = Number of cars × Cost per car
Total cost of acquiring the cars = 10 × $7,500 = $75,000

Step 3: Calculate the total profit from selling the 10 cars.
Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost of acquiring the cars
Total profit = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

Step 4: Calculate James' commission.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- James sold 10 cars
- Each car cost $25,000
- The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars
- James got a 10% commission on the profits

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the 10 cars.
Total revenue = 10 cars × $25,000 per car = $250,000

Step 2: Calculate the total cost to the company to acquire the 10 cars.
Cost to acquire the cars = 30% of $25,000 per car
Cost per car = 0.30 × $25,000 = $7,500
Total cost to acquire 10 cars = 10 cars × $7,500 per car = $75,000

Step 3: Calculate the total profit from selling the 10 cars.
Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost to acquire the cars
Total profit = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

Step 4: Calculate James' commission, which is 10% of the total profit.

Cost to acquire the cars = 30% of $25,000 per car
Cost per car = $25,000 × 0.30 = $7,500
Total cost to acquire 10 cars = 10 cars × $7,500 per car = $75,000

Step 3: Calculate the total profit from selling the 10 cars.
Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost to acquire the cars
Total profit = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000
