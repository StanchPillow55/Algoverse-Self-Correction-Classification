Question ID: 520

Question:
Martha is knitting winter wear for her 3 grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of them. It takes 2 skeins of wool to make a hat, 4 for a scarf, 12 for a sweater, 1 for a pair of mittens, and 2 for a pair of socks. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?


Reference Answer:
A full outfit for each child will require 2 skeins per hat + 4 skeins per scarf + 12 skeins per sweater + 1 skein per pair of mittens + 2 skeins per pair of socks = <<2+4+12+1+2=21>>21 skeins of wool.
So to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 3 * 21 = <<3*21=63>>63 skeins of wool.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of skeins of wool required for all the items Martha wants to make for her three grandchildren.

Given information:
- Martha wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of her 3 grandchildren.
- It takes 2 skeins of wool to make a hat.
- It takes 4 skeins of wool to make a scarf.
- It takes 12 skeins of wool to make a sweater.
- It takes 1 skein of wool to make a pair of mittens.
- It takes 2 skeins of wool to make a pair of socks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of skeins of wool required for each item.
Hats: 3 grandchildren × 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins
Scarves: 3 grandchildren × 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins
Sweaters: 3 grandchildren × 12 skeins per sweater = 36

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Martha is knitting for 3 grandchildren (triplets)
- She wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of them

To calculate the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to find the number of skeins required for each item and then multiply it by the number of grandchildren.

1. Hat:
   - 2 skeins of wool per hat
   - 3 grandchildren
   - Total skeins for hats = 2 x 3 = 6 skeins

2. Scarf:
   - 4 skeins of wool per scarf
   - 3 grandchildren
   - Total skeins for scarves = 4 x 3 = 12 skeins

3. Sweater:
   - 12 skeins of wool per sweater
   - 3 grandchildren
   - Total skeins for sweaters = 12 x 3 = 36 ske
