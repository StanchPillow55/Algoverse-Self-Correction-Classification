Question ID: 28

Question:
Henry made two stops during his 60-mile bike trip. He first stopped after 20 miles. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. How many miles did he travel between his first and second stops?


Reference Answer:
He traveled 20 miles + 15 miles = <<20+15=35>>35 miles not counting the distance between stops.
Henry traveled 60 miles - 35 miles = <<60-35=25>>25 miles between his first and second stop.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops.

Given information:
- Henry's total bike trip was 60 miles.
- He made his first stop after 20 miles.
- His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

Step 1: Find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip.
Distance from second stop to end of trip = 15 miles

Step 2: Find the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip.
Distance from first stop to end of trip = 60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles

Step 3: Find the distance between the first and second stops.
Distance between first and second stops = Distance from first stop to end of trip - Distance from second stop to end of trip
Distance between first and second stops = 40 miles - 15 miles = 25 miles

Therefore, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

Final answer: Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.
