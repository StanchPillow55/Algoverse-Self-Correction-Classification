Question:
Molly is catering a birthday party for her sister and invited 16 people. 10 people want the chicken salad which is $6.50 per person and 6 people want the pasta salad at $6 per person. What is the total amount Molly will pay for the catering?


Reference Answer:
Multiply the number of people who want chicken salad by the cost per person, so the cost is 10 x $6.50 = $<<10*6.5=65>>65.
Multiply the amount of people who want pasta salad by the cost per person, so the cost is 6 x $6.00 = $<<6*6=36>>36.
The total cost of chicken salad and pasta salad is $65 + $36 = $<<65+36=101>>101.
