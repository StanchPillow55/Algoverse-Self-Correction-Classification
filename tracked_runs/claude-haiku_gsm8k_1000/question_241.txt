Question:
Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill.  In each basket she wants to add 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.  The petunias cost $3.00 apiece and the sweet potato vines cost $2.50 apiece.  How much will she spend filling all 5 hanging baskets?


Reference Answer:
The petunia are $3.00 each and she wants 3 per basket so that's 3.00*3 = $<<3*3=9.00>>9.00
The sweet potato vines are $2.50 each and she wants 2 per basket so that's 2.5*2 = $<<2.5*2=5.00>>5.00
For 1 basket, the petunias will cost $9.00 and the sweet potato vines will cost $5.00 for a total of 9+5 = $<<9+5=14.00>>14.00
Each basket will cost $14.00 to fill and she needs to fill 5 baskets for a total of 14*5 = $<<14*5=70.00>>70.00

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill.
2. In each basket, she wants to add:
   - 3 petunias
   - 2 sweet potato vines
3. The petunias cost $3.00 apiece.
4. The sweet potato vines cost $2.50 apiece.

To calculate the total cost, we need to find the cost for each basket and then multiply it by the number of baskets.

Cost per basket:
- 3 petunias x $3.00 = $9.00
- 2 sweet potato vines x $2.50 = $5.00
- Total cost per basket = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00

Total cost for all 5 baskets:
- $14.00 per basket x 5 baskets = $70.00

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00.
