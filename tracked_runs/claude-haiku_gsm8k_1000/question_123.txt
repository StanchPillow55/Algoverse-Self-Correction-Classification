Question ID: 385

Question:
Lisa is part of a choir that has 52 members, 50% of which are boys and 50% of which are girls.  The choir decides to perform with just its female members.  On the day of the performance, however, half the people performing can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down.  The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. How many people sang in the performance?


Reference Answer:
The 50 person choir is 50% female, so if the performance is just women there will be 52/2=26 people performing.
If half of those people can't make it to the performance, then there will be 26/2= <<26/2=13>>13 people performing.
When the 3 teachers decide to participate, the performance now has 13+3=<<13+3=16>>16 people singing.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of girls in the choir.
2. Determine the number of girls who were able to perform on the day of the performance.
3. Add the number of teachers who sang with the choir.
4. Provide the final answer.

Step 1: Calculate the number of girls in the choir.
* The choir has 52 members, with 50% being boys and 50% being girls.
* To find the number of girls, we can divide the total number of members by 2:
* 52 รท 2 = 26 girls

Step 2: Determine the number of girls who were able to perform on the day of the performance.
* On the day of the performance, half the people performing couldn't make it due to a bus breakdown.
* This means that half of the 26 girls were able to perform:
* 26 รท 2 = 13 girls

Step 3: Add the number of teachers who sang with the choir.
* The choir's 3 teachers decided to sing with them.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The choir has 52 members total.
2. 50% of the choir members are boys, and 50% are girls.
   * So, the number of boys and girls are both 26 (52 * 0.5 = 26).
3. The choir decides to perform with just its female members.
   * So, the initial number of performers is 26 (the 26 girls).
4. On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it to the show.
   * So, the number of performers is now 13 (26 * 0.5 = 13).
5. The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them.
   * So, the final number of people who sang in the performance is 16 (13 + 3 = 16).

Therefore, the final answer is 16 people sang in the performance.
