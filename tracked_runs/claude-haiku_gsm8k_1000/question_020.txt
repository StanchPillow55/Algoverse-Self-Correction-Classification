Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jennifer bought 12 oranges from the market.
- She gave 2 oranges each to her three daughters.
- Her only boy got 3 oranges.

Step 1: Calculate the number of oranges given to the daughters.
Number of daughters = 3
Oranges given to each daughter = 2
Total oranges given to the daughters = 3 Ã— 2 = 6 oranges

Step 2: Calculate the number of oranges given to the boy.
Oranges given to the boy = 3

Step 3: Calculate the number of oranges remaining.
Total oranges bought = 12
Oranges given to the daughters = 6
Oranges given to the boy = 3
Oranges remaining = Total oranges bought - Oranges given to daughters - Oranges given to boy
Oranges remaining = 12 - 6 - 3 = 3 oranges

Therefore, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges.

Final answer: Jennifer remained with 3 oranges.
