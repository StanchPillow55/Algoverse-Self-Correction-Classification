Question ID: 437

Question:
Sitti and Juris bought 34 and 22 oranges, respectively. If both of them decide to share them equally with their 6 other friends, how many oranges will everyone get?


Reference Answer:
There are a total of 34 + 22 = <<34+22=56>>56 oranges.
Sitti, Juris, and 6 other friends will divide them equally which means there are 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 of them sharing.
So, each one will get 56 oranges / 8 people = <<56/8=7>>7 oranges/person
#### 7

Response:
Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Sitti bought 34 oranges.
- Juris bought 22 oranges.
- They have 6 other friends they want to share the oranges with.

Step 1: Find the total number of oranges.
Total oranges = Sitti's oranges + Juris' oranges
Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges

Step 2: Find the total number of people who will share the oranges.
Total people = Sitti + Juris + 6 friends = 2 + 6 = 8 people

Step 3: Divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find the number of oranges each person will get.
Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
Oranges per person = 56 / 8 = 7 oranges

Therefore, if Sitti and Juris decide to share the oranges equally with their 6 other friends, each person will get 7 oranges
