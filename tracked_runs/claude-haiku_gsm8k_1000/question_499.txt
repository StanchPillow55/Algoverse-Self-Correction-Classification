Question ID: 834

Question:
Mason is on his bike journey at a rate of 8 miles per hour. He travels for 4 hours, takes some rest, and then goes on for another 6 hours. How many miles has he traveled in total?


Reference Answer:
If Mason travels for 8 miles in one hour, in four hours, he traveled for 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 miles.
After his rest, Mason traveled for another 6 hours, and since he was traveling at 8 miles per hour, he had traveled for 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 miles after the six hours.
For the whole journey, Mason traveled for 32+48 = <<32+48=80>>80 miles.
#### 80

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Mason traveled during his bike journey.

Given information:
- Mason's bike journey rate is 8 miles per hour.
- He travels for 4 hours, takes some rest, and then goes on for another 6 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 hours.
Distance traveled in the first 4 hours = Rate × Time
Distance traveled in the first 4 hours = 8 miles per hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the next 6 hours.
Distance traveled in the next 6 hours = Rate × Time
Distance traveled in the next 6 hours = 8 miles per hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled.
Total distance traveled = Distance traveled in the first 4 hours + Distance traveled in the next 6 hours
Total distance traveled = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles during his bike journey.

Final answer: Mason
