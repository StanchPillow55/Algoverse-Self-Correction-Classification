Question:
Roy has saved 40% more in money earned by chores than his brother Anthony.  Anthony has saved $10.00 more than their sister Eva.   Eva has saved $20.00.  How much money does Roy have?


Reference Answer:
Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva who has $20.00 so he has 10+20 = $<<10+20=30.00>>30.00
Roy has saved 40% more than his brother who has $30.00 so Roy has saved .40*30 = $12.00
All total, Roy has 12.00 more than his brother, so he has 12+30 = $<<12+30=42.00>>42.00

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money Roy has saved based on the given information.

Given information:
- Roy has saved 40% more in money earned by chores than his brother Anthony.
- Anthony has saved $10.00 more than their sister Eva.
- Eva has saved $20.00.

Step 1: Find the amount of money Anthony has saved.
Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Step 2: Find the amount of money Roy has saved.
Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30.00 + (0.40 Ã— $30.00)
Roy's savings = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

Therefore, Roy has $42.00 saved.

Final answer: Roy has $42.00 saved.
