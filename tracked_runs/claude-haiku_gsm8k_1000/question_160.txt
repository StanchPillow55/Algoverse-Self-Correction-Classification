Question ID: 413

Question:
Marcy makes homemade candles that she markets as 99% guaranteed not to explode. 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. If she makes 50000 candles, how many of them will both smell like wet dog and explode?


Reference Answer:
First find what percentage of the candles explode: 100% - 99% = 1%
Then multiply the odds of the candles exploding by the odds of them smelling like wet dog to find the probability of both events happening: 1% * 5% = 0.05%
Then multiply that percentage by the number of candles to find the number of them that have both defects: 0.05% * 50000 candles = <<0.05*.01*50000=25>>25 candles

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and have the potential to explode.

Given information:
- Marcy makes 50,000 candles.
- 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode.
- 5% of the more dangerous candles (1% of the total) have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

Step 1: Find the number of candles that have the potential to explode.
Total number of candles = 50,000
Percentage of candles that are guaranteed not to explode = 99%
Percentage of candles that have the potential to explode = 1%
Number of candles that have the potential to explode = 50,000 × 1% = 500 candles

Step 2: Find the number of candles that smell like wet dog.
Percentage of candles that have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog = 5% of the more dangerous candles (1% of the total)
Number of candles that smell like wet dog = 50,000 × 5%

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Marcy makes 50,000 candles
- 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode
- 5% of the more dangerous candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog

Step 1: Calculate the number of candles that are not guaranteed not to explode.
Total candles - Candles guaranteed not to explode = Candles that may explode
50,000 - (50,000 × 0.99) = 50,000 - 49,500 = 500 candles that may explode

Step 2: Calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog.
Candles that may explode × Percentage of candles with wet dog defect = Candles that smell like wet dog
500 × 0.05 = 25 candles that smell like wet dog

Step 3: Calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and may explode.
Candles that smell like wet dog = 25
Since all the candles that smell like
