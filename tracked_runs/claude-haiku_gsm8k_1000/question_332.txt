Question:
Linus works for a trading company. He buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price. If he bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, how much profit was he able to earn after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday?


Reference Answer:
The total cost for the devices he bought on Monday is 2*20= <<2*20=40>>40
The total cost for the devices he bought on Tuesday is 4*20 = <<4*20=80>>80
The total cost of these devices is 80+40= <<80+40=120>>120
Linus sold each mobile device he bought for $20 x 2 = $<<20*2=40>>40.
So, he earned $40 x 2 = $<<40*2=80>>80 for the two devices he bought last Monday.
And he earned $40 x 4 = $<<40*4=160>>160 for the 4 devices he bought last Tuesday.
The total amount of sales he made were worth 160+80 =<<160+80=240>>240
Linus earned 240-120 =$<<240-120=120>>120

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Linus buys a mobile device for $20.
- Linus sells the mobile device for twice the amount of the original price.
- Linus bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday.

Step 1: Calculate the selling price of each mobile device.
Selling price = 2 × Original price
Selling price = 2 × $20 = $40

Step 2: Calculate the profit per mobile device.
Profit per device = Selling price - Original price
Profit per device = $40 - $20 = $20

Step 3: Calculate the total profit from the devices bought last Monday.
Total profit from Monday = Profit per device × Number of devices bought on Monday
Total profit from Monday = $20 × 2 = $40

Step 4: Calculate the total profit from the devices bought last Tuesday.
Total profit from Tuesday = Profit per device × Number of devices bought on Tuesday
Total profit from Tuesday = $20 × 4 = $80

Step 5: Calculate the total profit

- Linus bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday.

Step 1: Calculate the selling price of each mobile device.
Selling price = 2 × Original price
Selling price = 2 × $20 = $40

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the mobile devices.
Total revenue = Selling price × Total number of devices sold
Total revenue = $40 × (2 + 4) = $40 × 6 = $240

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the mobile devices.
Total cost = Original price × Total number of devices bought
Total cost = $20 × (2 + 4) = $20 × 6 = $120

Step 4: Calculate the total profit.
Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = $240 - $120 = $120

Therefore, Linus was able
