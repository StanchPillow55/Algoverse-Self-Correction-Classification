Question ID: 1290

Question:
A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds and a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.  How many sunflower seeds are there altogether?


Reference Answer:
The small sunflower has 3 x 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 seeds.
The large sunflower has 36 x 50% = <<36*50*.01=18>>18 more seeds than the small sunflower.
The large sunflower has 36 + 18 = <<36+18=54>>54 seeds.
Together, the two sunflowers have a total of 36 + 54 = <<36+54=90>>90 seeds.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds.
- A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.

Step 1: Find the number of seeds in a small sunflower.
1 dozen = 12 seeds
3 dozen = 3 × 12 = 36 seeds

Step 2: Find the number of seeds in a large sunflower.
A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.
50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 × 36 = 18 seeds
Number of seeds in a large sunflower = 36 + 18 = 54 seeds

Step 3: Find the total number of sunflower seeds.
Total number of sunflower seeds = Number of seeds in small sunflower + Number of seeds in large sunflower
Total number of sunflower seeds = 36 + 54 = 90 seeds

Therefore, the total number of sunflower seeds is 90.
