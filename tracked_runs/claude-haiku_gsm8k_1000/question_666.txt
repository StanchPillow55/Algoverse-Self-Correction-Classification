Question:
Sasha and Julie are best friends playing on opposing basketball teams. The teams have two practice games scheduled. In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game. Sasha always struggles during away games and their second match was at Julie's home court. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. How many total points did Sasha score during both games?


Reference Answer:
In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points, and Julie scored four fewer points: 14-4 = <<14-4=10>>10 points.
In the second game, Sasha scored 6 points fewer than Julie's score in the first game, meaning she scored 10-6=<<10-6=4>>4 points.
Sasha scored 10+4=<<10+4=14>>14 points in the two games.
#### 14

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
- In the first game, Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha.
- In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game.

Step 1: Calculate Julie's score in the first game.
Sasha's score in the first game - 4 = Julie's score in the first game
14 - 4 = 10 points

Step 2: Calculate Sasha's score in the second game.
Julie's score in the first game - 6 = Sasha's score in the second game
10 - 6 = 4 points

Step 3: Calculate the total points Sasha scored during both games.
Sasha's score in the first game + Sasha's score in the second game = Total points scored by Sasha
14 + 4 = 18 points

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18 points.
