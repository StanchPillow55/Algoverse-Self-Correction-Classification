Question:
Hunter counted 50 cars packed in their school parking lot when entering class one morning. During the first break, he counted 20 more cars in the parking lot. When he got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. What's the total number of cars he counted during lunch break?


Reference Answer:
During the first break, he saw 20 more cars in the parking lot, which totals 50 + 20 = <<50+20=70>>70 cars
When going for the lunch break, he counted and realized only half the number of cars were present, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break.
2. Calculate the number of cars that left the parking lot during the lunch break.
3. Calculate the total number of cars in the parking lot during the lunch break.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break.
Initial number of cars in the parking lot = 50
Number of additional cars during the first break = 20
Total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break = 50 + 20 = 70

Step 2: Calculate the number of cars that left the parking lot during the lunch break.
Number of cars that left the parking lot = 1/2 of the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break
Number of cars that left the parking lot = 1/2 Ã— 70 = 35

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cars in the parking lot during the lunch break.
Total number of cars in the parking lot during the lunch break = Total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break - Number of cars that
