Question ID: 923

Question:
Lana is brewing cups of tea for her friends. She has 27 cups, and she divides these into 3 rows. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. She then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. How many cups of mint tea are in each row?


Reference Answer:
If there are 15 cups of cinnamon tea, then there are a total of 27 â€“ 15 = <<27-15=12>>12 cups of chamomile or mint tea.
As there are equal amounts of chamomile tea and mint tea, there is a total of 12 cups / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cups of mint tea.
Dividing these into rows shows that each row holds 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 cups of mint tea.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Lana has 27 cups in total.
- She divides the cups into 3 rows.
- In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups.
- The remaining cups are used to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

Step 1: Determine the number of cups in each row.
Total cups / Number of rows = Cups per row
27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row

Step 2: Determine the number of cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row.
Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, we can divide the number of cups per row by 2 to get the number of cups of each type of tea.
Cups per row / 2 = Cups of chamomile and mint tea per row
9 cups per row / 2 = 4.5 cups of chamomile and 4.5 cups of mint tea per row

Step 3: Determine the

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Lana has 27 cups total.
2. She divides these cups into 3 rows.
3. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups.
4. The remaining cups are used to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

To find the number of mint tea cups in each row, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea.
2. Divide that number by 2 to get the number of cups for each type of tea.
3. Divide the number of cups for each type of tea by 3 to get the number in each row.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea.
Total cups - Cinnamon tea cups = Chamomile and mint tea cups
27 - 15 = 12 cups

Step 2: Divide the total chamomile and mint tea cups by 2 to get the number of cups for each type of tea.
12 cups / 2
