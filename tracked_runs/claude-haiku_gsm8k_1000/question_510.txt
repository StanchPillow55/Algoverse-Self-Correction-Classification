Question:
Ford owns a garden and he grows 40 roses every week. He supplies Roses to the local flower shops. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. How many roses does Ford lack to supply all the flower shops every month?


Reference Answer:
The first flower shop needs 20 x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 roses every month.
The second flower shop needs 15 x 4= <<15*4=60>>60 roses every month.
The third flower shop needs 30 x 4 = <<30*4=120>>120 roses every month.
So the total number of roses that all the flower shop needs every month is 120 + 80 + 60 = <<120+80+60=260>>260.
The total roses Ford grows every month is 40 x 4 = <<40*4=160>>160
Therefore, the total number of roses he lacks is 260 - 160 = <<260-160=100>>100 to supply all the flower shops every month.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per week.
2. Calculate the total number of roses ordered by the three flower shops per week.
3. Calculate the difference between the total roses grown and the total roses ordered per week.
4. Convert the weekly difference to a monthly difference.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per week.
Ford grows 40 roses every week.
Total roses grown per week = 40 roses

Step 2: Calculate the total number of roses ordered by the three flower shops per week.
First flower shop orders 20 roses per week.
Second flower shop orders 15 roses per week.
Third flower shop orders 30 roses per week.
Total roses ordered per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the total roses grown and the total roses ordered per week.
Difference = Total roses grown per week - Total roses ordered per week
Difference = 40 - 65 = -25 roses

Step 4: Convert the weekly difference to a monthly difference

Given information:
- Ford grows 40 roses every week.
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses ordered by the three flower shops per week.
Roses ordered by first shop: 20 per week
Roses ordered by second shop: 15 per week
Roses ordered by third shop: 30 per week
Total roses ordered per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Step 2: Calculate the number of roses Ford can supply per week.
Ford grows 40 roses per week.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the roses ordered and the roses supplied per week.
Roses ordered per week: 65
Roses supplied per week: 40
Difference = 65 - 40 = 25 roses

Step 4: Calculate the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Ford grows 40 roses every week.
2. The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week.
3. The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week.
4. The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week.

To find the total number of roses Ford needs to supply per week, we add up the orders from the three flower shops:
* 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week

Now, to find the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to:
* Calculate the total number of roses Ford can supply in a month
* Calculate the total number of roses the flower shops need in a month
* Subtract the number of roses Ford can supply from the number of roses the flower shops need

Ford can supply 40 roses per week, so in a month (4 weeks) he can supply:
* 40 roses/week x 4 weeks = 160 roses per month

The flower shops need 65 roses per week, so in a month (4 weeks) they
