Question:
Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, while Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each. If Peter and Martha have totals of 64 and 56 chocolate bars respectively, how many more chocolate bars does Peter have in each box than Martha?

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 equal boxes so there are 64/4 = <<64/4=16>>16 bars in each box
Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 equal boxes so there are 56/7 = <<56/7=8>>8 bars in each box
Peter has 16-8 = <<16-8=8>>8 bars more than Martha in each box
