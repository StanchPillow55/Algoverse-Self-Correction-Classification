Question:
Jackie grew 3" over the summer.  She is now 2" shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert.  If Albert is 36" tall, how tall was Jackie before summer?


Reference Answer:
Anne is twice the size of Albert, who is 36", so Anne is 2*36 = <<72=72>>72" tall
Anne is 72" tall and Jackie is 2" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72-2 = <<72-2=70>>70" tall
Jackie is currently 70" tall and grew 3" over summer, so before summer she was 70-3= <<70-3=67>>67" tall
#### 67

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jackie grew 3" over the summer.
- Jackie is now 2" shorter than Anne.
- Anne is twice the size of Albert.
- Albert is 36" tall.

Step 1: Find Anne's height.
Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, we can calculate her height as:
Anne's height = 2 × Albert's height
Anne's height = 2 × 36" = 72"

Step 2: Find Jackie's current height.
Jackie is 2" shorter than Anne, so:
Jackie's current height = Anne's height - 2"
Jackie's current height = 72" - 2" = 70"

Step 3: Find Jackie's height before the summer.
We know that Jackie grew 3" over the summer, so:
Jackie's height before the summer = Jackie's current height - 3"
Jackie's height before the summer = 70" - 3" = 67"

Therefore, Jackie was 67" tall before the summer.
