Question:
Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.  In 8 years his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age.  How many years separate the age of the two now?


Reference Answer:
James is 27-5=<<27-5=22>>22 years old
In 8 years he will be 22+8=<<22+8=30>>30 years old
So in 8 years, his cousin will be 30*2-5=<<30*2-5=55>>55
So his cousin is 55-8=<<55-8=47>>47 years old now
So there is a 47-22=<<47-22=25>>25 year gap
#### 25

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the current ages of Jame and his cousin, and then calculate the difference between their ages.

Given information:
- Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
- In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age.

Step 1: Find Jame's current age.
Jame's age in 5 years = 27
Jame's current age = 27 - 5 = 22 years old

Step 2: Find the cousin's age in 8 years.
Cousin's age in 8 years = 2 × Jame's age in 8 years - 5
Jame's age in 8 years = 22 + 8 = 30
Cousin's age in 8 years = 2 × 30 - 5 = 55

Step 3: Find the cousin's current age.
Cousin's current age = 55 - 8 = 47 years old

Step 4: Calculate the difference between Jame's an

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
- In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age.

Step 1: Find Jame's current age.
Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

Step 2: Find Jame's age in 8 years.
Jame's age in 8 years = 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

Step 3: Find the cousin's age in 8 years.
The cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years.
Twice Jame's age in 8 years = 2 × 30 = 60 years old.
The cousin's age in 8 years = 60 - 5 = 55 years old.

Step 4: Find the cousin's current age.
The cousin's age in

The cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years.
Twice Jame's age in 8 years = 2 × 30 = 60 years old.
The cousin's age in 8 years = 60 - 5 = 55 years old.

Step 4: Find the cousin's current age.
