Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- John manufactured 4 wooden tables for $20 each.
- John manufactured 2 roof frames for $10 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the wooden tables.
Cost of 4 wooden tables = 4 × $20 = $80

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the roof frames.
Cost of 2 roof frames = 2 × $10 = $20

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Ali has to pay John.
Total amount = Cost of wooden tables + Cost of roof frames
Total amount = $80 + $20 = $100

Therefore, Ali has to pay John $100.

Final answer: Ali has to pay John $100.
