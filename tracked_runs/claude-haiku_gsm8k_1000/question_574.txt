Jennie is helping at her mom's office. She has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps, and a pile of letters already stamped. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. If there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, how many were in that pile when Jennie began?

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:

Step 3: Calculate the number of letters in the already-stamped pile before Jennie added the 20 letters.
Number of letters in the already-stamped pile before Jennie added 20 = 30 - 20 = 10 letters

Therefore, the number of letters in the already-stamped pile when Jennie began was
