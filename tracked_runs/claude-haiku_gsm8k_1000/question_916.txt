Question ID: 588

Question:
Jared is trying to increase his typing speed. He starts with 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons the next time he tests his typing speed it has increased to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, what will be the average of the three measurements?


Reference Answer:
Jared types at 52 WPM and increases it by 5 WPM, 52 + 5 = <<52+5=57>>57 WPM.
His average over all his measured words-per-minute is 47 + 52 + 57 = <<47+52+57=156>>156.
His total is 156 / 3 typing speeds = <<156/3=52>>52 WPM as Jared's average typing speed.
#### 52

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jared's initial typing speed is 47 words per minute (WPM).
- After some lessons, his typing speed increased to 52 WPM.
- He continues to increase his typing speed by 5 more words.

Step 1: Calculate Jared's final typing speed after the additional 5 words increase.
Final typing speed = 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Step 2: Calculate the average of the three measurements.
Average = (Initial speed + Increased speed + Final speed) / 3
Average = (47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM) / 3
Average = 156 WPM / 3
Average = 52 WPM

Therefore, the average of the three measurements is 52 words per minute (WPM).

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jared's initial typing speed is 47 words per minute (WPM).
- After some lessons, his typing speed increased to 52 WPM.
- He continues to increase his typing speed by 5 more words.

Step 1: Calculate Jared's final typing speed after the additional 5 word increase.
Final typing speed = 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Step 2: Calculate the average of the three typing speed measurements.
Average = (Initial speed + Intermediate speed + Final speed) / 3
Average = (47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM) / 3
Average = 156 WPM / 3
Average = 52 WPM

Therefore, the average of the three typing speed measurements is 52 words per minute.
