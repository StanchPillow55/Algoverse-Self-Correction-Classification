Question ID: 727

Question:
Hannah has a mental breakdown while studying for finals and starts smashing windows in the high school's parking lot. She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows and 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows. If there are 64 students' cars with four windows each and 32 teachers' cars with two windows each, how many windows does Hannah smash?


Reference Answer:
First find how many student cars Hannah smashed: 64 cars * 1/4 = <<64*1/4=16>>16 cars
Then find how many teacher cars Hannah smashed: 32 cars * 3/4 = <<32*3/4=24>>24 cars
Then find how many windows the students' cars had smashed: 16 cars * 4 windows/car = <<16*4=64>>64 windows
Then find how many windows the teachers' cars had smashed: 24 cars * 2 windows/car = <<24*2=48>>48 windows
Then add the number of students' and teachers' windows smashed to find the total number of windows smashed: 64 windows + 48 windows = <<64+48=112>>112 windows
#### 112

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows.
- There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter (1/4) of the students' cars' windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters (3/4) of the teachers' cars' windows.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of windows in the students' cars.
Total windows in students' cars = 64 cars × 4 windows per car = 256 windows

Step 2: Calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes in the students' cars.
Windows smashed in students' cars = 1/4 of 256 windows = 256 × 1/4 = 64 windows

Step 3: Calculate the total number of windows in the teachers' cars.
Total windows in teachers' cars = 32 cars × 2 windows per car = 64 windows

Step 4: Calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes in the teachers' cars.
Windows smashed in teachers'

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Students' cars:
   * There are 64 students' cars
   * Each car has 4 windows
   * Hannah smashes a quarter (1/4) of the students' cars' windows

To calculate the number of students' car windows smashed:
* Total students' car windows = 64 cars x 4 windows per car = 256 windows
* Hannah smashes 1/4 of 256 windows = 256 x 1/4 = 64 windows

2. Teachers' cars:
   * There are 32 teachers' cars
   * Each car has 2 windows
   * Hannah smashes 3/4 of the teachers' cars' windows

To calculate the number of teachers' car windows smashed:
* Total teachers' car windows = 32 cars x 2 windows per car = 64 windows
* Hannah smashes 3/4 of 64 windows = 64 x 3/4 = 48 windows

3. Total windows smashed:
   * Students' car
