Question ID: 739

Question:
Cecelia went to the milk store and found out that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. If a gallon jar costs $5, calculate the total amount of money she spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.


Reference Answer:
If a full gallon costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, then the cost of a half-gallon jar is $5 - $2 = $3
If he bought 10 full gallon jars, she spent 10 jars * $5/jar = $<<10*5=50>>50
For the half-gallon jars, she spent $3/jar * 16 jars = $<<3*16=48>>48
The total amount she spent at the store is $48 + $50 = $<<48+50=98>>98

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- A gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar.
- A gallon jar costs $5.

Step 1: Find the cost of a half-gallon jar.
Since a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar to find the cost of a half-gallon jar.
Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2 = $3

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of 10 gallon jars.
Total cost of 10 gallon jars = 10 × $5 = $50

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars.
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 × $3 = $48

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent.
Total amount spent = Total cost of
