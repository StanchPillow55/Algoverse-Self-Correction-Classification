Question:
The biggest waterslide at Five Flags is 300 feet long, and people slide down at 60 feet/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 80 feet/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?


Reference Answer:
First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = <<300/60=5>>5 minutes
Then find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = <<240/80=3>>3 minutes
Then subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = <<5-3=2>>2 minutes

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes to ride each waterslide and then calculate the difference between the two.

Given information:
- The biggest waterslide is 300 feet long, and people slide down at 60 feet/minute.
- The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long, and people slide down at 80 feet/minute.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest waterslide.
Time to ride the biggest waterslide = Length of the slide / Sliding speed
Time to ride the biggest waterslide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest waterslide.
Time to ride the second biggest waterslide = Length of the slide / Sliding speed
Time to ride the second biggest waterslide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the difference in time between the two slides.
Difference in time = Time to ride the biggest waterslide - Time to ride the second biggest waterslide

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The biggest waterslide is 300 feet long and people slide down at 60 feet/minute.
- The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long and people slide down at 80 feet/minute.

To find how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest slide.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time for biggest slide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time for second biggest slide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Step 3: Find the difference in time between the two slides.
Time difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
Time difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the
