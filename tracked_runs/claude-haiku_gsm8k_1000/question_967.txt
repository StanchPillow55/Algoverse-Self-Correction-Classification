Response:
Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- There are 200 pounds of carrots.
- The carrots are to be distributed to 40 restaurants.
- Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.
Total amount of carrots distributed = Number of restaurants × Amount of carrots per restaurant
Total amount of carrots distributed = 40 × 2 pounds = 80 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the amount of carrots that will not be used.
Amount of carrots not used = Total amount of carrots - Total amount of carrots distributed
Amount of carrots not used = 200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

Therefore, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used.

Final answer: 120 pounds of carrots will not be used.
