Question ID: 670

Question:
Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy after Halloween. If they decide to pool and share their candy equally with each other, how much candy would each of them have?


Reference Answer:
Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy which equals 3 + 5 + 4 = <<3+5+4=12>>12 pounds of candy
Since there are three of them (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron), they divide the candy into 3 equal portions. 12/3 = <<12/3=4>>4 pounds of candy
#### 4

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of candy and then divide it equally among the three of them.

Given information:
- Robert had 3 pounds of candy.
- Cindy had 5 pounds of candy.
- Aaron had 4 pounds of candy.

Step 1: Find the total amount of candy.
Total candy = Robert's candy + Cindy's candy + Aaron's candy
Total candy = 3 pounds + 5 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds

Step 2: Divide the total candy equally among the three of them.
Amount of candy each person would have = Total candy / Number of people
Amount of candy each person would have = 12 pounds / 3 = 4 pounds

Therefore, if Robert, Cindy, and Aaron decide to pool and share their candy equally, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy.

Final answer: Each person would have 4 pounds of candy.
