Question:
Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. If Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, and Dora is 15 years old, calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.


Reference Answer:
If Dora's age is 15, her father, with eight more than twice Dora's age, is eight more than 15*2 = <<15*2=30>>30 years.
This means Dora's father is 30+8 = <<30+8=38>>38 years old.
Together, Dora and her father have a total age of 38+15 =<<38+15=53>>53.
Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, meaning Dora's mother is 38-4 = 34 years old.
Altogether, Dora's family has a total age of 53+34 = <<53+34=87>>87 years.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
- Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
- Dora is 15 years old.

Step 1: Find Dora's father's age.
Dora's father's age = 2 × Dora's age + 8
Dora's father's age = 2 × 15 + 8 = 38 years old

Step 2: Find Dora's mother's age.
Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4
Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years old

Step 3: Calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years old

Therefore,
