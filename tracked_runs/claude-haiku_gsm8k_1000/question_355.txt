Question ID: 1082

Question:
James decided to walk to the store.  When he got halfway there he realized he forgot something at home and had to walk back.  If his home is 4 miles from the store and he walks 4 miles per hour how long did it take him to reach the store?


Reference Answer:
He walked 4/2=<<4/2=2>>2 miles there before turning around
So in total he walked 2+2+4=<<2+2+4=8>>8 miles, he walked 2 miles to the halfway point than 2 miles home.
That means it took him 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 hours

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- James' home is 4 miles from the store.
- James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.
- James had to walk back home after reaching the halfway point.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance James walked.
Total distance = Distance from home to halfway point + Distance from halfway point back home + Distance from halfway point to the store
Total distance = (4 miles / 2) + 4 miles + (4 miles / 2) = 6 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total time it took James to reach the store.
Time taken = Total distance / Walking speed
Time taken = 6 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1.5 hours

Therefore, it took James 1.5 hours to reach the store.

Final answer: It took James 1.5 hours to reach the store.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- James' home is 4 miles from the store.
- James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance James walked.
Total distance = Distance to the store + Distance back home
Total distance = 4 miles + 4 miles = 8 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time it took James to reach the store.
Time = Total distance / Walking speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.

Final answer: It took James 2 hours to reach the store.
