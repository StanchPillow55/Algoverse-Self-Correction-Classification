Question:
A basket contains 25 oranges among which 1 is bad, 20% are unripe, 2 are sour and the rest are good. How many oranges are good?


Reference Answer:
20% of 25 oranges is (20/100)*25 = <<(20/100)*25=5>>5 oranges
The total number of bad, unripe and sour oranges is therefore 1+5+2 = <<1+5+2=8>>8 oranges
The rest which is 25-8 = <<25-8=17>>17 oranges are good
#### 17

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The basket contains 25 oranges.
- 1 orange is bad.
- 20% of the oranges are unripe.
- 2 oranges are sour.

Step 1: Calculate the number of unripe oranges.
20% of 25 oranges = 0.20 Ã— 25 = 5 unripe oranges

Step 2: Calculate the number of good oranges.
Total oranges - Bad oranges - Unripe oranges - Sour oranges = Good oranges
25 - 1 - 5 - 2 = 17 good oranges

Therefore, the number of good oranges in the basket is 17.

Final answer: 17 good oranges.
