Question ID: 1031

Question:
Apple High School is holding graduation in their Fine Arts Center this year which has space for 6000 people.  After accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?


Reference Answer:
Add graduate and faculty seats together. 950 + 300 = <<950+300=1250>>1250 seats for faculty and graduates
Minus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 6000 - 1250 = <<6000-1250=4750>>4750 remaining seats.
Divide amount of graduates by remaining seats. 4750/950 = <<4750/950=5>>5 tickets
#### 5

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of remaining seats available for the graduates' friends and family, and then divide that number equally among the graduates.

Given information:
- The Fine Arts Center has a capacity of 6000 people.
- 950 seats are reserved for graduates.
- 300 seats are reserved for faculty attending.

Step 1: Calculate the number of remaining seats available for the graduates' friends and family.
Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty = Remaining seats for friends and family
6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats

Step 2: Calculate the number of tickets each graduate will receive.
Remaining seats for friends and family / Number of graduates = Tickets per graduate
4750 / 950 = 5 tickets per graduate

Therefore, each graduate will receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

Final answer: Each graduate will receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.
