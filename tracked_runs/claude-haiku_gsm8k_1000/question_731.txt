Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Trent is 5 years older than Jane.
- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
- Quinn is 30 years old.

Step 1: Find Jane's age.
Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can calculate Jane's age as:
Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3 = 27 years old

Step 2: Find Trent's age.
Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, we can calculate Trent's age as:
Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5 = 32 years old

Therefore, the final answer is:
Trent is 32 years old.
