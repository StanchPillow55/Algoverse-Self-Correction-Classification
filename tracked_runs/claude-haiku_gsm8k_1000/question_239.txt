Question:
Boris has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, how many fewer apples does Beck have than Boris now?


Reference Answer:
Boris has 100 apples, but gives 10 away, so now he has 100 apples - 10 apples = <<100-10=90>>90 apples.
Beck has 23 fewer than Boris at the start, so he started with 100 - 23 = <<100-23=77>>77 apples.
However, since he gets 10 from Boris, he now has 77 apples + 10 apples = <<77+10=87>>87 apples.
Thus Beck has 90 - 87 = <<90-87=3>>3 apples fewer than Boris.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Boris has 100 apples.
- Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris.
- Boris gives Beck 10 apples.

Step 1: Calculate how many apples Beck has initially.
Beck's initial apples = Boris' apples - 23
Beck's initial apples = 100 - 23 = 77 apples

Step 2: Calculate how many apples Beck has after Boris gives him 10 apples.
Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris = Beck's initial apples + 10
Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris = 77 + 10 = 87 apples

Step 3: Calculate how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now.
Boris' apples after giving 10 to Beck = 100 - 10 = 90 apples
Difference in apples between Boris and Beck = Boris' apples - Beck's apples
Difference in apples between Boris and Beck = 90 - 87 = 3 apples

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Initially, Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris.
   * Boris: 100 apples
   * Beck: 100 - 23 = 77 apples

2. Boris gives Beck 10 apples.
   * Boris now has: 100 - 10 = 90 apples
   * Beck now has: 77 + 10 = 87 apples

3. Now, we need to find how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris.
   * Boris has 90 apples
   * Beck has 87 apples
   * Difference: 90 - 87 = 3 apples

Therefore, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

Final answer: Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.
