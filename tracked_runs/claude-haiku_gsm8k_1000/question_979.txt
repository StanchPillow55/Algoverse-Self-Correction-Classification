Question ID: 402

Question:
Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup milk. If flour is sold in 2-cup bags and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk does Mark have to buy?


Reference Answer:
To make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 3 cups * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 cups of flour.
To get 12 cups of flour, Mark needs to buy: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = <<12/2=6>>6 bags
To make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 1 cup * 4 = <<1*4=4>>4 cups of milk
To get 4 cups of milk, Mark needs to buy: 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = <<4/2=2>>2 bottles of milk
Finally, subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour to find the difference: 6 - 2 = <<6-2=4>>4

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies, and then determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

Given information:
- The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk.
- Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies.
- Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch.
Total flour required = 3 cups × 4 (quadruple batch) = 12 cups
Total milk required = 1 cup × 4 (quadruple batch) = 4 cups

Step 2: Determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.
Bags of flour required = Total flour required / Size of each bag
Bags of flour required = 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags

Bottles of milk required = Total milk required / Size of each bottle
Bottles of milk

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk.
2. Mark is making a quadruple batch, which means he needs 4 times the normal amount of ingredients.

To calculate the amount of flour and milk needed for the quadruple batch:
* Flour needed: 3 cups x 4 = 12 cups
* Milk needed: 1 cup x 4 = 4 cups

Now, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so:
* 12 cups of flour / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so: 
* 4 cups of milk / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk, we subtract:
* 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4 more bags of flour than bottles
