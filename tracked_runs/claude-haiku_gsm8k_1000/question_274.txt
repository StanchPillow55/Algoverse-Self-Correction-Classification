Question ID: 812

Question:
Rose is out picking flowers for a vase she wants to fill.  She starts off by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each.  She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?


Reference Answer:
Rose picks 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 petals worth of the 5 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 petals worth of the 6 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 petals worth of the 4 petal flowers.
Finally, Rose picks 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 petals worth of the 7 petal flowers.
Rose carries 15+24+20+42=<<15+24+20+42=101>>101 petals worth of flowers back to the vase.
But the wind blows 5+6+4+7=<<5+6+4+7=22>>22 petals worth of flowers away.
So Rose has 101-22=<<101-22=79>>79 petals worth remaining

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Rose starts by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   * 3 flowers x 5 petals each = 15 petals

2. She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   * 4 flowers x 6 petals each = 24 petals

3. She then adds 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   * 5 flowers x 4 petals each = 20 petals

4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   * 6 flowers x 7 petals each = 42 petals

5. Now we add up the total number of petals from all the flowers she picked:
   * 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

6. However, she drops 1 of each type of flower, so we need to subtract those:
   * 1 flower with 5 petals
   * 1
