Question ID: 633

Question:
Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, driving 55 miles per hour. Tom is driving 70 miles per hour. How long will it take Tom to catch up with Bob?


Reference Answer:
Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour to Bob's 55 miles per hour, meaning Tom is gaining at a rate of 70 mph - 55 mph = <<70-55=15>>15 mph.
Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, and if Tom is gaining 15 mph on him, it will take Tom 75 miles / 15 mph = <<75/15=5>>5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob.

Given information:
- Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom.
- Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour.
- Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour.

Step 1: Find the relative speed between Bob and Tom.
Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 miles per hour - 55 miles per hour = 15 miles per hour

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Final answer: It will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.
