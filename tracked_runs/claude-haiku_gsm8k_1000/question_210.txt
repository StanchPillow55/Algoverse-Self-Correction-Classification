Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- A glass of milk is 8 ounces of milk.
- John drinks 2 glasses of milk.
- Milk has 3 calories per ounce.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of milk John consumed.
Total milk consumed = 2 glasses × 8 ounces per glass = 16 ounces

Step 2: Calculate the total calories in the milk John consumed.
Total calories = Total milk consumed × Calories per ounce
Total calories = 16 ounces × 3 calories per ounce = 48 calories

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories from the 2 glasses of milk.

Final answer: John consumed 48 calories from the 2 glasses of milk.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. We know that a glass of milk is 8 ounces.
2. John drinks 2 glasses of milk.
3. To find the total amount of milk consumed, we multiply the number of glasses (2) by the amount in each glass (8 ounces):
   * 2 glasses x 8 ounces/glass = 16 ounces of milk

4. We also know that milk has 3 calories per ounce.
5. To find the total number of calories consumed, we multiply the total amount of milk (16 ounces) by the number of calories per ounce (3 calories/ounce):
   * 16 ounces x 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories

Therefore, the total number of calories John consumed is 48 calories.
