Question ID: 1230

Question:
Charlie is a tennis pro.  He spends most of the day teaching others lessons on how to improve their game.  His standard fee is $80 per hour for lessons, but he reduces his rate by 25% when he is giving lessons to a veteran.   If today Charlie has 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate and 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, what is the total amount of money he will make for the day, in dollars?


Reference Answer:
4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate cost 4*$80=$<<4*80=320>>320.
Reducing the rate by 25% for veterans means he takes $80/4=$<<80/4=20>>20 off his standard fee.
Thus, for veterans, he charges the reduced rate of $80-$20=$<<80-20=60>>60 per hour,
Thus, 2 1-hour lessons with veterans cost 2*$60=$<<2*60=120>>120.
All together, Charlie will make $320+$120=$<<320+120=440>>440 for the day.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day by considering the standard rate and the discounted rate for the veteran lessons.

Given information:
- Charlie's standard fee is $80 per hour for lessons.
- He reduces his rate by 25% when giving lessons to a veteran.
- Charlie has 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate and 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money for the 4 standard rate lessons.
Standard rate per lesson = $80 per hour
Number of standard rate lessons = 4
Total amount for standard rate lessons = 4 × $80 = $320

Step 2: Calculate the discounted rate for the veteran lessons.
Discount rate = 25% of $80 = 0.25 × $80 = $20
Discounted rate per lesson = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money for the 2 veteran lessons.
Discounted rate per lesson = $60 per hour
Number of veteran lessons =

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Charlie's standard fee for a 1-hour lesson is $80.
2. He reduces his rate by 25% when teaching a veteran.
   * 25% of $80 is $20.
   * So, the reduced rate for a veteran is $80 - $20 = $60 per hour.

3. Charlie has 4 lessons at the standard rate of $80 per hour.
   * 4 lessons x $80 per hour = $320.

4. Charlie has 2 lessons with a veteran at the reduced rate of $60 per hour.
   * 2 lessons x $60 per hour = $120.

5. To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we add the earnings from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons:
   * $320 + $120 = $440.

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440.
