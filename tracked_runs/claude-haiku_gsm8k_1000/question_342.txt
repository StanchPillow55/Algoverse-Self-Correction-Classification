Question:
Jenny is dividing up a pizza with 12 slices. She gives 1/3 to Bill and 1/4 to Mark. If Jenny eats 2 slices, how many slices are left?


Reference Answer:
First find how many slices 1/3 of the pizza is by multiplying 1/3 by the total number of slices: 12 slices * 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 slices
Do the same thing to find how many slices 1/4 of the pizza is: 12 slices * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 slices
Then subtract the slices each of the three people ate to find the remaining number of slices: 12 slices - 4 slices - 3 slices - 2 slices = <<12-4-3-2=3>>3 slices

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The pizza has 12 slices total.

2. Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill.
   * 1/3 of 12 slices = 4 slices

3. Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark.
   * 1/4 of 12 slices = 3 slices

4. Jenny eats 2 slices.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices taken:
* Bill's slices: 4
* Mark's slices: 3
* Jenny's slices: 2
* Total slices taken: 4 + 3 + 2 = 9

To find the number of slices left, we take the total number of slices (12) and subtract the number of slices taken (9):
* Slices left = 12 - 9 = 3

Therefore, the final answer is that 3 slices of pizza are left.
