Question ID: 377

Question:
Lucy sells apples from her orchard at $4 per piece. On Monday, she sold all the apples picked. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. Come Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day. If Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday, how many apples did she pick over the three days?


Reference Answer:
Since each apple costs $4, it means that on Monday, Lucy picked 56/4 = <<56/4=14>>14 apples
Combining Monday and Tuesday, Lucy picked 14 + 12 = <<14+12=26>>26 apples
On Wednesday, she picked 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 apples
All together, Lucy picked 26 + 24 = <<26+24=50>>50 apples.
#### 50

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of apples Lucy picked over the three days.

Given information:
- Lucy sells apples at $4 per piece.
- On Monday, she sold all the apples picked and got $56.
- On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.
- On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day.

Step 1: Find the number of apples Lucy picked on Monday.
Since Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday, we can divide the total amount by the price per apple to find the number of apples.
Number of apples picked on Monday = $56 / $4 per apple = 14 apples

Step 2: Find the number of apples Lucy picked on Tuesday.
We know that Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

Step 3: Find the number of apples Lucy picked on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day.
Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 × 12 = 24 apples
