Question:
John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours in the week.  If he spends 50 dollars on gas and wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, how many 25 dollar pens can he buy after he buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each?


Reference Answer:
He earned $50*6=$<<50*6=300>>300
He has $300 - $100 = $<<300-100=200>>200 to spend
He spends 5 * $10 = $<<5*10=50>>50 on pencils
After buying gas and pencils he has $200 - $50 - $50 = $<<200-50-50=100>>100 to spend on pens
He can buy $100/25=<<100/25=4>>4 pens

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours in the week.
   * Total earnings = $50 x 6 hours = $300

2. John spent $50 on gas.
   * Remaining money = $300 - $50 = $250

3. John wants to deposit $100 in the bank.
   * Remaining money after deposit = $250 - $100 = $150

4. John bought 5 pencils that cost $10 each.
   * Cost of pencils = 5 x $10 = $50
   * Remaining money = $150 - $50 = $100

5. Now, John wants to buy 25 dollar pens.
   * Remaining money = $100
   * Number of 25 dollar pens he can buy = $100 / $25 = 4 pens

Therefore, the final answer is that John can buy 4 pens after buying 5 pencils.
