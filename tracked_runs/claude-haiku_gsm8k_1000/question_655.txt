Question ID: 1252

Question:
Dominick went to his team's changing room and saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs kept there. If there were 20 helmets, calculate the total number of items Dominick saw.


Reference Answer:
If the number of helmets was 20, there were 2 footballs/helmet * 20 helmets = <<20*2=40>>40 footballs
There were half as many robots as helmets, so in total, there were 1 robot/2 helmets * 20 helmets = <<1/2*20=10>>10 robots.
The total number of items in the changing room is 10 robots + 40 footballs + 20 helmets = <<10+40+20=70>>70 items
#### 70

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- There are half as many robots as helmets.
- There are half as many helmets as footballs.
- There are 20 helmets.

Step 1: Find the number of robots.
Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can use the following equation:
Number of robots = 1/2 × Number of helmets
Number of robots = 1/2 × 20 = 10 robots

Step 2: Find the number of footballs.
Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can use the following equation:
Number of footballs = 2 × Number of helmets
Number of footballs = 2 × 20 = 40 footballs

Step 3: Calculate the total number of items Dominick saw.
Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 items

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw in the changing room is
