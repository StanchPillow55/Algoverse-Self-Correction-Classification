Question ID: 351

Question:
April is donating plant pots to a local school for their new garden. They ask for 30 plant pots for the daisies, and twice as many for the roses. April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center before she knew how many she needed. How many plant pots does April have left over?


Reference Answer:
For the roses, the school wants 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 plant pots.
This means she is giving the school 60 plant pots for roses + 30 plant pots for daisies = <<60+30=90>>90 plant pots.
So in total, Alice has 100 – 90 = <<100-90=10>>10 plant pots left over.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies.
- The school needs twice as many plant pots for the roses as for the daisies.
- April had already bought 100 plant pots before knowing the school's requirements.

Step 1: Calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses.
Number of plant pots needed for the roses = 2 × 30 = 60 plant pots

Step 2: Calculate the total number of plant pots needed for the school.
Total plant pots needed = Plant pots for daisies + Plant pots for roses
Total plant pots needed = 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots

Step 3: Calculate the number of plant pots April has left over.
Plant pots April had bought = 100
Plant pots needed for the school = 90
Plant pots left over = 100 - 90 = 10 plant pots

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.

Final answer: April has
