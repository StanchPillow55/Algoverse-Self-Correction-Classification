Question ID: 445

Question:
Michael is racing his horse and notices that for every mile the horse runs, he eats 1/2 a bail of hay. A bail of hay costs $3. If his horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, and Michael has six 5 dollar bills, how much change does he have after he buys the hay?


Reference Answer:
The horse runs 16 miles because 32 x (30/60) = <<32*(30/60)=16>>16
The horse needs to eat 8 bails of hay because 16 x .5 = <<16*.5=8>>8
The hay will cost $24 because 8 x $3 = <<8*3=24>>24
Michael has $30 because 6 x $5 = <<6*5=30>>30
Michael has $6 in change because $30 - $24 = $<<30-24=6>>6

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay.
- A bail of hay costs $3.
- The horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 MPH.
- Michael has six $5 bills.

Step 1: Calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes.
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 32 MPH × (30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour) = 16 miles

Step 2: Calculate the amount of hay the horse eats.
Hay consumed = Distance × (1/2 bail/mile)
Hay consumed = 16 miles × (1/2 bail/mile) = 8 bails of hay

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the hay.
Cost of hay = Number of bails × Cost per bail
Cost of hay = 8 bails × $3/bail = $24

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Michael has.
Total money = Number of $5 bills × $5/

Hay consumed = 16 miles × 1/2 bails per mile
Hay consumed = 8 bails of hay

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the hay.
Cost of hay = Hay consumed × $3 per bail
Cost of hay = 8 bails × $3 per bail
Cost of hay = $24
