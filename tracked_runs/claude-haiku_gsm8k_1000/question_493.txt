Question ID: 199

Question:
Mark is a copy-editor. He edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Mark edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?


Reference Answer:
Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences for each of them.
From Publisher A, he earns 5 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<5*500=2500>>2500 cents.
Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.
Thus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.
Thus, he earns 2500 + 5000 = <<2500+5000=7500>>7500 cents in total.

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Mark edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers.
- Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays.
- Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
- Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.

Step 1: Find the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher.
Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2 to find the number of sentences for each publisher.
Number of sentences for each publisher = 1000 ÷ 2 = 500 sentences

Step 2: Find the rate per sentence that Publisher B pays Mark.
Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays.
Rate per sentence for Publisher B = 2 × 5 cents = 10 cents

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Mark makes from Publisher A.
Total amount from Publisher A = 500 sentences × 5 cents per sentence = 2,500 cents

Step 4: Calculate the total amount Mark makes from Publisher B.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mark edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, Publisher A and Publisher B.
- Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays.
- Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
- Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.

Step 1: Find the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher.
Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, we can divide the total number of sentences (1000) by 2 to find the number of sentences for each publisher.
Number of sentences for each publisher = 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences

Step 2: Find the rate Publisher B pays Mark per sentence.
Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 5 cents per sentence.
Rate paid by Publisher B = 2 × 5 cents = 10 cents per sentence

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Mark makes from Publisher A.
Amount from Publisher A = 500 sentences × 5 cents per sentence = 2500 cents

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mark edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers.
- Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays.
- Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
- Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.

Step 1: Determine the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher.
Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, we can divide the total number of sentences (1000) by 2 to get the number of sentences for each publisher.
Number of sentences for each publisher = 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences

Step 2: Calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher A.
Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.
Amount earned from Publisher A = 500 sentences × 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Step 3: Calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher B.
Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays.
Amount earned from Publisher B = 2 × 5 cents/sentence = 10 cents/sentence
