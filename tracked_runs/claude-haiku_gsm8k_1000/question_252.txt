Question:
Verna loves to eat fruit. She bought three apples at $1.50 each, five oranges at $0.80 each, and six peaches at $0.75 each.  If she gave $20, how much change did she receive?


Reference Answer:
Three apples cost 3 x $1.50 = $<<3*1.5=4.50>>4.50.
Five oranges cost 5 x $0.80 = $<<5*0.8=4>>4.
Four peaches cost 6 x $0.75 = $<<6*0.75=4.50>>4.50.
Thus, Verna paid a total of $4.50 +$4+ $4.50 = $<<4.5+4+4.5=13>>13.
Therefore, Verna received $20 - $13 = $<<20-13=7>>7.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each
- Verna paid $20

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the fruits.
Cost of apples = 3 × $1.50 = $4.50
Cost of oranges = 5 × $0.80 = $4.00
Cost of peaches = 6 × $0.75 = $4.50
Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Step 2: Calculate the change Verna received.
Change = Amount paid - Total cost
Change = $20 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the change Verna received is $7.00.
