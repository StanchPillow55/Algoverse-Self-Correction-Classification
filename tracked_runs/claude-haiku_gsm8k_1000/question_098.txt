Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 3 red balls, 11 blue balls, and 25 green balls in the store.
- Red balls cost $9 each, blue balls cost $5 each, and green balls cost $3 each.

To find the total amount the store will receive after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of ball and then add them together.

Revenue from red balls = Number of red balls × Price per red ball
Revenue from red balls = 3 × $9 = $27

Step 2: Calculate the revenue from the blue balls.
Revenue from blue balls = Number of blue balls × Price per blue ball
Revenue from blue balls = 11 × $5 = $55
