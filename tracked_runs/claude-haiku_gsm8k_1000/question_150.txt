Question:
In a student council election, candidate A got 20% of the votes while candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. The rest of the votes was given to candidate C. If there were 100 voters, how many votes did candidate C get?


Reference Answer:
Candidate A got 100 x 20/100 = <<100*20/100=20>>20 votes.
Candidate B got 20 x 50/100 = <<20*50/100=10>>10 more votes than candidate A.
Thus, candidate B got 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 votes.
Candidate A and B have 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 votes together.
Therefore, candidate C got 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50 votes.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Candidate A got 20% of the votes.
- Candidate B got 50% more than Candidate A's votes.
- The remaining votes were given to Candidate C.
- There were 100 voters in total.

Step 1: Calculate the number of votes Candidate A got.
Since Candidate A got 20% of the votes, we can calculate the number of votes as follows:
20% of 100 voters = 0.20 × 100 = 20 votes for Candidate A

Step 2: Calculate the number of votes Candidate B got.
Candidate B got 50% more than Candidate A's votes, so we can calculate the number of votes as follows:
50% more than 20 votes = 1.50 × 20 = 30 votes for Candidate B

Step 3: Calculate the total number of votes for Candidates A and B.
Total votes for Candidates A and B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes

Step 4: Calculate the number of

Step 1: Calculate the number of votes Candidate A got.
Since Candidate A got 20% of the votes, we can calculate the number of votes as follows:
Votes for Candidate A = 20% of 100 voters
Votes for Candidate A = 0.20 × 100 = 20 votes

Step 2: Calculate the number of votes Candidate B got.
Candidate B got 50% more than Candidate A's votes, so we can calculate the number of votes as follows:
Votes for Candidate B = Votes for Candidate A + 50% of Votes for Candidate A
Votes for Candidate B = 20 + (0.50 × 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes

Step 3: Calculate the number of
