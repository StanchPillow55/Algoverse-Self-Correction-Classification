Question ID: 528

Question:
Ophelia and Jenna are living in the same apartment building. They each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. If Ophelia has 20 sofas, calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that they have.


Reference Answer:
If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20+2 = <<20+2=22>>22 chairs.
Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, a total of 3*22 = <<3*22=66>>66 chairs
The total number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have is 66+22 = <<66+22=88>>88
Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the total number of sofas she has is 66-2 = <<66-2=64>>64 sofas.
The total number of sofas Ophelia and Jenna have is 64+20 = <<64+20=84>>84 sofas
Together, they have 84 sofas+88 chairs = <<84+88=172>>172

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Ophelia and Jenna each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
- Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.
- Ophelia has 20 sofas.

Step 1: Find the number of chairs Ophelia has.
Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can use the following equation:
Ophelia's chairs = Ophelia's sofas + 2
Ophelia's chairs = 20 + 2 = 22 chairs

Step 2: Find the number of chairs Jenna has.
Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so:
Jenna's chairs = 3 × Ophelia's chairs
Jenna's chairs = 3 × 22 = 66 chairs

Step 3: Find the number of sofas Jenna has.
Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can use the following equation:
Jenna's sofas = J
