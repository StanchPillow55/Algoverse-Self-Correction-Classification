Question ID: 664

Question:
John decides to take a cooking class.  The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time for 6 weeks.  If he learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, how many recipes does he learn?


Reference Answer:
He is in class for 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 hours per week
So he takes classes for 8*6=<<8*6=48>>48 hours
That means he learned 48/1.5=<<48/1.5=32>>32 recipes
#### 32

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The cooking class meets 4 times a week.
- Each class session lasts 2 hours.
- The class runs for 6 weeks.
- John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours in the cooking class.
Number of hours per week = 4 classes × 2 hours per class = 8 hours per week
Total number of hours in the class = 8 hours per week × 6 weeks = 48 hours

Step 2: Calculate the number of recipes John learns.
Number of recipes learned = Total number of hours in the class / Time required to learn a new recipe
Number of recipes learned = 48 hours / 1.5 hours per recipe = 32 recipes

Therefore, John learns 32 recipes in the cooking class.
