Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day.
- Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar.

Step 1: Find how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day.
Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we can divide Edgar's daily intake by 2 to find his brother's daily intake.
Edgar's daily intake = 18 pretzels
Edgar's brother's daily intake = 18 รท 2 = 9 pretzels

Step 2: Find how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week.
There are 7 days in a week, so we can multiply Edgar's brother's daily intake by 7 to find his weekly intake.
Edgar's brother's weekly intake = 9 pretzels per day ร 7 days = 63 pretzels

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.
