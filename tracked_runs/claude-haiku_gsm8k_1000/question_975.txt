Question ID: 757

Question:
Krissa needs to order field trip shirts for her preschool students. 11 students need size extra-small.  Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.  Half as many students need size large as size medium.  Six more students need size extra-large than large.  Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?


Reference Answer:
Krissa ordered 11 x 2 = <<11*2=22>>22 size small.
She ordered 22 - 4 = <<22-4=18>>18 size medium.
She ordered 18 / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 size large.
She ordered 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 size extra-large.
Altogether, Krissa ordered 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = <<11+22+18+9+15=75>>75 shirts.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of shirts needed for each size and then add them up to get the total number of shirts ordered.

Given information:
- 11 students need size extra-small.
- Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
- Half as many students need size large as size medium.
- Six more students need size extra-large than large.

Step 1: Find the number of size small shirts needed.
Number of size small shirts = 2 × 11 = 22

Step 2: Find the number of size medium shirts needed.
Number of size medium shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

Step 3: Find the number of size large shirts needed.
Number of size large shirts = 18 ÷ 2 = 9

Step 4: Find the number of size extra-large shirts needed.
Number of size extra-large shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Step 5: Find the total number of shirts ordered.
Total number of shirts = 11

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Extra-small shirts: 
   * 11 students need extra-small shirts

2. Small shirts:
   * Twice as many students need small as extra-small
   * 11 x 2 = 22 students need small shirts

3. Medium shirts:
   * Four less than the number of small students need medium
   * 22 - 4 = 18 students need medium shirts

4. Large shirts:
   * Half as many students need large as medium
   * 18 / 2 = 9 students need large shirts

5. Extra-large shirts:
   * Six more students need extra-large than large
   * 9 + 6 = 15 students need extra-large shirts

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts Krissa ordered:
* Extra-small: 11
* Small: 22
* Medium: 18
* Large: 9
* Extra-large: 15

Total number of shirts ordered: 11 + 22 + 18 +
