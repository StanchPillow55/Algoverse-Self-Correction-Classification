Question ID: 591

Question:
Four dogs sat in a line within the veterinarian's waiting room.  The first dog was the Affenpinscher, who weighed only 10 pounds.  Next to him sat a Dachshund, who weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher.  Next to the Dachshund sat a Papillon, who weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.  And at the end of the line sat a Mastiff, who weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon.  How much did the Mastiff weigh, in pounds?


Reference Answer:
The Affenpinscher weighed 10 pounds, and the Dachshund weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, or 2*10=20 pounds.
The Papillon weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, or 20/4=<<20/4=5>>5 pounds.
And the Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon, or 5*44=<<44*5=220>>220 pounds.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The first dog is an Affenpinscher, who weighs 10 pounds.
- The second dog is a Dachshund, who weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher.
- The third dog is a Papillon, who weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.
- The fourth dog is a Mastiff, who weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of the Dachshund.
Weight of Dachshund = 2 × Weight of Affenpinscher
Weight of Dachshund = 2 × 10 pounds = 20 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the weight of the Papillon.
Weight of Papillon = 1/4 × Weight of Dachshund
Weight of Papillon = 1/4 × 20 pounds = 5 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the weight of the Mastiff.
Weight of Mastiff = 44

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first dog is an Affenpinscher, who weighs 10 pounds.

2. The second dog is a Dachshund, who weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher.
   * Dachshund's weight = 2 x 10 pounds = 20 pounds

3. The third dog is a Papillon, who weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.
   * Papillon's weight = 20 pounds / 4 = 5 pounds

4. The fourth dog is a Mastiff, who weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon.
   * Mastiff's weight = 44 x 5 pounds = 220 pounds

Therefore, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds.
