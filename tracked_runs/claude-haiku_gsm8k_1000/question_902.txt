Question:
George has 45% more pears than bananas. If George has 200 bananas, how many fruits does George have?


Reference Answer:
If George has 200 bananas, 45% more than that number is 45/100*200 = <<200*0.45=90>>90
The total number of pears that George has is 200+90 =<<200+90=290>>290
Together, George has 290 pears + 200 bananas = <<290+200=490>>490 fruits

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- George has 45% more pears than bananas.
- George has 200 bananas.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pears George has.
Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can use the following formula:
Number of pears = Number of bananas + 45% of number of bananas
Number of pears = 200 + (0.45 Ã— 200)
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Step 2: Calculate the total number of fruits George has.
Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

Therefore, George has a total of 490 fruits.

Final answer: George has a total of 490 fruits.
