Question:
James is in charge of running messages from the office to each teacher's classroom. If he delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson and 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu, how many messages does he deliver total?


Reference Answer:
First find the number of messages Mr. Yu gets: 66 messages / 3 = <<66/3=22>>22 messages
Then add that to the number of messages Ms. Thompson gets to find the total: 66 messages + 22 messages = <<66+22=88>>88 messages
#### 88

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.
- James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu.

Step 1: Calculate the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu.
Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu, we can calculate this as:
Messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 × Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 × 66 = 22 messages

Step 2: Calculate the total number of messages James delivers.
Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22 = 88 messages

Therefore, the total number of messages James delivers is 88.

Final answer: James delivers a total of 88 messages.
