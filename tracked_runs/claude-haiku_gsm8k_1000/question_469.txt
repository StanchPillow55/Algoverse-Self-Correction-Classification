Question:
Artemis is potting flowers with her father. They buy a 30-pound bag of soil. Each rose needs 1 pound. Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds. Each Sunflower needs 3 pounds. If they plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations, how many roses can they plant?


Reference Answer:
They used 12 pounds on the sunflowers because 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12
They used 15 pounds on carnations because 10 x 1.5 = <<10*1.5=15>>15
They have used 27 pounds in total because 12 + 15 = <<12+15=27>>27
They have 30 pounds left because 30 - 27 = <<30-27=3>>3
The can plant three roses because 3 / 1 = <<3/1=3>>3

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of soil needed for the sunflowers and carnations.
2. Subtract the amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil available.
3. Determine the number of roses that can be planted with the remaining soil.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of soil needed for the sunflowers and carnations.
* 4 sunflowers × 3 pounds per sunflower = 12 pounds of soil
* 10 carnations × 1.5 pounds per carnation = 15 pounds of soil
* Total soil needed for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Step 2: Subtract the amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil available.
* Total soil available = 30 pounds
* Soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 27 pounds
* Remaining soil = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Step 3: Determine the number of
