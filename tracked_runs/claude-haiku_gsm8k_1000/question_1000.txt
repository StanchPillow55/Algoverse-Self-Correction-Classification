Question ID: 705

Question:
Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle. If the cat can run 15 feet/second, how many feet can her turtle crawl in 40 seconds?


Reference Answer:
First find the speed of the turtle by dividing the cat's speed by 5: 15 feet/second / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 feet/second
Then multiply the turtle's speed by the number of seconds it spends crawling to find how far it crawls: 40 seconds * 3 feet/second = <<40*3=120>>120 feet
#### 120

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle.
- The cat can run 15 feet/second.
- We need to find how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds.

Step 1: Find the speed of the turtle.
Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can divide the cat's speed by 5 to find the turtle's speed.
Turtle's speed = Cat's speed / 5
Turtle's speed = 15 feet/second / 5 = 3 feet/second

Step 2: Calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds.
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 3 feet/second × 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

Therefore, Martha's turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

Final answer: Martha's turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.
