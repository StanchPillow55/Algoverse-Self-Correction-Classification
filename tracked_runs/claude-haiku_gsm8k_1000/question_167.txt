Question ID: 147

Question:
Debra is monitoring a beehive to see how many bees come and go in a day. She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours. She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours. Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?


Reference Answer:
Debra first sees 30 bees leave the hive, then sees 1/2 that many return, 30 x 1/2 = <<30*1/2=15>>15 bees that return and 15 bees that are still away from the hive.
Debra sees twice as many bees as first left the hive--which was 30--fly from the hive in the next 6 hours, 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 bees that leave the hive.
In total, 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 bees left the hive.
There were 90 bees total that left the hive - 15 bees that already returned = <<90-15=75>>75 bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step and keep track of the number of bees leaving and returning to the hive throughout the day.

Given information:
- In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
- In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the 30 bees return to the hive.
- In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the first 30 bees leave the hive.
- In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before but hadn't returned yet, return to the hive.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bees that return to the hive in the second 6 hours.
Number of bees that return in the second 6 hours = 1/2 × 30 = 15 bees

Step 2: Calculate the number of bees that leave the hive in the third 6 hours.
Number of bees that leave in the third 6 hours = 2 × 30 = 60 bees

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it.

Given information:
- In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.
- In the next 6 hours, she sees 1/2 of that number (30) return to the hive.
- In the next 6 hours, she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive (30) fly from the hive and leave.
- In the last 6 hours of the day, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned, returns to the hive.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bees that returned to the hive in the second 6-hour period.
Number of bees that returned = 1/2 × 30 = 15 bees

Step 2: Calculate the number of bees that left the hive in the third 6-hour period.
Number of bees that left = 2 × 30 = 60 bees

Step 3: Calculate the number of bees that had not yet returned to the hive.
