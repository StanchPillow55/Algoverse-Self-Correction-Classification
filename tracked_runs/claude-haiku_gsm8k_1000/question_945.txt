Question:
20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win the big race.  60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win.  The rest of the people think horse #12 will win the big race.  How many people think that horse #12 will win?


Reference Answer:
20% of 50 people are pulling for horse #2 so that's .20*50 = <<.20*50=10>>10 people
10 out of 50 people think horse #2 will win which leaves 50-10 = <<50-10=40>>40 people
60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win so that's .60*40 = <<60*.01*40=24>>24 people
That leaves 40-24 = <<40-24=16>>16 people that think horse #12 will win
#### 16

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win:
   * 20% of 50 = 0.20 x 50 = 10 people think horse #2 will win

2. Now we need to find the remaining number of people:
   * Total people = 50
   * People who think horse #2 will win = 10
   * Remaining people = 50 - 10 = 40 people

3. 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
   * 60% of 40 = 0.60 x 40 = 24 people think horse #7 will win

4. Now we can find the number of people who think horse #12 will win:
   * Total people = 50
   * People who think horse #2 will win = 10
   * People who think horse #7 will win = 24
   * People who think horse #12 will win = 50 - 10 - 24

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win the big race.
- 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win.
- The rest of the people think horse #12 will win the big race.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win.
20% of 50 people = 0.20 × 50 = 10 people

Step 2: Calculate the number of people who are left after the 10 people who think horse #2 will win.
Total people - People who think horse #2 will win = Remaining people
50 - 10 = 40 people

Step 3: Calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win.
60% of the remaining 40 people = 0.60 × 40 = 24 people

Step 4: Calculate the number of people who think horse #12 will win.
