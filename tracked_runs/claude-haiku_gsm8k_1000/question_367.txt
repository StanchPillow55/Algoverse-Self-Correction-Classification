Question:
Mr Boarden is remodeling his bathroom. For every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles. How many mosaic tiles would Mr Boarden need to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom?


Reference Answer:
A third of Mr. Boarden's bathroom is 36/3 = <<36/3=12>>12 sqft
Two thirds of Mr. Boarden's bathroom is 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 sq ft
Mr. Boarden needs 24 x 24 = <<24*24=576>>576 mosaic tiles

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total area of the bathroom.
2. Calculate the area that needs to be covered with mosaic tiles.
3. Calculate the number of mosaic tiles required.

Step 1: Calculate the total area of the bathroom.
Total area of the bathroom = 36 sq ft

Step 2: Calculate the area that needs to be covered with mosaic tiles.
Mr. Boarden needs to cover two-thirds of the bathroom.
Area to be covered = 2/3 × 36 sq ft = 24 sq ft

Step 3: Calculate the number of mosaic tiles required.
For every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles.
Number of mosaic tiles required = 24 tiles/sq ft × 24 sq ft = 576 mosaic tiles

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

Final answer: 576 mosaic tiles
