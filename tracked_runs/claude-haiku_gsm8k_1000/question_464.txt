Question:
Fishio posted her selfie on Instagram. She received 2000 likes on the photo after 1 week. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. If she received 20000 more new likes recently, how many Instagram likes are there?


Reference Answer:
After receiving 2000 likes on her photo on Instagram on the first week, Fishio received 70*2000 = <<70*2000=140000>>140000 new likes on the photo after three more weeks.
The total number of likes in the four weeks is 140000+2000 = <<140000+2000=142000>>142000
If Fishio received 20000 more likes recently, the number of likes on the photo is 142000+20000=<<142000+20000=162000>>162000
#### 162000

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the number of likes after 3 weeks.
2. Add the new 20,000 likes to the total number of likes.

Step 1: Find the number of likes after 3 weeks.
* Initial number of likes: 2,000
* After 3 weeks, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes.
* Number of likes after 3 weeks = 2,000 × 70 = 140,000

Step 2: Add the new 20,000 likes to the total number of likes.
* Total number of likes = 140,000 + 20,000 = 160,000

Therefore, the total number of Instagram likes is 160,000.

Final answer: 160,000 Instagram likes.

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Fishio received 2000 likes on her photo after 1 week.
- Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes.
- Fishio recently received 20,000 more new likes.

Step 1: Calculate the number of likes after 3 weeks.
Initial number of likes = 2000
Number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 × 2000 = 140,000 likes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of likes after the recent 20,000 new likes.
Total number of likes = Initial number of likes + New likes
Total number of likes = 140,000 + 20,000 = 160,000 likes

Therefore, the final answer is that Fishio's Instagram post has a total of 160,000 likes.
