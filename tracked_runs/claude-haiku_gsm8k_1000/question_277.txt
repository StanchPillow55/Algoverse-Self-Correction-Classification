Question ID: 661

Question:
Roger goes to the store to buy some coffee.  The normal brand of coffee he buys cost $5 per pound.  He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out.  He decides to buy a week's worth of coffee and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day.  He also decided to buy himself a donut for $2.  How much did everything cost?


Reference Answer:
The coffee he bought was 5*.2=$<<5*.2=1>>1 more expensive per pound than what he normally buys
So it cost 5+1=$<<5+1=6>>6 per pound
He goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 pounds of coffee a week
So he paid 6*7=$<<6*7=42>>42 on coffee
That means his total bill was 42+2=$<<42+2=44>>44

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound.
- The more expensive brand of coffee costs 20% more than the normal brand.
- Roger needs a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds.
- Roger also buys a donut for $2.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee.
Cost of the normal brand of coffee = $5 per pound
Cost of the more expensive brand of coffee = $5 + (20% of $5) = $5 + $1 = $6 per pound

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the coffee.
Total cost of the coffee = Cost of the more expensive brand of coffee × Number of pounds of coffee
Total cost of the coffee = $6 × 7 pounds = $42

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the purchase.
Total cost = Total cost of the coffee + Cost of the donut
Total cost = $42 + $2 = $44

Therefore, the total cost of everything that Roger bought is $44.
