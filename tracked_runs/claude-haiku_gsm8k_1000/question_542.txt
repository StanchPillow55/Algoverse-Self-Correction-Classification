Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Initially, Tate's garden pond has:
  - 4 male guppies
  - 7 female guppies
  - 3 male goldfishes
  - 5 female goldfishes
- Tate buys:
  - 2 male guppies
  - 1 female guppy
  - 2 male goldfishes
  - 3 female goldfishes

Step 1: Calculate the total number of male fishes initially and after the purchase.
Initial male fishes = 4 male guppies + 3 male goldfishes = 7 male fishes
Purchased male fishes = 2 male guppies + 2 male goldfishes = 4 male fishes
Total male fishes after purchase = 7 + 4 = 11 male fishes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of female fishes initially and after the purchase.
Initial female fishes = 7 female guppies + 5 female goldfishes
