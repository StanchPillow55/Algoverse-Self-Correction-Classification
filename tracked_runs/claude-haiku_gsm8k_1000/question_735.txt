Question ID: 647

Question:
Bill is trying to dig a well in his backyard. He can dig 4 feet/hour through soil and half that fast through clay. If he has to dig through 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay, how long will it take him to dig the well?


Reference Answer:
First find how fast Bill can dig through clay: 4 feet/hour / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 feet/hour
Then find how long he spends digging through clay in total: 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = <<8/2=4>>4 hours
Then find how long he spends digging through soil in total: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = <<24/4=6>>6 hours
Then add the time he spends digging through soil and clay to find the total digging time: 4 hours + 6 hours = <<4+6=10>>10 hours

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total time it takes Bill to dig through the soil and clay layers.

Given information:
- Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil.
- Bill can dig 2 feet/hour through clay (half the speed of soil).
- Bill has to dig through 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil layer.
Time to dig through soil = Depth of soil / Digging rate in soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay layer.
Time to dig through clay = Depth of clay / Digging rate in clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes to dig the well.
Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours

Therefore, it will take Bill
