Question ID: 299

Question:
John hires a driving service to get him to work each day.  His work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day.  He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.  He gets charged $2 per mile driven and he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?


Reference Answer:
He has to travel 30*2=<<30*2=60>>60 miles per day
That means he travels 60*5=<<60*5=300>>300 miles per week
So he pays 300*2=$<<300*2=600>>600 per week
That means he pays $600*50=$<<600*50=30000>>30000 a year for miles driven
He also gives $150*12=$<<150*12=1800>>1800 a year as a bonus to his driver
So he pays $30000+$1800=$<<30000+1800=31800>>31,800 a year
#### 31800

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the driving service for John per year.

Given information:
- John's work is 30 miles away, and he has to go there and back each day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.
- He gets charged $2 per mile driven.
- He also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance John travels per day.
Distance to work + Distance from work = Total distance per day
30 miles + 30 miles = 60 miles per day

Step 2: Calculate the total distance John travels per week.
Total distance per day × Number of days per week = Total distance per week
60 miles × 5 days = 300 miles per week

Step 3: Calculate the total distance John travels per year.
Total distance per week × Number of weeks per year = Total distance per year
300 miles × 50 weeks = 15,000 miles per year

Step 4: Calculate the cost per mile.
Cost per mile = $2

Step 5: Calculate

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Distance to work and back:
   * Distance to work: 30 miles
   * Distance back: 30 miles
   * Total distance per day: 30 + 30 = 60 miles

2. Days worked per year:
   * 5 days per week
   * 50 weeks per year
   * Total days worked per year: 5 x 50 = 250 days

3. Total miles driven per year:
   * Miles per day: 60 miles
   * Days worked per year: 250 days
   * Total miles driven per year: 60 x 250 = 15,000 miles

4. Cost per mile:
   * Cost per mile: $2

5. Bonus per month:
   * Bonus per month: $150

6. Total cost per year:
   * Cost per mile: $2
   * Total miles driven per year: 15,000 miles
   * Total cost for miles: 15,000 x $2 = $30,000

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John's work is 30 miles away
- He has to go there and back each day
- He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year
- He gets charged $2 per mile driven
- He also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month

Step 1: Calculate the total miles driven per day
Total miles driven per day = 30 miles (to work) + 30 miles (back home) = 60 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total miles driven per week
Total miles driven per week = 60 miles per day × 5 days per week = 300 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total miles driven per year
Total miles driven per year = 300 miles per week × 50 weeks per year = 15,000 miles

Step 4: Calculate the cost per mile
Cost per mile = $2 per mile

Step 5: Calculate the total cost for the miles driven per year
Total cost for miles driven per year = 15,000 miles × $2 per
