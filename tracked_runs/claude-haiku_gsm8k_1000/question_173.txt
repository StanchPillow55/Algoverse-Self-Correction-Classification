Question:
Fireman Frank has 200 shoes. If he gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and gains 15 new pairs on Wednesday and 30 pairs on Friday, how many shoes will he have on Sunday if he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday?


Reference Answer:
If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.
When he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.
Since a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.
The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300
On Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is 10 additional shoes.
   * 200 shoes + 10 shoes = 210 shoes

3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs, which is 30 additional shoes.
   * 210 shoes + 30 shoes = 240 shoes

4. On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs, which is 60 additional shoes.
   * 240 shoes + 60 shoes = 300 shoes

5. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.
   * 300 shoes - 180 shoes = 120 shoes

Therefore, on Sunday, Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes.
