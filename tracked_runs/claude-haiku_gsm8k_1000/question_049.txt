Question:
90 single use contacts come in 1 box and will last Pete 45 days.  Each box is $100.00 and currently 10% off.  If he buys 2 boxes of contact, how much will each pair of contacts cost?


Reference Answer:
Each box of contacts is $100.00 with 10% off so that's 100*.10 = $<<100*.10=10.00>>10.00 off
So the box was $100.00 and he has $10.00 off so each box will cost 100-10 = $<<100-10=90.00>>90.00
He buys 2 boxes and each box costs $90.00 so that's 2*90= $<<2*90=180.00>>180.00
1 box of contacts has 90 contacts and he buys 2 boxes so that's 90*2 = <<90*2=180>>180 contacts
He needs 1 contact for each eye and he has 180 contacts so that's 180/2 = <<180/2=90>>90 pairs of contacts
He spent $180.00 to have 90 pairs of contacts so each pair of contacts costs 180/90 = $<<180/90=2.00>>2.00 a pair

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- 90 single-use contacts come in 1 box
- The contacts will last Pete 45 days
- Each box costs $100.00
- The boxes are currently 10% off

Step 1: Calculate the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes.
Number of pairs of contacts in 1 box = 90 contacts / 2 contacts per pair = 45 pairs
Number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes = 45 pairs × 2 boxes = 90 pairs

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.
Original cost of 2 boxes = $100.00 × 2 = $200.00
Discount (10%) = $200.00 × 0.10 = $20.00
Total cost of 2 boxes = $200.00 - $20.00 = $180.00

Step 3: Calculate the cost per pair of contacts.
Cost per pair of contacts = Total cost of 2 boxes / Number of pairs of contacts in

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 90 single use contacts come in 1 box
- The contacts will last Pete 45 days
- Each box costs $100.00
- The boxes are currently 10% off

Step 1: Calculate the cost of 1 box of contacts after the 10% discount.
Original price of 1 box = $100.00
Discount = 10% of $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price of 1 box = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Step 2: Calculate the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes.
Number of contacts in 1 box = 90
Number of contacts in 2 boxes = 2 × 90 = 180 contacts
Number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes = 180 / 2 = 90 pairs

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.
Total cost of 2 boxes = 2 × $90.00 = $180

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 90 single use contacts come in 1 box
- The contacts will last Pete 45 days
- Each box costs $100.00
- The boxes are currently 10% off

Step 1: Calculate the cost of 1 box with the 10% discount.
Original price of 1 box = $100.00
Discount = 10% of $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price of 1 box = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Step 2: Calculate the number of days Pete can use the contacts from 2 boxes.
Contacts in 1 box = 90
Contacts in 2 boxes = 90 × 2 = 180
Days of use from 2 boxes = 45 days × 2 = 90 days

Step 3: Calculate the cost of 2 boxes of contacts.
Cost of 2 boxes = $90.00 × 2 = $180.00
