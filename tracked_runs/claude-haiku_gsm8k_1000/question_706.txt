Question:
John is raising money for a school trip. He has applied for help from the school, which has decided to cover half the cost of the trip. How much money is John missing if he has $50 and the trip costs $300?


Reference Answer:
John's school has decided to pay 300 / 2 = $<<300/2=150>>150 for his trip.
In total John has covered 150 + 50 = $<<150+50=200>>200 for his trip
Therefore, John needs 300 - 200 = $<<300-200=100>>100 more for the trip.
#### 100

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money John is missing for the school trip.

Given information:
- The total cost of the school trip is $300.
- The school has decided to cover half the cost of the trip.
- John has $50.

Step 1: Calculate the amount the school will cover.
Total cost of the trip = $300
School's contribution = 1/2 Ã— $300 = $150

Step 2: Calculate the amount John needs to contribute.
John's contribution = Total cost of the trip - School's contribution
John's contribution = $300 - $150 = $150

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money John is missing.
Amount of money John is missing = John's contribution - John's current funds
Amount of money John is missing = $150 - $50 = $100

Therefore, John is missing $100 for the school trip.

Final answer: John is missing $100 for the school trip.
