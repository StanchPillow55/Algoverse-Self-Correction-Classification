Question ID: 798

Question:
When Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.  After 2 months, he was given a raise of $0.50 per hour.  On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was.  If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?


Reference Answer:
Billy has a salary of $10+0.50+$1.00=$<<10+0.5+1=11.50>>11.50 per hour.
Sally is paid $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, for a total of $10+$0.50=$<<10+0.5=10.50>>10.50 per hour.
If Billy works 20 hours, he will be paid 20*$11.50=$<<20*11.5=230>>230
If Sally works 20 hours, she will be paid 20*$10.50=$<<20*10.50=210>>210.
Thus, if both work 20 hours, Billy will be paid $230-$210=$20 more.

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Billy's initial hourly rate: $10 per hour
- After 2 months, he was given a raise of $0.50 per hour
- On his first anniversary, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour
- Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary
- Both Billy and Sally work 20 hours

Step 1: Calculate Billy's hourly rate after the first 2 months.
Billy's initial hourly rate: $10 per hour
Raise after 2 months: $0.50 per hour
Billy's hourly rate after 2 months: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour

Step 2: Calculate Billy's hourly rate after his first anniversary.
Billy's hourly rate after 2 months: $10.50 per hour
Raise on his first anniversary: $1.00 per hour
Billy's hourly rate after his first anniversary: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Billy's initial hourly rate: $10 per hour
- After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour
- On his first anniversary, he received a raise of $1.00 per hour
- Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary
- Both Billy and Sally work 20 hours

Step 1: Calculate Billy's hourly rate after the two raises.
Initial hourly rate: $10 per hour
Raise after 2 months: $0.50 per hour
Raise on first anniversary: $1.00 per hour
Billy's final hourly rate = $10 + $0.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour

Step 2: Calculate Sally's hourly rate.
Sally's starting salary = Billy's starting salary + $0.50
Sally's hourly rate = $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for Billy and Sally.
