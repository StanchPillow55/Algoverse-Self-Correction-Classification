Question:
Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agreed to have monthly interest of 2%. If Mandy was able to pay it after 3 months, how much should she give to Benedict?


Reference Answer:
The monthly interest is $100 x 2/100 = $<<100*2/100=2>>2.
After 3 months, the total interest amount to $2 x 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.
Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict a total of $100 + $6 = $<<100+6=106>>106.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Mandy owes Benedict $100.
- They agreed to have a monthly interest of 2%.
- Mandy was able to pay it after 3 months.

Step 1: Calculate the interest for the first month.
Interest for the first month = 2% of $100 = 0.02 × $100 = $2

Step 2: Calculate the total amount owed after the first month.
Total amount owed after the first month = $100 + $2 = $102

Step 3: Calculate the interest for the second month.
Interest for the second month = 2% of $102 = 0.02 × $102 = $2.04

Step 4: Calculate the total amount owed after the second month.
Total amount owed after the second month = $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

Step 5: Calculate the interest for the third month.
Interest for the third month = 2% of $104.04 = 0.02 × $104.04


Extracted Answer: 104.04
