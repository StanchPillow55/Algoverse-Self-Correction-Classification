Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average score across the 4 tests.

Given information:
- John scored 100 on his first 3 tests.
- John scored 80 on his 4th test.

Step 1: Calculate the total score across the 4 tests.
Total score = (100 Ã— 3) + 80 = 380

Step 2: Calculate the average score across the 4 tests.
Average score = Total score / Number of tests
Average score = 380 / 4 = 95

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95.
