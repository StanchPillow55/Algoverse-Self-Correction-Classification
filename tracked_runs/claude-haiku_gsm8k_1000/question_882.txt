Question ID: 258

Question:
Nancy is returning her overdue books to the library. She owes $0.50 cents each on 8 books, plus a flat $2.00 fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. How much does she have to pay total?


Reference Answer:
First multiply the late fee per book by the number of books: $0.50/book * 8 books = $<<0.5*8=4.00>>4.00
Then add the "more than a week overdue" fee to the answer from the previous step to find the total: $4.00 + $2.00 = $<<4+2=6.00>>6.00

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Nancy owes $0.50 cents for each of the 8 overdue books.
- There is a flat $2.00 fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the overdue books.
Cost per book × Number of books = Total cost of overdue books
$0.50 × 8 = $4.00

Step 2: Calculate the flat $2.00 fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue.
Flat fee = $2.00

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Nancy has to pay.
Total cost of overdue books + Flat fee = Total amount to pay
$4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $6.00.
