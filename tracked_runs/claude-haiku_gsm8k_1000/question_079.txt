Question ID: 425

Question:
Lillian's garden doesn't have any bird feeders in it so she wants to add some. She builds 3 and buys 3 others. Each bird feeder seems to attract 20 birds throughout the day until Lillian notices that the birds seem to prefer the feeders she made herself which attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones. How many birds can Lillian expect to see in her garden each day if the same amount keep coming to her bird feeders?


Reference Answer:
Lillian has 3 store-bought + 3 self-made bird feeders = <<3+3=6>>6 bird feeders in all.
Lillian first notices each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, 6 x 20 = <<6*20=120>>120 birds.
Then Lillian notices that her 3 self-made bird feeders attract 10 more birds each, 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 extra birds.
Each day Lillian can expect to see 120 + 30 = <<120+30=150>>150 birds in her garden.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others.
- The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each throughout the day.
- The homemade feeders attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones.

Step 1: Calculate the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders.
Number of store-bought feeders = 3
Birds attracted to each store-bought feeder = 20
Total birds attracted to store-bought feeders = 3 × 20 = 60 birds

Step 2: Calculate the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders.
Number of homemade feeders = 3
Birds attracted to each homemade feeder = 20 + 10 = 30
Total birds attracted to homemade feeders = 3 × 30 = 90 birds

Step 3: Calculate the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day.
Total birds attracted to all feeders = Birds attracted to store-
