Question ID: 715

Question:
A company wanted to buy 500 computers and had $700 for each computer. However, when they went to order, they realized the price of each computer was 10% higher than they had planned for. Calculate the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices.


Reference Answer:
When they went to order, the company realized the prices of each computer had increased by 10/100*700 = $<<10/100*700=70>>70
The total buying price at the new prize is $700+$70 = $<<700+70=770>>770
Since they wanted to buy 500 computers, they paid a total of $770*500 = $<<770*500=385000>>385000
#### 385000

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the new price of each computer and then calculate the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers.

Given information:
- The company wanted to buy 500 computers.
- The company had $700 for each computer.
- The price of each computer was 10% higher than they had planned for.

Step 1: Calculate the new price of each computer.
Original price per computer = $700
Increase in price = 10% of $700 = 0.10 × $700 = $70
New price per computer = Original price + Increase in price
New price per computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers.
Total amount paid = Number of computers × New price per computer
Total amount paid = 500 × $770 = $385,000

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new prices is $385,000.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The company wanted to buy 500 computers.
- The original planned price for each computer was $700.
- The actual price of each computer was 10% higher than the planned price.

Step 1: Calculate the new price of each computer.
Original planned price per computer = $700
Increase in price = 10% of $700 = 0.10 × $700 = $70
New price per computer = Original price + Increase in price = $700 + $70 = $770

Step 2: Calculate the total amount paid for the 500 computers.
Total amount paid = Number of computers × New price per computer
Total amount paid = 500 × $770 = $385,000

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to buy the 500 computers at the new prices is $385,000.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The company wanted to buy 500 computers.
- They had budgeted $700 for each computer.
- The actual price of each computer was 10% higher than they had planned for.

Step 1: Calculate the original planned cost for 500 computers.
Original planned cost per computer = $700
Total original planned cost = 500 computers × $700 per computer = $350,000

Step 2: Calculate the new price of each computer after the 10% increase.
New price per computer = $700 + (10% of $700) = $700 + $70 = $770

Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid for 500 computers at the new price.
Total amount paid = 500 computers × $770 per computer = $385,000

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to buy the 500 computers at the new prices is $385,000.
