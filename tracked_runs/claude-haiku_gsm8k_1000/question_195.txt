Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of people who were inside the church.

Given information:
- There were 20 private cars and 12 buses parked outside the church.
- Each bus carried 35 people.
- Each car carried 3 people.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people carried by the buses.
Number of buses × Number of people per bus = Total number of people carried by buses
12 buses × 35 people per bus = 420 people

Step 2: Calculate the number of people carried by the private cars.
Number of cars × Number of people per car = Total number of people carried by cars
20 cars × 3 people per car = 60 people

Step 3: Calculate the total number of people inside the church.
Total number of people = Number of people carried by buses + Number of people carried by cars
Total number of people = 420 + 60 = 480 people

Therefore, there were 480 people inside the church.

Final answer: 480 people were inside the church.
