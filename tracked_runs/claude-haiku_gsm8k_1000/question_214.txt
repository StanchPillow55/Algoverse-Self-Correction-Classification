Question ID: 677

Question:
Carol and Jennifer are sisters from Los Angeles who love collecting signatures from celebrities. During their summer break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After five weeks, Carol and Jennifer compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Carol has 20 signatures in her book, and Jennifer has 44. The sisters have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they decide they want to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?


Reference Answer:
Carol and Jennifer have already collected 20 + 44 signatures = <<20+44=64>>64 signatures.
Since their goal is 100, they need to collect 100 - 64 signatures. 100 - 64 = <<100-64=36>>36 signatures
#### 36

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of signatures collected by the sisters so far.
2. Determine the number of signatures they need to collect to reach their goal of 100.
3. Provide the final answer.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of signatures collected by the sisters so far.
Carol's signatures: 20
Jennifer's signatures: 44
Total signatures collected so far = 20 + 44 = 64 signatures

Step 2: Determine the number of signatures they need to collect to reach their goal of 100.
Goal: 100 signatures
Signatures collected so far: 64 signatures
Signatures needed to reach the goal = 100 - 64 = 36 signatures

Step 3: Provide the final answer.
The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.

Final answer: The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures.
2. The total number of signatures they have collected so far is 20 + 44 = 64.
3. Their goal is to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer.
4. To calculate how many more signatures they need to reach their goal, we subtract the total they have now from their goal:
   100 - 64 = 36 signatures

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carol has 20 signatures in her book.
- Jennifer has 44 signatures in her book.
- They have 3 more weeks of summer vacation.
- Their goal is to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of signatures they have collected so far.
Carol's signatures + Jennifer's signatures = Total signatures collected
20 + 44 = 64 signatures

Step 2: Calculate the remaining number of signatures they need to reach their goal.
Goal - Total signatures collected = Remaining signatures needed
100 - 64 = 36 signatures

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.

Final answer: The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.
