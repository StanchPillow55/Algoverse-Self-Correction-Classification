Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of medals that have been given out for counting.

Given information:
- Ali has won 22 medals for counting super fast.
- Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
- Together, Ali and Izzy have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting.

Step 1: Find the number of medals Izzy has.
Izzy's medals = Ali's medals - 5
Izzy's medals = 22 - 5 = 17 medals

Step 2: Find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.
Total medals of Ali and Izzy = Ali's medals + Izzy's medals
Total medals of Ali and Izzy = 22 + 17 = 39 medals

Step 3: Find the total number of medals that have been given out for counting.
Total medals given out = 10 × Total medals of Ali and Izzy
Total medals given out = 10 × 39 = 390 medals

Therefore, the total number of medals that have been given out for counting is

Given information:
- Ali has won 22 medals for counting super fast.
- Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
- Together, Ali and Izzy have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting.

Step 1: Find the number of medals Izzy has.
Izzy's medals = Ali's medals - 5
Izzy's medals = 22 - 5 = 17 medals

Step 2: Find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.
Total medals of Ali and Izzy = Ali's medals + Izzy's medals
Total medals of Ali and Izzy = 22 + 17 = 39 medals

Step 3: Find the total number of medals that have been given out for counting.
