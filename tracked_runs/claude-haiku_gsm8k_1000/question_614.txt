Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair.
- The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug.
- The chair is 3 feet wide.

Step 1: Find the width of the rug.
Width of the rug = Width of the chair + 5 feet
Width of the rug = 3 feet + 5 feet = 8 feet

Step 2: Find the width of the couch.
Width of the couch = 2 × Width of the rug
Width of the couch = 2 × 8 feet = 16 feet

Step 3: Find the length of the couch.
Length of the couch = 2 × Width of the couch + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 2 × 16 feet + 2 feet = 34 feet

Therefore, the couch is 34 feet long.
