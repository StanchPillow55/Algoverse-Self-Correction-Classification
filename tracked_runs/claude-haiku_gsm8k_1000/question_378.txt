Question:
If Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days and then increases it to 5 eggs a day for 30 days, how many dozens of eggs will Chester need for 60 days?


Reference Answer:
He starts off eating 3 eggs a day for 30 days for a total of 3*30 = <<3*30=90>>90 eggs
Then he increases it to 5 eggs a day for 30 days for a total of 5*30 = <<5*30=150>>150 eggs
All total he will eat 90+150 = <<90+150=240>>240 eggs

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Chester eats 3 eggs a day for the first 30 days.
- Then, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day for the next 30 days.
- We need to find the total number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days.

Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days.
Eggs per day × Number of days = Total eggs in first 30 days
3 eggs × 30 days = 90 eggs

Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days.
Eggs per day × Number of days = Total eggs in next 30 days
5 eggs × 30 days = 150 eggs

Step 3: Calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days.
Total eggs in first 30 days + Total eggs in next 30 days = Total eggs in 60 days
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Step 4: Convert the
