Question ID: 218

Question:
Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, and Harriet is half the age of Zack. Calculate the average age of the three in three years if Harriet is 21 years old now.


Reference Answer:
In three years, Harriet will be 21+3 = <<21+3=24>>24 years old.
Since Adrian's age is three times that of Harriet, Adrian is 3*21 = <<3*21=63>>63 years old.
In three years, he will be 63+3 =<<63+3=66>>66 years old.
If Harriet is half times the age of Zack, Zack is 21*2 = <<21*2=42>>42 years old.
In three years, he will be 42+3 = <<42+3=45>>45 years old.
The combined age of the three in 3 years will be 45+66+24 = <<45+66+24=135>>135 years.
The average age for the in three years will be 135/3 =<<135/3=45>>45 years

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet.
- Harriet is half the age of Zack.
- Harriet is 21 years old now.

Step 1: Find Adrian's age.
Adrian's age = 3 × Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 × 21 = 63 years old

Step 2: Find Zack's age.
Harriet's age = 21 years
Zack's age = 2 × Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 × 21 = 42 years old

Step 3: Calculate the total age of the three people.
Total age = Adrian's age + Harriet's age + Zack's age
Total age = 63 + 21 + 42 = 126 years

Step 4: Calculate the average age of the three people.
Average age = Total age / 3
Average age = 126 / 3 = 42 years

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet.
- Harriet is half the age of Zack.
- Harriet is 21 years old now.

Step 1: Find Adrian's age.
Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age as:
Adrian's age = 3 × Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 × 21 = 63 years old

Step 2: Find Zack's age.
We know that Harriet is half the age of Zack, so we can calculate Zack's age as:
Zack's age = 2 × Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 × 21 = 42 years old

Step 3: Calculate the average age of the three in three years.
In three years, the ages will be:
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years old
- Harriet: 21 + 3
