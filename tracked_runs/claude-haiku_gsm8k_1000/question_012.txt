Question:
Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?


Reference Answer:
Let B be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the third set.
In the second set, he retrieved 2B balls.
In the first set, he retrieved 2B + 4 balls.
In total, he retrieved B + 2B + 2B + 4 = 5B + 4 = 19 balls.
Thus, 5B = 19 - 4 = 15 balls.
Therefore, in the third set, Rory retrieved B = 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 balls.
Hence, in the second set, he retrieved 2B = 3 * 2 = 6 balls.
In the first set he retrieved 2(3) + 4 balls = 10

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- In the first set, Rory had to retrieve 4 more balls than in the second set.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set.
- Rory retrieved a total of 19 tennis balls.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of balls retrieved in the second set.
- Then, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.
- The number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write an equation:
x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Solving this equation:
x + x + 4 + x/2 = 19
2.5x + 4 = 19
2.5x = 15
x = 6

Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
Balls retrieved in the first set = x + 4 = 6 +

- In the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set.
- Rory retrieved a total of 19 tennis balls.

- Let x = the number of balls retrieved in the second set.
- Then, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.
- The number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Solving the equation:
x + x + 4 + x/2 = 19
2.5x + 4 = 19
2.5x = 15
x = 6

Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
Balls retrieved in the first set = x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
