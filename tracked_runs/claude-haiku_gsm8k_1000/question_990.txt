Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- 1 kilo of apples for $4
- 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo
- 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the apples.
Cost of apples = 1 kilo × $4 per kilo = $4

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the bananas.
Cost of bananas = 2 kilos × $2 per kilo = $4

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the oranges.
Cost of oranges = 2 kilos × $3 per kilo = $6

Step 4: Calculate the total cost by adding the costs of the individual items.
Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of bananas + Cost of oranges
Total cost = $4 + $4 + $6 = $14

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14 at the grocery store.
