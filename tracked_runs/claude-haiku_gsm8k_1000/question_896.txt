Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- On Monday, the tank's water depth was 17 feet.
- On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday.
- On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday.

Step 1: Calculate the water depth on Tuesday.
Water depth on Tuesday = Water depth on Monday + 7 feet
Water depth on Tuesday = 17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet

Step 2: Calculate the water depth on Wednesday.
Water depth on Wednesday = Two-thirds of the water depth on Tuesday
Water depth on Wednesday = (2/3) × 24 feet = 16 feet

Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

Final answer: The tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.
