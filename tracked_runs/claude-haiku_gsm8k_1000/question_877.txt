Question ID: 1275

Question:
John's car breaks down.  The car weighs 1200 pounds and he has luggage in it weighing 250 pounds.  He also has his two young children who weigh 75 pounds each in it.  If the force to move the car is 1% of the weight how much force does he need to push the car?


Reference Answer:
His two children weigh 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 pounds
So the total weight of the car and everything is 1200+250+150=<<1200+250+150=1600>>1600 pounds
So he needs to generate 1600*.01=<<1600*.01=16>>16 pounds

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, and then calculate the force required to move the car.

Given information:
- The car weighs 1200 pounds.
- The luggage in the car weighs 250 pounds.
- The two young children in the car weigh 75 pounds each.
- The force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children.
Total weight = Weight of the car + Weight of the luggage + Weight of the children
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + (2 × 75 pounds)
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the force required to move the car.
Force required = 1% of the total weight
Force required = 0.01 × 1600 pounds
Force required = 16 pounds

Therefore, the force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds.
