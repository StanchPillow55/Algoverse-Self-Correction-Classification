Question:
Tim has a box with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. If he uses 3 blue shoeboxes and 1/3 red of his shoeboxes to go fishing, how many red and blue shoe boxes are left in Tim's box?


Reference Answer:
If Tim uses 3 blue shoeboxes, he remains with 7-3=<<7-3=4>>4 blue shoe boxes in the box.
Tim also uses 1/3 of the red shoeboxes, a total of 1/3*9=<<1/3*9=3>>3 red shoe boxes.
Tim remains with 9-3=<<9-3=6>>6 red shoeboxes.
The total number of red and blue shoe boxes left in Tim's box is 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Tim has a box with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.
- He uses 3 blue shoeboxes and 1/3 of the red shoeboxes to go fishing.

Step 1: Calculate the number of red shoeboxes used for fishing.
1/3 of 9 red shoeboxes = 1/3 × 9 = 3 red shoeboxes

Step 2: Calculate the number of blue and red shoeboxes left in the box.
Blue shoeboxes left = 7 - 3 = 4 blue shoeboxes
Red shoeboxes left = 9 - 3 = 6 red shoeboxes

Therefore, the number of red and blue shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes

Final answer: 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes are left in Tim's box.
