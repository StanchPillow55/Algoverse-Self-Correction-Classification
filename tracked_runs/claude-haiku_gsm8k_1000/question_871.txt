Question:
On the first day of school, Ava sees that her friends Cole and Xavier have both grown a lot over the summer. Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer. What is the difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now?


Reference Answer:
First, we need to be sure we are comparing the same units, so let’s convert feet into inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So Xavier was 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 inches tall.
Xavier grew to be 48 + 3 = <<48+3=51>>51 inches.
Cole grew to be 50 + 2 = <<50+2=52>>52 inches.
The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height is now 52 – 51 = <<52-51=1>>1 inch.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches.
- Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer.

Step 1: Convert Xavier's height to inches.
Xavier's initial height = 4 feet
1 foot = 12 inches
Xavier's initial height in inches = 4 feet × 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Step 2: Calculate Xavier's new height after growing 3 inches.
Xavier's new height = Xavier's initial height + Growth
Xavier's new height = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Step 3: Calculate Cole's new height after growing 2 inches.
Cole's initial height = 50 inches
Cole's new height = Cole's initial height + Growth
Cole's new height = 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Step 4: Calculate the difference between Cole and Xavier's new heights.
Difference in height = Cole's new height - Xavier's new height
Difference in height = 52 inches

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches.
- Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches.

Step 1: Convert Xavier's height to inches.
Xavier's initial height = 4 feet
1 foot = 12 inches
Xavier's initial height in inches = 4 feet × 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Step 2: Calculate Xavier's final height.
Xavier's final height = Xavier's initial height + Growth
Xavier's final height = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Step 3: Calculate Cole's final height.
Cole's initial height = 50 inches
Cole's final height = Cole's initial height + Growth
Cole's final height = 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Step 4: Calculate the difference between Cole and Xavier's final heights.
Difference in height = Cole's final height - Xavier's final height
Difference in height = 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

Therefore, the difference
