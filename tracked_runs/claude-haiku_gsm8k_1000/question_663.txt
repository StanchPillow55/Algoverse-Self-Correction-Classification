Question:
Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. If his father also gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, and each marble weighs 2kgs, calculate the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store.


Reference Answer:
After buying twenty marbles from his friend Johanna, Solomon had 20+50 = <<20+50=70>>70 marbles.
Solomon's father gave him 2/5*20 = <<2/5*20=8>>8 more marbles.
Adding Johanna's and Solomon's marbles, he has a total of 8+70 = <<8+70=78>>78 marbles.
If each marble weigh 2 kgs, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in store is 78 * 2 kgs = <<78*2=156>>156 kgs

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna.
- The store already had 50 marbles.
- Solomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna.
- Each marble weighs 2 kgs.

Step 1: Calculate the number of marbles Solomon's father gave him.
Number of marbles from father = 2/5 × 20 = 8 marbles

Step 2: Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store.
Total marbles = Marbles from Johanna + Marbles already in the store + Marbles from father
Total marbles = 20 + 50 + 8 = 78 marbles

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the marbles.
Total weight = Total number of marbles × Weight of each marble
Total weight = 78 marbles × 2 kgs/marble = 156 kgs

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store
