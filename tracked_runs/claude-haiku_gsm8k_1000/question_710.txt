Question ID: 587

Question:
At the Burger Palace restaurant, there is an enormous jar containing red, blue and green jelly beans.  On the outside of the jar is a note that reads, "This jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans."  If the jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans, how many more green jelly beans does it contain than red jelly beans?


Reference Answer:
If the total number of jelly beans is 4500, there must be 1500 blue jelly beans
4500/3= <<4500/3=1500>>1500
1500/100= <<1500/100=15>>15 jelly beans (1% of blue jelly beans)
1500+15= <<1500+15=1515>>1515 Green Jelly beans
1500-15= <<1500-15=1485>>1485 Red Jelly beans
1515-1485= <<1515-1485=30>>30 jelly beans difference between red and green

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of red, blue, and green jelly beans in the jar, and then calculate the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans.

Given information:
- The jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans.
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans.
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.

Step 1: Let's represent the number of blue jelly beans as x.

Step 2: Find the number of red jelly beans.
Number of red jelly beans = x - 1% of x
Number of red jelly beans = x - 0.01x = 0.99x

Step 3: Find the number of green jelly beans.
Number of green jelly beans = x + 1% of x
Number of green jelly beans = x + 0.01x = 1.01x

Step 4: Set up an equation to find the value of x (the number of blue jelly beans).

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans.
- The jar contains red, blue, and green jelly beans.
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans.
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of blue jelly beans.
- Then the number of red jelly beans = x - 1% of x = 0.99x
- And the number of green jelly beans = x + 1% of x = 1.01x

We know the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up an equation:
0.99x + x + 1.01x = 4500

Simplifying the equation:
3x = 4500
x = 1500

Now we can calculate the number of each color:
- Red jelly beans = 0.99 × 1500 = 1485
