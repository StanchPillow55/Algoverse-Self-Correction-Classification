Question ID: 1265

Question:
Tim wanted to make lemonade for a pool party.  For a gallon of lemonade, his recipe called for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.  He found that 6 lemons would yield 1 cup of juice.  He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?


Reference Answer:
Tim is going to make one gallon twice as tart as the others and each gallon needs 1 cup of juice. So he needs 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 cups for the tart batch
In addition, he will make 4 regular gallons of lemonade, which each need 1 cup juice so 4*1 = <<4*1=4>>4 cups total
All total he will need 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 cups of juice
Each cup requires 6 lemons each and he needs 6 cups of juice so 6 * 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 lemons needed

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of lemons Tim will need to make the lemonade for the party, including the extra gallon with twice the tartness.

Given information:
- For 1 gallon of lemonade, the recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
- 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
- Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.
- Tim's best friend Allen asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart as the other gallons.

Step 1: Calculate the number of lemons needed for the 4 gallons of lemonade.
Number of cups of lemon juice needed for 4 gallons = 4 gallons × 1 cup/gallon = 4 cups
Number of lemons needed for 4 cups of lemon juice = 4 cups × 6 lemons/cup = 24 lemons

Step 2: Calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon that is twice as tart.
Number of cups of lemon juice needed for the
