Question ID: 294

Question:
Will buys 15 oranges. When he gets home, he asks his 2 sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old. The oldest son is 8 years old, the youngest is half as old as the oldest. How many oranges are left unwashed?


Reference Answer:
The older son washes 8 oranges, so the younger son washes 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 oranges.
Together they wash 8 oranges + 4 oranges =<<8+4=12>>12 oranges
There are 15 oranges - 12 oranges = <<15-12=3>>3 oranges left unwashed.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Will buys 15 oranges.
- Will asks his 2 sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old.
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest.

Step 1: Find the age of the youngest son.
Youngest son's age = 1/2 × Oldest son's age
Youngest son's age = 1/2 × 8 = 4 years old

Step 2: Calculate the number of oranges washed by the sons.
Oldest son washes = 8 oranges
Youngest son washes = 4 oranges
Total oranges washed by the sons = 8 + 4 = 12 oranges

Step 3: Calculate the number of oranges left unwashed.
Total oranges bought - Total oranges washed = Oranges left unwashed
15 - 12 = 3 oranges

Therefore, the final answer is that 3 oranges are left unwashed.
