Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Charlie had 10 stickers initially.
- He bought 21 stickers from a store in the mall.
- He got 23 stickers for his birthday.
- He gave 9 stickers to his sister.
- He used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of stickers Charlie had after buying and receiving the new stickers.
Initial stickers + Stickers bought + Stickers received as a gift = Total stickers
10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers

Step 2: Calculate the number of stickers Charlie had after giving 9 to his sister.
Total stickers - Stickers given to sister = Stickers remaining
54 - 9 = 45 stickers

Step 3: Calculate the number of stickers Charlie had left after using 28 to decorate a greeting card.
Stickers remaining - Stickers used for greeting card = Stickers left
45 - 28 = 17 stickers
