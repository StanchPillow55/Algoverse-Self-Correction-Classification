Question:
Morgan's dad said that she had $90 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. A round of mini-golf is $5. The Go-karts cost $10 a ride. How many friends can she invite?


Reference Answer:
The go karts will cost $20 per person because 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20
Each person costs $30 because 5 + 5 + 20 = <<5+5+20=30>>30
Three total people can attend because 90 / 30 = <<90/30=3>>3
She can invite 2 friends because 3 - 1 =<<3-1=2>>2

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities Morgan wants to do and then determine how many friends she can invite within her $90 budget.

Given information:
- Morgan has a $90 budget for her birthday party.
- She wants to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice.
- A round of mini-golf costs $5.
- The go-karts cost $10 per ride.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the activities.
Cost of mini-golf = $5
Cost of arcade tokens = $5
Cost of go-karts (2 rides) = $10 Ã— 2 = $20
Total cost of activities = $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Step 2: Calculate the remaining budget for inviting friends.
Remaining budget = Total budget - Total cost of activities
Remaining budget = $90 - $30 = $60

Step 3: Calculate the cost per friend.
Cost per friend = Total cost of activities / (1 + Number of friends)
Since Morgan is also

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Morgan has a $90 budget for her birthday party.
- She wants to:
  - Play one round of mini-golf for $5 per person
  - Get $5 in arcade tokens per person
  - Ride the go-karts twice per person at $10 per ride

Step 1: Calculate the total cost per person.
Cost of mini-golf: $5
Cost of arcade tokens: $5
Cost of go-karts (2 rides): $10 x 2 = $20
Total cost per person = $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for Morgan.
Total cost for Morgan = $30

Step 3: Calculate the remaining budget for Morgan's friends.
Remaining budget = $90 - $30 = $60

Step 4: Calculate the number of friends Morgan can invite.
Cost per friend = $30
Remaining budget / Cost per friend = $60 / $30 = 2 friends

Therefore, Morgan can invite 2
