Question:
The Llesis family drove and hiked 6 hours to their vacation spot. They drove an average of 50 miles per hour and hiked an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drive. If it took them 1.5 hours to hike, how far was their vacation spot?


Reference Answer:
Half the average speed of Llesis family driving is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour.
Hence, their average speed hiking was 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 miles per hour.
So, they hiked 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 miles.
It took them a total of 6 - 1.5 = <<6-1.5=4.5>>4.5 hours driving.
So, they drove 50 x 4.5 = <<50*4.5=225>>225 miles.
Therefore, their vacation spot was 30 + 225 = <<30+225=255>>255 miles far.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- The Llesis family drove and hiked for a total of 6 hours to their vacation spot.
- They drove an average of 50 miles per hour.
- They hiked an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drive.
- It took them 1.5 hours to hike.

Step 1: Calculate the average speed of the Llesis family when they hike.
Driving speed = 50 miles per hour
Hiking speed = 1/2 of driving speed - 5 miles per hour
Hiking speed = (50 / 2) - 5 = 20 miles per hour

Step 2: Calculate the distance they hiked.
Time spent hiking = 1.5 hours
Distance hiked = Hiking speed × Time spent hiking
Distance hiked = 20 miles per hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles

Step 3: Calculate the distance they drove.
Total time = 6 hours
Time spent driving = Total time - Time spent hiking

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The Llesis family drove and hiked for a total of 6 hours to their vacation spot.
- They drove at an average of 50 miles per hour.
- They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
- It took them 1.5 hours to hike.

Step 1: Calculate the hiking speed.
Driving speed = 50 miles per hour
Hiking speed = 1/2 of driving speed - 5 miles per hour
Hiking speed = (1/2 × 50) - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour

Step 2: Calculate the distance hiked.
Time hiked = 1.5 hours
Distance hiked = Hiking speed × Time hiked
Distance hiked = 20 miles per hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles

Step 3: Calculate the distance driven.
Total time = 6 hours
Time driven = Total time - Time hiked
Time driven

Hiking speed = (50 / 2) - 5 = 20 miles per hour

Step 2: Calculate the distance covered during the hike.
Time spent hiking = 1.5 hours
Distance covered during hike = Hiking speed × Time spent hiking
Distance covered during hike = 20 miles per hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles

Step 3: Calculate the distance covered during the drive.
Time spent driving = Total time - Time spent hiking
