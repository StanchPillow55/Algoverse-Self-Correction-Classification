Question:
Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.  They normally order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.  How much do they make a week if they are open 2 days a week?


Reference Answer:
The meals cost 2*5=$<<2*5=10>>10 per table
So each table pays 10+5=$<<10+5=15>>15 a night
So they make 6*$15=$<<6*15=90>>90 a night
That means they make $90*2=$<<90*2=180>>180 a week
#### 180

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
- They normally order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.
- The restaurant is open 2 days a week.

Step 1: Calculate the revenue per night.
Revenue per night = (2 meals × $5 per meal) + $5 bottle of wine
Revenue per night = ($10 + $5) = $15

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue per week.
Total revenue per week = Revenue per night × Number of days open per week
Total revenue per week = $15 × 2 days = $30

Therefore, Tom's restaurant makes $30 a week.

Final answer: Tom's restaurant makes $30 a week.
