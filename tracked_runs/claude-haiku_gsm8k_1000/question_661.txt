Question ID: 239

Question:
The number of students in a school hall was 1000. The hall had 3 entrances A, B, and C which also served as the exits. If after a meeting 30% of the students went out of the building through exit A, 3/5 of the remaining went out through exit B, and the rest went out through exit C, calculate the number of students who went out through exit C.


Reference Answer:
The number of students who went out through exit A is 30/100%1000 = 300 students.
The number of students who didn't use exit A is 1000-300 = <<1000-300=700>>700
3/5 of the students used exit B, a total of 3/5*700 = <<3/5*700=420>>420 students.
If 420 of the remaining students who didn't use exit A used exit B, the number who used exit C is 700-420 = 280 students.
#### 280

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students who remained after exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C.

Step 1: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
* 30% of 1000 students went out through exit A
* 30% of 1000 = 0.30 × 1000 = 300 students

Step 2: Calculate the number of students who remained after exit A.
* Total students - students who went out through exit A = remaining students
* 1000 - 300 = 700 students

Step 3: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B.
* 3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B
* 3/5 of 700 = 0.6 × 700 = 420 students

Step 4: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The number of students in the school hall was 1000.
- The hall had 3 entrances/exits: A, B, and C.
- 30% of the students went out through exit A.
- 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B.
- The rest went out through exit C.

Step 1: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
30% of 1000 students = 0.30 × 1000 = 300 students

Step 2: Calculate the number of students remaining after exit A.
Remaining students = Total students - Students who went out through exit A
Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700 students

Step 3: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B.
3/5 of the remaining 700 students = (3/5) × 700 = 420 students

Step 4: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C.
Students who went out through exit C = Total

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The total number of students in the hall is 1000.

2. 30% of the students went out through exit A.
   * 30% of 1000 = 0.30 x 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.

3. The remaining students are 1000 - 300 = 700.

4. 3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B.
   * 3/5 of 700 = 0.6 x 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.

5. The remaining students went out through exit C.
   * The remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280 students went out through exit C.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.
