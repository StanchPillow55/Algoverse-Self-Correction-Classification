Question ID: 994

Question:
Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous are the three little wolves who live in the forest and howl at the moon every night. When Tobias howls, each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds.  Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.  And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?


Reference Answer:
Chikote howls for 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 seconds.
Igneous howls for 20+40=<<20+40=60>>60 seconds.
In total, the combined length of time, in seconds, of the three wolves' howls is 20+40+60=<<20+40+60=120>>120 seconds.
Thus, the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls is 120/60=<<120/60=2>>2 minutes.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
- Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
- Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.

Step 1: Calculate the length of Chikote's howl.
Chikote's howl = 2 × Tobias' howl
Chikote's howl = 2 × 20 seconds = 40 seconds

Step 2: Calculate the length of Igneous' howl.
Igneous' howl = Tobias' howl + Chikote's howl
Igneous' howl = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds

Step 3: Calculate the combined length of the three wolves' howls.
Combined length = Tobias' howl + Chikote's howl + Igneous' howl
Combined length = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds

Step 4: Convert the

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tobias howls for 20 seconds per howl.
- Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
- Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.

Step 1: Calculate the duration of Chikote's howl.
Chikote's howl duration = 2 × Tobias' howl duration
Chikote's howl duration = 2 × 20 seconds = 40 seconds

Step 2: Calculate the duration of Igneous' howl.
Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds

Step 3: Calculate the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls.
Combined length of time = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
Combined length of time = 20 seconds + 40

Step 3: Calculate the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls.
Combined length of time = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
Combined length of time = 20 seconds + 40
