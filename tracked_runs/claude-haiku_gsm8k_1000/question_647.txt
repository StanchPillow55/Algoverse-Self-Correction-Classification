Question ID: 265

Question:
Mrs. Cruz is looking for a house that will not go beyond her $400 000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $350 000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?


Reference Answer:
The brokerage fee is $350 000 x 5/100 = $<<350000*5/100=17500>>17500.
The transfer fee is $350 000 x 12/100 = $<<350000*12/100=42000>>42000.
The total price of the house is $350 000 + $17500 + $42000 = $409 500.
So, it is $409 500 - $400 000 = $<<409500-400000=9500>>9500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the house, including the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, and then compare it to Mrs. Cruz's budget.

Given information:
- Selling price of the house: $350,000
- Brokerage fee: 5% of the selling price
- Transfer fee: 12% of the selling price
- Mrs. Cruz's budget: $400,000

Step 1: Calculate the brokerage fee.
Brokerage fee = 5% of the selling price
Brokerage fee = 0.05 × $350,000 = $17,500

Step 2: Calculate the transfer fee.
Transfer fee = 12% of the selling price
Transfer fee = 0.12 × $350,000 = $42,000

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the house.
Total cost = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total cost = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

Step 4: Calculate the difference between the total cost and Mrs
