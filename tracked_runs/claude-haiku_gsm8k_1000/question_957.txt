Question:
Lisa and Peter are selling chocolate bars door to door. Lisa sold three and a half boxes of chocolate bars, and Peter sold four and a half boxes. They sold 64 chocolate bars together. How many chocolate bars are in a box?


Reference Answer:
Let B stand for the number of chocolate bars in a box.
Lisa sold 3 1/2 * B bars.
Peter sold 4 1/2 * B bars.
Together, they sold 3 1/2 * B + 4 1/2 * B = 8B = 64 bars.
Therefore, there are B = 64 / 8 = <<64/8=8>>8 chocolate bars in a box.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of chocolate bars in a box.

Given information:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes of chocolate bars.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes of chocolate bars.
- Together, they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars.

Step 1: Find the total number of boxes sold.
Total boxes sold = Lisa's boxes + Peter's boxes
Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes

Step 2: Find the total number of chocolate bars sold.
Total chocolate bars sold = 64

Step 3: Find the number of chocolate bars in a box.
Number of chocolate bars in a box = Total chocolate bars sold / Total boxes sold
Number of chocolate bars in a box = 64 / 8 = 8 chocolate bars per box

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in a box is 8.

Final answer: There are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes of chocolate bars.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes of chocolate bars.
- Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars.

To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we need to set up an equation and solve for the unknown.

Step 1: Find the total number of boxes sold.
Total boxes sold = Lisa's boxes + Peter's boxes
Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the total number of chocolate bars sold.
Total chocolate bars sold = Number of chocolate bars per box × Total boxes sold
64 = Number of chocolate bars per box × 8

Step 3: Solve for the number of chocolate bars per box.
64 = Number of chocolate bars per box × 8
Number of chocolate bars per box = 64 / 8
Number of chocolate bars per box = 8

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in a box is 8.
