Question ID: 953

Question:
Kim sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room. Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. She is a sleepwalker. One day, after reviewing the cameras, she finds that she woke up that day and was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am.  Also, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?


Reference Answer:
Out of 24 hours in a day, 10 pm represents 22 hours.
Until 12 p.m. or 24 hours, Kim slept 24 - 22 = <<24-22=2>>2 hours.
In total, Kim usually sleeps 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 hours a day.
In minutes, Kim usually sleeps 8 * 60 = <<8*60=480>>480 minutes
Kim was sleepwalking for a total of 38 - 15 = <<38-15=23>>23 minutes.
Within her usual sleep routine, Kim was sleepwalking or awake a total of 23 + 5 =<<23+5=28>>28 minutes.
On that day, Kim slept in her bed for 480 - 28 = <<480-28=452>>452 minutes.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total time Kim spent sleeping on her bed that day.

Given information:
- Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
- On the day in question, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom.
- She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.

Step 1: Calculate the usual sleeping time.
Usual sleeping time = 6 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 8 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time she woke up earlier.
Time she woke up earlier = 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

Step 3: Calculate the time she was actually sleeping on her bed.
Time she was sleeping on her bed = 5:55 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 7 hours and 55 minutes

Step 4: Subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
- On the day in question, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom.
- Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Kim usually sleeps.
Usual sleep time = 6 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 8 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time Kim actually slept on the bed that day.
Usual wake up time = 6 a.m.
Actual wake up time = 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.
Time spent sleeping on the bed = 5:55 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 7 hours and 55 minutes

Step 3: Subtract the time Kim was sleepwalking from the total time

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

- Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
- One day, she woke up and was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
- That day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom.

To find the total minutes she slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

Step 1: Calculate the usual sleep duration.
Usual sleep duration = 6 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 8 hours = 480 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time she was awake due to sleepwalking.
Time awake due to sleepwalking = 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the time she was awake due to waking up 5
