Question:
A toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys. 5 workers are available to work on the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?


Reference Answer:
In the first group of workers, each produces 6 toys * 10 hours = <<6*10=60>>60 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 60 toys * 2 workers = <<60*2=120>>120 toys.
In the second group of workers, each produces 4 toys * 10 hours = <<4*10=40>>40 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 40 toys * 2 workers = <<40*2=80>>80 toys.
Together, these two groups produce 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 toys.
If the order is still short, then all the workers combined have produced 400 ordered toys – 20 remaining toys = <<400-20=380>>380 toys.
This means the fifth worker produced 380 – 200 = <<380-200=180>>180 toys in total.
The fifth worker therefore produced 180 toys / 10 hours = <<180/10=18>>18 toys per hour.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then calculate the number of toys the fifth worker needs to produce to complete the order.

Given information:
- The order is for 400 toys.
- 5 workers are available to work on the order.
- 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour.
- 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour.
- All workers work a 10-hour shift.
- By the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to complete the order.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers.
Toys produced by the first two workers:
2 workers × 6 toys/hour × 10 hours = 120 toys

Toys produced by the other two workers:
2 workers × 4 toys/hour × 10 hours = 80 toys

Total toys produced by the first four workers:
120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

Step 2: Calculate the number of toys the fifth worker needs to produce.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The order is for 400 toys.
- There are 5 workers available.
- 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour.
- 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour.
- They all work a 10-hour shift.
- By the end of the shift, 20 more toys are needed to complete the order.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.
2 workers producing 6 toys/hour each for 10 hours = 2 × 6 × 10 = 120 toys
2 workers producing 4 toys/hour each for 10 hours = 2 × 4 × 10 = 80 toys
Total toys produced by first 4 workers = 120 + 80 = 200 toys

Step 2: Calculate the remaining number of toys needed to complete the order.
Total order - Toys produced by first 4 workers = 400 - 200 = 200 toys

Total toys produced by the first 4 workers: 120 + 80 = 200 toys

Step 2: Calculate the total number of toys needed to fulfill the order.
