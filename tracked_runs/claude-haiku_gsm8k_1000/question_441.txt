Question ID: 421

Question:
There were 50 cats on a rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, and later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. How many cats were left on the rock?


Reference Answer:
When four boats carried away 5 cats each, the total number of cats that left the rock is 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20 cats.
The number of cats remaining on the rock became 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30.
Later 3/5 of the remaining cats left the rock and ran after a mouse, a total of 3/5*30 = <<3/5*30=18>>18 cats.
The number of cats that remained on the rock is 30-18 = <<30-18=12>>12 cats
#### 12

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Initial number of cats on the rock:
   * 50 cats

2. Cats carried away by the boats:
   * 4 boats, each carrying 5 cats
   * 4 x 5 = 20 cats carried away

3. Remaining cats on the rock after the boats left:
   * 50 - 20 = 30 cats

4. Cats that ran after the mouse:
   * 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats
   * 3/5 x 30 = 18 cats

5. Cats left on the rock:
   * 30 - 18 = 12 cats

Therefore, the final answer is:
12 cats were left on the rock.
