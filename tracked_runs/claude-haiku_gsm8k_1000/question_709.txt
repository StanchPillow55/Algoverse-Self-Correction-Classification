Question ID: 1120

Question:
John visits his parents twice a month.  It takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph.  Considering the round trip, how many miles a month does he drive when visiting his parents?


Reference Answer:
His parents live 70*2=<<70*2=140>>140 miles away
So he drives 140*2=<<140*2=280>>280 miles a round trip
280*2 = <<280*2=560>>560 miles a month
#### 560

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance John drives when visiting his parents twice a month.

Given information:
- John visits his parents twice a month.
- It takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph.

Step 1: Calculate the distance for a one-way trip.
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance for the round trip.
Round trip distance = 2 × One-way distance
Round trip distance = 2 × 140 miles
Round trip distance = 280 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total distance John drives when visiting his parents twice a month.
Total distance = Round trip distance × Number of visits per month
Total distance = 280 miles × 2 visits
Total distance = 560 miles

Therefore, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents.

Final answer: John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents.
