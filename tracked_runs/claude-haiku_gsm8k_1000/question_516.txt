Question ID: 369

Question:
44 seniors need to receive awards.  Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.  Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost per frame.  2 of the seniors will also receive pins that are $5.  1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will need to receive cords that are $12 each.  How much will be spent on the senior gifts?


Reference Answer:
The cost per picture frame is $20 * 1.20 = $<<20*1.20=24>>24.
Total cost for the senior's picture frames is 44 seniors * $24 = $<<44*24=1056>>1056.
The cost for pins will be 2 seniors * $5 = $<<2*5=10>>10.
The number of seniors receiving cords is 1/4 * 44 = <<1/4*44=11>>11 seniors.
The total cost of cords is 11 seniors * $12 = $<<11*12=132>>132.
The total cost of gifts for seniors is $1056 + $10 + $132 = $<<1056+10+132=1198>>1198.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, including the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

Given information:
- 44 seniors need to receive awards.
- Each picture frame costs $20.
- The etching on each picture frame costs an additional 20% of the frame cost.
- 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
- 1/4 of the seniors are officers and will receive cords that cost $12 each.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the picture frames.
Cost of picture frames = 44 seniors × $20 per frame = $880

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the etching on the picture frames.
Etching cost per frame = 20% of $20 = $4
Total etching cost = 44 seniors × $4 per frame = $176

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the pins.
Cost of pins = 2 seniors × $5 per pin = $10

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the cords for the officers.
Number of officers =
