Question ID: 924

Question:
A three-toed sloth moves very slowly, and only eats when he is up in his tree.  For a meal of berries, it takes the sloth 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree.  Assuming he picks the same number of berries on each trip, what is the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground if he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours?


Reference Answer:
If one trip is 4-hours long, in 8 hours he can make 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 trips.
To collect 24 berries per 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 berries per trip.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Given information:
- It takes the sloth 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Step 1: Determine the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
Number of trips = Total time / Time per trip
Number of trips = 8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Step 2: Calculate the number of berries the sloth needs to pick up per trip.
Total berries needed / Number of trips = Berries per trip
24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12 berries.

Final answer: The sloth needs to pick up at least 12
