Question ID: 174

Question:
Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?


Reference Answer:
There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.
Billy only takes 5 seconds to cut the potatoes, so it takes 5 seconds * 60 potatoes / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes to cut the potatoes.
So it will take him a total of 90 minutes peeling + 5 minutes cutting = <<90+5=95>>95 minutes total prepping the potatoes.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all 60 potatoes.

Given information:
- Billy has 60 potatoes to peel and cut.
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes (90 seconds) to peel a potato.
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut up a potato.

Step 1: Calculate the total time it takes to peel all 60 potatoes.
Time to peel one potato × Number of potatoes = Total time to peel all potatoes
90 seconds × 60 potatoes = 5,400 seconds

Step 2: Calculate the total time it takes to cut up all 60 potatoes.
Time to cut up one potato × Number of potatoes = Total time to cut up all potatoes
5 seconds × 60 potatoes = 300 seconds

Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes to prep all 60 potatoes.
Total time to peel all potatoes + Total time to cut up all potatoes = Total time to prep all potatoes
5,400 seconds + 300

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Billy has 60 potatoes to peel and cut.
- It takes him 1.5 minutes (90 seconds) to peel each potato.
- It takes him 5 seconds to cut up each potato.

To find the total time it will take Billy to prep all 60 potatoes, we need to calculate the time for peeling and the time for cutting, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the time for peeling all 60 potatoes.
Time to peel 1 potato = 1.5 minutes = 90 seconds
Time to peel all 60 potatoes = 60 × 90 seconds = 5,400 seconds

Step 2: Calculate the time for cutting up all 60 potatoes.
Time to cut 1 potato = 5 seconds
Time to cut all 60 potatoes = 60 × 5 seconds = 300 seconds

Step 3: Calculate the total time by adding the time for peeling and the time for cutting.
Total time =
