Question:
In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, how many miles will Brian walk in seven days?


Reference Answer:
If Sofie walks 10 miles each day, she will walk 7*10 = <<10*7=70>>70 miles in seven days.
Since Sofie is walking twice as far as Brian, Brian will walk 70/2 = <<70/2=35>>35 miles in seven days.
#### 35

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Brian will walk in 7 days based on the given information about Sofie's walking distance.

Given information:
- In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.
- Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days.
Sofie's daily walking distance × Number of days = Total distance Sofie will walk
10 miles × 7 days = 70 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total distance Brian will walk in 7 days.
Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can divide Sofie's total distance by 2 to find Brian's total distance.
Total distance Sofie will walk / 2 = Total distance Brian will walk
70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

Final answer: Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.
- Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days.
Sofie's daily distance × Number of days = Total distance Sofie will walk
10 miles × 7 days = 70 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total distance Brian will walk in 7 days.
Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can divide Sofie's total distance by 2 to find Brian's total distance.
Sofie's total distance ÷ 2 = Brian's total distance
70 miles ÷ 2 = 35 miles

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.
