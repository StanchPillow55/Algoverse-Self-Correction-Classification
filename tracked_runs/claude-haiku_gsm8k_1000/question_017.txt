Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jean has 30 lollipops.
- Jean eats 2 of the lollipops.
- Jean wants to package the remaining lollipops in bags, with 2 lollipops per bag.

Step 1: Calculate the number of lollipops remaining after Jean eats 2.
Number of lollipops remaining = 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops

Step 2: Determine how many lollipops can be packaged in each bag.
Each bag will contain 2 lollipops.

Step 3: Calculate the number of bags Jean can fill with the remaining lollipops.
Number of bags = Number of lollipops remaining / Number of lollipops per bag
Number of bags = 28 / 2 = 14 bags

Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

Final answer: Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Jean starts with 30 lollipops.
2. Jean eats 2 of the lollipops, so now she has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops remaining.
3. Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag.
4. To calculate the number of bags Jean can fill, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2 (since each bag contains 2 lollipops).
5. 28 lollipops รท 2 lollipops per bag = 14 bags.

Therefore, the final answer is that Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.
