Question:
Candy has 15 light blue spools of thread, 45 dark blue spools of thread, 40 light green spools of thread, and 50 dark green spools of thread. What percent of her spools are blue?


Reference Answer:
First find the number of blue spools: 15 spools + 45 spools = <<15+45=60>>60 spools
Then find the total number of spools: 40 spools + 50 spools + 60 spools = <<40+50+60=150>>150 spools
Then divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 60 spools / 150 spools * 100% = 40%
#### 40

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of spools Candy has and then calculate the percentage of blue spools.

Given information:
- Candy has 15 light blue spools of thread.
- Candy has 45 dark blue spools of thread.
- Candy has 40 light green spools of thread.
- Candy has 50 dark green spools of thread.

Step 1: Find the total number of spools Candy has.
Total number of spools = Light blue spools + Dark blue spools + Light green spools + Dark green spools
Total number of spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools

Step 2: Find the total number of blue spools.
Total number of blue spools = Light blue spools + Dark blue spools
Total number of blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60 spools

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of blue spools.
Percentage of blue spools = (Total number of blue spools / Total number of spools) Ã— 100
Percentage of

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Candy has 15 light blue spools of thread
- Candy has 45 dark blue spools of thread
- Candy has 40 light green spools of thread
- Candy has 50 dark green spools of thread

To find the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of spools Candy has
2. Calculate the total number of blue spools
3. Divide the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools
4. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage

Step 1: Calculate the total number of spools Candy has
Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green)
Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools

Step 2: Calculate the total number of blue spools
Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. We need to find the total number of spools Candy has:
   * 15 light blue spools
   * 45 dark blue spools
   * 40 light green spools
   * 50 dark green spools
   * Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools

2. Now we need to find the total number of blue spools:
   * Light blue spools: 15
   * Dark blue spools: 45
   * Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60 spools

3. To find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the total blue spools by the total spools and multiply by 100:
   * Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue.
