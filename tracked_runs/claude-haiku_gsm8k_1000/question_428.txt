Question ID: 692

Question:
A certain company is in the business of selling fresh fruit. One crate of such fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. The price for such a crate depends on the price of its individual fruits. One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?


Reference Answer:
The price for apples in the crate would be 12 * 0.5 = $<<12*0.5=6>>6.
Cost of banana is 0.5 * 2 = $<<0.5*2=1>>1.
So the bananas in this crate cost 5 * 1 = $<<5*1=5>>5.
One orange is three times more expensive than a banana, so it costs 1 * 3 = $<<1*3=3>>3.
So for the oranges in the crate, one needs to pay 7 * 3 = $<<7*3=21>>21.
So the whole crate costs 6 + 5 + 21 = $<<6+5+21=32>>32.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of each type of fruit and then calculate the total cost of the crate.

Given information:
- One crate of fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges.
- The price of one apple is $0.5.
- The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple.
- The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana.

Step 1: Find the price of one banana.
Price of one banana = 2 × Price of one apple
Price of one banana = 2 × $0.5 = $1

Step 2: Find the price of one orange.
Price of one orange = 3 × Price of one banana
Price of one orange = 3 × $1 = $3

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the crate.
Cost of 5 bananas = 5 × $1 = $5
Cost of 12 apples = 12 × $0.5 = $6
Cost of 7 oranges = 7 ×

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- 1 crate of fruit contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges.
- The price of 1 apple is $0.5.
- The price of 1 banana is twice the price of 1 apple.
- The price of 1 orange is three times the price of 1 banana.

Step 1: Calculate the price of 1 banana.
Price of 1 banana = 2 × Price of 1 apple
Price of 1 banana = 2 × $0.5 = $1

Step 2: Calculate the price of 1 orange.
Price of 1 orange = 3 × Price of 1 banana
Price of 1 orange = 3 × $1 = $3

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate.
Cost of 5 bananas = 5 × $1 = $5
Cost of 12 apples = 12 × $0.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Determine the cost of each fruit:
   - Banana: 2 x $0.5 = $1 per banana
   - Apple: $0.5 per apple
   - Orange: 3 x $1 = $3 per orange

2. Calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
   - Bananas: 5 x $1 = $5
   - Apples: 12 x $0.5 = $6
   - Oranges: 7 x $3 = $21

3. Add up the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
   - Total cost = $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit would be $32.
