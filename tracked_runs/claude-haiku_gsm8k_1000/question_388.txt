Question:
Tim gets a promotion that offers him a 5% raise on his $20000 a month salary.  It also gives him a bonus worth half a month's salary. How much money will he make in a year?


Reference Answer:
The promotion increased his monthly salary by 20000*.05=$<<20000*0.05=1000>>1000
So his new salary is 20000+1000=$<<20000+1000=21000>>21000 a month
So he makes 21000*12=$<<21000*12=252000>>252,000 a year
The bonus is worth 21000*.5=$<<21000*.5=10500>>10500
So he makes 252,000+10,500=$<<252000+10500=262500>>262,500 for the year
#### 262500

Given information:
- Tim's current salary is $20,000 per month.
- He gets a 5% raise on his salary.
- He also gets a bonus worth half a month's salary.

Step 1: Calculate the new monthly salary after the 5% raise.
New monthly salary = Current monthly salary + (Current monthly salary × Raise percentage)
New monthly salary = $20,000 + ($20,000 × 0.05)
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000
New monthly salary = $21,000

Step 2: Calculate the bonus amount.
Bonus = Half a month's salary
Bonus = $21,000 ÷ 2
Bonus = $10,500

Step 3: Calculate the total annual income.
Annual income = (New monthly salary × 12 months) + Bonus
Annual income = ($21,000 × 12) + $10,500
Annual income = $252,000 + $10,500
Annual income = $262,500

Given information:
- Tim's original monthly salary is $20,000.
- He gets a 5% raise on his salary.
- He also gets a bonus worth half a month's salary.

Step 1: Calculate the new monthly salary after the 5% raise.

New monthly salary = Original monthly salary + (Original monthly salary × Raise percentage)
New monthly salary = $20,000 + ($20,000 × 0.05)
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000
New monthly salary = $21,000

Step 2: Calculate the bonus amount.
Bonus = Half a month's salary
Bonus = $21,000 / 2
