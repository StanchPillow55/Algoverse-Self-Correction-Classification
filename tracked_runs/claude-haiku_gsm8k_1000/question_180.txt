Question:
An interior design firm offers installation for $129.00.  It includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.  They will install additional items for an extra $15.00 per item.  Angela has 6 mirrors and 2 chandeliers and 20 pictures that she needs installed/hung.  How much will this cost her?


Reference Answer:
The service includes 4 mirrors and she has 6 so that's 6-4 = <<6-4=2>>2 extra mirrors
An additional item is an extra $15.00 so that's 2*15 = $30.00
The service includes 1 chandelier and she has 2 so that's 2-1 = 1 extra chandelier
An additional item is an extra $15.00 so that's 1*15 = $<<1*15=15.00>>15.00
The service includes 10 pictures and she has 20 to that's 20-10 = <<20-10=10>>10 extra pictures
An additional item is an extra $15.00 so that's 10*15 = $<<10*15=150.00>>150.00
The service costs $129.00 and the extra mirrors are $30.00, the chandelier is $15.00 and the pictures are $150.00 for a total of 129+30+15+150 = $<<129+30+15+150=324.00>>324.00

Extra pictures = 20 - 10 = 10
Total extra items = 2 + 1 + 10 = 13

Basic installation package cost = $129.00

Step 2: Calculate the number of additional items Angela needs installed.
Additional items = (6 mirrors - 4 mirrors) + (2 chandeliers - 1 chandelier) + (20 pictures - 10 pictures) = 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 items

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the additional items.
Cost of additional items = 13 items × $15.00 per item = $195.00
