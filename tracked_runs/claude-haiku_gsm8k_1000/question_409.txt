Question ID: 106

Question:
John has 3 boxes.  Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.  The walls are 1 inch thick.  What is the total inner volume of all 3 boxes?


Reference Answer:
The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension
So each box has 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 inch width
It also has a 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 inch height
Finally, it has a 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 inch depth
So the inner volume of one box is 4*3*2=<<4*3*2=24>>24 cubic inches
So in total the inner volume of the 3 boxes is 3*24=<<3*24=72>>72 cubic inches
#### 72

Response:
Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- John has 3 boxes.
- Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
- The walls of each box are 1 inch thick.

To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the inner dimensions of each box.
Outer dimensions of each box:
- Length = 5 inches
- Width = 6 inches
- Height = 4 inches

Inner dimensions of each box:
- Length = 5 inches - 1 inch (wall thickness) - 1 inch (wall thickness) = 3 inches
- Width = 6 inches - 1 inch (wall thickness) - 1 inch (wall thickness) = 4 inches
- Height = 4 inches - 1 inch (wall thickness) - 1 inch (wall thickness) = 2 inches

Step 2: Calculate the inner volume of each box.
Inner volume of each box = Length × Width × Height

Given information:
- John has 3 boxes.
- Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
- The walls of each box are 1 inch thick.

To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to:
1. Calculate the inner dimensions of each box.
2. Calculate the inner volume of each box.
3. Multiply the inner volume of each box by 3 to get the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

Step 1: Calculate the inner dimensions of each box.
Outer dimensions of each box:
- Length: 5 inches
- Width: 6 inches
- Height: 4 inches

Inner dimensions of each box:
- Length: 5 inches - (1 inch × 2) = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - (1 inch × 2) = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - (1 inch × 2) = 2 inches

Step 2: Calculate the inner volume of
