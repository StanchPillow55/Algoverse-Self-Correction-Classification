Question:
Jeremy saw 12 birds in their backyard and threw a stone at them, scaring away 1/3 of that number. A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. How many birds are now in the backyard?


Reference Answer:
The total number of birds scared away after he threw the stone at them is 1/3 * 12 = <<1/3*12=4>>4 birds.
The total number of birds remaining is 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 birds.
If 20 more birds joined, the total number of birds in the backyard will become 8 + 20 = <<8+20=28>>28 birds.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Jeremy saw 12 birds in their backyard.
- He threw a stone at them, scaring away 1/3 of that number.
- A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds.

Step 1: Calculate the number of birds that were scared away.
Number of birds scared away = 1/3 of 12 birds
Number of birds scared away = 1/3 Ã— 12 = 4 birds

Step 2: Calculate the number of birds that remained in the backyard after the stone was thrown.
Number of birds remaining = Total birds - Birds scared away
Number of birds remaining = 12 - 4 = 8 birds

Step 3: Calculate the total number of birds in the backyard after the additional 20 birds joined.
Total birds in the backyard = Birds remaining + Additional birds
Total birds in the backyard = 8 + 20 = 28 birds

Therefore, the final answer is that there are now 28 birds in the backyard.
