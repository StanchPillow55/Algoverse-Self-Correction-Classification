Question ID: 866

Question:
Together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. If Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn does, how many books does Fawn have?


Reference Answer:
Let x = the number of books Anne has.
Then x + 25 + x + 12 + x = 85
3x + 37 = 85
3x = 48
x = 48 / 3 = <<48/3=16>>16 books
Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.
#### 28

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books.
- Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Step 1: Let's represent the number of books each person has.
Let x = the number of books Anne has.
Then, Sofie has x + 25 books, and Fawn has x + 12 books.

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the total number of books.
Total books = Sofie's books + Anne's books + Fawn's books
85 = (x + 25) + x + (x + 12)
85 = 3x + 37

Step 3: Solve for x, the number of books Anne has.
3x + 37 = 85
3x = 48
x = 16

Step 4: Find the number of books Fawn has.
Fawn has x + 12 books
Fawn has 16

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books.
- Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's represent the number of books each person has as follows:
- Sofie has x books
- Anne has x - 25 books
- Fawn has x - 12 books

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the total number of books.
Total books = Sofie's books + Anne's books + Fawn's books
85 = x + (x - 25) + (x - 12)

Step 2: Simplify the equation.
85 = 3x - 37

Step 3: Solve for x (the number of books Fawn has).
3x - 37 = 85
3x = 122
x = 40.67

Since we can't have a fractional number of books, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.
x = 40
