Question:
A pound of almonds costs $10 while a pound of walnuts costs $15. How much more does it cost for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts?


Reference Answer:
One-half pound of almonds cost $10/2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.
One-fifth pound of almonds cost $10/5 = $<<10/5=2>>2.
A one-third pound of walnuts costs $15/3 = $<<15/3=5>>5.
So, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $5 + $5 = $10.
And 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $2 + $5 = $7.
Therefore, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $10 - $7 = $3 more than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 1 pound of almonds costs $10
- 1 pound of walnuts costs $15

Mixture 1:
- 1/2 pound of almonds
- 1/3 pound of walnuts

Mixture 2:
- 1/5 pound of almonds
- 1/3 pound of walnuts

Step 1: Calculate the cost of Mixture 1.
Cost of 1/2 pound of almonds = (1/2) × $10 = $5
Cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts = (1/3) × $15 = $5
Total cost of Mixture 1 = $5 + $5 = $10

Step 2: Calculate the cost of Mixture 2.
Cost of 1/5 pound of almonds = (1/5) × $10 = $2
Cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts = (1/3) × $15 = $5
Total cost of

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the first mixture.
1/2 pound of almonds at $10 per pound = $5
1/3 pound of walnuts at $15 per pound = $5
Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the second mixture.
1/5 pound of almonds at $10 per pound = $2
1/3 pound of walnuts at $15 per pound = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Step 3: Calculate the difference in cost between the two mixtures.
Difference in cost = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture
Difference in cost = $10 - $7 = $3

Therefore, the mixture of 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts.
