Question ID: 640

Question:
Bill is ordering a new truck. He has decided to purchase a two-ton truck with several added features: a king cab upgrade, a towing package, leather seats, running boards, and the upgraded exterior light package.  The base price of the truck is $30,000, and the other features are at extra cost. The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500.  What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?


Reference Answer:
The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, at a cost of $7,500/3=$<<7500/3=2500>>2500.
The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats at a cost of $2500-$500=$2000
The total cost of the truck is $30,000+$7500+$2500+$2000+$1500=$<<30000+7500+2500+2000+1500=43500>>43,500
#### 43,500

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and then add them to the base price of the truck to find the total cost.

Given information:
- Base price of the truck: $30,000
- King cab upgrade: $7,500
- Leather seats: one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
- Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats
- Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the leather seats.
Cost of leather seats = One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
Cost of leather seats = $7,500 / 3 = $2,500

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the running boards.
Cost of running boards = Cost of leather seats - $500
Cost of running boards = $2,500 - $500 = $2,000

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the truck.
Total cost = Base price + King cab upgrade + Leather seats + Running boards + Upgraded exterior light package
Total cost = $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- Base price of the truck: $30,000
- King cab upgrade: $7,500
- Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
- Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats
- Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the leather seats.
Cost of leather seats = One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
Cost of leather seats = $7,500 / 3 = $2,500

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the running boards.
Cost of running boards = Cost of leather seats - $500
Cost of running boards = $2,500 - $500 = $2,000

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the truck.
Total cost = Base price + King cab upgrade + Leather seats + Running boards + Upgraded exterior light package
Total cost = $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,500

Therefore,
