Question ID: 448

Question:
A salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576. He sold 17 of them for $20 at a flash sale on Monday, and the rest were sold to a department store for $25 each throughout the rest of the week. How much money, in dollars, was the salesman's profit?


Reference Answer:
The salesman made 17 × $20 = $<<17*20=340>>340 at the flash sale on Monday.
There were 48 - 17 = <<48-17=31>>31 sneakers left.
At the department store he made 31 × $25 = $<<31*25=775>>775 throughout the week.
In total he made $340 + $775 = $<<340+775=1115>>1115.
The profit made by the salesman was $1115 - $576 = $<<1115-576=539>>539.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue the salesman earned from selling the sneakers and then subtract the cost of the case of sneakers to find the profit.

Given information:
- The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.
- He sold 17 of them for $20 each at a flash sale on Monday.
- The remaining sneakers were sold to a department store for $25 each.

Step 1: Calculate the revenue from the flash sale.
Revenue from flash sale = 17 sneakers × $20 per sneaker = $340

Step 2: Calculate the revenue from the department store sale.
Number of sneakers sold to the department store = 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers
Revenue from department store sale = 31 sneakers × $25 per sneaker = $775

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue.
Total revenue = Revenue from flash sale + Revenue from department store sale
Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1,115

Step 4: Calculate the profit.
Profit = Total revenue - Cost of the case of sneakers

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.
   * This means the cost per sneaker is $576 / 48 = $12

2. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each during the flash sale on Monday.
   * Revenue from flash sale = 17 x $20 = $340

3. The remaining 31 sneakers were sold to a department store for $25 each.
   * Revenue from department store = 31 x $25 = $775

4. Total revenue = Revenue from flash sale + Revenue from department store
   * Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1,115

5. Total cost = Cost of 48 sneakers
   * Total cost = $576

6. Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   * Profit = $1,115 - $576 = $539

Therefore, the salesman's profit is $539.
