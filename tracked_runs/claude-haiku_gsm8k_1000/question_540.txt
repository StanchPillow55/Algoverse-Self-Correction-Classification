Question:
Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays.  On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class.  How many hours a week did she have dance practice?


Reference Answer:
She had practice for 1 hour on Tuesday and 2 hours on Thursday so she practiced for 1+2 = <<1+2=3>>3 hours
Saturday's class was twice as long as Tuesday's so she danced 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 hours on Saturday
In one week she danced 3 hours on the weekdays and 2 hours on the weekend for a total of 3+2 = <<3+2=5>>5 hours

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour on Tuesdays.
- Hallie had dance practice for 2 hours on Thursdays.
- On Saturdays, Hallie had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class.

Step 1: Calculate the duration of Hallie's Saturday dance practice.
Duration of Saturday dance practice = 2 × Duration of Tuesday dance practice
Duration of Saturday dance practice = 2 × 1 hour = 2 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total hours of dance practice per week.
Total hours of dance practice per week = Duration of Tuesday dance practice + Duration of Thursday dance practice + Duration of Saturday dance practice
Total hours of dance practice per week = 1 hour + 2 hours + 2 hours = 5 hours

Therefore, Hallie had a total of 5 hours of dance practice per week.

Final answer: Hallie had a total of 5 hours of dance practice per week.
