Question ID: 960

Question:
A pirate crew is digging for buried treasure on the island marked X on a map. They dug ten holes the first day, thirteen holes the second day, and eight holes the third day. They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in. On the fourth day of digging, they unearthed a treasure chest full of gold, jewels, and an aged hat. The island had four times as many holes by then as it did at the end of the first day. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?


Reference Answer:
Let X mark the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.
The island had 4 * 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 holes when they found the treasure.
They dug 10 + 13 + 8 = <<10+13+8=31>>31 holes the first three days.
After filling in 2 holes, they had 31 - 2 = <<31-2=29>>29 holes dug.
When they found the treasure, they had 29 + X = 40 holes dug.
Thus, the pirates dug 40 - 29 = <<40-29=11>>11 holes on the fourth day.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of holes dug by the pirates and then calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

Given information:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes.
- The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
Holes dug on the first day = 10
Holes dug on the second day = 13
Holes dug on the third day = 8
Holes filled in on the third day = 2
Total holes dug by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes

Step 2: Calculate the number of holes on the island at the end of the fourth day.
Number of holes at the end of the first day = 10

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, the pirates dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, the pirates dug 8 holes, but then filled in 2 holes.
- On the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
Holes dug on the first day: 10
Holes dug on the second day: 13
Holes dug on the third day: 8
Holes filled in on the third day: 2
Total holes dug by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes

Step 2: Calculate the number of holes on the island at the end of the first day.
Number of holes at the end of the first day = 10 holes

Step 3: Calculate the number of holes on the island on the fourth

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, the pirates dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, the pirates dug 8 holes, but they also filled in 2 holes.
- On the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
Holes dug on the first day: 10
Holes dug on the second day: 13
Holes dug on the third day: 8
Holes filled in on the third day: 2
Total holes dug by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes

Step 2: Calculate the number of holes at the end of the first day.
Total holes dug by the end of the third day = 29 holes
The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as
