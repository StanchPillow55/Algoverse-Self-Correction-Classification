Question ID: 163

Question:
In a room, there are various toys: 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and a doll. The doll cost as much as 3 action figures and one red car cost $4. How much are all toys worth, of an action figure costs $5?


Reference Answer:
Three actions figures are worth 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15, as much as the doll.
The red cars are worth 5 * 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
So all toys are worth 20 + 15 + 15 = $<<20+15+15=50>>50.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of each type of toy and then calculate the total worth of all the toys in the room.

Given information:
- There are 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and 1 doll.
- One red car costs $4.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
- The cost of an action figure is $5.

Step 1: Find the cost of the red cars.
Cost of 1 red car = $4
Cost of 5 red cars = 5 × $4 = $20

Step 2: Find the cost of the action figures.
Cost of 1 action figure = $5
Cost of 3 action figures = 3 × $5 = $15

Step 3: Find the cost of the doll.
The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
Cost of the doll = 3 × $5 = $15

Step 4: Calculate the total worth of all the toys.
Total worth = Cost of red cars + Cost of action figures + Cost of the doll

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- There are 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and 1 doll in the room.
- One red car costs $4.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
- An action figure costs $5.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the red cars.
Cost of 1 red car = $4
Cost of 5 red cars = 5 × $4 = $20

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the action figures.
Cost of 1 action figure = $5
Cost of 3 action figures = 3 × $5 = $15

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the doll.
The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
Cost of the doll = 3 × $5 = $15

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of all the toys.
Total cost = Cost of red cars + Cost of action figures + Cost of the doll
Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15 = $

Given information:
- There are 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and 1 doll in the room.
- One red car costs $4.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
- The cost of one action figure is $5.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the red cars.
Cost of 1 red car = $4
Cost of 5 red cars = 5 × $4 = $20

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the action figures.
Cost of 1 action figure = $5
Cost of 3 action figures = 3 × $5 = $15

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the doll.
The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
