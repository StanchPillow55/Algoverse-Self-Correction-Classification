Question ID: 46

Question:
Candice put 80 post-it notes in her purse before she headed out to her job at the coffee shop.  On her way, she stopped off at the store and purchased a package of Post-it notes;  At work, she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.  If she had 23 post-it notes remaining overall, how many Post-it notes were in the package that she purchased?


Reference Answer:
Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.
Then, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.
And if she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left, then 80+x=220+23
Subtracting 80 from each side of the equation, we see that x=220+23-80=<<220+23-80=163>>163 Post-it notes.

- She purchased a package of post-it notes at the store.
- At work, she placed a single post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.
- She had 23 post-it notes remaining overall.

Step 1: Calculate the number of post-it notes used at work.
Number of post-it notes used at work = 220

Step 2: Calculate the total number of post-it notes Candice had before using them at work.
Total post-it notes before work = 80 (in her purse) + Unknown number from the package purchased

Step 3: Calculate the number of post-it notes used from the original 80 in her purse.

Number of post-it notes used at work = 220

Step 2: Calculate the total number of post-it notes Candice had before using them at work.
Total post-it notes before work = 80 (in purse) + Unknown number from package
Total post-it notes before work = 80 + Unknown

Step 3: Calculate the number of post-it notes used at work from the total before work.
Total post-it notes before work - Post-it notes used at work = Post-it notes remaining
