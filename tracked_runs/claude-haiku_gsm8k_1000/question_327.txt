Question ID: 260

Question:
Two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies. Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. How many cups of flour will Carla need to bake the cookies today and tomorrow?


Reference Answer:
Carla will bake a total of 36 + 30 = <<36+30=66>>66 cookies.
Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, then 66 cookies are equal to 66/12 = <<66/12=5.5>>5.5 dozens.
Hence, Carla will need 5.5 x 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 cups of flour.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies.
- Carla is making 36 cookies today.
- Carla is making 30 cookies tomorrow.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of flour needed for the cookies made today.
Cookies made today = 36
Flour needed for 1 dozen (12) cookies = 2 cups
Flour needed for 36 cookies = (36 ÷ 12) × 2 = 6 cups

Step 2: Calculate the amount of flour needed for the cookies made tomorrow.
Cookies made tomorrow = 30
Flour needed for 1 dozen (12) cookies = 2 cups
Flour needed for 30 cookies = (30 ÷ 12) × 2 = 5 cups

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of flour needed for the cookies made today and tomorrow.
Total flour needed = Flour needed for cookies made today + Flour needed for cookies made tomorrow
Total flour needed = 6 cups

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies.
2. Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow.
3. To find the total number of cookies Carla is making, we add the cookies for today and tomorrow:
   * 36 cookies + 30 cookies = 66 cookies

4. Now we need to find how many dozens of cookies that is:
   * 66 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5.5 dozens

5. Since we can't have a partial dozen, we round up to 6 dozens.

6. To find the total cups of flour needed, we multiply the number of dozens by the 2 cups per dozen:
   * 6 dozens x 2 cups per dozen = 12 cups of flour

Therefore, Carla will need 12 cups of flour to bake the 36 cookies today and the 30 cookies tomorrow.

   * 6 dozens x 2 cups/dozen = 12 cups of flour

Therefore, Carla will need 12 cups of flour to bake the 36 cookies today and the 30 cookies tomorrow.
