Question ID: 608

Question:
Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25. He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?


Reference Answer:
The price of the two clothing items totals 35 + 25 = <<35+25=60>>60 dollars before discount.
The total sale discount comes to 60 * 0.3 = <<60*0.3=18>>18 dollars.
The final sale price comes to 60 - 18 = <<60-18=42>>42 dollars.
Joe ends up with 50 - 42 = <<50-42=8>>8 dollars change.

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Joe has $50 to spend on an outfit for his field trip.
- There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store.
- The shirt he picks out has a price of $25.
- He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35.
- Sales tax is included.

Step 1: Calculate the discounted price of the shirt.
Original price of the shirt = $25
Discount percentage = 30%
Discounted price of the shirt = $25 - (30% of $25) = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the outfit before tax.
Cost of the shirt = $17.50
Cost of the shorts = $35
Total cost of the outfit before tax = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Joe has left after the purchase.
Joe's initial budget = $50
Total cost of the outfit = $52.50
Amount of money Joe has left = $50 - $52

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Joe has $50 to spend on an outfit for his field trip.
- There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store.
- The shirt he picks out has a price of $25.
- He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35.
- Sales tax is included.

Step 1: Calculate the discounted price of the shirt.
Original price of the shirt = $25
Discount percentage = 30%
Discounted price of the shirt = $25 - (30% of $25) = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the outfit before tax.
Cost of the shirt = $17.50
Cost of the shorts = $35
Total cost before tax = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Joe has left after the purchase.
Joe's initial budget = $50
Total cost of the outfit = $52.50
Amount of money Joe has left = $50 - $52.
