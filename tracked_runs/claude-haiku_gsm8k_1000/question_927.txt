Question ID: 1100

Question:
Bobby takes a 30 min lunch and 2 15 minutes break per day at the office.  After 5 days, how many hours do his lunches and breaks add up to?


Reference Answer:
He has 2 15 minutes breaks per day so together they add up to 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30 minutes
He also has a 30-minute lunch every day so together with his 30-minute break he has a 30+30 = 60-minute break each day
Every day his breaks total 60 minutes and he takes these breaks 5 days per week so he takes 60*5 = <<60*5=300>>300 minutes of break time
60 minutes is in an hour so 300/60 = <<300/60=5>>5 hours of break time

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch per day.
- Bobby takes 2 15-minute breaks per day.
- We need to find the total time of his lunches and breaks after 5 days.

Step 1: Calculate the total time of his lunches per day.
Lunch time per day = 30 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total time of his breaks per day.
Break time per day = 2 × 15 minutes = 30 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time of his lunches and breaks per day.
Total time per day = Lunch time + Break time
Total time per day = 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the total time of his lunches and breaks after 5 days.
Total time after 5 days = Total time per day × 5 days
Total time after 5 days = 60 minutes × 5 days = 300 minutes

Step 5: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.
