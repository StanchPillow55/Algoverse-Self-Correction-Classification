Question ID: 977

Question:
Pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside.  Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles.  While on vacation, if she will be outside 4 hours a day over 8 days, how many bottles of sunscreen will she need to pack?


Reference Answer:
She will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days so that's 4*8 = <<4*8=32>>32 hours
She applies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour and she'll be outside for 32 hours so she needs 1*32 = <<1*32=32>>32 ounces of sunscreen
Her bottle holds 8 ounces of sunscreen and she needs 32 ounces so she will need to pack 32/8 = 4 bottles of sunscreen

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will need for her vacation and then determine the number of bottles she needs to pack.

Given information:
- Pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside.
- Pamela's sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles.
- Pamela will be outside for 4 hours a day over 8 days.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Pamela will be outside during her vacation.
Total hours outside = 4 hours per day × 8 days = 32 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will need for her vacation.
Total sunscreen needed = 1 ounce per hour × 32 hours = 32 ounces

Step 3: Calculate the number of 8-ounce bottles Pamela needs to pack.
Number of bottles needed = Total sunscreen needed / Size of each bottle
Number of bottles needed = 32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles

Therefore,
