Question ID: 52

Question:
Uriah's book bag is getting too heavy for him. He needs to remove 15 pounds from it. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each and his toys weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys does he need to remove?


Reference Answer:
30 comic books weigh 7.5 pounds because 30 x .25 = <<30*.25=7.5>>7.5
He needs to remove 7.5 more pounds because 15 - 7.5 = <<15-7.5=7.5>>7.5
He needs to remove 15 toys because 7.5 / .5 = <<15=15>>15
#### 15

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag.
- Comic books weigh 1/4 pound each.
- Toys weigh 1/2 pound each.
- Uriah removes 30 comic books.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of the 30 comic books that Uriah removed.
Weight of 30 comic books = 30 × 1/4 pound = 7.5 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the remaining weight that Uriah needs to remove.
Total weight to be removed = 15 pounds
Weight of 30 comic books removed = 7.5 pounds
Remaining weight to be removed = 15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the number of toys Uriah needs to remove.
Weight of each toy = 1/2 pound
Remaining weight to be removed = 7.5 pounds
Number of toys to be removed = Remaining weight to be removed / Weight of each toy
