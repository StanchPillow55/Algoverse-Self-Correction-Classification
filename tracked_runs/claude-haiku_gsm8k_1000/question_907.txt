Question ID: 405

Question:
Tyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game.  Each sandwich required 1 pound each of meat and cheese and would serve 4 people.  There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?


Reference Answer:
Each sandwich serves 4 people and he had 20 people in total to make food for so 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 sandwiches
1 pound of meat cost $7.00 per sandwich and he had to make 5 so 7*5 = $<<7*5=35.00>>35.00 for meat
1 pound of cheese cost $3.00 per sandwich and he had to make 5 so 3*5 = $<<3*5=15.00>>15.00 for cheese
When you add the meat and cheese together, he would spend 35+15 = $<<35+15=50.00>>50.00

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each muffaletta sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
- Each sandwich serves 4 people.
- There will be 20 people watching the game.
- The meat costs $7.00 per pound.
- The cheese costs $3.00 per pound.

Step 1: Calculate the number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people.
Number of people / Number of people per sandwich = Number of sandwiches
20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed.
Number of sandwiches × 1 pound of meat per sandwich = Total meat needed
5 sandwiches × 1 pound = 5 pounds of meat

Number of sandwiches × 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = Total cheese needed
5 sandwiches × 1 pound = 5 pounds of cheese

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese.
Cost of meat = Total meat neede

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and serves 4 people.
2. There will be 20 people watching the game.
3. The meat costs $7.00 per pound, and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound.

To find the total cost, we need to:
1. Calculate how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people.
2. Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese.

Step 1: Calculate the number of sandwiches needed.
* Each sandwich serves 4 people.
* 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches needed.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required.
* Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
* 5 sandwiches x 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat.
* 5 sandwiches x 1 pound of cheese
