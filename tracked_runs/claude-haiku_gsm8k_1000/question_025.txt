Question:
Carl buys ten packs of cookies. Each pack of cookies has six cookies inside. Each cookie cost $0.10. How much change does Carl receive if he pay with a $10 bill?


Reference Answer:
A pack of cookies costs 6 x $0.10 = $<<6*0.1=0.60>>0.60.
Thus, ten packs of cookies cost 10 x $0.6 = $<<10*0.6=6>>6.
Therefore, Carl will receive a $10 - $6 = $<<10-6=4>>4 change.

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carl buys 10 packs of cookies.
- Each pack of cookies has 6 cookies inside.
- Each cookie costs $0.10.
- Carl pays with a $10 bill.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies Carl bought.
Total number of cookies = Number of packs × Number of cookies per pack
Total number of cookies = 10 × 6 = 60 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the cookies.
Total cost of cookies = Total number of cookies × Cost per cookie
Total cost of cookies = 60 × $0.10 = $6.00

Step 3: Calculate the change Carl receives.
Change = Amount paid - Total cost of cookies
Change = $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

Therefore, the change Carl receives is $4.00.
