Question ID: 298

Question:
Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. She accepts the opening bid of $200 and continues bidding until she wins. The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time and 3 other people each bid once. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?


Reference Answer:
3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $<<200+300=500>>500.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the bidding process and calculate the final cost of the desk for Carmen.

Given information:
- The opening bid for the desk is $200.
- The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time.
- 3 other people each bid once.
- Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins.

Step 1: Determine the sequence of bids.
Opening bid: $200
Bid 1: $200 + $50 = $250 (by the first person)
Bid 2: $250 + $50 = $300 (by the second person)
Bid 3: $300 + $50 = $350 (by the third person)
Bid 4: $350 + $50 = $400 (by Carmen)

Step 2: Calculate the final cost of the desk for Carmen.
Final bid: $400

Therefore, the desk costs Carmen $400.

Final answer: The desk costs Carmen $400.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The opening bid for the antique desk is $200.
- The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time.
- 3 other people each bid once.
- Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins.

To find the final cost of the desk, we need to calculate the amount of each bid and the total number of bids.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of each bid.
Opening bid: $200
Bid increment: $50

Bid 1: $200 + $50 = $250
Bid 2: $250 + $50 = $300
Bid 3: $300 + $50 = $350
Bid 4: $350 + $50 = $400 (Carmen's winning bid)

Step 2: Calculate the total number of bids.
There are 4 bids in total, as Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the desk.
Total cost =

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The opening bid for the antique desk is $200.
- The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time.
- 3 other people each bid once.
- Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins.

To find the final cost of the desk, we need to calculate the amount of each bid and the total number of bids.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of each bid.
Opening bid: $200
First bid increase: $200 + $50 = $250
Second bid increase: $250 + $50 = $300
Third bid increase: $300 + $50 = $350

Step 2: Calculate the total number of bids.
There are 4 bids in total (3 other people's bids and Carmen's final winning bid).

Step 3: Calculate the final cost of the desk.
Final cost = Opening bid + (3 × Bid increase)
Final cost = $200 + (3 × $50)
Final cost = $200
