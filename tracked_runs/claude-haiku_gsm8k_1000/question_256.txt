Question ID: 1211

Question:
For one medical dosage, Saanvi had to combine 14 mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. How many mL of medicine would be in 8 doses?


Reference Answer:
First medicine = <<14=14>>14 mL
Second medicine = 3 * 14 = <<3*14=42>>42 mL
One dose = 14 + 42 = <<14+42=56>>56 mL
Eight doses = 8 * 56 = <<8*56=448>>448 mL
Eight doses of Saanvi's medicine contained 448 mL of medicine.

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- For one medical dosage, Saanvi had to combine 14 mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine.
- We need to find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of the second medicine.
Amount of the second medicine = 3 × 14 mL = 42 mL

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of medicine in one dose.
Total amount of medicine in one dose = 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of medicine in 8 doses.
Total amount of medicine in 8 doses = 8 × 56 mL = 448 mL

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses would be 448 mL.

Final answer: 448 mL
