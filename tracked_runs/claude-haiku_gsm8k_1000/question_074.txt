Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob to shingle a house.
- Rob takes 2 hours to shingle the house.

Step 1: Convert Rob's time from hours to minutes.
Rob's time = 2 hours
Rob's time in minutes = 2 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Step 2: Calculate double the time it takes Rob to shingle the house.
Double Rob's time = 2 × 120 minutes = 240 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes Royce to shingle the house.
Royce's time = Double Rob's time + 40 minutes
Royce's time = 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

Step 4: Convert Royce's time from minutes to hours and minutes.
Royce's time in hours = 280 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours and 40 minutes

Therefore, Royce takes 4 hours and
