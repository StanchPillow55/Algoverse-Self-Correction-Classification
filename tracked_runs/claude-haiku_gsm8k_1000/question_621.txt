Question:
Larry loves taking care of animals.  He has 3 cats.  He has 3 times as many dogs as cats.  He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.  He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits.  He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has.  How many pets does Larry have?


Reference Answer:
Larry has 3 cats and 3 times as many dogs as cats, for 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 dogs
Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than his 9 dogs, for 9-2=7 rabbits
Larry has 3 times as many fish as rabbits, for 3*7=<<7*3=21>>21 fish
Larry has 1 /3 as many gerbils as he has fish, for 21/3= 7 gerbils
Adding these all together, he has 9+7+21+7+3= <<9+7+21+7+3=47>>47 pets

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- Larry has 3 cats.
- Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats.
- Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.
- Larry has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits.
- Larry has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has.

Step 1: Calculate the number of dogs.
Number of dogs = 3 × Number of cats
Number of dogs = 3 × 3 = 9 dogs

Step 2: Calculate the number of rabbits.
Number of rabbits = Number of dogs - 2
Number of rabbits = 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits

Step 3: Calculate the number of fish.
Number of fish = 3 × Number of rabbits
Number of fish = 3 × 7 = 21 fish

Step 4: Calculate the number of gerbils.
Number of gerbils = 1/3 × Number of fish
Number of g

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.

2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so:
   * Number of dogs = 3 x 3 = 9 dogs

3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so:
   * Number of rabbits = 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits

4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so:
   * Number of fish = 3 x 7 = 21 fish

5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so:
   * Number of gerbils = 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils

Now, let's add up all the pets:
* 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets

Therefore, the total number of pets Larry has is 47.
