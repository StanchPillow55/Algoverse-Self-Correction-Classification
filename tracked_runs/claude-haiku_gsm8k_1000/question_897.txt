Question:
Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school and did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?


Reference Answer:
Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = <<6000=6000>>6,000 steps.
He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = <<10000-2000=8000>>8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = <<8000-6000=2000>>2,000 steps.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of steps Elliott took during his jog.

Given information:
- Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day.
- He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school.
- He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
- After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

Step 1: Calculate the number of steps Elliott had completed before his jog.
Steps completed on walks to and from school = 10,000 ÷ 2 = 5,000 steps
Steps completed on the short walk with his friend = 1,000 steps
Total steps completed before the jog = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps

Step 2: Calculate the number of steps Elliott had left to take after his jog.
Steps left to take = 2,000 steps

Step 3: Calculate the total number of steps Elliott took during his jog.
Total steps taken during the jog = Total steps goal - Steps completed before the j

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day.
- He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school.
- He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
- After his jog around the block, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

Step 1: Calculate the number of steps Elliott had completed before his jog.
Steps completed before jog = (10,000 / 2) + 1,000 = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps

Step 2: Calculate the number of steps Elliott had left to take after his jog.
Steps left to take = 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps

Step 3: Calculate the number of steps Elliott took during his jog.
Steps taken during jog = 4,000 steps

Therefore, Elliott took 4,000 steps during his jog around the block.

Step 1: Calculate the number of steps Elliott had completed before his jog.
Steps completed before jog = (10,000 / 2) + 1,000 = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps

Step 2: Calculate the number of steps Elliott had left to take after his jog.
Steps left to take = 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps

Step 3: Calculate the number of steps Elliott took during his jog.
Steps taken during jog = 4,000 steps

Therefore, Elliott took 4,000 steps during his jog around the block.
