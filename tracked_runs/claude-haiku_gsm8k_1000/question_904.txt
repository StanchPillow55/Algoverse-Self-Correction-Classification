Question ID: 694

Question:
Tomorrow, 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending a function at Mia’s restaurant. The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. If there are 8 high chairs, how many more chairs does she have to get?


Reference Answer:
Since there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = <<8*5=40>>40 regular chairs
The total number of both types of chairs is therefore 8 + 40 = <<8+40=48>>48 chairs
However, the total number of attendants will be 42 + 15 = <<42+15=57>>57 people
Mia will therefore need 57-48 = <<57-48=9>>9 more chairs

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of chairs required for the function and then calculate the number of additional chairs Mia needs to get.

Given information:
- There will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function.
- The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
- There are 8 high chairs.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of people attending the function.
Total number of people = Number of adults + Number of babies
Total number of people = 42 + 15 = 57 people

Step 2: Calculate the number of regular chairs.
Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 5 × Number of high chairs
Number of regular chairs = 5 × 8 = 40 regular chairs

Step 3: Calculate the total number of chairs required.
Total number of chairs required = Number of regular chairs + Number of high chairs
Total number of chairs required = 40 + 8 = 48 chairs

Step 4: Calculate the number of additional chairs Mia needs to get.
Number of additional chairs needed = Total number

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that there are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function.
2. The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
3. There are 8 high chairs.

To find the number of regular chairs, we can use the information that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs:
* Number of regular chairs = 5 x 8 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we need to find the total number of chairs needed for the 42 adults and 15 babies:
* Total chairs needed = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57 chairs

Finally, we can calculate the number of additional chairs Mia needs to get:
* Additional chairs needed = Total chairs needed - Number of regular chairs
* Additional chairs needed = 57 - 40 = 17 chairs

Therefore, Mia needs to get 17 more chairs for the function.

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending the function at Mia's restaurant.
- The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
- There are 8 high chairs.

Step 1: Find the total number of people attending the function.
Total people = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people

Step 2: Find the number of regular chairs.
Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 5 × 8 = 40 regular chairs

Step 3: Find the total number of chairs needed.
Total chairs needed = Number of adults + Number of high chairs
Total chairs needed = 42 + 8 = 50 chairs

Step 4: Find the number of additional chairs Mia needs to get.
Additional chairs needed = Total chairs needed - Total chairs available
Additional chairs needed = 50 - 40 = 10 chairs

Therefore, Mia needs to get 10 more chairs for the function.
