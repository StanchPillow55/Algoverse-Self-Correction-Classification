Question ID: 4

Question:
Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?


Reference Answer:
If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of feed required for the flock of 20 chickens and then subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals.

Given information:
- Each chicken is fed 3 cups of mixed chicken feed per day.
- In the morning, Wendi gives her flock 15 cups of feed.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives her flock 25 cups of feed.
- The size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of feed required for the flock per day.
Total feed required per day = Number of chickens × Feed per chicken per day
Total feed required per day = 20 chickens × 3 cups per chicken = 60 cups

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals.
Total feed given in the morning and afternoon = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

Step 3: Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal of the day.
Feed needed for the final meal = Total feed required per day - Total

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Wendi feeds each of her 20 chickens 3 cups of mixed feed per day.
- She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals.
- In the morning, she gives her flock 15 cups of feed.
- In the afternoon, she gives her flock 25 cups of feed.

To find the amount of feed needed for the final meal, we need to:
1. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the day.
2. Subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the day.
Total feed needed per day = Number of chickens × Feed per chicken per day
Total feed needed per day = 20 chickens × 3 cups per chicken = 60 cups

Step 2: Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal.
Feed needed for final meal = Total feed needed per day - Feed given in morning - Feed given in afternoon
Feed needed for final meal = 60 cups - 15 cups - 25

Total feed needed per day = 20 chickens × 3 cups per chicken = 60 cups

Step 2: Calculate the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
Feed given in the morning = 15 cups
Feed given in the afternoon = 25 cups
Total feed given in the morning and afternoon = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

Step 3: Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal.
Feed needed for the final meal = Total feed needed per day - Total feed given in the morning and afternoon
Feed needed for the final meal = 60 cups -
