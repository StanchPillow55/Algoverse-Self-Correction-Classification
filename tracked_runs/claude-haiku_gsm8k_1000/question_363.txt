Question ID: 1045

Question:
Three people divided an amount of $1920. The second took $80 more than the first and the third took twice what the second took. Calculate the share of the first one.


Reference Answer:
Let X be the amount of what the first took.
The second took X+<<+80=80>>80.
The third took (X+80)*2.
The total amount X + (X+80) + (X+80)*2 = 1920.
X + X + 80 + 2*X + 80*2 = 1920
X*4 + 240 = 1920.
X*4 = 1680.
X = <<420=420>>420.
#### 420

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the share of the first person.

Given information:
- The total amount is $1920.
- The second person took $80 more than the first person.
- The third person took twice what the second person took.

Let's define the variables:
- Let the share of the first person be x.
- The share of the second person is x + $80.
- The share of the third person is 2(x + $80).

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the total amount.
Total amount = Share of the first person + Share of the second person + Share of the third person
$1920 = x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80)

Step 2: Simplify the equation.
$1920 = x + x + $80 + 2x + 2($80)
$1920 = 4x + $240

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
$1920 = 4x + $240
$1680 = 4x
x = $420

Therefore, the share
