Question ID: 58

Question:
Stephen placed an online order for groceries.  His final bill came to $40.00.  Because this was through a delivery vendor, they tacked on a 25% fee to his final total and charged him $3.00 in delivery fees.  Stephen also added a $4.00 tip.  After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?


Reference Answer:
He spent $40.00 on groceries but they charged him a 25% fee so that's 40*.25 = $10.00
There is also a $3.00 delivery fee and a $4.00 tip for an extra $3 + $4 = $<<3+4=7.00>>7.00 in fees
His groceries were $40.00, there's a $10.00 fee plus another $7.00 in delivery/tip fees for a final total of $40 + $10 + $7 = $<<40+10+7=57.00>>57.00

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the final bill to find the original cost of the groceries.

Given information:
- The final bill came to $40.00.
- There was a 25% fee added to the final total.
- There was a $3.00 delivery fee.
- Stephen added a $4.00 tip.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount added to the original cost of the groceries.
Total added amount = 25% fee + Delivery fee + Tip
Total added amount = (0.25 × $40.00) + $3.00 + $4.00
Total added amount = $10.00 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $17.00

Step 2: Calculate the original cost of the groceries.
Original cost of groceries = Final bill - Total added amount
Original cost of groceries = $40.00 - $17.00 = $23.00

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries was $23.00.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Stephen's final bill came to $40.00
- The delivery vendor tacked on a 25% fee to the final total
- The delivery vendor charged $3.00 in delivery fees
- Stephen added a $4.00 tip

Step 1: Calculate the 25% fee on the $40.00 final bill.
25% of $40.00 = 0.25 × $40.00 = $10.00

Step 2: Calculate the total amount before the tip.
Final bill ($40.00) + 25% fee ($10.00) + Delivery fee ($3.00) = $53.00

Step 3: Calculate the final price including the tip.
Total amount before tip ($53.00) + Tip ($4.00) = $57.00

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries, including all the extra fees and the tip, is $57.00.
