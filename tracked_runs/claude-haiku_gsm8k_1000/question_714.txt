Question ID: 1096

Question:
Billy is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes. He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. If he takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off, and helps people on all the other days. How many people does he help? (Remember there are 31 days in March.)


Reference Answer:
First find the number of days between March 1st and April 19th: 31 days + 19 days = <<31+19=50>>50 days
Then subtract the percentage of time Billy takes off from 100% to find the percentage of time he works: 100% - 20% = 80%
Then multiply that number by 80% to find the number of days Billy works: 50 days * 80% = <<50*80*.01=40>>40 days
Then find how many people Billy can help per day: 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = <<2*3=6>>6 people/day
Then multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works to find the total number of people he helps: 6 people/day * 40 days = <<6*40=240>>240 people

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off, which is 20% of the total days.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Determine the number of people Billy can help per day.
5. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
Total days = 31 days in March + 19 days in April = 50 days

Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off, which is 20% of the total days.
Number of days off = 20% of 50 days = 0.20 Ã— 50 = 10 days

Step 3: Calculate the number of days Billy works.
Number of days worked = Total days - Days off = 50 days - 10 days = 40 days

Step 4: Determine the number of people Billy can help per day.
Billy can help 2 people per

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.
   * That means he can help 2 people x 3 hours = 6 people per day.

2. There are 31 days in March and 19 days in April (until April 19th).
   * That's a total of 31 + 19 = 50 days.

3. Billy takes 20% of the days off.
   * 20% of 50 days = 0.2 x 50 = 10 days off.

4. So, he helps people on the remaining 50 - 10 = 40 days.

5. On each of those 40 days, he helps 6 people.
   * 40 days x 6 people per day = 240 people.

Therefore, the final answer is that Billy helps 240 people.
