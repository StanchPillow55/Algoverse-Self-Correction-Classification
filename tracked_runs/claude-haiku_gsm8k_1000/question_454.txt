Question:
Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?


Reference Answer:
There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

The two events are:
1. Rolling a number greater than 3
2. Rolling two even numbers in a row

Let's start with the first event:
Rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die.
The possible outcomes greater than 3 are: 4, 5, and 6.
The total number of possible outcomes on a six-sided die is 6.
The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes
Probability = 3 / 6 = 1/2 = 50%

Now, let's consider the second event:
Rolling two even numbers in a row on a six-sided die.
The possible even numbers are: 2, 4, and 6.
The probability of rolling the first even number is 3/6 = 1/2.
The probability of rolling the second even number is also 3/6 = 1/2.
The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die:
   * The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.
   * There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   * Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%

2. Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row on a six-sided die:
   * The even numbers are 2, 4, and 6.
   * Probability of rolling the first even number = 3/6 = 1/2
   * Probability of rolling the second even number = 3/6 = 1/2
   * Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4 = 25%

3. Comparing the probabilities:
   * Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 50%
   * Probability of rolling two even

   * The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   * The total number of possible outcomes on a six-sided die is 6.
   * The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.

2. Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row on a six-sided die:
   * The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   * The probability of rolling the first even number is 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.
   * The probability of rolling the second even number is also 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.
   * The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the product of the individual probabilities: 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4 = 25%.
