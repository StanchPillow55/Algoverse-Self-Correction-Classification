Question:
John and Jack have 30 minutes to walk to school together. It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is. It takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. How much longer do they have to get to school without being late?


Reference Answer:
John and Jack arrive at the library with 30 - 6 = <<30-6=24>>24 minutes left to reach the fire station.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John and Jack have 30 minutes to walk to school together.
- It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is.
- It takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station.

To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time it takes them to walk to the fire station, and then subtract that from the total time they have.

Step 1: Calculate the total time it takes them to walk to the fire station.
Time to get to the library corner + Time from the library corner to the fire station = Total time to the fire station
6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the remaining time they have to get to school.
Total time they have - Total time to the fire station = Remaining time to get to school
30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

Final answer: John and Jack have 11 minutes left
