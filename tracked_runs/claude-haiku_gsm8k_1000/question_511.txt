Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Lani baked 55 cookies.
- She ate 5 cookies.
- She placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies remaining after Lani ate 5 cookies.
Total cookies baked - Cookies eaten = Remaining cookies
55 cookies - 5 cookies = 50 remaining cookies

Step 2: Divide the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars.
Remaining cookies / Number of jars = Cookies per jar
50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar

Therefore, the final answer is:
Each jar contains 10 cookies.
