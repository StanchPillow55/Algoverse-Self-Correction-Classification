Question ID: 1262

Question:
John decides to take up an odd hobby of speed talking.  His normally speaking speed is 150 WPM.  After training his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed.  How long would it take him to speak 10 pages if each page has 450 words per page?


Reference Answer:
He can speak 150*2.5=<<150*2.5=375>>375 words per minute
He wants to say 450*10=<<450*10=4500>>4500 words
So he can speak them in 4500/375=<<4500/375=12>>12 minutes

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.
2. Calculate the total number of words in 10 pages.
3. Calculate the time it takes John to speak 10 pages.

Step 1: Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.
* John's normal speaking speed is 150 WPM (words per minute).
* After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed.
* New speaking speed = 150 WPM × 2.5 = 375 WPM

Step 2: Calculate the total number of words in 10 pages.
* Each page has 450 words.
* Total number of words in 10 pages = 10 × 450 = 4,500 words

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes John to speak 10 pages.
* Total number of words = 4,500 words
* John's new speaking speed = 375 WPM
* Time to speak 10 pages = Total number of words / Speaking speed
* Time to speak 10

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John's normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM).
- After training, his speaking speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed.
- He needs to speak 10 pages, and each page has 450 words.

Step 1: Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.
John's new speaking speed = 150 WPM × 2.5 = 375 WPM

Step 2: Calculate the total number of words he needs to speak.
Total words = 10 pages × 450 words per page = 4,500 words

Step 3: Calculate the time it would take John to speak 4,500 words at his new speaking speed.
Time taken = Total words / Speaking speed
Time taken = 4,500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages, where each page has 450 words.

- John's normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM).
- After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed.
- He needs to speak 10 pages, and each page has 450 words.

Step 1: Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.
John's new speaking speed = 150 WPM × 2.5 = 375 WPM

Step 2: Calculate the total number of words he needs to speak.
Total words = 10 pages × 450 words per page = 4,500 words

Step 3: Calculate the time it would take John to speak 4,500 words at his new speaking speed.
Time taken = Total words / Speaking speed
Time taken = 4,500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages, where each page has 450 words.
