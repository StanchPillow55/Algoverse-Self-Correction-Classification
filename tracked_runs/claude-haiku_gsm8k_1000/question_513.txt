Question ID: 534

Question:
Twenty kids went out on a school trip. In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells. The boys went out for the search and brought back 60 shells each. If the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, how many seashells were brought by each girl?


Reference Answer:
When they divided, each group had 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 students.
The total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10*60 = <<10*60=600>>600
The girls brought four times more seashells than the boys, which is 4*600 = <<4*600=2400>>2400
The total number of seashells brought by the girls is 2400+600 = <<2400+600=3000>>3000
If there were 10 girls, then each girl brought 3000/10 = <<3000/10=300>>300 seashells

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There are 20 kids on the school trip.
- They were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
- The boys brought back 60 seashells each.
- The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

Step 1: Find the number of boys and girls in the group.
Since the groups were divided equally, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Step 2: Find the total number of seashells brought back by the boys.
Number of boys × Number of seashells per boy = Total seashells brought by boys
10 × 60 = 600 seashells

Step 3: Find the total number of seashells brought back by the girls.
Total seashells brought by boys + (4 × Total seashells brought by boys) = Total seashells brought by girls
600 + (4 × 600) = 600 + 2,400 = 3,000 seashells

- The girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

Step 1: Find the number of boys and girls in the group.
Since the groups were divided equally, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls.

Step 2: Find the total number of shells brought back by the boys.
Number of boys × Number of shells per boy = Total shells brought back by boys
10 × 60 = 600 shells

Step 3: Find the total number of shells brought back by the girls.
Total shells brought back by boys + (4 × Total shells brought back by boys) = Total shells brought back by girls
600 + (4 × 600) = 600 + 2,400 = 3,000 shells

Step 4: Find the number of shells brought back by each girl.

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There are 20 kids on the school trip.
- They were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
- The boys brought back 60 shells each.
- The girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

Step 1: Determine the number of boys and girls.
Since the groups were divided equally, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of shells brought back by the boys.
Number of boys × Number of shells per boy = Total shells brought back by boys
10 × 60 = 600 shells

Step 3: Calculate the total number of shells brought back by the girls.
Total shells brought back by boys + (4 × Total shells brought back by boys) = Total shells brought back by girls
600 + (4 × 600) = 600 + 2,400 = 3,000 shells

Step 4: Calculate the number of shells brought back by each girl.
