Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Henry and 3 of his friends ordered 7 pizzas for lunch.
- Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- They want to share the pizzas equally.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices.
Total number of slices = Number of pizzas × Number of slices per pizza
Total number of slices = 7 × 8 = 56 slices

Step 2: Calculate the number of people sharing the pizzas.
Number of people sharing the pizzas = Henry + 3 friends = 4 people

Step 3: Calculate the number of slices each person can have.
Number of slices per person = Total number of slices / Number of people
Number of slices per person = 56 / 4 = 14 slices

Therefore, if Henry and his 3 friends want to share the 7 pizzas equally, each of them can have 14 slices.

Final answer: Each person can have 14 slices of pizza.
