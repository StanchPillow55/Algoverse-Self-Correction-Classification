Question ID: 207

Question:
Joe's bag of Halloween candy has 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. If each chocolate bar weighs 40g, how much does Joe's bag of candy weigh, in grams?


Reference Answer:
The candied apples weigh 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 grams each.
The chocolate bars weigh 40*25=<<40*25=1000>>1000 grams in total.
The candied apples weigh 20*80=<<20*80=1600>>1600 grams in total.
Joe's bag weighs 1000+1600=<<1000+1600=2600>>2600 grams.

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Joe's bag of Halloween candy has 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples.
- Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
- Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.

Step 1: Find the weight of each candied apple.
Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can use the following equation:
Weight of each chocolate bar = 2 × Weight of each candied apple
40 grams = 2 × Weight of each candied apple
Weight of each candied apple = 40 grams / 2 = 20 grams

Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars.
Total weight of chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars × Weight of each chocolate bar
Total weight of chocolate bars = 25 × 40 grams = 1,000 grams

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the candied apples.
Total weight of candied apples = Number of candied apples × Weight of each candied apple

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Joe's bag of Halloween candy has 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples.
- Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
- Each chocolate bar weighs 40g.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of each candied apple.
Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can divide the weight of the chocolate bar by 2 to find the weight of the candied apple.
Weight of each candied apple = 40g / 2 = 20g

Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars.
Total weight of chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars × Weight of each chocolate bar
Total weight of chocolate bars = 25 × 40g = 1000g

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the candied apples.
Total weight of candied apples = Number of candied apples × Weight of each candied apple
Total weight of candied apples = 80 × 20g = 1600g

Step 4: Calculate the
