Question ID: 330

Question:
A customer’s loyalty card at a store gives them rewards of $1 off their next purchase for every $20 they spend. Their last shopping trip, they spent $80. This shopping trip, they spent $43, used their rewards, and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. How many dollars did the customer pay on this shopping trip?


Reference Answer:
The customer had 80 / 20 = $<<80/20=4>>4 in rewards.
Their coupon was worth 4 * 2 = $<<4*2=8>>8.
Thus, they paid 43 - 4 - 8 = $<<43-4-8=31>>31 on this shopping trip.
#### 31

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The customer's loyalty card gives them $1 off their next purchase for every $20 they spend.
- On their last shopping trip, they spent $80.
- On this shopping trip, they spent $43, used their rewards, and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price.

Step 1: Calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip.
Rewards earned = $80 / $20 = $4

Step 2: Calculate the amount the customer paid on this shopping trip after using the rewards.
Amount spent = $43
Rewards used = $4
Amount paid = $43 - $4 = $39

Step 3: Calculate the amount the coupon took off the price.
Coupon discount = 2 × $4 = $8

Step 4: Calculate the final amount the customer paid on this shopping trip.
Final amount paid = $39 - $8 = $31

Therefore, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.
