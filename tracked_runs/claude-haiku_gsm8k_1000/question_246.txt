Question ID: 141

Question:
There are 700 bees in a hive. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and there are twice as many babies as queens.  How many worker bees are there?


Reference Answer:
Let x represent the number of queens
Babies:2x
Workers:2(2x)=4x
Total:x+2x+4x=700
7x=700
x=<<100=100>>100 queen bees
Workers:4(100)=400 worker bees
#### 400

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of worker bees in the hive.

Given information:
- There are 700 bees in the hive.
- There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
- There are twice as many baby bees as queen bees.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of queen bees.
- Let 2x be the number of baby bees.
- Let 4x be the number of worker bees.

We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write the equation:
x + 2x + 4x = 700

Simplifying the equation:
7x = 700

Solving for x:
x = 100

Now, we can find the number of worker bees:
Number of worker bees = 4x = 4 Ã— 100 = 400

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.
