Question ID: 1159

Question:
Carla just gave birth to identical octuplets. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue. If all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, what is the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple?


Reference Answer:
First find the number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 babies = <<3/4*8=6>>6 babies
Then multiply that number by 1/3 to find the number of babies wearing purple and bows: 6 babies * 1/3 = <<6*1/3=2>>2 babies
Then subtract the number of purple-wearing babies from the total number of babies to find the number of blue-wearing babies: 8 babies - 6 babies = <<8-6=2>>2 babies
Now divide the number of purple bow babies by the total number of bow babies to find the percentage chance a bow baby wears purple: 2 babies / (2 babies + 2 babies) = 2 babies / 4 babies = .5 * 100% = 50%

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carla has 8 identical octuplets (8 babies)
- 3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple
- 1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue
- All the blue-wearing babies and 1/3 of the purple-wearing babies also wear bows

Step 1: Calculate the number of babies wearing purple and the number wearing blue.
Number of babies wearing purple = 3/4 of 8 = 6 babies
Number of babies wearing blue = 1/4 of 8 = 2 babies

Step 2: Calculate the number of babies wearing bows.
All 2 blue-wearing babies wear bows.
1/3 of the 6 purple-wearing babies wear bows, which is 2 babies.
Total number of babies wearing bows = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of bow-wearing babies that are wearing purple.
Total number of babies wearing bows = 4

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) Carla has 8 identical octuplets.

2) She dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue.
   * 3/4 of 8 = 6 babies in purple
   * 1/4 of 8 = 2 babies in blue

3) All the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows.
   * 2 blue-wearers wear bows
   * 1/3 of 6 purple-wearers = 2 purple-wearers wear bows
   * Total babies wearing bows = 2 blue + 2 purple = 4 babies

4) To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:
   * Total babies wearing bows = 4
   * Babies wearing purple bows = 2
   * Percentage = (2 purple bows / 4 total bows) x 100 = 50%

Therefore, the
