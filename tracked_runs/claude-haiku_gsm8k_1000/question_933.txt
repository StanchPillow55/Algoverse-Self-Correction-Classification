Question ID: 95

Question:
Out of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. How many girls are not in the girl scout?


Reference Answer:
There are 200 x 2/5 = <<200*2/5=80>>80 boys in Grade 5.
So, 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120 are girls.
Out of the 120 girls, 120 x 2/3 = <<120*2/3=80>>80 are in the girl scout.
Therefore, 120 - 80 = <<120-80=40>>40 girls are not in the girl scout.
#### 40

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scouts.

Given information:
- There are 200 Grade 5 students.
- 2/5 of the students are boys.
- 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts.

Step 1: Find the number of boys.
Number of boys = 2/5 × 200 = 80 boys

Step 2: Find the number of girls.
Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120 girls

Step 3: Find the number of girls in the Girl Scouts.
Number of girls in the Girl Scouts = 2/3 × 120 = 80 girls

Step 4: Find the number of girls not in the Girl Scouts.
Number of girls not in the Girl Scouts = Total girls - Number of girls in the Girl Scouts
Number of girls not in the Girl Scouts = 120 - 80 = 40 girls

Therefore, the number of girls not in the Girl Scouts is 40
