Question ID: 43

Question:
According to its nutritional info, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories?


Reference Answer:
If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat
If each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving
We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams
If I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- A bag of chips has 250 calories per serving.
- A 300g bag has 5 servings.
- Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.

Step 1: Calculate the total calories in the 300g bag of chips.
Total calories in the bag = Calories per serving × Number of servings
Total calories in the bag = 250 calories × 5 servings = 1250 calories

Step 2: Calculate the remaining calories you can consume for the day.
Remaining calories = Daily calorie target - Calories already consumed
Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Step 3: Calculate the maximum amount of chips you can eat to stay within your remaining calorie target.
Maximum grams of chips = (Remaining calories / Calories per serving) × Grams per bag
Maximum grams of chips = (200 calories / 250 calories per serving) × 300 grams
Maximum grams of

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving.
2. The bag is 300g and has 5 servings.
3. Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories.
4. To find how many grams you can eat, we need to first calculate the total calories in the bag of chips.
5. Total calories in the bag = 250 calories per serving x 5 servings = 1250 calories.
6. Now, we need to find out how many calories you have left to consume for the day.
7. Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have 200 calories left.
8. To find how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to divide the remaining 200 calories by the calorie density of the chips, which is 250 calories per serving.
9. 200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.
10.

Remaining calories = 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Step 3: Calculate the maximum amount of chips you can eat to stay within your remaining calorie target.
Maximum grams of chips = (Remaining calories / Calories per serving) × Grams per bag
Maximum grams of chips = (200 calories / 250 calories per serving) × 300 grams
Maximum grams of chips = 0.8 × 300 grams = 240
