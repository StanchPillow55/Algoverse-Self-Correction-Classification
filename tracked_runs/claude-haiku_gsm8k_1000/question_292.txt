Question ID: 29

Question:
Gloria is shoe shopping when she comes across a pair of boots that fit her shoe budget. However, she has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels that together cost five dollars less than the boots. If one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, how many dollars are the boots?


Reference Answer:
The second pair of heels costs 33 * 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66.
The heels together cost 66 + 33 = $<<66+33=99>>99.
The boots cost $5 more than both pairs of heels together, so the boots cost 99 + 5 = $104.
#### 104

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Gloria has to choose between a pair of boots and two pairs of high heels.
- The two pairs of high heels together cost $5 less than the boots.
- One pair of heels costs $33.
- The other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair.

Step 1: Find the cost of the second pair of heels.
Cost of the second pair of heels = 2 Ã— $33 = $66

Step 2: Find the total cost of the two pairs of heels.
Total cost of the two pairs of heels = $33 + $66 = $99

Step 3: Find the cost of the boots.
Cost of the boots = Total cost of the two pairs of heels + $5
Cost of the boots = $99 + $5 = $104

Therefore, the boots cost $104.

Final answer: The boots cost $104.
