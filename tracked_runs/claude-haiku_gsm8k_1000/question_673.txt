Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cupcakes Paul needs for the party and then subtract the number of cupcakes he already has.

Given information:
- Paul needs 63 cupcakes for the birthday party.
- Paul already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes.

Step 1: Find the total number of cupcakes Paul already has.
Number of chocolate cupcakes + Number of toffee cupcakes = Total cupcakes Paul already has
8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes

Step 2: Find the number of additional cupcakes Paul needs to buy.
Total cupcakes needed - Total cupcakes Paul already has = Additional cupcakes needed
63 - 48 = 15 cupcakes

Therefore, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes for the birthday party.

Final answer: Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.
