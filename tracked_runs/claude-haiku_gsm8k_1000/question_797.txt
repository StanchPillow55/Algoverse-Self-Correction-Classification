Question ID: 989

Question:
Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute and saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and cook 90 shrimp?


Reference Answer:
First find how long it takes Emily to peel the shrimp: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = <<90/6=15>>15 minutes
Then find how many batches of shrimp she needs to cook: 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp/batch = <<90/30=3>>3 batches
Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 3 batches * 10 minutes/batch = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes
Then add the peeling time to find the total time Emily spends: 30 minutes + 15 minutes = <<30+15=45>>45 minutes

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

Given information:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute.
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- Emily needs to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp.
Time to peel 90 shrimp = 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to sauté 90 shrimp.
Time to sauté 90 shrimp = (90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per 10 minutes) × 10 minutes = 30 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.
Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté
Total time = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will
