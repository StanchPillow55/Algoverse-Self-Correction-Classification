Question:
Topher, the green giant, wears enormous shoes.  The length of one of his shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes.  If the length of one of Topher’s shoes is 8-feet and 4-inches, how long, in inches, is one of Bobby’s shoes?


Reference Answer:
Since Topher’s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.
If we let the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, in inches, be x.
Then the length of Topher’s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.
Subtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90
Solving for x, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the length of one of Bobby's shoes given the information about the length of Topher's shoes.

Given information:
- The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.
- The length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches.

Step 1: Convert the length of Topher's shoes from feet and inches to inches.
8 feet and 4 inches = (8 × 12) + 4 = 100 inches

Step 2: Find the length of one of Bobby's shoes.
Let the length of one of Bobby's shoes be x inches.
The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.
Topher's shoe length = 9x + 10
100 inches = 9x + 10
9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90
x = 10 inches

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.
- The length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches.

Step 1: Convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches.
8 feet = 8 × 12 inches = 96 inches
4 inches
Total length of Topher's shoe = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Step 2: Set up an equation to solve for the length of one of Bobby's shoes.
Let x = the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches.
The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.
100 inches = 9x + 10

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
100 inches = 9x + 10
100 inches - 10 = 9x
90
