Question ID: 1315

Question:
There are some oranges in a basket. Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange and Jane spends 4 minutes doing the same. If Ana and Jane start picking oranges from this basket to peel at the same time, how many more oranges will Ana have peeled than Jane after an hour?


Reference Answer:
There are 60 minutes in an hour. Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes so she will peel 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 oranges in an hour
Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes so she will peel 60/4 = <<60/4=15>>15 oranges in an hour
Ana will have peeled 20-15 = <<20-15=5>>5 more oranges

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange.
- Jane takes 4 minutes to peel an orange.
- Ana and Jane start peeling oranges at the same time.
- We need to find how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour (60 minutes).

Step 1: Calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in 60 minutes.
Time available for Ana = 60 minutes
Time to peel 1 orange = 3 minutes
Number of oranges Ana can peel in 60 minutes = 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges

Step 2: Calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in 60 minutes.
Time available for Jane = 60 minutes
Time to peel 1 orange = 4 minutes
Number of oranges Jane can peel in 60 minutes = 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the number of oranges peeled by

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange
* Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange
* They start peeling oranges at the same time

To find how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour (60 minutes):

1) Calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in 60 minutes:
* Ana can peel 1 orange every 3 minutes
* In 60 minutes, Ana can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges

2) Calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in 60 minutes: 
* Jane can peel 1 orange every 4 minutes
* In 60 minutes, Jane can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges

3) Calculate the difference between the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
* Ana peeled 20 oranges, Jane peeled 15 oranges
* Difference = 20 - 15 = 5 oranges

Therefore, after an hour, Ana
