Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Food costs $25 per week.
- Treats cost $20 per month.
- Medicine costs $100 per month.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of food per month.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost per month.
Cost of food per month = $100
Cost of treats per month = $20
Cost of medicine per month = $100
Total cost per month = $100 + $20 + $100 = $220

Step 3: Calculate the total cost per year.
