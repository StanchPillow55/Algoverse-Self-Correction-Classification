Question:
A water tank is filled with 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her small garden. She was then able to collect rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. How many liters of water are in the tank now?


Reference Answer:
After watering Celine's garden, 120 - 90 = <<120-90=30>>30 liters of water were left in the tank.
Celine was able to collect 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 liters of rainwater.
Thus, there are 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 liters of water in the tank.
#### 90

Response:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The water tank is initially filled with 120 liters of water.
- Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her small garden.
- Celine was able to collect rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters.
Amount of water left in the tank = Initial amount of water - Amount of water used
Amount of water left in the tank = 120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Step 2: Calculate the amount of rainwater Celine collected.
Amount of rainwater collected = 2 × Amount of water left in the tank
Amount of rainwater collected = 2 × 30 liters = 60 liters

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water in the tank now.
Total amount of water in the tank = Amount of water left in the tank + Amount of rainwater collected
Total amount of water in the tank = 30 li

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water in the tank now.
Total amount of water in the tank = Amount of water left in the tank + Amount of rainwater collected
Total amount of water in the tank = 30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

Therefore, the final answer is that there are 90 liters of water in the tank now.
