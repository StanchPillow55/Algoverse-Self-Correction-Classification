Question ID: 603

Question:
Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. If they worked for 12 hours in a day, calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together.


Reference Answer:
Merissa makes 3/4 * 120 pounds = <<3/4*120=90>>90 pounds of chocolate in an hour.
Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolate in two hours; this means she makes 120 pounds / 2 hours = <<120/2=60>>60 pounds of chocolate in an hour.
If they worked for 12 hours, Ruiz made 12 hours * 60 pounds/hour = <<12*60=720>>720 pounds of chocolate while
Marissa made 90 pounds/hour * 12 hours = <<90*12=1080>>1080 pounds of chocolate
The combined amount of pounds of chocolate they both ate is 1080 pounds + 720 pounds = <<1080+720=1800>>1800 pounds of chocolate
#### 1800

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of chocolate pounds made by Ruiz and Marissa separately, and then add them together to get the total amount of chocolate pounds made.

Given information:
- Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours.
- Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours.
- They worked for 12 hours in a day.

Step 1: Find the amount of chocolate pounds made by Ruiz.
Ruiz's chocolate pounds per hour = 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour
Ruiz's chocolate pounds in 12 hours = 60 pounds per hour × 12 hours = 720 pounds

Step 2: Find the amount of chocolate pounds made by Marissa.
Marissa's chocolate pounds per hour = 3/4 × Ruiz's chocolate pounds per two hours
Marissa's chocolate pounds per hour = 3/4 × (120 pounds / 2 hours) = 45 pounds per hour

Response:
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours.
- Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours.
- They worked for 12 hours in a day.

Step 1: Calculate how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour.
Ruiz's chocolate production in two hours = 120 pounds
Ruiz's chocolate production in one hour = 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds

Step 2: Calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour.
Marissa's chocolate production in one hour = 3/4 × Ruiz's chocolate production in two hours
Marissa's chocolate production in one hour = 3/4 × 120 pounds = 90 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together in 12 hours.
Ruiz's total chocolate production in 12 hours = 60 pounds/hour ×
