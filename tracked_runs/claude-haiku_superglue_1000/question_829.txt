Question:
Passage: By Michael Gadd Winston Reid's homecoming didn't go to script for the New Zealand Premier League star as West Ham were beaten by Wellington Phoenix at Auckland's Eden Park. Sam Allardyce's side got more than they bargained for against the team which finish one place above the wooden spoon last A-League season and for Reid, who was handed the captain's armband for the occasion, it'll be a night to forget. The Phoenix took a 2-0 lead into half-time and West Ham were only able to peg one back through new signing Mauro Zarate inside the closing 20 minutes. Shining light: Mauro Zarate's goal was a rare positive sign for Sam Allardyce as West Ham lost to Wellington
