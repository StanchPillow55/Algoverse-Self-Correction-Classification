Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- It's a 1-0 victory to the U.S. In an age when major nations are doing battle for football's brightest talents, the American team has pulled off quite a coup. Julian Green is a dual U.S. and German citizen who has been playing for Bayern Munich in Germany since 2010. The 18-year-old winger's displays since making his debut for Bayern's second team in 2013 have been enough to convince U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann to offer Green the chance to represent the country of his birth. But the Tampa-born starlet has already represented Germany at youth level, meaning football's global governing body FIFA had to clear Green to play for Klinsmann's team.
