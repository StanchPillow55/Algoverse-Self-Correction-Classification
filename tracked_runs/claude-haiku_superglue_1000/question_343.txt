Question:
Passage: (CNN)For Formula One fanatics it was a thrilling  spectacle  -- the sport's top two drivers going head-to-head for the drivers' championship title. That Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton were teammates, from the Mercedes stable, made it all the more enthralling.

For Rosberg, who was ultimately beaten to the world title by the Briton and had to deal with plenty of criticism along the way, it wasn't the first time he'd felt like an outsider. As testing for the 2015 season continues, he says last term provided some trying moments but he insists he can't think of a better teammate than Hamilton.
