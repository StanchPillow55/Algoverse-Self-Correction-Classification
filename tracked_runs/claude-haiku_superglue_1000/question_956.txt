Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Score another win for the power of music -- and Bruno Mars gets the assist. Medical personnel at a hospital in Cleveland, Ohio, are crediting the "Just the Way You Are" singer with helping the recovery of 11-year-old Zumyah Thorpe. According to reports from CNN affiliate WKYC, Thorpe was severely injured in a March 2013 car accident that killed her pregnant mother and two sisters. Thorpe suffered horrific brain swelling that required the removal of part of her skull. While she recovered, nurses played songs by Mars every day. "I asked her who her favorite singer was and she said 'Bruno Mars' as quick as anyone would say any singer," Nancy Bass, a pediatric neurologist at UH Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital, told the station. "And she just started singing every single word. It definitely brought a tear to my eye."
