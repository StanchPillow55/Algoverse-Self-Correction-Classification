Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama filled out his Cabinet nominations on Thursday when he tapped Penny Pritzker as commerce secretary and Michael Froman as U.S. trade representative. At an event in the White House Rose Garden, Obama heralded his two nominees as leaders with "extraordinary experience" who are about "growing opportunity" for the American middle class. "One of the reasons I'm proud to nominate them is they don't forget what matters," Obama said standing between the two nominees. "They know this is not about just growing balance sheets, it's about growing opportunity for people, it's about growing a sense of security for the middle class. And most of all, they operate with integrity and they understand that that public service is a privilege and you've got to do it right when you get involved on behalf of the American people."
