Question:
Passage: Chicago (CNN) -- Just two weeks after his wedding, Christophe Quancard was diagnosed with glioblastoma, one of the deadliest types of brain tumors. He was only 35 years old. The news was devastating. "In our age group, no one is ready for the diagnosis, (or) the possibility," Quancard said. "I mean, we know it's out there, but you didn't think it would happen when you were still young and had so many other things that you were thinking about." Quancard's team of doctors encouraged him to get in touch with a group called Imerman Angels. The nonprofit matches cancer patients with cancer survivors so they can receive support from someone who has been down a similar path.
