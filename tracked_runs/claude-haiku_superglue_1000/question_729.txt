Question:
Passage: Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert refused to shake Jose Mourinho's hand on Saturday because the Chelsea boss left before the full time whistle. Chelsea were leading 3-0 when Mourinho decided to beat the traffic and walk down the Stamford Bridge tunnel, but the 'Special One' halted to say his goodbyes to Lambert and assistant manager Roy Keane first. Instead, Lambert snubbed the 51-year-old's prematurely out-stretched hand and pointed to his watch to tell the former Real Madrid and Inter Milan manager that time wasn't quite up yet.
