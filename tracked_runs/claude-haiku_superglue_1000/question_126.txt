Given information:
- The sentence states that the touring version of Frozen "will follow the plot of the film but be performed in an arena setting."
- The missing word is represented by the placeholder "@placeholder".

- Show
- Production
- Performance
- Spectacle

   - This option fits the context and makes sense.

2. Production:
   - "The production will follow the plot of the film but be performed in an arena setting."
   - This option also fits the context and makes sense.

3. Performance:
   - "The performance will follow the plot of the film but be performed in an arena setting."
