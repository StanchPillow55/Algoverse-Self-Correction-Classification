The paragraph states:
"In the opening scene, Randy Morton describes a typical Friday afternoon at the Waldorf. A newlywed couple discover there are no rooms available, and are given use of an apartment by a Mr. Jesup, who is going away for the weekend."

From this, we can conclude the following:

2. When they arrived at the hotel, they discovered that there were no rooms available.
3. Instead of being given a room, they were given the use of an apartment belonging to Mr. Jesup, who was going away for the weekend.

Therefore, the final answer is:
