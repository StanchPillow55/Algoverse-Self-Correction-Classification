Question:
Passage: By David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor PUBLISHED: 16:46 EST, 14 October 2013 | UPDATED: 17:55 EST, 14 October 2013 Kansas Republican Pat Roberts has been a member of Congress since 1981 and a Senator since 1997, but he's never run this hard to the right before.

Response:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Milton Wolf, a tea party challenger, announced he will run against Senator Pat Roberts in the 2014 Republican primary.
- Wolf acknowledges he will likely need to raise $4 million by next year to mount a credible challenge against the 77-year-old senator.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of money Wolf needs to raise per month to reach his $4 million goal by next year.

Step 1: Calculate the number of months until next year.
Assuming next year refers to 12 months from now, the number of months is 12.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Wolf needs to raise per month.
Amount of money needed per month = Total amount needed / Number of months
Amount of money needed per month = $4,000,000 / 12 months
Amount of money needed per month = $333,333.33

Therefore, Milton Wolf thinks he's up to the challenge of raising $333,333.33 per month to reach his $4 million goal by next year.


Extracted Answer: 333.33
