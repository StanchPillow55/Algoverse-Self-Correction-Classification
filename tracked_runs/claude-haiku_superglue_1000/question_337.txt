Question:
Passage: Sandra Fluke, the contraception activist who shot from obscurity to the national spotlight in 2012 when she argued that her Catholic law school should be required to provide birth control to female students for free, said Wednesday that she's decided not to run for Congress in California. The newly minted 'social justice attorney' was one of three Democrats who had petitioned the California Democratic Party for its endorsement in the 33rd District election set for nine months from now. Henry Waxman, who has served in Congress since 1975, is vacating that seat at the end of his current term. Fluke will run instead for a state Senate seat held by Democrat Ted Lieu, who is running for Waxman's seat.
