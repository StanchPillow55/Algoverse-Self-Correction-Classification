Question:
Passage: Reggie Love, the guy partially responsible for transforming then-Sen. Barack Obama into the "president of cool," is opening up about his close relationship with the President in his new book, "Power Forward: My Presidential Education." The book gives an inside look at the role Obama played as part mentor, part boss to Love, who served as his personal assistant for five years. The young staffer, now 33, is credited for making Obama "hip" by showing him how to fist bump, introducing him to Jay-Z and buying him an iPod. He even surprised the President on his 49th birthday for a game of basketball alongside LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Dwyane Wade.
