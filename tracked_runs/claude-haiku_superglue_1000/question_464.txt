Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- It was 1984. Hulk Hogan had won the WWE Championship from The Iron Sheik, Rowdy Roddy Piper smashed a coconut over Jimmy Snuka's head and Captain Lou Albano's appearance in Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" was hitting the airwaves. Fans around the world couldn't wait get their hands on toy company LJN's first line of WWE action figures. Sure, these tiny wrestlers were made of hard plastic and had zero moveable joints, but these were WWE action figures. Children wanted to play with the heroes and villains they saw on TV each week. "I can remember asking my mom and dad for LJN figures straight off the shelves when I was about 8 or so," said Daniel Epps, a 34-year old, decades-long fan of WWE figures from Gloversville, New York.
