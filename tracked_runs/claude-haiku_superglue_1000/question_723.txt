Question:
Passage: By Beth Stebner PUBLISHED: 00:14 EST, 14 October 2012 | UPDATED: 20:52 EST, 14 October 2012 Saturday Night Live took inspiration from Thursday’s fiery debate between Vice President Joe Biden and Republican vice presidential hopeful Paul Ryan. In fact, the clash between the two politicians was such good fodder that many lines from the cold open were taken verbatim from last week’s exchange, focusing on Biden’s constant snickering, gesturing, and grinning. Biden, played by long-time SNL veteran Jason Sudeikis, called one of Taran Killam’s statements a ‘bunch of malarkey.’ When Ryan explained that it was an Irish expression, Sudeikis responded: ‘No, Irish is I come over there and smack that dumb look off your face.’
