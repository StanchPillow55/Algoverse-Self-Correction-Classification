Question:
Passage: By Francesca Chambers In 2001 when then-Illinois State Senator Barack Obama's first child was born, it was Obama's aunt Kenyan aunt Zeituni Onyango who stepped in to help new parents Barack and Michelle. Onyango, who had moved to the United States the year before on a visa, took care of baby Sasha and kept the Obama's Chicago home in tidy order. After Onyango, 61, died at a Boston, Massachusetts nursing home after battling breast cancer and respiratory issues earlier this month, President Barack Obama returned the favor by helping to pay for her funeral expenses. But the President did not attend the funeral. He hit the links and sent a condolence note, instead, a New York Times profile on Obama's relationship with his relatives released on Tuesday declares.
