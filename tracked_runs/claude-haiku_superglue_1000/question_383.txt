Question:
Passage: An alleged arsonist has been arrested on suspicion of starting an out-of-control Northern California wildfire that has driven nearly 2,800 people from their homes and continues to grow, authorities said on Thursday. Wayne Allen Huntsman, 37, is suspected of starting the fire east of Sacramento on Saturday, authorities said at a news conference today. He was arrested late on Wednesday in Placerville and booked into El Dorado County Jail, where he was being held on $10 million bail. Huntsman is charged with one count of arson of forest land for willfully and maliciously setting a fire, according to a criminal complaint. He also faces a special allegation of arson with aggravating factors because the blaze east of Sacramento put a dozen firefighters in serious danger, forcing them to deploy their fire shields. They all escaped unharmed as it emerged today that four crew had lost their homes.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the King Fire based on the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- The King Fire has burned nearly 111 square miles of trees.
- The fire has doubled in size overnight.

Step 1: Convert the area of the King Fire from square miles to square kilometers.
1 square mile = 2.59 square kilometers
Area of the King Fire = 111 square miles × 2.59 square kilometers/square mile = 287.49 square kilometers

Step 2: Calculate the area of the King Fire after it doubled in size overnight.
Area of the King Fire after doubling = 287.49 square kilometers × 2 = 574.98 square kilometers

Therefore, the area of the King Fire tearing through @placeholder is approximately 575 square kilometers.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- The King Fire has burned nearly 111 square miles of trees.
- The fire has doubled in size overnight.
- The fire is just 5% contained.
- Firefighters were in serious danger and had to deploy their fire shields, but they all escaped unharmed.
- Four firefighters have lost their homes, and two churches, a community center, and a library have also burned down.

Step 1: Calculate the area of the King Fire.
Initial area of the fire = 111 square miles
Doubling in size overnight means the new area is 2 × 111 = 222 square miles.

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of the fire that is still uncontained.
Percentage of the fire that is uncontained = 100% - 5% = 95%

Step 3: Analyze the danger faced by the firefighters.
The passage states that the fire put a dozen firefighters in serious danger, forcing them to deploy their fire shields. However, they all escaped unharmed, indicating that the fire shields were
