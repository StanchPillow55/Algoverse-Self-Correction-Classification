Question:
Passage: Fears are growing of a neo-fascist uprising in Ukraine as ousted president Viktor Yanukovych called for referendums in every region to determine how pro-Russian the country actually is. Hundreds of members of the ultra-nationalist Right Sector movement stormed the parliament (Rada) building in Kiev last night, smashing windows and breaking down doors. The riot erupted just hours before Russia's foreign ministry today warned that ethnic minorities in Ukraine are 'living in fear' of the expanding power of the far-right across the divided nation. Right Sector activists are angry over the killing of their leader, Oleksandr Muzychko, better known as Sashko Bily, who died in a shoot-out with police in a cafe in Rivne, in western Ukraine, on Monday.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the range of the estimated membership of the neo-fascist Right Sector movement in Ukraine.

Given information:
- The passage states that the membership of the Right Sector movement has been growing.
- The membership has been estimated to be between 5,000 and 10,000.

Step 1: Identify the range of the estimated membership.
The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the given set.
Range = Highest value - Lowest value
Range = 10,000 - 5,000 = 5,000

Therefore, the range of the estimated membership of the Right Sector movement is 5,000.

Final answer: The range of the estimated membership of the Right Sector movement is 5,000.
