Question:
Passage: By Paul Donnelley Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie and Foreign Secretary William Hague called Bosnia's decision to include preventing sexual violence in military training ‘ground-breaking’ and said that it should become the standard for U.N. peacekeeping missions. Mr Hague added that rape was a devastatingly effective way to terrorise and displace a population and is currently being used in Syria, the Central African Republic and South Sudan.
