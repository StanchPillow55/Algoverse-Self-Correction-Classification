Question:
Passage: Luis Suarez's lawyer has condemned FIFA's punishment of the Uruguay striker for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini as 'draconian, totalitarian and fascist', and said an appeal will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Speaking just before Barcelona and Liverpool confirmed reaching an agreement for the transfer of Suarez to the Catalan club, Alejandro Balbi reacted angrily to FIFA's announcement on Thursday that an initial appeal from both Suarez and the Uruguayan Football Federation (AUF) had been rejected. Suarez had appealed against FIFA's sanctions, which include a ban on 'all football-related activities' for four months, a nine-match ban from international football, as well as a fine of 100,000 Swiss francs (Â£66,000).
