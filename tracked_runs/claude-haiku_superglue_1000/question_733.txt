Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The main Pakistani Taliban extended a cease-fire deadline until April 10, the militant group said Friday. The move came two days after the group met with Pakistan officials and made demands. The cease-fire was initially agreed upon on March 1. The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, which has been waging an insurgency against the Pakistani government, said it is still awaiting a reply from the government regarding the demands, including the release of noncombatants. At least 19 Taliban noncombatants were released earlier on the directive of Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, said Shaukatullah Khan, governor of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. The release is a goodwill gesture that will help promote peace talks, Khan said, speaking at a seminar in Peshawar. The prime minister is supervising the talks process, which are going in a positive direction, according to Khan.
