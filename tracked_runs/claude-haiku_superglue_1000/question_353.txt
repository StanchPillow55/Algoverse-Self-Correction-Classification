Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Britain's Andy Murray battled long and hard to make it to the ATP World Tour Finals but he may wish he hadn't following one of the most humiliating defeats of his career. It came against a Roger Federer who was a mixture of majestic, imperious and brutal as he battered the home favorite 6-0 6-1. With Kei Nishikori having won earlier on Thursday, Federer came into the match knowing he had already made the semifinals -- and that freedom allowed a performance of flair and firepower. Fifty-six minutes later, he had another exquisite win to reflect upon, a result that sent the Japanese through to the last four.
