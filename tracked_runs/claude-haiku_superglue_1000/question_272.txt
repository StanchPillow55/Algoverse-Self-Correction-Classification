Response:
To solve this problem, I will need to make some assumptions and inferences based on the given information. Here is my step-by-step reasoning:

1. The passage states that French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault criticized the UK's economic policy, saying it has caused "mass poverty". This suggests that Ayrault was critical of certain economic policies or practices in the UK.

2. The passage then mentions that Ayrault "was particularly critical of @placeholder's zero-hour contracts". This indicates that the "@placeholder" refers to a specific entity, likely a company or organization in the UK, that uses zero-hour contracts.

3. Zero-hour contracts are employment arrangements where employees agree to be available for work as and when required, without any guaranteed minimum hours. These types of contracts have been controversial in the UK due to concerns about job insecurity and lack of worker protections.

4. Since the passage does not provide the name of the specific entity that Ayrault criticized, I will use the placeholder "@placeholder" to represent the unnamed company or organization.

5. Based on the information given, I can conclude that Ayrault was critical of @placeholder's use of zero-hour contracts
