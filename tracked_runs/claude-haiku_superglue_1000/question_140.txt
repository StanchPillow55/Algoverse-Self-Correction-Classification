Response:
To solve this problem, we need to compare the waiting times for vital scans and tests to diagnose cancer in Wales and the placeholder (likely England).

Given information:
- In Wales, almost 50% of patients wait six weeks or more for vital scans and tests to diagnose cancer.
- In the placeholder (likely England), the figure for patients waiting six weeks or more is 1%.

Step 1: Calculate the percentage of patients in Wales who wait less than six weeks for vital scans and tests to diagnose cancer.
Percentage of patients waiting less than six weeks = 100% - 50% = 50%

Step 2: Calculate the difference in the percentage of patients waiting less than six weeks between Wales and the placeholder (likely England).
Difference in percentage = Percentage in placeholder - Percentage in Wales
Difference in percentage = 99% - 50% = 49%

Therefore, the difference in the percentage of patients waiting less than six weeks for vital scans and tests to diagnose cancer between Wales and the placeholder (likely England) is 49 percentage points.

Final answer: The difference in the percentage of patients waiting less than six weeks for vital scans an

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to compare the waiting times for vital scans and tests to diagnose cancer in Wales and the placeholder region.

Given information:
- In Wales, almost 50% of patients wait six weeks or more for vital scans and tests to diagnose cancer.
- In the placeholder region, the figure for patients waiting six weeks or more is 1%.

Step 1: Calculate the difference in waiting times between Wales and the placeholder region.
Difference in waiting times = Percentage of patients waiting six weeks or more in Wales - Percentage of patients waiting six weeks or more in the placeholder region
Difference in waiting times = 50% - 1% = 49%

Step 2: Interpret the results.
The difference in waiting times for vital scans and tests to diagnose cancer between Wales and the placeholder region is 49 percentage points. This means that the percentage of patients waiting six weeks or more for these tests is 49 percentage points higher in Wales compared to the placeholder region.

Final answer:
The difference in waiting times for vital scans and tests to diagnose cancer between Wales and the placeholder region is 49 percentage points.
