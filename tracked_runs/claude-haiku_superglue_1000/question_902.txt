Question:
Passage: PUBLISHED: 17:45 EST, 3 January 2014 | UPDATED: 18:01 EST, 3 January 2014 Third-round weekend. Just saying those words takes me back to childhood and triggers the excitement I had for the FA Cup. What a competition it used to be. From the start of the season to the beginning of December, I would regularly think about which team Everton would get drawn against on the first Saturday in January. The excitement and anticipation was massive because everyone was dreaming about Wembley. I still remember the buzz of the build-up to the third round, taking in all the unusual stories in the papers, on the radio and TV about little-known players who had dreams of becoming household names. Third-round day itself was mixed with nerves and excitement. If I wasn't at the game, I'd be sat in front of the TV, glued to Grandstand.
