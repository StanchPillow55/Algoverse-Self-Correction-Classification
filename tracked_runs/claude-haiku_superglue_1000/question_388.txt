Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- A second Syrian teenager has been returned to his parents -- lifeless, battered and, according to activists, a victim of torture. A video released Thursday by activists includes a woman wailing as a body is unwrapped at the hospital in Daraa. "My son, it's my son," the voice cries out. "This scar here, I swear its my son, I stitched this cut on him when he was little." The boy was identified as Tamer Mohammed al Sharey, 15, who disappeared after an April 29 demonstration. He was from the same village as Hamza Ali al-Khateeb, 13. Hamza's killing has enraged, mobilized and emboldened the country's opposition movement. Tamer was at the same demonstration Hamza attended, according to activists.
