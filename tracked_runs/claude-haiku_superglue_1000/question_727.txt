Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- An explosive century from birthday boy Ross Taylor helped New Zealand crush Pakistan by 110 runs and go top of their group at the Cricket World Cup. Taylor hit an unbeaten 131 off just 124 balls as the Kiwis smashed an incredible 100 runs off the final five overs of their innings. New Zealand looked set to post a modest total as they labored to 164-4 with ten overs remaining but fireworks from Taylor -- who hit seven sixes -- and Jacob Oram saw them amass 138 more runs. Finishing on 302-7 off their 50 overs the Kiwis shell shocked Pakistan, who contributed to their own downfall with sloppy fielding and poor bowling.
