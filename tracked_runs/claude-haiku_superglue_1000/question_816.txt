Question:
Passage: (CNN)I still remember sitting on the set of "Crossfire" that day in 2004 as the floor manager counted down to blastoff. I was thinking: "Jon Stewart, wow. I hope Diane is watching." My wife, truth be told, rarely watched "Crossfire," but she rarely missed "The Daily Show." By the time Stewart finished disemboweling my show, I was hoping she wasn't watching. From my perspective, the show that day was a debacle. I was unprepared for the onslaught since Stewart had recently been on "Hannity & Colmes" (Fox News' truly awful knockoff of "Crossfire"), and had not attacked that show at all. But he had a different agenda this day. I thought his charge that a 30-minute debate show was "hurting America" was fatuous. But I love direct confrontation (obviously). And I was not defensive because, as a former senior White House official, I know that being a cable TV host would never be the most important thing I do in my career. So I was actually interested in hearing Stewart's full critique of "Crossfire."
@highlight
Paul Begala co-hosted show where Jon Stewart launched attack on "Crossfire"
@highlight
He says Stewart shared a thoughtful critique of show after the cameras stopped

Query: I told him that was silly, forgetting that this is precisely what he tries to do with his "@placeholder" interviews.
