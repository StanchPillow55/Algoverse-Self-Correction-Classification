Passage: Greeted by crowds of delighted flag-waving children, it was a bittersweet moment for the Duchess of Cornwall as she arrived at a school once attended by her late brother Mark Shand today. The Duchess, who was there to unveil a memorial to the late conservationist, was left devastated by his untimely death in New York earlier this year. Mr Shand had been due to return to Saint Ronan’s School in Hawkhurst, Kent, to talk about his work as a conservationist and tell the children about his elephant charity but died before  making the trip.
