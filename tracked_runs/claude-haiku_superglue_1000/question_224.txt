Question:
Passage: A new dinosaur species may be the largest land predator ever discovered in Europe. The beast, found in Portugal, is estimated to have been up to 10 metres long and weighing in at between four and five tons. It would have been one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs from the Jurassic era, according to findings published in the journal PLOS ONE. Fearsome: The enormous creature, named Torvosaurus gurney, was discovered in Lisbon, Portugal. It was more than 30ft (10m) long and had razor-sharp 4in(10cm)-long teeth Scientists discovered bones belonging to the dinosaur north of Lisbon. They were originally believed to be Torvosaurus tanneri, a dinosaur species from North America.
@highlight
Bones originally thought to belong to Torvosaurus tanneri, a U.S. species
@highlight
But closer comparison of the shin bone, upper jawbone, teeth, and partial tail vertebrae suggested that it may warrant a new species name

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the geological period during which the Torvosaurus dinosaur lived.

Given information:
- Torvosaurus was a type of carnivorous dinosaur.
- Torvosaurus was discovered in Portugal and is estimated to have been up to 10 meters long and weighed between four and five tons.
- Torvosaurus is believed to have lived during the later part of a specific geological period.

The question asks us to fill in the @placeholder with the name of the geological period during which Torvosaurus lived.

Based on the information provided, we can determine that Torvosaurus lived during the Jurassic period.

Reasoning:
1. The passage states that Torvosaurus was a carnivorous dinosaur, which means it lived during the Mesozoic Era, as dinosaurs were the dominant land animals during this era.
2. The Mesozoic Era is divided into three periods: Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous.
3. The passage mentions that Torvosaurus lived between 153 and 148 million years ago,

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the geological period during which the Torvosaurus dinosaur lived.

Given information:
- Torvosaurus was a type of carnivorous dinosaur.
- Torvosaurus lived between 153 and 148 million years ago.

The geological period during which Torvosaurus lived was the @placeholder.

Reasoning:
The given information states that Torvosaurus lived between 153 and 148 million years ago. This time period corresponds to the later part of the Jurassic period.

The Jurassic period is one of the three major geological periods of the Mesozoic Era, which lasted from approximately 252 million years ago to 66 million years ago. The Jurassic period specifically lasted from approximately 201 million years ago to 145 million years ago.

Therefore, the geological period during which Torvosaurus lived was the Jurassic period.

Final answer:
The Torvosaurus dinosaur lived during the later part of the Jurassic period.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the geological period during which the Torvosaurus dinosaur lived.

Given information:
- Torvosaurus was a type of carnivorous dinosaur.
- Torvosaurus was discovered in Portugal and was estimated to be up to 10 meters long and weigh between 4 and 5 tons.
- Torvosaurus was originally believed to be Torvosaurus tanneri, a dinosaur species from North America, but further analysis suggested it may be a new species named Torvosaurus gurney.

Based on the information provided, we can determine that Torvosaurus lived during the Jurassic period.

The Jurassic period is the second period of the Mesozoic era, lasting from approximately 201 to 145 million years ago. Carnivorous dinosaurs, such as Torvosaurus, were prevalent during the Jurassic period.

Therefore, the placeholder in the question should be filled with "Jurassic period".

Final answer:
Torvosaurus were a type of carnivorous dinosaur that lived between 153
