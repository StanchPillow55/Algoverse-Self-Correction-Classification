Question:
Passage: New York (CNN) -- New Yorkers are not especially known for their patience. Stand on a subway escalator's left side -- otherwise known as the passing lane -- and it might evoke a sharp reprimand from fellow riders. But in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, millions across the New York metropolitan region who depend on the nation's busiest transit system are still waiting for their subway system to be fully restored. "There is no precedent for this," said Clifton Hood, author of "722 Miles: The Building of the Subways and How They Transformed New York." Dubbed New York's "life-blood," an estimated 5.5 million people ride the city's subway system each day in the country's most densely populated region.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the information provided in the passage, and then apply logical reasoning to answer the query.

Given information:
- New York's subway system is the busiest in the nation, with an estimated 5.5 million people riding it each day.
- The subway system was shut down for the second time ever due to Superstorm Sandy.
- The subway tracks, if laid out in a single line, would extend from Manhattan to Detroit, Michigan.
- Scientists cite rising sea levels and climate change as contributors to dangerous flooding.

Query: "has a 100-year flood every two years now," Gov.

To answer this query, we need to understand the concept of a "100-year flood." A 100-year flood is a flood event that has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year. This means that on average, a 100-year flood event should occur once every 100 years.

The query suggests that the governor has stated that the region "has a 100-year flood every two years now." This implies that the frequency of 100-year flood events has increased significantly, from once every 100 years to

To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the information provided in the passage, and then use logical reasoning to determine the final answer.

Given information:
- New York's subway system is the busiest in the nation, with an estimated 5.5 million people riding it each day.
- The subway system was shut down for the second time ever due to Superstorm Sandy.
- The subway tracks, if laid out in a single line, would extend from Manhattan to Detroit, Michigan.
- Scientists cite rising sea levels and climate change as contributors to dangerous flooding.

The passage states that the governor said, "has a 100-year flood every two years now." This suggests that the frequency of 100-year floods has increased significantly, with such events occurring much more often than once every 100 years.

To determine the reasoning behind this statement, we can consider the following:
1. A 100-year flood is a flood event that has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year.
2. If a 100-year flood is occurring every two years, it means the probability of such an event has increased dramatically.
3. This could be due to factors like

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the implications of the given statement.

The passage provides some key information:
1. New York's subway system is the busiest in the country, with an estimated 5.5 million people riding it each day.
2. The subway system was shut down for the second time ever due to Superstorm Sandy.
3. Scientists cite rising sea levels and climate change as contributors to dangerous flooding.

The statement provided in the query is:
"has a 100-year flood every two years now," Gov.

This statement suggests that the frequency of 100-year floods has increased significantly, from once every 100 years to once every 2 years.

To analyze this, we need to understand the concept of a 100-year flood. A 100-year flood is a flood event that has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year. In other words, it is a flood that has a statistical probability of occurring once every 100 years on average.

The statement from the governor implies that the frequency of these 100-year flood events has increased dramatically, from once every 100 years to once every 2
