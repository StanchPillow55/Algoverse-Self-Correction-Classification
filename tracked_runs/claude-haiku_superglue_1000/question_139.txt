Question:
Passage: By Jill Reilly Heavy security blanketed central Beijing on the 25th anniversary of the bloody suppression of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests today, to stop any attempts to publicly commemorate one of the darkest chapters in recent Chinese history. China allows no public discussion of the events of June 3-4, 1989, when soldiers backed by tanks and armored personnel carriers fought their way into the heart of Beijing, killing hundreds of unarmed protesters and onlookers. The silence in the mainland about the pivotal event that shocked the world contrasted with boisterous commemorations in Hong Kong. Large crowds gathered Wednesday night in the city's Victoria Park for an annual candlelight vigil to remember the Tiananmen victims, holding candles aloft that turned the vast area into a sea of flickering light.
