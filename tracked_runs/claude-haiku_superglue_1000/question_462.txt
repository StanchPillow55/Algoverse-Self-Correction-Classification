Question:
Paragraph: IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than $2.5 billion to build and equip, the largest single capital investment the company has ever made. The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than $500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. "The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market," said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y. To stay ahead in advanced chip technology, he said, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial. "What we call the lab-to-fab time should be as close to zero as possible," Kelly said. "If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia." The new factory, which will begin normal production early next year, will employ about 1,000 people. 

Question: Who does IBM see as their technological competition?

Answer: East Asian chip producers


Reference Answer:
1


=== Turn 1 ===


Response:
To determine who IBM sees as their technological competition, I will carefully analyze the information provided in the paragraph.

The key information is:
- IBM opened a new $2.5 billion semiconductor factory, which is the largest single capital investment they have ever made.
- This factory is part of IBM's strategy to "lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market."
- The paragraph states that "Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage" in the personal computer business, which is an area IBM is trying to move beyond.
- The paragraph also states that "If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia."

From this, we can infer that IBM sees East Asian chip producers as their main technological competition, especially in the high-performance semiconductor market. The fact that IBM chose to locate the new factory in the U.S. rather than Asia suggests they view the East Asian chip producers as their primary rivals that they are trying to outcompete.

Therefore, the final answer is:
IBM sees East Asian chip producers as their technological competition.

Response:
To determine who IBM sees as their technological competition, I will closely examine the information provided in the paragraph.

The key details are:
1. IBM opened a new $2.5 billion semiconductor factory, the largest single capital investment they have ever made.
2. This factory is part of IBM's strategy to "lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market."
3. The paragraph states that "Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage" in the personal computer business, which is an area IBM is trying to move beyond.
4. The paragraph also states that "to stay ahead in advanced chip technology, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial." This suggests IBM sees the need to stay ahead of their competitors in chip technology.

Based on this information, the paragraph indicates that IBM sees East Asian chip producers as their main technological competition. The paragraph specifically calls out East Asian chip producers as holding an advantage in the personal computer business, which IBM is trying to move beyond with its new factory.

Therefore, the final answer is:
IBM sees East Asian chip producers as their technological competition.

4. The paragraph also states that "to stay ahead in advanced chip technology, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial." This suggests IBM is trying to stay ahead of its competitors.

Based on this information, the main technological competitors that IBM sees are the "East Asian chip producers." The paragraph specifically calls them out as having an advantage in the personal computer chip market, which IBM is trying to move beyond with its new factory.

Therefore, the final answer is:
IBM sees East Asian chip producers as their technological competition.
