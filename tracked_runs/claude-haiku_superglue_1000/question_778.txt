Question:
Passage: It appears Mark Clattenburg isn't the Premier League's only fan of Ed Sheeran as Manchester United duo Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney were also spotted at one of the singer's shows. After referee Clattenburg got in trouble for breaking Premier League protocol in order to attend one of the singer's concerts in Newcastle, the United strikers have also shown their admiration for the 23-year-old by heading to his gig in Manchester. Captain Rooney tweeted a picture of himself and Sheeran after the show, saying: 'Brilliant time at @edsheeran concert last night. Thanks for a great night mate.'
