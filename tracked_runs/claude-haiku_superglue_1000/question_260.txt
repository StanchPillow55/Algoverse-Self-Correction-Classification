Question:
Paragraph: Have you ever looked closely at a globe? That continents look like a giant jig-saw puzzle. North America looks like it could fit next to Europe. The edge of South America matches Africa. Scientists noticed these same features. It caused them to start asking questions. They wanted to know if these continents were was connected? If so, how can something so large move so far? What could possibly have enough force to move such a giant slab of rock? Is there other evidence that can provide clues to the past positions of continents? How can answering these questions help us? A scientist named Alfred Wegener had these same questions. Wegener look at rocks on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. He noticed they were the same type and age. He thought that the rocks must have formed side by side. He proposed that the rocks then drifted apart. One part went with North America. The other part stayed with Europe. 

Question: Wagner proposed that rocks drifted apart in which directions?

Answer: One part went with North America the other part stayed with Europe


Reference Answer:
1


=== Turn 1 ===


Response:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the key information provided in the paragraph and then use it to determine the directions in which the rocks drifted apart according to Wegener's proposal.

Given information:
- Wegener noticed that the rocks on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean were the same type and age.
- Wegener proposed that the rocks must have formed side by side and then drifted apart.
- One part of the rocks went with North America, and the other part stayed with Europe.

Reasoning:
Based on the information provided, we can infer that Wegener proposed that the rocks drifted apart in the following directions:

1. One part of the rocks went with North America.
   - This means that the rocks that were originally side by side with the rocks in Europe drifted away and became part of the North American continent.

2. The other part of the rocks stayed with Europe.
   - This means that the rocks that were originally side by side with the rocks in North America remained in the European continent.

Therefore, according to Wegener's proposal, the rocks drifted apart in the following directions:
- One part went with North America,

=== Turn 2 ===


Response:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the paragraph and determine the directions in which Wegener proposed the rocks drifted apart.

Given information:
- Wegener noticed that the rocks on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean were the same type and age.
- Wegener proposed that the rocks must have formed side by side and then drifted apart.
- One part of the rocks went with North America, and the other part stayed with Europe.

Reasoning:
1. The paragraph states that Wegener noticed the rocks on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean were the same type and age.
2. This suggests that the rocks were originally connected and formed side by side.
3. Wegener then proposed that these rocks drifted apart, with one part going with North America and the other part staying with Europe.
4. This means that the rocks drifted in opposite directions, with one part moving towards North America and the other part staying with Europe.

Final answer:
Wegener proposed that the rocks drifted apart in opposite directions, with one part going with North America and the other part staying with Europe.
