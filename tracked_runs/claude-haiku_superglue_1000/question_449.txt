Question:
Passage: A holidaymaker who lost his camera overboard while kayaking in Australia six months ago is set to get his holiday snaps back in tact after it was discovered in a river. Traveller Chris Hesford, from Jersey was kayaking with friends off the coast of New South Wales when a rogue wave swept away his GoPro camera. Chris was halfway through a round-the-world trip and lost two months' worth of photos with the camera, which he never expected to see again. British backpacker Chris Hedford, from Jersey, was on an amazing round-the-world trip when he lost his camera But last week Australian Steve Carmody contacted the 22-year-old out of the blue via Facebook to say he had found his camera - in a riverbed 60 miles away from where it was lost.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it took for the camera to travel 60 miles in the river.

Given information:
- The camera was lost 6 months ago.
- The camera was found 60 miles away from where it was lost.

Step 1: Convert the time from months to days.
6 months = 6 Ã— 30 days = 180 days

Step 2: Calculate the average speed of the camera in the river.
Distance traveled = 60 miles
Time taken = 180 days
Average speed = Distance / Time
Average speed = 60 miles / 180 days = 0.333 miles per day

Step 3: Explain the reasoning.
The camera was swept away by a rogue wave while Chris Hesford was kayaking off the coast of New South Wales. The camera then traveled 60 miles in the river over a period of 6 months, which is 180 days.

To find the average speed of the camera in the river, we divide the distance traveled (60 miles) by the time taken (180 days). This gives us the average speed of 0
