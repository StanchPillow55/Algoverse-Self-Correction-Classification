Question:
Passage: By Sam Greenhill and Peter Campbell Google faced renewed outrage yesterday as its latest accounts revealed that it paid less than £12million corporation tax last year on bumper UK sales of £3billion. The ‘paltry’ sum was criticised by MPs, who called for action to force the internet giant to pay more. Its tax bill is only slightly higher than the previous year, when there was outcry over the way corporations such as Amazon, Starbucks and Google all found ways to avoid paying tax. Google’s accounts show that it handed over £11.6million in corporation tax for the 2012 financial year. Yet it raked in £3billion in revenues from its UK operations.
