Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- His stare stayed with them for days. The cold, harsh way he looked at them. The unease they just couldn't shake off when he did. So, when Austin Reed Sigg was arrested Tuesday night, accused of strangling 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway, dismembering her and placing her body parts under the two-story home where he lived, many of the girls in that Denver suburb weren't shocked. "He was so infatuated with the idea of death," Hannah Bane, a college classmate, told a local reporter. Detectives spent a bitter-cold Wednesday at Sigg's home in Westminster as crime scene technicians gathered more evidence in the gruesome case.
