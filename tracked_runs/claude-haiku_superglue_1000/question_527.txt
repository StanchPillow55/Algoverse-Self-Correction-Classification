Question:
Passage: By Diana Appleyard PUBLISHED: 17:35 EST, 1 February 2014 | UPDATED: 17:35 EST, 1 February 2014 To look at Kelly Simpkin, you would imagine that the head-turning blonde enjoys a jet-set life of frequent celebrity parties, swanky red-carpet events and lavish holidays with her famous hairdresser boyfriend, Nicky Clarke. But the reality is far from glamorous. For the 32-year-old faces a daily battle with the rare and potentially life-threatening disease lupus. This chronic auto-immune condition, for which there is no cure, affects 50,000 people in the UK – a staggering 90 per cent of whom are women.
