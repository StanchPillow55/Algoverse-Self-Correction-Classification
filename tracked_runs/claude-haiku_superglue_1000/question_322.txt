Question:
Passage: By Adam Crafton for MailOnline Follow @@AdamCrafton_ Andrew Cole has jumped to the defence of Manchester United and rubbished suggestions that his former club are in terminal decline. United have made a calamitous start to life under new manager Louis van Gaal, failing to win two Premier League games against Swansea and Sunderland before crashing to a 4-0 at MK Dons in the Capital One Cup. Paul Scholes has admitted he is ‘scared’ for the club he served so well. Cole, however, is a little more optimistic and does not believe that United will stagnate in the same as Liverpool did following the Anfield club’s sustained dominance in English football in the 1980's.

You're right, we shouldn't be too quick to write off Manchester United. While their start to the season has been poor, with losses to Swansea and MK Dons, it's still early days under a new manager. United have a proud history and a talented squad, and I believe they will find their form and be competitive this season. It's important to give the team and the new manager time to gel and implement their system. United may have stumbled out of the gate, but they have the quality to bounce back and be "there or thereabouts" come the end of the season. We shouldn't be too quick to
