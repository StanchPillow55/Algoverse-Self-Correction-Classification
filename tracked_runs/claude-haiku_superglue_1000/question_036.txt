Question:
Passage: Andres Iniesta did not feature in the contenders for the best player of the 2010 World Cup despite scoring Spain's winning goal in the final, but the midfielder has been recognized  for his country's historic triumph at Euro 2012. The 28-year-old Barcelona star is one of 10 Spanish players in UEFA's 23-man squad, which features four from losing finalists Italy. Iniesta, clubmates Xavi Hernandez and Sergio Buesquets plus Real Madrid's Xabi Alonso were included in a nine-strong midfield contingent, while David Silva and Cesc Fabregas were named among five forwards despite playing in Spain's so-called "no striker" formation. The Spaniards completely nullified Italy's midfield general Andrea Pirlo in Sunday's final, winning 4-0 in Kiev to clinch a third successive major title.
