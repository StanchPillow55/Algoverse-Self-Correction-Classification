Question:
Passage: When Caroline Wozniacki’s world came crashing down in May, her wedding plans suddenly and very publicly cancelled, she knew who she could turn to. Beyond her immediate family, one of the first people she called was Serena Williams, asking if she fancied to spend some party time together on Miami’s South Beach to help try and regroup after the shock. Serena, who was also going through a turbulent time with her coach/boyfriend Patrick Mouratoglou, agreed and the pair seemed to be content to be photographed hanging out together. Friendship: Serena Williams was there for Caroline Wozniacki after her split from Rory McIlroy
