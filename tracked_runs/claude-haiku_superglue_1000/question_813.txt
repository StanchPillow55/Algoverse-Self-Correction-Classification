Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- An extra day once every four years doesn't really give travelers much more time to play, but it's an excuse for the hospitality industry to create special Leap Year travel offers. (Each year is actually 365 days plus about 6 hours. An additional day is added to the calendar every four years to keep the calendar in sync with the seasonal year.) Swim into San Diego. If you stay three nights at the Hotel Palomar in San Diego, the fourth night is $29. Also included are a $29 daily food and beverage credit and morning coffee and tea service in the hotel living room. The rate must be booked by February 29. Rooms start at $229 and the fourth night charge is $29. The offer is valid for travel between February 22 and March 7. Call (888) 288-6601 or book online and include rate code PLPY.
