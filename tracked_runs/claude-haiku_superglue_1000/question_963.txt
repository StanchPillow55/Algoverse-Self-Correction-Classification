Question:
Passage: This forces firm to cancel or postpone flights, destroying passenger confidence it its timetable By Graham Smith Last updated at 2:11 PM on 3rd January 2012 Zimbabwe's cash-strapped national airline has suspended all of its flights to Britain after one of its planes was impounded at Gatwick over unpaid bills. Air Zimbabwe bosses today announced that the state-owned company will no longer serve London or Johannesburg, South Africa, amid a crippling financial crisis that has engulfed the company. The move comes after one of the struggling airline's 767s was last month seized at Gatwick airport over an outstanding Â£780,000 ($1.2million) debt with a U.S. parts supplier.
