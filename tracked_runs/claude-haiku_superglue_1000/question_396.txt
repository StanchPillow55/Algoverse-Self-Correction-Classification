Question:
Passage: By Associated Press and David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor Half the U.S. Senate urged NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell on Thursday to change the Washington Redskins' name, saying it is a 'racist slur' and the time is ripe to replace it. In one letter, a group of 49 Democrats cited the NBA's quick action recently to ban Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling for life after he was heard on an audio recording making offensive comments about blacks.
