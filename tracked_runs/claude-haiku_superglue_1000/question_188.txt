Question:
Paragraph: According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said "we have some planes." Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a "nationwide ground stop." While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25. The Command Center kept looking for American 77. At 9:21, it advised the Dulles terminal control facility, and Dulles urged its controllers to look for primary targets. At 9:32, they found one. Several of the Dulles controllers "observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed" and notified Reagan National Airport. FAA personnel at both Reagan National and Dulles airports notified the Secret Service. 

Question: What was one of the mistakes besides the air traffic control search that lead to America 77 flying for 36 min. undetected?

Answer: Neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the paragraph and identify the mistakes that led to American 77 flying undetected for 36 minutes.

The key information from the paragraph is:
1. American 77 reemerged on Indianapolis Center radar at 9:05 but was not detected by the controllers.
2. Indianapolis Center did not instruct other controllers to turn on their primary radar coverage to search for American 77.
3. The Command Center and FAA headquarters did not issue an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets.

The mistake that led to American 77 flying undetected for 36 minutes, besides the air traffic control search, was:

The Command Center and FAA headquarters did not issue an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets.

Reasoning:
The paragraph states that "neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets." This means that the Command Center and FAA headquarters failed to alert other air traffic control centers to actively search for American 77 on their primary radar. If they had issued an all points bulletin, the surrounding centers would have

Response:
Based on the information provided in the paragraph, one of the mistakes that led to American 77 flying undetected for 36 minutes was that neither the FAA Command Center nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding air traffic control centers to search for the primary radar target of American 77.

The reasoning is as follows:

1. The paragraph states that "Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets."
2. This means that the FAA Command Center and FAA headquarters did not take the necessary action to alert other air traffic control centers to actively search for American 77 on their radar screens.
3. If an all points bulletin had been issued, the surrounding air traffic control centers would have been aware of the missing aircraft and could have joined the search, potentially detecting American 77 earlier.
4. The lack of this critical communication and coordination among the air traffic control centers allowed American 77 to fly undetected for 36 minutes.

Therefore, the mistake, in addition to the air traffic control search, was the failure to issue an all points bulletin to surrounding air traffic control

Response:
Based on the information provided in the paragraph, one of the mistakes that led to American 77 flying undetected for 36 minutes was that neither the FAA Command Center nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding air traffic control centers to search for the aircraft on primary radar.

The reasoning is as follows:

1. The paragraph states that "Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets."
2. This means that the surrounding air traffic control centers were not alerted to actively search for American 77 on their primary radar displays.
3. As a result, American 77 was able to travel undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C.
4. If an all points bulletin had been issued, the surrounding centers might have been able to detect the aircraft on their primary radar and assist in the search.

Therefore, the mistake besides the air traffic control search that led to American 77 flying undetected for 36 minutes was the failure to issue an all points bulletin to surrounding air traffic control centers.
