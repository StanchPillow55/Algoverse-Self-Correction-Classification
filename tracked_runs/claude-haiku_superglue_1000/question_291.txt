Question:
Passage: (Mashable) -- Ford is installing a feature in its new vehicles -- and many of its older ones -- that can read text messages out loud. The feature, which is intended to reduce texting while driving, is part of Ford's voice-activated technology, Sync, and is already installed on all model 2012 Ford vehicles with the exception of the Ranger. Using a Bluetooth connection, it syncs with phones and alerts users when they receive text messages, reads them out loud and allows users to respond with a selection of standard pre-written messages without taking their hands off the wheel. On Tuesday, it will be made available as an upgrade to Sync vehicles that are model 2010 or later. In order to install the capability, owners can download the upgrade from the Ford Sync site onto a USB drive along with print-out instructions. Older Ford vehicles that have Sync will soon be able to make the update as well, says supervisor of Sync product development Mark Porter.

The passage mentions that the Sync feature, which can read text messages aloud and allow users to respond with pre-written messages, is already installed on all 2012 Ford vehicles, except for the Ranger model. It also states that the feature will be made available as an upgrade for Sync-equipped vehicles from 2010 or later.

The quote in the question suggests that the voice-activated technology and hands-free profile for integrating with vehicles were just emerging a couple of years ago, and that few phones supported it at the time.

Given this context, the most appropriate word to replace the placeholder "@placeholder" would be "hands-free" or "hands-free devices".
