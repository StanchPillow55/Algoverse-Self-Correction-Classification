Question:
Passage: By Simon Tomlinson and James Tozer PUBLISHED: 11:16 EST, 23 April 2013 | UPDATED: 06:59 EST, 24 April 2013 A mother accused of murdering five people by setting fire to a pushchair outside their front door said that the person who started the blaze was ‘beyond evil’. Melanie Smith, pictured for the first time arriving at court yesterday, denied killing the three children and two adults because she was fed up with the buggy being left outside her own front door, adding that she was ‘not that kind of person’. Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, her son Charlie, aged 15 months, Miss Shiers’s nephew Bailey, four, and niece Skye, two, died in the fire at the first-floor flat in Prestatyn, north Wales. Miss Shiers’s partner, Liam Timbrell, 23, died in hospital a fortnight later.
