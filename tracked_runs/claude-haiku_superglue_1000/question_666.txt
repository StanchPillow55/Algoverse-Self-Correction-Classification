Question:
Passage: By Ray Massey and Rob Davies PUBLISHED: 13:46 EST, 11 December 2012 | UPDATED: 04:45 EST, 12 December 2012 The boss of British Airways’ parent company Willie Walsh has bet Sir Richard Branson ‘a knee in the groin’ that Virgin Atlantic will not survive five years. And Sir Richard has accepted the remarkable challenge – saying the painful debt will be paid out to the loser at the winner’s headquarters. The unusual ‘below the belt’ wager came after America's largest airline, Delta, took a 49 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic under a major deal announced today. Sir Richard tried to bet Walsh £1million that his Virgin airline would flourish after the deal. But Walsh said he did not have the cash and offered the 'painful' bet instead.
