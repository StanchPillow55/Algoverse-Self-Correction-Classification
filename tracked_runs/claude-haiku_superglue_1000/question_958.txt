Question:
Passage: ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Wendell Lawing's eyes light up as the 88-year-old man talks about his last flight in a B-17 bomber. Wendell Lawing, 88, recently flew on a B-17 for the first time since World War II. "We were going to Berlin, and we were flying around 20,000 feet. Suddenly, Me 109s headed out of the clouds," said the Atlanta native, referring to Germany's Messerschmitt fighter aircraft. "We had a big fight, a running fight, and I personally saw my waist gunner shoot down one of those Me 109s right outside the window." Seconds later, his bomber was struck in the plane's radio room. Lawing, who was the radio operator, already had moved farther back in the plane.
