Passage: By Leon Watson PUBLISHED: 07:41 EST, 30 March 2013 | UPDATED: 11:30 EST, 30 March 2013 Post Office workers have gone on strike today in a row over jobs, pay and closures - saying they received strong support from the public over their action. Members of the Communication Workers Union in around 260 so-called Crown offices took industrial action in protest at plans to close or franchise 70 branches. The union said the walkout was 'solidly' supported by thousands of its members, with picket lines set up outside post offices across the country.
