Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine by Japanese officials, including the younger brother of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, ignited criticism from China and Korea, which see the visits as an homage to Japan's past wartime aggressions. Over the weekend several officials, including Abe's brother, senior vice foreign minister Nobuo Kishi, visited the shrine, according to Kyodo News. The visits started last week as part of an autumn festival and included 159 members of the Diet, Japan's national legislature. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe refrained from visiting the shrine, but sent an offering. An editorial in Global Times, a Chinese state-run newspaper, blasted Japanese officials for their deference to the shrine.
