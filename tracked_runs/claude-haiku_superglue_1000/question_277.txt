To determine if the word "light" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "He stepped into the light."
In this sentence, the word "light" is used to refer to a physical source of illumination, such as sunlight or artificial lighting. The person is stepping into an area that is illuminated, suggesting a literal interpretation of the word "light."
