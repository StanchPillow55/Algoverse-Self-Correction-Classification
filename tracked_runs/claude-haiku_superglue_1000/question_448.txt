Question:
Passage: Amid the chaos of flying bullets, roaming checkpoints guarded by gunmen, and the constant threat of a street battle erupting around the corner at any moment, a new underground television channel has become must-see TV for residents of Aleppo, Syria. It doesn't look like much. Aleppo Today TV, with it photographic slideshow of Aleppo in happier times accompanied by Syrian music, is not what many would expect from a 24-hour news channel. But two rolling news bars at the bottom of the screen have become a vital news source for residents navigating the shifting violence in Syria's largest city. "Aleppo Today started at a time when a person in Aleppo might know that someone a couple of blocks away got killed, or a demonstration happened in the next neighborhood," wrote Omar Halabi, the assistant manager of Aleppo Today, in an e-mail to CNN.

Response:
To solve this problem, I will need to fill in the missing information in the query. The passage provides some relevant details, but does not explicitly state the name of the 23-year-old individual mentioned.

Given information:
- The passage mentions a 23-year-old individual who worked as a baker in Aleppo, Syria until the uprising began more than 20 months ago.
- This individual asked not to have his name published in full for the safety of his family still living in Aleppo.

To find the missing name, I will need to make a reasonable inference based on the information provided.

Reasoning:
Since the passage states that the 23-year-old individual "asked not to have his named published in full", this suggests that only a partial name was provided. 

A common way to represent a partially revealed name is to use a placeholder, such as the "@placeholder" used in the query.

Therefore, the most reasonable answer is that the missing name is the placeholder "@placeholder".

Final answer:
The 23-year-old individual mentioned in the passage is "@placeholder".

Response:
To solve this problem, I will need to fill in the missing information in the query. The passage provides some context, but does not explicitly state the name of the 23-year-old individual mentioned. I will need to use the information given to infer a reasonable placeholder for the missing name.

Given information:
- The passage mentions a 23-year-old individual who worked as a baker in Aleppo, Syria until the uprising began more than 20 months ago.
- This individual asked not to have his full name published for the safety of his family still living in Aleppo.

Reasoning:
Since the passage does not provide the individual's full name, I will use a placeholder name to represent him. A common placeholder name used in this type of context is "John Doe".

Therefore, the complete query with the placeholder filled in would be:

"For the safety of his family still living in Aleppo, the 23-year old John Doe, who worked as a baker until the uprising began more than 20 months ago, asked not to have his named published in full."

Final answer:
For the safety of his family still living in Aleppo
