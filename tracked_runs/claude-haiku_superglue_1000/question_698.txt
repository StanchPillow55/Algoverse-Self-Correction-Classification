Question:
Passage: Los Angeles (CNN) -- AMC's "Mad Men" won a fourth consecutive best drama series Emmy, while the ABC sitcom "Modern Family" took top comedy honors at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles Sunday night. PBS' "Downton Abbey," a Masterpiece production, won the best miniseries Emmy, although HBO's "Mildred Pierce" and ReelzChannel's "The Kennedys" had a share in the acting honors. Charlie Sheen delivered onstage drama when he took the stage to present the trophy for best lead actor in a comedy series, which he called "my old category." Sheen, bounced from his hit sitcom "Two and a Half Men" earlier this year after a spat with producers, said he wanted "to take a moment to get something off my chest and say a few words to everyone here from 'Two and a Half Men.' "
