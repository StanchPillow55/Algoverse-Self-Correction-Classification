Question:
Paragraph: In Colombia, the drug-financed guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include M-19, which Castro has clearly backed. Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida, doesn't think for a minute that Castro's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel. "If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations, the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them," he told the Journal's David Asman recently. The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing. This week, the government arrested Jose Abello Silva, said to be the fourth-ranking cartel leader. He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived. Later, another high-ranking trafficker, Leonidas Vargas, was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized. Mr. Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid. President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr. Barco, President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem. It might not be a bad idea to do that sooner, rather than later. After the Panama fiasco, they will need some reassurance. Certainly, the Colombian press is much in need of that.

Response:
To answer this question, I will go through the paragraph step-by-step and analyze the relevant information.

The paragraph discusses the drug-financed guerrillas in Colombia, including the M-19 group, which is backed by Castro. It mentions that a former U.S. attorney, Robert Merkel, does not believe that Castro has broken off his relationship with the Medellin drug cartel, even though Castro has put some high-ranking officials on trial.

The paragraph then discusses the Colombian government's efforts to combat the drug lords. It mentions that the government has arrested two high-ranking drug traffickers, Jose Abello Silva and Leonidas Vargas, and has seized 1,000 pounds of dynamite. The paragraph also states that the Colombian president, Virgilio Barco, has refused to accept U.S. troops or advisers, but has accepted U.S. military aid.

Finally, the paragraph mentions that President Bush has agreed to meet with the presidents of Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia within 90 days to discuss the drug problem. The paragraph suggests that this meeting might be a good idea to happen sooner rather than later, "after the Panama fiasco,"
