Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Les Paul never stopped tinkering, said Henry Juszkiewicz. Les Paul was constantly making recommendations on how to improve guitars, says the CEO of Gibson. Juszkiewicz, the chairman and CEO of Gibson Guitars, remembers getting calls from his company's partner (and famed client), offering recommendations on how to change or market his eponymous Gibson guitars. Sometimes, Juszkiewicz recalls, the two would go out for Chinese food. Paul was very particular, desiring a dish called Chicken Subgum. The two would have to search Chinatown for a restaurant that knew how to cook it, he says with a chuckle. Les Paul died Thursday of pneumonia. He was 94.
