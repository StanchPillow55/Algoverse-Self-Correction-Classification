Question:
Passage: Garry Monk has backed his former mentor Brendan Rodgers to be the man who saves Mario Balotelli’s career. Rodgers’ summer gamble has so far looked woefully ill-advised, with Balotelli flopping since joining Liverpool for £16m from AC Milan. But Monk believes if anyone can draw top form out of the 24-year-old, it is Rodgers, whose side face Swansea in the Capital One Cup last 16 on Tuesday.
