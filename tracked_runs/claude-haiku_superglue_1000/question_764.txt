Question:
Passage: By Stuart Woledge PUBLISHED: 04:33 EST, 22 August 2013 | UPDATED: 08:08 EST, 22 August 2013 The unstoppable Duck Dynasty is on course to snatch cable TV's ratings record from The Walking dead after 11.8 million viewers tuned in to watch the start of the new season. The boss of A&E Network's is cautiously optimistic that the hilarious exploits of a Louisiana family and their duck merchandise business still has plenty of room to grow. With some 'fun episodes coming down the pike', the show needs just 600,000 more viewers to equal current record holder, zombie fest The Walking Dead, which recorded the highest ever ratings for a show of any kind when 12.4 million people tuned in earlier this year.
