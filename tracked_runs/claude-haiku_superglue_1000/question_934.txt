Question:
Passage: Raheem Sterling may still be without a Premier League goal since September, but the 20-year-old can be pleased with his contribution following Liverpool's 2-2 draw against Arsenal. Sitting at the very top of Brendan Rodgers' 3-4-3 system, Sterling looked a constant threat during the first 45 minutes despite losing his early exchanges with Arsenal defenders Mathieu Debuchy and Calum Chambers. The England international spent most of the initial period drifting across the line and found space well, often pointing to where he wanted the likes of Philippe Coutinho to play the ball.
