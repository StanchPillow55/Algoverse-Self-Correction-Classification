Question:
Passage: Will Smith's date doctor "Hitch" is setting up a practice on TV. According to numerous reports, Fox is adapting the 2005 romantic comedy into a half-hour show, in addition to trying to create TV versions of comedies "Big" and "Monster-in-Law." Smith starred in the movie "Hitch" as the titular dating guru Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, who would help ordinary men shape up and land the partner of their dreams. Eva Mendes co-starred as the woman Hitch falls for. The movie has had a long shelf life, as it's still in regular rotation on cable after earning close to $370 million at the box office worldwide.
