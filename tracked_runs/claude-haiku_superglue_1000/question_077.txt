Question:
Passage: By Associated Press Iekhan Safar moved from Iraq to Lincoln for the same reason that hundreds of Yazidis, a Kurdish religious minority, came to Nebraska's capital city: to live near family, far from the dangers they've long faced as a persecuted group. Lincoln has the largest concentration of Yazidis (yah-ZEE-dees) in the United States, and many of them brought their families to the U.S. after receiving visas for serving as translators during the first Gulf War. Now, the city is at the center of a frantic effort to draw attention to the group's plight in northern Iraq, where Yazidis are fleeing from Islamic State militants to escape violence and attempts to convert them to Islam.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the @placeholder in the given query.

Given information:
- Lincoln, Nebraska has the largest concentration of Yazidis in the United States.
- The passage states that "roughly half the nation's @placeholder population — about 200 families — lives" in Lincoln.

To find the value of the @placeholder, we need to determine the total Yazidi population in the United States.

Step 1: Calculate the total Yazidi population in Lincoln.
Total Yazidi population in Lincoln = 200 families

Step 2: Determine the total Yazidi population in the United States.
Since the passage states that the Yazidi population in Lincoln is "roughly half the nation's @placeholder population," we can use this information to find the total Yazidi population in the United States.

Let the total Yazidi population in the United States be x.
Then, the Yazidi population in Lincoln is approximately x/2.

We know that the Yazidi population in Lincoln is about 200 families, so:

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the @placeholder in the given query.

Given information:
- Lincoln, Nebraska has the largest concentration of Yazidis in the United States.
- Roughly half the nation's Yazidi population, which is about 200 families, lives in Lincoln.

To find the value of the @placeholder, we need to calculate the total Yazidi population in the United States.

Step 1: Calculate the total Yazidi population in Lincoln.
Total Yazidi population in Lincoln = 200 families

Step 2: Calculate the total Yazidi population in the United States.
Since Lincoln has roughly half the nation's Yazidi population, we can double the Yazidi population in Lincoln to find the total Yazidi population in the United States.
Total Yazidi population in the United States = 2 × 200 families = 400 families

Therefore, the value of the @placeholder is 400 families, which represents the total Yazidi population in the United States.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the @placeholder in the given query.

Given information:
- Lincoln, Nebraska has the largest concentration of Yazidis in the United States.
- The city is home to about 200 Yazidi families, which is roughly half the nation's Yazidi population.

To find the total Yazidi population in the United States, we can use the information provided:

Step 1: Determine the total number of Yazidi families in Lincoln.
Total Yazidi families in Lincoln = 200 families

Step 2: Determine the total Yazidi population in the United States.
Since the 200 Yazidi families in Lincoln represent roughly half the nation's Yazidi population, we can double the number of families to find the total Yazidi population in the United States.

Total Yazidi population in the United States = 200 families × 2 = 400 families

Therefore, the @placeholder in the given query is the total Yazidi population in the United States, which is 400 families.
