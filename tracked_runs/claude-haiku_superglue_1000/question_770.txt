Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Globetrotting Chelsea bounced back from their defeat in the FIFA Club World Cup final to Corinthians with a resounding victory in the League Cup at Leeds. Rafael Benitez's side ran out 5-1 winners at the second tier outfit, having trailed 1-0 at halftime, thanks to goals from Juan Mata, Branislav Ivanovic, Victor Moses, Eden Hazard and Fernando Torres. Having arrived back in London from Japan on Monday after their defeat in FIFA's showpiece club tournament, Chelsea progressed to the last eight on a rain-soaked night Yorkshire. Luciano Becchio gave Leeds -- European Champions League semifinalists back in 2001 -- a first half lead but Spain's Mata equalized early in the second half.
