Merah emerged from a bathroom in his apartment and fired more than 30 shots at police as they burst in to end a standoff that had lasted more than 31 hours, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said. He jumped out a window onto a balcony, still shooting, and was found dead on the ground, officials said. Two police officers were injured in the raid, Interior Minister Claude Gueant said.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of days between the start of the shootings on March 11 and the end of the shootings on Monday.

Given information:
- The shootings began on March 11.
- The shootings ended on Monday with the slaying of the rabbi and the children at a school in Toulouse.

Step 1: Determine the date of the Monday when the shootings ended.
Since the passage does not specify the exact date of the Monday when the shootings ended, we can assume that it was the Monday immediately following the start of the shootings on March 11.

Step 2: Calculate the number of days between March 11 and the Monday when the shootings ended.
March 11 (Sunday) to Monday = 1 day
Monday to the following Monday = 7 days

Total number of days = 1 day + 7 days = 8 days

Therefore, the shootings began on March 11 and ended on the following Monday, a total of 8 days later.

Final answer: The shootings began on March 11 and ended on the following Monday, a total of 8
