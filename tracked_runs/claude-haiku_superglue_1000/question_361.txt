Question:
Passage: Canada's most valuable export? Oil. Its most problematic? Justin Bieber. You know it's going to be a strange week when the hashtag #DeportBieber. is trending on Twitter. Guess what? Nineteen-year-old singer and teen heartthrob Justin Bieber -- who was arrested this week in Miami Beach for street racing in a $250,000 Lamborghini while under the influence of alcohol and drugs, driving without a valid license, and resisting arrest -- is not a U.S. citizen. Rather, Bieber is a citizen of his native Canada. Lucky Canada. Bieber is in the United States on an O-1 work visa that was designed to retain foreigners with "extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business or athletics."

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of the bond set for Justin Bieber.

Given information:
- Justin Bieber was arrested for street racing under the influence of alcohol and drugs, driving without a valid license, and resisting arrest.
- Bieber was released from jail after making a brief appearance through a video link before a judge.
- The judge set a "standard" $2,500 bond.

Step 1: Understand the problem.
The problem is asking us to show the complete reasoning and work behind the $2,500 bond set for Justin Bieber.

Step 2: Explain the reasoning.
The judge likely set a "standard" bond amount of $2,500 for Justin Bieber's release from jail. This is a common bond amount for misdemeanor charges, such as the ones Bieber was facing (driving under the influence, driving without a valid license, and resisting arrest).

The judge may have considered several factors in setting the bond amount, such as:
- The severity of the charges
- Bieber's flight risk (as a non-U.S. citizen)
- Bieber's ability
