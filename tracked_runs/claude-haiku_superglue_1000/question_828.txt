Question:
Passage: A forensic psychologist called in to analyse the Sydney siege gunman has revealed how just hours after the ordeal ended he counselled a crying Muslim taxi driver who feared for his life because two people had been killed by a man claiming to be part of his religion. Self-styled Sheik Man Haron Monis forced his 18 hostages to hold up an Islamic Shahada flag, which bore an inscription 'There is no god but God, and Mohamed is the messenger of God' during his 16-hour siege at the Lindt Café in Martin Place. As Tim Watson-Munro hoped into a cab to travel to his office on Elizabeth Street, not far from the scene where Monis killed Lindt manager Tori Johnson and barrister Katrina Dawson, he noticed his bearded driver looked upset.
