No


=== Turn 1 ===


Response:
To determine if the word "line" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "There is a narrow line between sanity and insanity."
In this sentence, the word "line" is used metaphorically to represent the boundary or distinction between sanity and insanity. It is not referring to a physical line, but rather a conceptual or abstract idea.

Sentence 2: "He got out of line."
In this sentence, the word "line" is used idiomatically to mean that the person has behaved in an inappropriate or unacceptable manner, deviating from the expected or proper behavior.

Analyzing the two usages of the word "line":
- In the first sentence, "line" is used metaphorically to represent a conceptual boundary.
- In the second sentence, "line" is used idiomatically to refer to appropriate behavior or conduct.

Therefore, the word "line" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. The meanings are different, one being metaphorical and the other being idiomatic.

Final answer: No
