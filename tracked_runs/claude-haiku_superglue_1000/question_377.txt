To determine if the word "line" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and the meaning of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "A dedicated line."
In this sentence, the word "line" is used to refer to a dedicated communication channel or a dedicated connection, such as a telephone line or a network connection that is reserved for a specific purpose.

Sentence 2: "I can't follow your line of reasoning."
In this sentence, the word "line" is used to refer to a sequence of thought or a train of thought, a logical progression of ideas or arguments.
