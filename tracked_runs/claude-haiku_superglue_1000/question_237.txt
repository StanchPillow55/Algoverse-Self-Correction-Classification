Response:
To determine if the word 'have' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "I have two years left."
In this sentence, the word 'have' is used to indicate possession or ownership. The speaker is stating that they have or possess two years remaining.

Sentence 2: "He had an insulin shock after eating three candy bars."

In the first sentence, 'have' is used to express possession, while in the second sentence, 'had' is used to describe a past event.

Therefore, the word 'have' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
