Response:
To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and determine the appropriate response to the query.

The passage discusses the delay in the announcement of the results of the Egyptian presidential election. It mentions that the electoral committee has not completed the verification of 400 electoral violation reports submitted by the two presidential candidates. As a result, the announcement of the election results has been delayed by a day or two.

The passage also mentions that the former ruler, Hosni Mubarak, was removed from life-support equipment and his health improved a day after a state-run news agency reported that he was "clinically dead."

The query asks about the citizens' reaction to the "health scare" on Tuesday. However, the passage does not mention any specific "health scare" that occurred on Tuesday. The only health-related information in the passage is about Hosni Mubarak's condition, but this is not described as a "health scare."

Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, there is no evidence to suggest that citizens were cynical or fatalistic about a "health scare" on Tuesday. The passage does not provide any information about the citizens' reactions to any health-related events

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and determine the appropriate response to the query.

The passage discusses the delay in the announcement of the results of the Egyptian presidential election, as well as the health status of former Egyptian ruler Hosni Mubarak. However, the passage does not mention anything about the citizens' reactions to a "health scare" on Tuesday.

Since the passage does not provide any information about a "health scare" or the citizens' reactions, I do not have enough information to answer the given query. The query appears to be unrelated to the content of the passage.

Therefore, the appropriate response is: "I do not have enough information to answer the given query, as it is not related to the content of the provided passage."

Response:
To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and determine the appropriate placeholder to use in the query.

The passage discusses the delay in the announcement of the results of the Egyptian presidential election. It mentions that the electoral committee has not completed the verification of 400 electoral violation reports submitted by the two presidential candidates. This suggests that there is uncertainty and controversy surrounding the election results.

The passage also mentions that the former ruler, Hosni Mubarak, was removed from life-support equipment and his health improved, which was reported a day after he was declared "clinically dead" by a state-run news agency.

Given this context, the appropriate placeholder in the query would be "Mubarak's", as the passage suggests that there was a "health scare" surrounding Mubarak's condition.

Therefore, the complete query would be:

"Citizens were cynical or fatalistic about the Mubarak's health scare Tuesday."
