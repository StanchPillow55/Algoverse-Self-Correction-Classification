Question:
Passage: After Allison Dore had an unhappy experience during a trip to the dentist, she did what thousands do as a matter of routine: she posted a negative review on a consumer website. But that decision could cost her dearly because the dental practice has taken the unusual step of suing her for £125,000 damages plus legal costs, saying that her online claims were wrong. The firm’s action has been condemned by the business listings and reviews site Yelp, which says it could have a chilling effect on free speech. The row began when Allison, 46, was referred by her NHS dentist to B Dental in Islington, London, for £10,000 worth of tooth implants.
