Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- President Obama has written yet another letter to Iran's Supreme Leader and, by all accounts, his missives remain unrequited.

It is good that Iran and the United States are talking. But this is another matter altogether. A letter is not needed to maintain communications. The two countries are already engaged in high-level negotiations, with a make-or-break deadline fast approaching on a nuclear deal.
