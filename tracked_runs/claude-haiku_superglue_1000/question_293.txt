Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The European Union forged a political agreement on Monday to list the military wing of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, a European diplomat told CNN. The Iranian-backed Lebanese Shiite group, which is a strong force in Lebanese politics, already is regarded as a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel. Hezbollah leader acknowledges fighters' presence in Syria town There had been political pressure to put the entire group on the terror list amid developments in Bulgaria and Cyprus. The designation would put asset freezes on Hezbollah entities. "Legal details need to be worked on in the coming days," the diplomat said.
