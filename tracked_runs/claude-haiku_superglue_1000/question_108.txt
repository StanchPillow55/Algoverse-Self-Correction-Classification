Question:
Paragraph: Mechanical energy is a combination of the energy of motion or position. This type of energy describes objects that are moving or could move. A moving ball can have energy from motion. An arrow can also have the energy of motion. Both are types of mechanical energy. Can you think of some other examples? Where does the energy of motion come from? It comes from the energy created by position. This energy is stored energy. This means it is not moving yet, but it has the potential to move. How can you store energy? The arrow gains energy from the drawn bow. As the arrow is released, the bow releases its stored energy and puts the arrow into motion. Can you think of some other ways to store energy using position?

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the concepts of mechanical energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy.

Mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic energy (energy of motion) and potential energy (energy of position or stored energy).

In the given paragraph, the examples of a moving ball and a moving arrow are described as having mechanical energy.

Specifically, the paragraph states that a moving ball and a moving arrow have "energy from motion", which is the definition of kinetic energy.

The paragraph also mentions that the energy of motion comes from the "energy created by position", which is the definition of potential energy.

Therefore, the type of energy that a moving arrow or ball have is kinetic energy.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Mechanical energy is a combination of kinetic energy (energy of motion) and potential energy (energy of position or stored energy).
2. The paragraph states that a moving ball and a moving arrow have "energy from motion", which is the definition of kinetic energy.
3. The paragraph also mentions that the energy of motion comes from the "energy created by position", which is the definition of potential energy.
4. Therefore, the type of energy that a moving

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the concepts of mechanical energy and the different types of energy involved in the examples provided in the paragraph.

The paragraph states that mechanical energy is a combination of the energy of motion (kinetic energy) and the energy of position (potential energy). It also mentions that a moving ball and a moving arrow are examples of mechanical energy.

Let's analyze the examples provided:

1. Moving ball:
   - A moving ball has energy from motion, which is known as kinetic energy.
   - Kinetic energy is the energy an object possesses due to its motion.

2. Moving arrow:
   - The paragraph states that an arrow can also have the energy of motion, which is also kinetic energy.
   - When an arrow is released from a drawn bow, it gains kinetic energy as it moves through the air.

The paragraph also mentions that the energy of motion comes from the energy created by position, which is potential energy.

Potential energy is the energy an object possesses due to its position or configuration. In the example of the arrow, the potential energy is stored in the drawn bow. As the arrow is released, the bow releases its stored potential energy and converts it

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the concepts of mechanical energy and the different types of energy involved in the motion of objects like a moving arrow or ball.

Given information:
- Mechanical energy is a combination of the energy of motion (kinetic energy) and the energy of position (potential energy).
- A moving ball or arrow has mechanical energy.
- The energy of motion comes from the energy created by position, which is stored energy (potential energy).
- An arrow gains energy from the drawn bow, and as it is released, the bow releases its stored energy and puts the arrow into motion.

Step 1: Identify the type of energy a moving arrow or ball has.
Based on the information provided, a moving arrow or ball has kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion.

Explanation:
- When an object is in motion, it possesses kinetic energy, which is the energy it has due to its motion.
- A moving ball or arrow has kinetic energy because they are in motion and possess the energy of motion.
- The energy of motion comes from the energy created by position (potential energy) that is released and converted into kinetic energy.
