Question:
Passage: (CNN)Who says you need a printer to churn out digital-quality images? The Human Printer, a project from graphic design duo Stinsensqueeze, is recreating this modern effect with decidedly old-school techniques. Louise Naunton Morgan and Stina Gromark use fine tip markers and endless patience to mimic the layered tonality of CMYK color printing, which uses cyan, magenta, yellow and black to create the full spectrum. (You may recognize these colors from your old printer cartridges.) However, the handmade component gives each print its own look and feel. "With something handmade, you create unique experiences or unique art works, whereas digitally, you can produce it over and over again, and it's exactly the same," says Gromark.
