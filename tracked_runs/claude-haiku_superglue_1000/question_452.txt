Question:
Passage: By Francesca Chambers and David Martosko The campaign arm of Congressional Democrats has raised more than $7.6 million since House Republicans announced a lawsuit against President Barack Obama last month. The Democratic Congressional Campaign committee says it raised $1 million in a single day after newly elected Republican Whip Steve Scalise repeatedly refused to tell Fox News' Chris Wallace on Sunday that the House wouldn't impeach the president. House Speaker John Boehner has said time and time again that the legal action the House intends to take against Obama is not a precursor to impeachment, but Democrats have continued to link the two together, causing headaches for Republican leaders.
