Question:
Passage: By Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor PUBLISHED: 02:05 EST, 12 June 2013 | UPDATED: 06:40 EST, 12 June 2013 David Cameron will today launch a web campaign to pile pressure on Labour and the Lib Dems to drop their opposition to giving the public a say on the EU. The Prime Minister will risk coalition unity by urging voters in Lib Dem seats to bombard their MP with emails, web messages and tweets demanding they back a law on holding a referendum on Britainâ€™s relationship with Brussels. And he will use the Let Britain Decide to challenge Labour leader Ed Miliband and his MPs to support legislation on holding an in-out vote.
