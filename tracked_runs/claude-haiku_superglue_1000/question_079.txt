Response:
Unfortunately, there is no mathematical problem or calculation to solve in the given passage. The passage is a sports news article describing a remarkable comeback by Bradford City against Chelsea in the FA Cup. It does not contain any numerical information or a mathematical problem that I can solve.

The query "They'd dreamed of scoring or providing an assist at @placeholder during those fledgling days" also does not seem to be a mathematical problem. It appears to be a hypothetical statement about someone's dreams or aspirations, without any numerical values or calculations involved.

As an AI math problem solver, I do not have the capability to extract a mathematical problem from this type of textual information. I can only provide solutions to well-defined mathematical problems that are presented to me. Without a clear mathematical question or problem statement, I cannot generate any meaningful work or reasoning, nor provide a final answer.

Response:
Unfortunately, there is no mathematical problem or calculation to solve in the given passage. The passage is a description of a football (soccer) match between Chelsea and Bradford City, where Bradford City came back from 2-0 down to win 4-2. 

The query "They'd dreamed of scoring or providing an assist at @placeholder during those fledgling days" does not contain any numerical information that can be used to solve a math problem. It is simply a statement about the players' aspirations during their early careers.

As an AI language model, I do not have the capability to solve math problems or provide mathematical reasoning without being given a specific math-related question or problem statement. The information provided in the passage and the query does not contain any mathematical elements that I can work with.

Therefore, I cannot provide a step-by-step solution or final answer for a math problem in this case. The passage and query are purely descriptive and do not involve any numerical calculations or mathematical reasoning.

Response:
Unfortunately, there is no mathematical problem or calculation to solve in the given passage. The passage is a sports news article describing an unexpected upset in a football (soccer) match between Chelsea and Bradford City in the FA Cup. 

The passage does not contain any numerical data or information that can be used to solve a math problem. It is simply a descriptive account of the match events, including the goals scored by the players.

Since there is no mathematical problem or calculation to solve, I cannot provide any step-by-step work or reasoning. The passage is purely narrative in nature and does not lend itself to a mathematical treatment.

The only way I could attempt to answer a math-related question would be if you provided an explicit math problem or calculation that is somehow related to the information given in the passage. Without such a specific math-based question, I cannot generate a meaningful mathematical solution. Please let me know if you have a different question that involves numerical data or calculations that I can try to solve.
