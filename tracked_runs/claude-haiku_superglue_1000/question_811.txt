Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- A New Jersey police officer charged with attempted murder and arson for allegedly setting fire to his captain's home has been released on $2 million cash bail, the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office said. Michael Dotro, 35, was released Tuesday after a bail source hearing in Middlesex Superior Court, said Jim O'Neill, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office. The bail was put up by Dotro's family: $110,000 from one of Dotro's brothers, $400,000 from another brother, and the remaining $1.49 million from Dotro's parents, O'Neill said. His bail was originally set at $5 million, but a judge granted a request by his attorney to reduce it to $2 million.
