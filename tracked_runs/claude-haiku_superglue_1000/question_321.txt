Question:
Passage: By Beth Stebner Last updated at 11:06 AM on 16th January 2012 Former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman will drop out of the presidential race today, and will instead endorse fellow candidate Mitt Romney, a senior campaign aide confirmed Sunday night. The official said Mr Huntsman was ‘proud of the race he ran.' Mr Huntsman's rationale to back Mr Romney - a man he’s consistently criticised on the campaign trail and called an ‘establishment’ - comes because he doesn't want to block the best candidate to beat President Obama in the upcoming elections, according to an aide. He was scheduled to participate in an evening debate in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina on Monday evening, but will instead endorse Mr Romney at an 11am press conference.

Response:
To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and determine the appropriate word to replace the placeholder "@placeholder".

Based on the information provided in the passage, the key details are:
1. Jon Huntsman is withdrawing from the presidential race and endorsing Mitt Romney, despite having criticized Romney in the past.
2. Huntsman's rationale for endorsing Romney is that he doesn't want to block the best candidate to beat President Obama.
3. Huntsman was scheduled to participate in a debate, but will instead hold a press conference to endorse Romney.

The passage mentions that Huntsman "tried to offer a different tenor, promising a campaign marked by civility." This suggests that the word to replace the placeholder "@placeholder" is likely "Huntsman".

Therefore, the complete sentence would be:

"Mr Huntsman also tried to offer a different tenor, promising a campaign marked by civility."
