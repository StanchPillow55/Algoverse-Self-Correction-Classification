Question:
Passage: Francesca Grillo was a self-confessed ‘eBay addict’ long before her employers took her to court – and even boasted about her love of flashy labels. In 2005, the younger Grillo sister admitted she had spent £30,000 in just two years on designer products from the auction website and said her shopping addiction was so serious, she ‘needed help’. Francesca, then 25, said: ‘I was blown away by what you could buy – absolutely anything, from furniture to Fendi bags, vintage clothes to holiday homes. Francesca Grillo confessed to being an eBay addict in 2005 ‘Within a few months, I was hooked. I fell in love with designers such as Marc Jacobs, Prada, Gucci and Moschino.’
