Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Joe Paterno led the Penn State Nittany Lions for 46 seasons and -- in the process -- became the winningest coach in college football history. Then came the child molestation scandal involving his former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky and allegations that Paterno played a role in concealing it. The NCAA vacated 111 of his wins over a 14-year period, fined the school $60 million, reduced scholarships and banned it from bowl games for four years. Paterno died last year, his iconic reputation in tatters. But his relatives filed a lawsuit Thursday to see that his legacy doesn't end that way.
