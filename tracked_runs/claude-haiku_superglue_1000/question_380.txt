Question:
Passage: The former leader of Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru  has sparked fury after comparing Britain's nuclear deterrent to the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz. Lord Wigley apologised for 'any offence caused' after hitting out at claims the Government could shift the Trident weapons system from Scotland to Wales. The peer dismissed the potential jobs boost for Wales, adding: 'Look, this week we have been remembering what happened in Germany before the war, no doubt there were many jobs provided in Auschwitz and places like that but that didn't justify their existence and neither does nuclear weapons justify having them in Pembrokeshire.'
