Question:
Passage: By Nick Craven & Simon Murphy Official World Cup partner Visa has been condemned for allowing touts to use its payment service to sell England tickets at more than ten times their face value. Fifa has vowed to clamp down on World Cup touts – already illegal in the UK – yet Visa, one of only six ‘global partner’ firms for the 2014 tournament in Brazil, rakes in fees every time such a ticket is bought using one of their cards from shady websites. We found one ticket with a face value of £47 for England’s match against Uruguay being offered for £676.
