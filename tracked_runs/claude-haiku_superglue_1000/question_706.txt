Question:
Passage: Olympia, Washington (CNN) -- Joseph Shaun Goodman's seventh arrest for DUI was as sensational as it gets. Police chased him in his Ferrari at more than 90 mph in downtown Olympia, Washington. A passenger, whom Goodman had just met at a bar, begged to leave the car, and his wish was granted while the car slowed. Goodman crashed his sports car, a 2000 model worth $70,000, into a house and two cars. The tall, tan businessman was finally arrested behind the wheel in a church parking lot with police drawing their guns on him just before midnight December 29. Cops noted his watery, bloodshot eyes and smelled alcohol on his breath.
