Question:
Paragraph: Earth processes have not changed over time. The way things happen now is the same way things happened in the past. Mountains grow and mountains slowly wear away. The same process is at work the same as it was billions of years ago. As the environment changes, living creatures adapt. They change over time. Some organisms may not be able to adapt. They become extinct. Becoming extinct means they die out completely. Some geologists study the history of the Earth. They want to learn about Earths past. They use clues from rocks and fossils. They use these clues to make sense of events. The goal is to place things in the order they happened. They also want to know how long it took for those events to happen.

The goal is to place things in the order they happened. They also want to know how long it took for those events to happen."

From this, we can conclude that:

1. Geologists are people who study the Earth.
2. They are specifically interested in learning about the history and past of the Earth.
3. They use clues from rocks and fossils to understand and make sense of past events and processes that have occurred on Earth.
4. Their goal is to determine the order in which these events happened and how long they took to occur.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the paragraph, geologists can be defined as people who study the Earth, its history, and the processes that have shaped it over time, using evidence from rocks, fossils, and other geological data.

Final Answer:
Geologists are people who study the
