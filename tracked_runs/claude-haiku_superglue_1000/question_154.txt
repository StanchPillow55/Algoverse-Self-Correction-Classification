Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- Bill and Hillary Clinton's seemingly never-ending political careers have had a tremendous impact on at least one person: Monica Lewinsky. The former White House intern, whose sexual relationship with the 42nd President led to his impeachment, will never be able to escape the spotlight -- as long as the Clintons are still in it. As Hillary Clinton mulls another presidential run in 2016, her husband's relationship with Lewinsky has become fodder for her political foes. Possible Republican 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has invoked Lewinsky and Clinton's affair twice in as many months. "If (Democrats) want to take a position on women's rights, by all means do. But you can't do it and take it from a guy who was using his position of authority to take advantage of young women in the workplace," Paul said this past weekend on C-SPAN's "Newsmakers" program.
