Question:
Paragraph: You couldnt survive without your skin. It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air. 

Question: What happens when the heat reaches the surface of your skin?

Answer: It is trapped within the body by the sweat glands

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the mechanism by which the skin helps maintain a constant body temperature.

Given information:
- The skin has the main function of controlling what enters and leaves the body.
- The skin prevents the loss of too much water from the body.
- The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature.
- The skin keeps the body cool in two ways:
  1. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body.
  2. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen, which increases blood flow to the body surface, allowing more heat to reach the surface and then radiate off the body.
- The opposite happens to retain body heat:
  1. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow, which decreases blood flow to the body surface, reducing the amount of heat that reaches the surface.
  2. This reduces the amount of heat that can be lost to the air.

Reasoning:
When heat reaches the surface of the skin, it is not trapped within the body by the sweat glands. Instead, the heat is able to radiate off the body surface.

The key point is that

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the mechanisms by which the skin helps maintain a constant body temperature.

According to the given paragraph, the skin has two main ways of keeping the body cool:

1. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body.
2. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen, which increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface, and the heat is then able to radiate off the body.

The question asks what happens when the heat reaches the surface of the skin. The paragraph states that the opposite happens to retain body heat:

"The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air."

Therefore, the correct answer is that when the heat reaches the surface of the skin, it is trapped within the body by the constriction of the blood vessels in the skin.

The reasoning can be summarized as follows:

1. The skin has two main ways of keeping the body cool: ev
