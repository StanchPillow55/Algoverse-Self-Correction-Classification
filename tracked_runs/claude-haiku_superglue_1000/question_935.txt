Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- RICHARD QUEST SAYS: As I headed down the mountainside after the World Economic Forum, it became clear: The theme, "Reshaping the World," should be attached to the event itself. I have already tweeted my personal conclusion to the forum: A missed opportunity to start a dialogue on real change. It had an overloaded agenda and too many corporate executives with no idea what they were supposed to be doing besides seeing clients and drumming up business. I don't mean there should be fewer participants. WEF constantly reminds me the number is steady, at around 2,500. But there are now so many advisers, spokesmen and assistants who attend, that 2,500 is multiplied many times. Access is more difficult, honesty becomes harder. To quote the musical Mary Poppins, it's "a ghastly mess."
@highlight
CNN's Richard Quest, John Defterios and Nina dos Santos give their views on Davos
@highlight

@highlight
Dos Santos argues Davos revealed significant inequality -- in its many different forms
@highlight
Defterios says the star guest was Iran's Rouhani, as judged by how he stopped the room

Query: And then there is there's the glass ceiling, which reared its ugly head in this year's @placeholder demographics as it emerged only 15% of participants were women today versus 17% in 2011.
