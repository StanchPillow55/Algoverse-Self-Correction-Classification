Question:
Paragraph: Earth processes have not changed over time. The way things happen now is the same way things happened in the past. Mountains grow and mountains slowly wear away. The same process is at work the same as it was billions of years ago. As the environment changes, living creatures adapt. They change over time. Some organisms may not be able to adapt. They become extinct. Becoming extinct means they die out completely. Some geologists study the history of the Earth. They want to learn about Earths past. They use clues from rocks and fossils. They use these clues to make sense of events. The goal is to place things in the order they happened. They also want to know how long it took for those events to happen.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the key information provided in the paragraph and then apply it to the question.

Key information from the paragraph:
1. Earth processes have not changed over time. The way things happen now is the same way things happened in the past.
2. As the environment changes, living creatures adapt. They change over time.
3. Some organisms may not be able to adapt. They become extinct.
4. Becoming extinct means they die out completely.
5. Geologists study the history of the Earth using clues from rocks and fossils.

Now, let's apply this information to the question:

Question: What happens when some organisms are not able to adapt and what does it mean for them?

Reasoning:
1. The paragraph states that some organisms may not be able to adapt as the environment changes.
2. When organisms are not able to adapt, they become extinct, which means they die out completely.
3. The paragraph also mentions that geologists study the history of the Earth using clues from rocks and fossils.
4. This suggests that when organisms become extinct, their remains (such as bones, shells, or other hard parts) can become fossil

Response:
To solve this problem, I will break down the key information from the paragraph and use it to explain what happens when some organisms are not able to adapt and what it means for them.

Key information from the paragraph:
1. Earth processes have not changed over time. The way things happen now is the same way things happened in the past.
2. As the environment changes, living creatures adapt. They change over time.
3. Some organisms may not be able to adapt. They become extinct.
4. Becoming extinct means they die out completely.
5. Geologists study the history of the Earth using clues from rocks and fossils.

Explanation:
When some organisms are not able to adapt to changes in their environment, they become extinct. Extinction means that the organism dies out completely and no longer exists.

The paragraph states that "Becoming extinct means they die out completely." This indicates that the organisms that are unable to adapt are no longer alive and present in the current environment.

However, the paragraph also mentions that geologists use clues from rocks and fossils to study the history of the Earth. This suggests that the remains of the extinct organisms, such as their fossilized remains, are preserved in

2. As the environment changes, living creatures adapt. They change over time.
3. Some organisms may not be able to adapt.
4. Becoming extinct means they die out completely.
5. Geologists study the history of the Earth using clues from rocks and fossils.

Reasoning:
1. The paragraph states that Earth processes have not changed over time, meaning the fundamental natural processes that shape the Earth's environment have remained the same.
2. As the environment changes, living creatures must adapt to these changes in order to survive. Organisms that are able to adapt will evolve and change over time to better suit the new environmental conditions.
3. However, the paragraph mentions that some organisms may not be able to adapt to the changing environment.
4. When an organism is unable to adapt, it becomes extinct, which means it dies out completely and no longer exists.
5. Geologists study the history of the Earth by examining
