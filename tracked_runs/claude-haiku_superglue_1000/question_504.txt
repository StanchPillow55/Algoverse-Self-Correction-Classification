Question:
Passage: By Tom Sheen PUBLISHED: 12:46 EST, 12 March 2014 | UPDATED: 16:05 EST, 12 March 2014 Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho spent £32million in eight days to bring the pair of them to Stamford Bridge to strengthen his title bid - and so far the plan is working. Since £21m was spent bringing Serbia midfielder Nemanja Matic back to his former club, Chelsea are unbeaten in their eight Premier League games, winning six, and have opened up a seven point gap at the top of the table. Crucially, in a tricky run of games for the Blues, Matic has been a key part in important wins over Manchester United, Manchester City, Everton and Tottenham.
