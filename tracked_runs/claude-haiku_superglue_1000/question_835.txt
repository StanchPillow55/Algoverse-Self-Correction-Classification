Question:
Passage: Former Football Association chairman Lord Triesman has backed calls for a World Cup boycott to force FIFA to introduce more reforms and admitted that some of England's tactics in pursuing votes for its 2018 bid were 'unwise'. Triesman, England 2018's first bid chairman until he was forced to resign after being taped making derogatory remarks about rival bids, also said he was now prepared to meet World Cup ethics investigator Michael Garcia about the 2018 and 2022 bids. His successor at the FA, David Bernstein, who stepped down from the post in 2013, has called for UEFA to lead a boycott of the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
