To determine if the word "charge" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "This cartridge has a powder charge of 50 grains."
In this sentence, the word "charge" refers to the amount of gunpowder or propellant contained within the cartridge. This is a specific measurement of the quantity of explosive material used in the cartridge.

Sentence 2: "The battery needed a fresh charge."
