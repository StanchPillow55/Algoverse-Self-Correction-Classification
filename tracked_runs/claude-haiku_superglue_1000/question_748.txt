Question:
Passage: In the course of their murderous rampage yesterday in Paris, two of the Islamist shooters announced that they were acting in the name of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula or AQAP, the affiliate of Al Qaeda that operates in Yemen. Formed in 2009, AQAP merged existing Yemeni and Saudi jihadists after the Saudi Kingdom became too unsafe for them and they fled southwards. This suggests that AQAP feels eclipsed by ISIS, which has attracted so much coverage since last summer, and is determined to put itself back in the international spotlight with this act of mass murder, in broad daylight, in a major European capital.
