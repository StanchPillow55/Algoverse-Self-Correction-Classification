Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Rubbished, reviled, rejected. Rafa. As he posed on the Amsterdam Arena pitch with the glistening Europa League trophy in his hand, Rafael Benitez might have wondered what all the fuss had been about. Branislav Ivanovic's dramatic late winner secured a 2-1 win victory over Benfica and left Chelsea's interim manager with every right to feel proud. When he replaced Champions League-winning coach Roberto Di Matteo last November, he was welcomed into a cauldron of hate by Chelsea supporters. Despised by those in blue following his time with Liverpool, the new interim manager was mercilessly mocked, abused and verbally attacked in the stands and on radio phone-in shows.
