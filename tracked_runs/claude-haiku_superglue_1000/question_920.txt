Question:
Passage: Singapore (CNN) -- A Singapore court on Friday rejected an appeal by a British author against a conviction for contempt of court over a book that criticized the  justice system. Author Alan Shadrake was put on trial by the government of Singapore for his book on the death penalty in Singapore. Police arrested him in July, a day after he released his book "Once A Jolly Hangman" in Singapore. Statements in his book criticized Singapore's judicial system, leading to the contempt of court charge, according to the attorney general. His book asserts that Singapore's death penalty is applied unfairly to the poor and spares those with money and political connections.
