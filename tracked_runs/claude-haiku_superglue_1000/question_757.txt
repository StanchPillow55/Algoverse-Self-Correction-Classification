Question:
Paragraph: What a time of it Dawson's Landing was having!  All its life it had been asleep, but now it hardly got a chance for a nod, so swiftly did big events and crashing surprises come along in one another's wake: Friday morning, first glimpse of Real Nobility, also grand reception at Aunt Patsy Cooper's, also great robber raid; Friday evening, dramatic kicking of the heir of the chief citizen in presence of four hundred people; Saturday morning, emergence as practicing lawyer of the long-submerged Pudd'nhead Wilson; Saturday night, duel between chief citizen and titled stranger.  The people took more pride in the duel than in all the other events put together, perhaps.  It was a glory to their town to have such a thing happen there.  In their eyes the principals had reached the summit of human honor.  Everybody paid homage to their names; their praises were in all mouths.  Even the duelists' subordinates came in for a handsome share of the public approbation: wherefore Pudd'nhead Wilson was suddenly become a man of consequence.  When asked to run for the mayoralty Saturday night, he was risking defeat, but Sunday morning found him a made man and his success assured. 

Question: What was Pudd'nhead Wilson asked to do on Saturday?
