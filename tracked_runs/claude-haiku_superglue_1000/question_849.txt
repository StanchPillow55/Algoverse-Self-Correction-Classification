Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Arsenal have signed Moroccan international striker Marouane Chamakh from Bordeaux on a free transfer. Chamakh, 26, joins the London club on a "long-term contract," the English Premier League team said in a statement on its Web site. His contract with the French club had run out, allowing him to move without a transfer fee. Chamakh scored 14 goals as Bordeaux ended Lyon's seven-year reign as French champions in 2009 and helped the southwest France club reach the quarterfinals of Europe's Champions League this season. "Chamakh is a striker of real quality and has all the attributes suited to come to England and do very well," said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.
