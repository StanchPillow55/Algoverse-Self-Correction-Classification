Question:
Passage: A soldier who survived the Battle of Rorke’s Drift against 4,000 Zulus only to be forgotten on its Roll of Honour has finally been hailed a war hero – thanks to a 130-year-old sketch. Private David Jenkins was among the 150 soldiers who fought in the heroic defence of the small South African missionary outpost in 1879, which was immortalised by the film Zulu starring Michael Caine. Such was the bravery shown by the heavily outnumbered troops that after the battle 11 Victoria Crosses were awarded. Hero: Geoff Rees, great grandson of Private David Jenkins, recognised him in this sketch by Lady Elizabeth Butler. He had fought valiantly in the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift in 1879

Query: His great-grandson @placeholder  recognised the face instantly and was able to prove to historians that his relative was a long-forgotten war hero.
