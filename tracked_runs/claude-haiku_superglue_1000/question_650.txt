Question:
Passage: Where the likes of Sir Alex Ferguson, Terry Venables and Alan Pardew have failed, Sam Allardyce has succeeded.

But here he is back at West Ham United, wrapped up to the nines in his training gear after leading a coaching session at chilly Chadwell Heath. The former England striker is back in football. Not that he looks like he has ever been away. Teddy Sheringham reveals why he decided to take time away from football following his retirement TEDDY on... BIG SAM I couldn’t have asked to work with a better boss for my first real impression of what managerial life is like. He’s been very open with me and I’ve got the utmost respect for that. He’s very experienced.
