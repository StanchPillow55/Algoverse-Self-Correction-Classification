Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- In early 2000, shortly after Al Gore beat Bill Bradley by a too-close-for-comfort four points in the state's first-in-the-nation primaries, Ray Buckley, then a New Hampshire state legislator, swung through Washington to have breakfast with a friend in the Clinton administration. As he sat in the White House mess eating pancakes, Buckley was shocked when an aide brought him a note that said President Bill Clinton wanted to see him in the Oval Office. He didn't know Clinton was even aware he was visiting. "He started grilling me on what towns Gore did well in and didn't do well in. He didn't have a paper in front of him, he just knew. He was asking me 'Why didn't Al do better in Amherst?' His understanding of the political landscape of New Hampshire is just amazing," Buckley, now the chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, told CNN.
