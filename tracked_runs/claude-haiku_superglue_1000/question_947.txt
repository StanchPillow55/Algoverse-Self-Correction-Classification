Question:
Passage: By Simon Walters and Glen Owen PUBLISHED: 18:45 EST, 2 March 2013 | UPDATED: 20:50 EST, 2 March 2013 David Cameron invoked the vision of Margaret Thatcher’s favourite political guru yesterday in an attempt to fight back from the shattering Tory defeat in the Eastleigh by-election. He refused to ‘tack right’, but said he would pursue ‘common ground’ policies on welfare, immigration, the NHS and crime to woo ordinary voters. The Prime Minister’s ‘common ground’ theme is a tribute to one of Mr Cameron’s Tory heroes, Sir Keith Joseph. Inspiration: David Cameron with Baroness Thatcher in 2007 Sir Keith was the intellectual driving force behind Thatcherism, but was nicknamed ‘the mad monk’ by Left-wing critics for his ascetic manner and some of his more controversial views.

Query: He also launched a new personal attack on ‘dishonest’ @placeholder, stating: ‘The aspirational classes who supported Thatcher won’t touch Cameron with a bargepole because we are the only party who want to take those on a minimum wage out of paying tax altogether and who know bright children from poorer backgrounds will benefit hugely from more grammar schools.
