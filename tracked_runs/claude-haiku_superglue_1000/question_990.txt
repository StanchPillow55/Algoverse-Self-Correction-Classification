Question:
Passage: Jack Wilshere rarely shirks a tackle. Just ask Paul Scholes or Daniel Agger or Wilshereâ€™s doctor. He knows only one way, it is in his nature and that is not about to change, even if his stomach lurched and he feared for his World Cup dream when he picked up his phone in March and saw messages backing up from the medical experts. The injury had not seemed too serious at the time. There was no great pain, he played on for 40 minutes and there was nothing alarming on the post-match scans, but there was a threat of deja vu in the air.
