Question:
Passage: It is regarded as the most probable place in the solar system to host alien life. And now Jupiter’s moon Europa has been found to have tectonic activity like Earth. It is also the first time this specific type of geological activity has been observed in the solar system other than on our planet. Scientists have found evidence of plate tectonics on Jupiter's moon Europa (pictured)  – the first sign of this geologic activity on a solar system world other than Earth, raising hopes that life could one day be found there Less than a year ago, scientists discovered plumes of water vapour erupting from Jupiter's moon’s south polar region, so it may be possible for a robotic probe to sample Europa’s liquid water at a distance without landing on it.
@highlight
Scientists have found the first sign of this geologic activity on a solar system world other than Earth a year after discovering jets of water on Europa
@highlight
Experts from the University of Idaho and the Johns Hopkins University, Maryland, say Europa could be more Earth-like than experts imagined
@highlight
Latest find appears to solve a puzzle that has perplexed planetary scientists
@highlight
It shows where old crust was destroyed and how the icy crust is expanding
@highlight
Europa’s surface is considered to be relatively young at between 40 and 90 millions of years old, which can perhaps now be explained by plate tectonics

Query: Although @placeholder and Jupiter's other moons have been visited by other spacecraft, they were each limited to a single distant flyby of these satellites.
