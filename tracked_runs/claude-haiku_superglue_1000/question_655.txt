Question:
Passage: A PR executive working for the makers of Xbox game Call Of Duty siphoned off £18,963 to pay for her engagement party, hen party and designer shopping sprees. Kathryn Kirton, 35, was head of PR at Activision when she got carried away with the 'glamorous and luxurious' world of public relations, Blackfriars Crown Court heard. She was in charge of the budget for a major film premiere-style launch of the game, but instead siphoned off thousands of pounds. She spent £9,437 at designer clothes store Reiss on one of three shopping trips along with another £2,000 on a luxury hotel break for her then fiance Lee Kirton.
