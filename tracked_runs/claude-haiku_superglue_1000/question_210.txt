Question:
Context: Plus-minus -- Plus−minus (+/−, ±, plus/minus) is a sports statistic used to measure a player's impact on the game, represented by the difference between their team's total scoring versus their opponent's when the player is in the game. In ice hockey, it measures a player's goal differential. When an even-strength goal or shorthanded goal is scored, the plus--minus statistic is increased by one (``plus'') for those players on the ice for the team scoring the goal; the plus--minus statistic is decreased by one (``minus'') for those players on the ice for the team allowing the goal. Power play or penalty shot goals are excluded. An empty net does not matter for the calculation of plus--minus.

Question: do empty net goals count for plus minus


Reference Answer:
No

Response:
To determine whether empty net goals count for the plus-minus statistic, we need to carefully consider the context and the definition of the plus-minus statistic.

Given information:
- The plus-minus statistic measures a player's impact on the game, represented by the difference between their team's total scoring versus their opponent's when the player is in the game.
- In ice hockey, the plus-minus statistic is increased by one (``plus'') for those players on the ice for the team scoring the goal, and decreased by one (``minus'') for those players on the ice for the team allowing the goal.
- Power play or penalty shot goals are excluded from the plus-minus calculation.

The question specifically asks whether empty net goals count for the plus-minus statistic.

Reasoning:
1. An empty net goal is a goal scored when the defending team has removed their goaltender from the ice, typically in an attempt to gain an extra attacker and score a goal.
2. The plus-minus statistic is meant to measure a player's impact on the game while they are on the ice. When the defending team's goaltender is pulled, the players on the ice are not

- Power play or penalty shot goals are excluded from the plus-minus calculation.
- The question states that an empty net does not matter for the calculation of plus-minus.

Reasoning:
Based on the given information, the key point is that the question states that an empty net does not matter for the calculation of plus-minus. This means that empty net goals, whether scored by the team or allowed by the team, are not included in the plus-minus calculation.

The rationale behind this is that an empty net goal is not a true reflection of a player's impact

Response:
To determine whether empty net goals count for the plus-minus statistic, we need to carefully consider the context and the definition of the plus-minus statistic.

The given context states that "An empty net does not matter for the calculation of plus--minus." This means that empty net goals are excluded from the plus-minus calculation.

The reasoning behind this is as follows:

1. The plus-minus statistic is intended to measure a player's impact on the game, specifically their goal differential when they are on the ice.
2. An empty net goal is scored when the defending team has pulled their goaltender in an attempt to score an extra attacker goal. This is a strategic decision by the team, not a direct result of the players on the ice.
3. Including empty net goals in the plus-minus calculation would not accurately reflect the player's impact on the game, as the goal was scored with an extra attacker, not due to the player's individual performance.

Therefore, based on the given context and the definition of the plus-minus statistic, the answer is:

No, empty net goals do not count for the plus-minus statistic.

The plus-minus statistic is calculated by considering
