Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- This morning in New York City, Rupert Murdoch held a press event announcing the launch of The Daily, the world's first iPad-only "newspaper." While I listened to the streaming audio, I was scanning the news -- and I spotted a headline that should probably make News Corp. nervous about its new venture: Apple blocks Sony e-book app. Is Kindle next? First, a bit about The Daily, per today's announcement: According to News Corp, iPad owners can subscribe to The Daily with one click, at a weekly rate of 99 cents. An annual subscription costs $39.99. The publication also will display paid advertising.
@highlight
News Corporation launched a iPad newspaper called The Daily
@highlight
The Daily will cost 99 cents a week, $39.99 a year
@highlight
Apple rejects Sony's e-reader application for not using Apple's in application purchase method

Query: Eventually @placeholder will be developing editions for all tablet platforms, but for right now, it's effectively an iPad exclusive -- which means News Corp. is relying heavily on the terms of the deal it's worked out with Apple to make the economics of this venture pay off.
