Question:
Paragraph: The center of an atom is held together by powerful forces. This gives them a huge amount of stored energy. This type of energy is called nuclear energy. This energy can be released and used to do work. This happens in nuclear power plants where they split apart the nucleus of an atom. This splitting apart is called nuclear fission. Another type of nuclear energy happens in the Sun. Here the atoms nuclei are not split apart. Instead, the nuclei of the atoms are fused, or joined together. This process is called nuclear fusion. Some of the suns energy travels to Earth. This energy from nuclear fusion warms the planet and provides the energy for photosynthesis.

Response:
To answer the question "What happens to atoms during nuclear fusion?", I will go through the problem step-by-step:

Step 1: Understand the concept of nuclear fusion.
The passage states that in nuclear fusion, the nuclei of atoms are "fused, or joined together". This means that during nuclear fusion, the nuclei of atoms are combined to form a new, heavier nucleus.

Step 2: Identify the key information about nuclear fusion.
The passage mentions that nuclear fusion occurs in the Sun, where the nuclei of atoms are "not split apart" but instead "are fused, or joined together". It also states that this process of nuclear fusion "warms the planet and provides the energy for photosynthesis".

Step 3: Analyze the question and determine the correct answer.
The question asks "What happens to atoms during nuclear fusion?". Based on the information provided in the passage, the correct answer is that the nuclei of the atoms are fused, or joined together, during the process of nuclear fusion.

The passage does not mention anything about neutrons breaking apart during nuclear fusion. Instead, it focuses on the nuclei of atoms being combined to form a new, he
