Question:
Passage: Education Minister Christopher Pyne has denied he's trying to save ABC jobs in his home state of South Australia, from his own government and at the expense of the broadcaster's other departments.

His office has denied it's a case of double standards, My Pyne attempting to turn the blame onto the ABC board, accusing them of 'political vandalism' if they choose to reduce production costs.
