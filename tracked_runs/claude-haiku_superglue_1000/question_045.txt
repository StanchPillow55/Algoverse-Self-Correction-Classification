Question:
Passage: By Mark Prigg The D-Day landings have been recreated as a virtual world to allow a new generation to experience the Invasion of Normady using 3D displays and virtual reality headsets. French researchers painstakingly scanned and recreated the landing craft, gliders and even the artificial harbour, known as the Mulberry harbour, for the virtual invasion recreation. The team today revealed their work as part of the seventieth anniversary of D-Day and the Invasion of Normandy. Scroll down for video The Mulberry Harbor was one of the most extraordinary technological feats of WWII. Developed in part by Major Allan Beckett of the Royal Engineers, it was an artificial harbor built in England, transported across the English Channel and assembled off the coast at Arromanches to unload the vast quantities of supplies and men that were needed for battle.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of the placeholder in the given statement.

Given information:
- The 3D model is an accurate, scientific reconstruction of the Harbor.
- The Harbor was destroyed after a certain event.

The statement suggests that the 3D model will allow many to see and experience a site that was destroyed after a specific event. Based on the context provided in the passage, the event that led to the destruction of the Mulberry Harbor was the Invasion of Normandy during World War II.

Therefore, the placeholder in the statement should be filled with the phrase "the Invasion of Normandy".

The complete statement with the placeholder filled in is:
"The 3D model is an accurate, scientific reconstruction of the Harbor that will allow many to see and experience a site that was destroyed after the Invasion of Normandy."

This statement accurately reflects the information provided in the passage, where the French researchers recreated the Mulberry Harbor as part of the virtual recreation of the Invasion of Normandy, which ultimately led to the destruction of the actual Mulberry Harbor.

Final answer:
The placeholder should be filled with the phrase "the Invasion of

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of the placeholder in the given statement.

Given information:
- The 3D model is an accurate, scientific reconstruction of the Mulberry Harbor.
- The Mulberry Harbor was destroyed after a certain event.

The placeholder in the statement refers to the event when the Mulberry Harbor was destroyed.

To find the value of the placeholder, we need to look for information in the passage about the destruction of the Mulberry Harbor.

The passage states:
"The Mulberry Harbor was one of the most extraordinary technological feats of WWII. Developed in part by Major Allan Beckett of the Royal Engineers, it was an artificial harbor built in England, transported across the English Channel and assembled off the coast at Arromanches to unload the vast quantities of supplies and men that were needed for battle."

The passage does not explicitly mention when the Mulberry Harbor was destroyed. However, we can infer that it was destroyed after the Invasion of Normandy, also known as D-Day, which was the event that the 3D model is recreating.

Therefore, the value of the placeholder is:
D-Day

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of the placeholder in the given statement.

Given information:
- The 3D model is an accurate, scientific reconstruction of the Mulberry Harbor.
- The Mulberry Harbor was destroyed after a certain event.

The placeholder in the statement is the event that led to the destruction of the Mulberry Harbor.

To find the correct answer, we need to review the information provided in the passage.

The passage mentions that the Mulberry Harbor was "one of the most extraordinary technological feats of WWII" and that it was "developed in part by Major Allan Beckett of the Royal Engineers." The passage also states that the Mulberry Harbor was "built in England, transported across the English Channel and assembled off the coast at Arromanches to unload the vast quantities of supplies and men that were needed for battle."

Based on this information, the event that led to the destruction of the Mulberry Harbor was likely the end of World War II, as the harbor was no longer needed after the war ended.

Therefore, the correct answer to the placeholder is:

the end of World War II.
