Question:
Passage: By Alex Horlock PUBLISHED: 07:04 EST, 2 August 2012 | UPDATED: 08:55 EST, 2 August 2012 Andy Murray, one of Team GB's strong podium hopefuls, has moved within one match of securing at least a silver medal at the Olympic Games after dismantling Spaniard Nicolas Almagro in today's quarter-final. The Scot - who lost only a month ago in the Wimbledon final to Roger Federer - is desperate to earn a gold medal at the Games after his plucky defeat at SW19, and must progress through the semi-final and the final to fulfill his dream. Serbia's Novak Djokovic or France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga await the Scot now, and he could meet world No 1 Federer in the final.
