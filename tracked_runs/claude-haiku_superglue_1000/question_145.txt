Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- This week marks the centenary of the assassination in Sarajevo of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. This was a key trigger for the devastating First World War, setting off a chain reaction that saw key European powers, including Germany, Russia and Britain, entering conflict soon after. One hundred years on, the world has numerous echoes of the early 20th century with a major shift in global power once again taking place. Whereas Germany, Russia and the United States were key "rising nations" in 1914, power is today shifting from the global North to the South with Asian countries, especially China, primary beneficiaries so far.
