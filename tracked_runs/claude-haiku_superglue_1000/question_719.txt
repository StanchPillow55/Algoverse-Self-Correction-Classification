Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- We're fresh out of English-language ballots. How about Japanese instead? That's basically what happened to voters at one precinct in Hawaii after a series of unfortunate events. First, the polling place at Hokulani Elementary School on the island of Oahu ran out of ballots. A two-hour line formed as polling workers tried to shuffle hundreds of people through a single electronic voting machine. Next, according to Mike Kratzke, who was working the election, officials delivered more ballots -- but they were the wrong ones, featuring the wrong local races. "Everyone stop! The ballots are wrong!" Kratzke recalls yelling over an angry mob.
