Question:
Context: Blocking the plate -- In college, the ``flagrant collision'' rule discourages, but does not prohibit, collisions at home plate and on the bases. Instead, only ``unnecessary and violent'' collisions are outlawed. While defensive players are allowed to block the plate/base with clear possession of the ball, offensive players must take steps to ensure contact with the fielder is legal--for instance, it must be below the waist. Violations of this rule carry similar penalties to the high school malicious contact rule.
