Question:
Passage: Boko Haram has seized the northeastern Nigerian town from which it abducted 276 schoolgirls  more than six months ago and declared the town part of their 'caliphate'. Heavily-armed extremists loyal to the Islamist terror group swept into Chibok yesterday afternoon, obliterating communication masts with rocket-propelled grenades and forcing terrified residents to flee their homes. The attack comes after the April 14 kidnapping in the impoverished town, in southern Borno state, brought unprecedented global attention to the armed Islamist group's brutal five-year uprising. Heads of state and top celebrities joined a viral social media campaign calling for the rescue of the seized, mostly Christian, schoolgirls, 219 of whom are still being held.
