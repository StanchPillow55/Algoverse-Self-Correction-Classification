Response:
To determine the cause of the slow service at the restaurant, we need to analyze the given choices and use logical reasoning to arrive at the most likely explanation.

Let's consider the two choices:

Choice 1: There were many empty tables.
If there were many empty tables, it would suggest that the restaurant was not crowded. In this case, the slow service would not be due to the restaurant being crowded. Therefore, this choice is not the likely cause of the slow service.

Choice 2: The restaurant was crowded.
If the restaurant was crowded, it would mean that there were a large number of customers, which could lead to slow service. When a restaurant is busy and has a high volume of customers, it can strain the resources of the staff, leading to longer wait times and slower service.

Therefore, based on the given information and the logical analysis of the choices, the most likely cause of the slow service at the restaurant is that the restaurant was crowded (Choice 2).

Final answer: The cause of the slow service at the restaurant is that the restaurant was crowded.
