Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of fungal meningitis cases reported by the CDC on Saturday.

Given information:
- The CDC reported 198 infections on Saturday, which is 13 more than the previous day.

Total cases reported on Saturday = Previous day's cases + Increase in cases
Total cases reported on Saturday = 185 + 13 = 198 cases

Therefore, the CDC reported a total of 198 fungal meningitis cases on Saturday.
