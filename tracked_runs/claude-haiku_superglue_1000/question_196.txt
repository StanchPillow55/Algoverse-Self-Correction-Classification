Question:
Passage: John Terry has hailed the goal knack of defender Branislav Ivanovic and claims it is down to 'desire' and 'strength' not good fortune. Ivanovic scored Chelsea's goal in a 1-1 draw in the Champions League away to PSG to enhance his reputation for scoring crucial goals at key moments in big matches. 'He has scored some important goals for us,' said captain Terry. 'Look at the Liverpool one a couple of weeks ago. He pops up in the final of the Europa League. He really is a top player for the team. It's a desire and hunger he's got and the aggression and strength he's got to want to firstly get in those positions and secondly out-strength the opponent and be a lot hungrier.'
