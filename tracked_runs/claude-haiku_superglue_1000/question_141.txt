Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the percentage of the £1.2 million that has been spent by the 12 'Portas Pilot' towns.

Given information:
- The 12 'Portas Pilot' towns were awarded a total of £1.2 million.
- The towns have spent just 12 percent of their funding.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money spent by the 12 'Portas Pilot' towns.
Total amount awarded = £1.2 million
Percentage spent = 12%
Amount spent = £1.2 million × 0.12 = £144,000

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of the £1.2 million that has been spent.
Percentage spent = (Amount spent / Total amount awarded) × 100
Percentage spent = (£144,000 / £1,200,000) × 100 = 12%

Therefore, the 12 'Portas Pilot' towns have spent just 12 percent of the £1.2 million awarded to them.
