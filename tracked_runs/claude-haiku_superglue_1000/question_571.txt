Question:
Passage: By David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius offered a public apology before a congressional committee on Wednesday, and insisted that its performance had 'improved.' But moments before her hotly anticipated appearance before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the Obamacare website crashed and was apparently unavailable in at least 20 states. Even those congressmen who came to question her were unable to load the site in their browsers before the hearing. 'I am as frustrated as anyone,' she told Americans. 'You deserve better. I apologize. I'm accountable to you for fixing these problems and I'm committed to earning your confidence back by fixing the site.'
