Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- The Libyan military has been pounded by coalition airstrikes neutralizing its air capabilities but it is still able to fight and maneuver on the ground, U.S. officials said. The Libyan Air Force has been grounded after five days of operations by the coalition forces. More than 160 Tomahawk missiles and several hundred strikes from fighter jets have virtually destroyed Moammar Gadhafi's air defense. The toll on the air system is "to the point where we can operate with near impunity across Libya," said Vice Marshall Greg Bagwell of Britain's Royal Air Force. Despite the targeting of mobile launchers, Libyan forces still have numerous mobile launchers that could pose a risk to coalition planes.

To solve this problem, we need to find out who the "placeholder" is referring to in the given passage.

Based on the context, the "placeholder" is likely referring to Moammar Gadhafi's forces or the Libyan military, as the passage discusses the Libyan military and its capabilities.

Given information:
- Before the war, Gadhafi's forces had about 500 mortars and 2,400 pieces of artillery.

To find the total number of weapons Gadhafi's forces had before the war, we need to add the number of mortars and the number of artillery pieces.

Step 1: Add the number of mortars and artillery pieces.
Number of mortars + Number of artillery pieces = Total number of weapons
500 + 2,400 = 2,900

Therefore, before the war, Gadhafi's forces had a total of 2,900 weapons, consisting of 500 mortars and 2,400 pieces of artillery.

Final answer: Before the war, Gadhafi's forces had a total of 2,900 weapons, consisting of 500 mortars and 2,
