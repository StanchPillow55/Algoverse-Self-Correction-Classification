Response:
This is not a math problem, but rather a question about the aftermath of a media scandal involving the TV show "Duck Dynasty" and one of its stars, Phil Robertson. The passage provides some background information on the situation, but does not contain any mathematical elements that would require step-by-step calculations or a final numerical answer.

The question asks about the immediate aftermath of the scandal, and what the network A&E sought to do in response. Based on the information given in the passage, it seems that A&E initially suspended Phil Robertson indefinitely for making homophobic and racially charged remarks in an interview. In the aftermath, a petition was started by the Christian conservative group Faith Driven Consumer, demanding that A&E reinstate Robertson and apologize to the Robertson family.

The passage states that the petition quickly surpassed its target of 250,000 signatures, indicating that there was significant public support for Robertson and opposition to A&E's decision to suspend him. However, the passage does not provide any information about what specific actions A&E took in the immediate aftermath to "distance" itself from the scandal or the Robertson family.

Without any mathematical elements or a clear statement about A&E's specific actions, I cannot
