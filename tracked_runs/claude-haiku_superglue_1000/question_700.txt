Question:
Passage: The UK Independence Party, led by the pub-clubbable Nigel Farage, has won a resounding second successive Parliamentary by-election and sent British politics tumbling into an abyss of the unknown. Mark Reckless, the former Conservative politician who left the party for UKIP in September, won back his seat in Parliament Thursday in the Rochester and Strood by-election that was triggered by his defection. UKIP is now more than just a fringe group thumbing its nose at the big parties: it is a wild card which can threaten all their prospects. Few political experts would claim at this moment to be able to predict the outcome of the next General Election, which will take place on May 7, 2015. And nobody knows how many of the protest votes UKIP has been gathering will stay with them when voters are deciding who will govern the country.

Oakley: Reckless' win an embarrassing blow for David Cameron, who threw kitchen sink at winning vote

Oakley: UKIP has successfully tied itself to the bandwagon of popular discontent with "establishment" parties

Query: What seems almost inevitable is that there will be another "hung" @placeholder after the General Election -- meaning no party will win an outright majority of seats.
