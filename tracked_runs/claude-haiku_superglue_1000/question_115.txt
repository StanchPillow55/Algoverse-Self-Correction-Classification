Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- "The last couple of weeks I've been at home have been murder with the traffic," bemoans Monte Carlo resident Jenson Button. Like most Formula One protagonists, the McLaren man loves the thrill of racing in the Monaco Grand Prix -- it's just that he is less keen on Monte Carlo's traffic jams in the build-up to the race. "It's been a nightmare," the English driver, who recently moved back to the principality from the British island of Guernsey, told CNN. "Putting up the grandstands takes a long time so the city does change quite a bit. "In the winter it's pretty quiet. You see a lot of people that you know and I train with the same people. Monte Carlo is like a quiet, peaceful village really. There's also a new Irish pub that I like -- there's a good pint of Guinness there!"
