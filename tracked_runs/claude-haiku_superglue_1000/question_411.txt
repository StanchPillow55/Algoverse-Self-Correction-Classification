Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- "But if we know enough to be hung, we know enough to vote. If the Negro knows enough to pay taxes to support the government, he knows enough to vote; taxation and representation should go together. If he knows enough to shoulder a musket and fight for the flag, fight for the government, he knows enough to vote ... " -- Frederick Douglass ("What the Black Man Wants," 1865) Yet another milestone of great American historical importance has come to pass with embarrassingly little tribute. And much like the election of President Barack Obama, many of us also thought we would never live to see this racial ceiling broken.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and extract the relevant data to answer the query.

Given information:
- The passage discusses the high voter turnout rate among African-Americans in the 2012 presidential election.
- The query asks how well the African-American voter was listening to Candidate Obama's message that "it wasn't about him" on the campaign trail going back to 2008.

To answer this query, we need to examine the relationship between the high African-American voter turnout in 2012 and Candidate Obama's message that "it wasn't about him" during the 2008 and 2012 campaigns.

Step 1: Understand the context of Candidate Obama's message.
Candidate Obama's message that "it wasn't about him" was likely a way to emphasize that his campaign was about the broader issues and the needs of the American people, rather than being solely focused on his own personal ambition or agenda.

Step 2: Analyze the high African-American voter turnout in 2012.
The passage states that the African-American turnout rate exceeded the white turnout rate in the 2012 presidential election.
