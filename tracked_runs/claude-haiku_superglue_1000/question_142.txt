Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the blood alcohol level of the suspected drunken driver, John Powers, at the time of the accident.

Given information:
- John Powers, 54, is accused of manslaughter for slamming into Juan Gonzalez Jr's motorcycle while driving drunk.
- The report states that Powers' blood alcohol level at the time of the accident was nearly twice the legal limit.

Step 1: Determine the legal blood alcohol limit.
The legal blood alcohol limit in most states is 0.08% or 0.08 g/dL.

Step 2: Calculate the blood alcohol level of John Powers.
Since the report states that Powers' blood alcohol level was nearly twice the legal limit, we can calculate the approximate blood alcohol level as follows:
Blood alcohol level = 2 × 0.08 = 0.16 g/dL

Therefore, the blood alcohol level of John Powers at the time of the accident was approximately 0.16 g/dL, which is nearly twice the legal limit.

Final answer: John Powers' blood alcohol level at the time of the accident was approximately 0.16 g

- The report states that Powers' blood alcohol level at the time of the accident was nearly twice the legal limit.

Step 1: Determine the legal blood alcohol limit.
The legal blood alcohol limit in most states is 0.08 g/dL (grams per deciliter).

Step 2: Calculate the suspected drunken driver's blood alcohol level.
Since the report states that Powers' blood alcohol level was "nearly twice the legal limit," we can calculate the approximate value as follows:
Legal limit = 0.08 g/dL
Suspected drunken driver's blood alcohol level = 2 × 0.08 g/dL = 0.16 g/dL

Therefore, the suspected drunken driver, John Powers, had a blood alcohol level of approximately 0.16 g/dL at the time of

Legal limit = 0.08 g/dL
Estimated blood alcohol level of John Powers = 2 × 0.08 g/dL = 0.16 g/dL

Therefore, the final answer is:
John Powers' blood alcohol level at the time of the accident was approximately 0.16 g/dL, which is nearly
