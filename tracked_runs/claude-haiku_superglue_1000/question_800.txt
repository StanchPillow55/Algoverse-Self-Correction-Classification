Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Sanford, Florida, city officials have chosen a former Colorado police chief as an interim replacement for the top cop who stepped aside during the furor over February's killing of an unarmed teen. Richard Myers, the former police chief in Colorado Springs, will take office in Sanford at the end of the week, the city government announced Tuesday. A news conference to introduce Myers is slated for Friday. He will take over a department that has been under the microscope since the February 26 killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a neighborhood watch volunteer. Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee, who attempted to resign last week, will remain on paid administrative leave, according to a statement from city hall. Lee stepped aside as chief after a vote of no-confidence by city commissioners, but the commission voted against accepting his resignation while investigations into Martin's killing are pending.
