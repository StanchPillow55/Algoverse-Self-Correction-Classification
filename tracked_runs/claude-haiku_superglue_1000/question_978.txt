Question:
Passage: TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- A senior official with Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard is calling for the prosecution of two key opposition leaders and a former president, accusing them of fanning the protests that have gripped the nation since its disputed presidential election two months ago. A top official in Iran wants to put former President Mohammad Khatami, left, and Mir Hossein Moussavi on trial. Opposition leaders Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi, along with former reformist President Mohammad Khatami, should be tried for attempting to lead a Western-backed "velvet revolution" that aimed to topple the regime, the official said. "If Moussavi, Khatami ... and Karrubi are the main suspects believed to have been behind the velvet coup in Iran, which they are, we expect the judiciary to go after them, arrest them, put them on trial and punish them according to the law," said Brigadier General Yadollah Javani.
