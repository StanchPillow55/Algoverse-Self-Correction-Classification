Question:
Passage: (RollingStone.com) -- Here's a poke to users and nonusers of Facebook: "The Social Network" isn't some yawny visual aid on how the website grew from a few hundred users at Harvard in 2004 to a 2010 global reach of half a billion. "The Social Network" is a hard-charging beast of a movie with a full tank of creative gas that keeps it humming from start to finish (hell of a middle, too.) Sure, it gives you the facts about how then-Harvard undergrad Mark Zuckerberg (a never-better Jesse Eisenberg) made billions by helping technology win the battle against actual human contact.
@highlight

@highlight
Director David Fincher and writer Aaron Sorkin both do the best work of their careers
@highlight

Query: They were the ones who asked Mark to help them build a @placeholder computer-dating service.
