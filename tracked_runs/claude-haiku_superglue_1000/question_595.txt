Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- More than half a century of hostility between the United States and Cuba has done nothing to diminish the island's love of America's national pastime. So it came as no surprise Wednesday when Major League Baseball tweeted that it was "closely monitoring" President Barack Obama's historic plans to normalize diplomatic relations with Cuba and ease economic restrictions on the nation. "While there are not sufficient details to make a realistic evaluation, we will continue to track this significant issue, and we will keep our Clubs informed if this different direction may impact the manner in which they conduct business on issues related to Cuba," MLB said in the statement.
