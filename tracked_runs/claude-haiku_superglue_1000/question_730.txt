Question ID: record_3266

Question:
Passage: The U.S. Department of Justice says it's concerned about actions taken by the Ferguson, Missouri, Police Department in recent days. Two letters to Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson this week from Justice Department chastised Ferguson police over what officers were wearing -- and in some cases, not wearing. Specifically, the department took issue with some officers wearing bracelets that say "I am Darren Wilson," and other officers who were not wearing their name tags. "Officers wearing name plates while in uniform is a basic component of transparency and accountability," Christy E. Lopez, deputy chief of the Special Litigation Section of the Department's Civil Rights Division, said in a September 23 letter obtained by CNN. "The failure to wear name plates conveys a message to the community that, through anonymity, officers may seek to act with impunity."
