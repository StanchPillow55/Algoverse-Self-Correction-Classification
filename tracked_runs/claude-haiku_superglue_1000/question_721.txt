Question:
Passage: A business analyst who quit a high-flying job in London to become landlord of a country inn has seen his freehouse named pub of the year. Peter Tiley quit the rat race in 2013 and spent nearly all his savings on leasing The Salutation Inn in Ham near Berkeley, Gloucestershire, after realising his 'passion' was 'spending time in a wonderful old boozer talking rubbish with friends.' The 31-year-old had had heard a talk from Steve Jobs on being passionate about work which got him thinking 'about how I would look back on my life as an old man'. After quitting his high flying job in London Peter Tiley opened a pub in Gloucestershire with his wife Claire which has just been named Pub of The Year
