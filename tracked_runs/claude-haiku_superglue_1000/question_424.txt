Question:
Passage: (CNN)It might sound like a Vin Diesel movie, but tennis authorities in Australia are hoping that the FAST4 format, which debuted Monday with an exhibition match between world No. 2 Roger Federer and former Wimbledon and US Open champ Lleyton Hewitt, could "revolutionize" the sport. That contest ended in the Swiss star's favor, beating his old friend and rival 4-3 2-3 3-4 4-0 4-3 at Sydney's Qantas Credit Union Arena. This new version of tennis, which marks some of the most significant rule changes in the sport's history, consists of the best-of-three sets with quick changeovers and sudden-death playoffs to prevent tiebreaks from dragging on. The first player to four games wins the set.
