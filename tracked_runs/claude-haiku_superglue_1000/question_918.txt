Question:
Passage: An Alaskan judge has denied Levi Johnson split custody of his child with Sarah Palin's daughter Bristol. The tumultuous relationship between the former vice presidential candidate's daughter and her former fianc√© has landed their son Tripp in Bristol's care for much of his life, but Johnston wanted to change that. Johnston, 23, filed to have equal custody of the now-4-year-old boy but that petition was thrown out by Judge Gregory Heath- who was appointed to the bench by Sarah Palin when she was governor in 2009- who mandated that Tripp remain in the primary custody of his mother Bristol, 23.
