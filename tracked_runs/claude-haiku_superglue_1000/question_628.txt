Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- In the movie "Back to the Future," the year is 1955 when Marty McFly introduces the song "Johnny B. Goode" to a high school dance. That was three years before this tune was actually written, but McFly knows it well because he's from the future. It would stand to reason that in real life, time travelers from a future era -- or who had at least visited the future -- might give themselves away by mentioning events that haven't yet occurred. They might even do so online. I mean, you'd obviously take to social media to broadcast your foreknowledge of world events, right?
@highlight
New study uses Twitter to look for predictions of the future
@highlight
Research found no prescient mentions of Comet ISON or Pope Francis
@highlight
Physicists say time travel is probably not possible

Query: Similarly, before @placeholder took on his papal name in 2013, the phrase "Pope Francis" did not appear in the researchers' search results, except for one person's blog, which appears to have been speculating -- not remembering something from the future.
