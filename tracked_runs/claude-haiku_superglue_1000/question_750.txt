Question:
Passage: The mark of a good team is they play poorly and win. Not as poorly as this, mind you. Manchester United were very ordinary indeed. Still, this is their fifth consecutive victory under Louis van Gaal and they have clawed their way up to third in the Premier League, so they must have something. What they had on Monday night was a world-class finisher in Robin van Persie. Since his title-winning first season at United he has often been criticised, but this was one of those occasions when he was the difference. Poor defending from Southampton — horrid for the first goal, in fact — was equally responsible for United’s win, but a lesser striker would not have taken his only two chances of the game with such assurance. To nutmeg the goalkeeper twice is no accident. Van Persie knew what he was doing.
@highlight
Robin van Persie capitalised on a Jose Fonte error to give Manchester United an early first half lead
@highlight
Graziano Pelle equalised for Southampton in the 31st minute with a blistering left-footed strike
@highlight
Van Persie restored United's lead on 71 minutes with the outside of his left-foot from a Wayne Rooney free-kick
@highlight
The Red Devils have won five straight league games, while Saints have lost their last three matches
@highlight
Van Persie proved United's star man, while Marouane Fellaini and Juan Mata had shockers

Query: And sure enough, 71 minutes in, @placeholder were handed the bill for their profligacy.
