Question:
Passage: Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman finally broke her silence yesterday over her links with a paedophile group. Miss Harman, her MP husband Jack Dromey and former Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt have been under mounting pressure to explain the connections to the Paedophile Information Exchange while holding key roles in the National Council for Civil Liberties. The pressure group granted ‘affiliate’  status to PIE, a notorious group of  predatory paedophiles. Last night Miss Harman dismissed the revelations as a ‘politically-motivated  smear campaign’ and offered no apology over the NCCL’s extraordinary relationship with the PIE.
