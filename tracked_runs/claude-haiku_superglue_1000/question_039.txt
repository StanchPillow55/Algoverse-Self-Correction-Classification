Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- As Iran rushes ahead with its nuclear program, some foreign policy thinkers urge Israel to accept that it must live with "incomplete" security. On Monday morning, 200,000 Israeli children spent the morning in bomb shelters rather than classrooms, as rockets from Gaza barraged southern Israeli cities. That would seem to qualify as security "incomplete" enough to satisfy anybody. Israel has met the barrage with a new defense system, named Iron Dome. Iron Dome senses rocket launches. Its computers assess which rockets are headed toward populated areas, then it fires missiles to intercept the incoming rockets. According to the Israel Defense Forces, Iron Dome has achieved a success rate of more than 90% when fired. Since Friday, Palestinian militants have fired more than 170 rockets at Israeli cities, but as yet, no Israeli civilians have been killed.

Frum: Partial security isn't enough when the threat is mass annihilation

Query: When @placeholder misses -- and it does sometimes miss -- the Gaza rockets kill and maim only within a very limited radius.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the potential damage caused by the Gaza rockets when the Iron Dome system fails to intercept them.

Given information:
- The Iron Dome system has a success rate of more than 90% when fired.
- Since Friday, Palestinian militants have fired more than 170 rockets at Israeli cities.
- When the Iron Dome system misses, the Gaza rockets kill and maim only within a very limited radius.

Step 1: Calculate the number of rockets that the Iron Dome system failed to intercept.
Total number of rockets fired = 170
Success rate of Iron Dome = 90%
Number of rockets missed by Iron Dome = 170 Ã— (1 - 0.90) = 17 rockets

Step 2: Determine the potential damage caused by the 17 rockets that the Iron Dome system failed to intercept.
The passage states that when the Iron Dome system misses, the Gaza rockets kill and maim only within a very limited radius. This suggests that the damage caused by these rockets is relatively small and localized.

Therefore, the final answer is that the potential damage caused by the 17 rockets

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the potential damage caused by the Gaza rockets when the Iron Dome system fails to intercept them.

Given information:
- The Iron Dome system has a success rate of more than 90% when fired.
- When the Iron Dome system misses, the Gaza rockets kill and maim only within a very limited radius.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of the Iron Dome system missing a rocket.
Probability of the Iron Dome system missing a rocket = 1 - Probability of the Iron Dome system intercepting a rocket
Probability of the Iron Dome system missing a rocket = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10 or 10%

Step 2: Determine the limited radius of damage caused by the unintercepted Gaza rockets.
The passage states that when the Iron Dome system misses, the Gaza rockets kill and maim only within a very limited radius. However, the exact radius is not provided.

Step 3: Conclude that the damage caused by the unintercepted Gaza rockets is limited.
Since the passage states that the Gaza rockets kill and maim only within a very limite

Step 2: Estimate the potential damage caused by a Gaza rocket when the Iron Dome system misses.
Since the passage states that the Gaza rockets "kill and maim only within a very limited radius" when the Iron Dome system misses, we can assume that the damage is localized and relatively small in scale.

Without specific data on the blast radius or destructive power of the Gaza rockets, it's difficult to quantify the exact level of damage. However
