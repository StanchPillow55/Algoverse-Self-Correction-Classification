Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage of tickets sold for the opening fixture of the England team in the European Championship compared to the total number of tickets available.

Given information:
- The total number of tickets available for the opening fixture is 9,000.
- Only 2,000 tickets have been sold.

Step 1: Calculate the percentage of tickets sold.
Percentage of tickets sold = (Number of tickets sold / Total number of tickets available) × 100
Percentage of tickets sold = (2,000 / 9,000) × 100
Percentage of tickets sold = 0.2222 × 100
Percentage of tickets sold = 22.22%

Step 2: Determine the placeholder in the given query.
The placeholder in the given query is "@placeholder", which refers to the European Championship.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The dismal figures will be the lowest turnout ever for the European Championship.
