Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Five-time world champions Brazil needed to come from two goals down to beat underdogs the United States 3-2 in the final of the Confederations Cup in South Africa on Sunday night. Brazil celebrated a third Confederations Cup triumph following victories in 2005 and 1997. Captain Lucio headed an 84th-minute winner to end the hopes of the plucky Americans, who scored twice in the first half-hour in Johannesburg. Clint Dempsey, who netted in the shock 2-0 win against European champions Spain in the semi-finals, put the U.S. ahead in the 10th minute. A massive upset seemed to be on the cards when captain Landon Donovan doubled the lead in the 27th minute, but Brazil reduced the deficit just 41 seconds after the half-time break through Luis Fabiano.
