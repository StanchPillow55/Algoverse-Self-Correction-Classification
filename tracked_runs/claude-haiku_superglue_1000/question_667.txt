Question:
Passage: By Pa Reporter Geoffrey Boycott believes an England comeback for Kevin Pietersen is a non-starter because captain Alastair Cook 'can't handle' him. Pietersen's colourful international career was effectively ended in February when the England and Wales Cricket Board dropped its record run-scorer and effectively sacked him from his central contract. Entrenched opinions on both sides mean reconciliation is highly unlikely, while the publication of Pietersen's eagerly anticipated autobiography next month, when a mutually agreed confidentiality clause expires, should settle the matter once and for all. Kevin Pietersen is unlikely to return for England while Alastair Cook is still captain England's record run taker (R),  playing here for Surrey, was effectively sacked in February
