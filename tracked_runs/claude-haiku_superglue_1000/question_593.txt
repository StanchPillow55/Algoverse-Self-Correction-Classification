Question:
Passage: Yankees general manager Brian Cashman allegedly hacked into his mistress's emails and ordered her mother to have her committed in a desperate bid to keep their affair secret. Cashman, who was married at the time, accessed Louise Meanwell's messages 28 times over three days in 2012 after she threatened to expose him, court papers delivered to Manhattan Supreme Court on Thursday allege.
