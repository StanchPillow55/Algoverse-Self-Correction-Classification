Question:
Paragraph: Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for "coal," nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

Response:
To solve this problem, I will go through the paragraph step-by-step and extract the relevant information to determine what a mastery of fire achieved for Peking Man.

Key information from the paragraph:
1. Hundreds of thousands of years before China became the world's longest-running civilization, Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire.
2. Peking Man did not invent ways of creating fire, but he learned how to capture flame and keep it alight.
3. With fire, Peking Man and his communities could live year-round in one cave, and they could pursue cooking and even smelting.

Reasoning:
The paragraph states that Peking Man's mastery of fire was a "phenomenal breakthrough" that allowed his communities to live year-round in one cave and engage in activities like cooking and smelting. This suggests that the mastery of fire achieved the following for Peking Man:

1. Allowed for year-round settlement in one location (cave)
2. Enabled cooking and smelting activities
3. Provided light and heat, which are described as "two revolutionary lux
