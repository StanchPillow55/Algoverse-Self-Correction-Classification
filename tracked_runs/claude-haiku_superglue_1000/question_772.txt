Question:
Passage: More than 20 UK music festivals have banned the sale of 'legal highs' at their events this summer after a spike in the number of people dying from the drugs. The festivals, which include T in the Park, Bestival, Lovebox, Global Gathering and Sonisphere, will also take part in a 'digital blackout' on Monday to highlight the danger of taking the drugs. The websites and social media accounts of the 24 festivals involved will go dark for a day from 9am, and music fans will be met with a black window, a grey light bulb and the message 'Don't be in the Dark about Legal Highs'.
