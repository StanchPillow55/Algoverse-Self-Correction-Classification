Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- A New Zealand gas station owner who became an overnight millionaire after a banking error, and later an international fugitive, has pleaded guilty to seven counts of theft. Nicknamed the "accidental millionaire," Hui "Leo" Gao made headlines three years ago after he and his girlfriend fled the country when he accidentally received access to $10 million New Zealand dollars (U.S.$7 million). He is scheduled to be sentenced on August 24. Gao and his girlfriend withdrew $6.8 million and transferred them to overeseas accounts in Hong Kong, China and the Wynn casino in Macau, according to court documents. Gao has not made any statements to the New Zealand Police.
