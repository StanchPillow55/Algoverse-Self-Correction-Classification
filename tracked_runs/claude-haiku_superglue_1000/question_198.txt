Question:
Passage: Never mind the World Cup connotations. For now, the bigger picture can remain out of focus, in the background. Friday night it is all about Wales versus England; an annual tribal confrontation that needs no wider significance. The 2015 edition of the RBS 6 Nations explodes into life under lights and the night sky in Cardiff, with a cross-border grudge match that deserves to be viewed as the be-all and end-all for both competing nations. When the arch rivals collide at the Millennium Stadium, there will be no thought of tomorrow or the championship title, let alone events to follow later this year.
