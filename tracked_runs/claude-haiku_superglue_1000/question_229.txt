Response:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of bail set for the three men pending their preliminary hearing at the magistrates court next month.

Given information:
- Three men (Darren Wheatcroft, Callan Wheatcroft, and Simon Whitworth) were charged in relation to a RSPCA dog fighting investigation.
- The men face a total of 16 charges.
- All three men deny the charges and are facing trial in Burnley next month.
- The men were bailed pending a preliminary hearing at the magistrates court next month.

Step 1: Determine the typical bail amount for charges related to illegal dog fighting.
Based on the severity of the charges and the nature of the alleged crime, we can assume that the bail amount for each man would be relatively high, likely in the range of £5,000 to £20,000 or more.

Step 2: Calculate the total bail amount for the three men.
Since the passage does not provide the specific bail amount for each individual, we can assume that the bail amount was the same for all three men.

Assuming a bail amount of £10,000 per person
