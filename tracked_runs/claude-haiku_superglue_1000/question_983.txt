Question:
Passage: London, England (CNN) -- How big is big? How open is open? Conservative leader David Cameron has said his power-sharing offer to the Liberal Democrats following the unresolved UK election is "big, open and comprehensive." But will it be big enough to tempt them to ally with a traditional political opponent? Will it be open enough to persuade those in both parties who fear that essential principles or interests will be sold out? Will there be a Conservative/Liberal Democrat deal at all? If not, could a Lib Dem/Labour deal keep Gordon Brown in Downing Street as prime minister? After knocking the stuffing out of each other for four weeks, Britain's major political parties are now jostling to buy each other a drink. Listen to their public statements and you might believe, if you had spent most of your life in Fairyland, that they are doing so in the "national interest."
@highlight
No party won a clear majority in British election, resulting in hung parliament
@highlight
The UK has not had a hung parliament since 1974 -- and parties are not used to bargaining
@highlight
Much depends on the Liberal Democrats and which party it allies itself with
@highlight
One result of the current uncertainty is that the UK edges toward a new political system

Query: Those on the right of @placeholder's party resent his re-branding , or as some put it 'de-toxifying'' of the Conservative party.
