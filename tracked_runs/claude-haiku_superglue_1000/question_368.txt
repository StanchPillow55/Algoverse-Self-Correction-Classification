Question:
Passage: By Jim Norton After nearly 400 years of symbolising four nations united in one flag, what would the Union Flag look like without the blue and white of the Saltire? The question is being posed by flag experts after a poll found nearly 65 per cent were in favour of changing the flag if Scotland votes Yes to independence. The vexillologists, as they are known, have come up with designs that could replace the familiar red, white and blue flag. The first design strips out the blue field of the Scottish flag, replacing it with black, and sees the white bands turn a shade of yellow - intended to honour the flag of Wales' patron saint, St David (a yellow cross on a black field)
