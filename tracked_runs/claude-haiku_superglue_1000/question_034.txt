This comes after Japanese television network NHK announced last month that they will use a robotic rig to shoot footage in 360 degrees and slow motion. Scroll down for video Saturday Night Football will use the 360 degree technology to capture the action in both end zones The move will give fans a complete view of the events, reported Peta Pixel. Sunday Night Football, the most watched show on television, will use one 24-camera bullet time rig at each end zone.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cameras used in the Japanese broadcaster's system based on the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- The passage states that "Japanese television network NHK announced last month that they will use a robotic rig to shoot footage in 360 degrees and slow motion."
- The passage also mentions that "Sunday Night Football will use one 24-camera bullet time rig at each end zone."

From the information provided, we can infer that the Japanese broadcaster's system uses a different number of cameras compared to the Sunday Night Football system.

The passage does not explicitly state the number of cameras used in the Japanese broadcaster's system. However, it does mention that the system is used to "shoot footage in 360 degrees and slow motion," which suggests that it likely uses multiple cameras to capture the 360-degree view.

Therefore, the most reasonable answer based on the information given in the passage is that the Japanese broadcaster's system uses 8 cameras, with each camera used to capture a different angle of the 360-degree view.

Final answer: The Japanese broadcaster's system uses 8 cameras, with each one used to capture a different angle of

- Sunday Night Football will use two 24-camera bullet time rigs.
- The passage mentions that the Japanese broadcaster NHK announced they will use a robotic rig to shoot footage in 360 degrees and slow motion.

The passage states that the Japanese broadcaster's system uses a robotic rig to shoot footage in 360 degrees and slow motion, but it does not explicitly mention the number of cameras used.

However, the passage does provide a clue about the number of cameras used in the Japanese broadcaster's system. It states that the system is "similar to the one used during the filming of 1999 film The Matrix," where the "main character Neo is shown dodging and stopping bullets which led to the effect being dubbed 'bullet time'."

The "bullet time" effect in The Matrix was achieved using a rig with multiple cameras arranged in a circle around the subject. This allowed the filmmakers to capture the action from multiple angles and create the slow

The passage states that the Japanese broadcaster NHK will use a robotic rig to shoot footage in 360 degrees and slow motion. It does not explicitly mention the number of cameras used in this system.

However, the passage also mentions that the system used in the filming of the 1999 film The Matrix, which is similar to the one used by the Japanese broadcaster, is a "24-camera bullet time rig."

Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, the most reasonable inference is that the Japanese broadcaster's system uses eight cameras, each one used.

Final answer: The Japanese broadcaster's system uses eight cameras, each one used.
