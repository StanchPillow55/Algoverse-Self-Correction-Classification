Paragraph: Dylan and Jez are two orphans who meet in their twenties and vow to achieve their shared childhood dream of living in a stately home .

During one of their biggest cons , their lives are touched by Georgie , who needs money to save the Down's syndrome foundation that her brother attends .  When a con goes wrong , the two find themselves in gaol to be released only after their entire fortune is rendered useless because of a recall of 50 notes .  It is down to an elaborate plan involving Dylan , Jez and Georgie , to break them out of gaol in order to save their dream .
