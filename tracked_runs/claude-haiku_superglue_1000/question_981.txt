Question:
Passage: By Ruth Styles and Toni Jones PUBLISHED: 05:07 EST, 31 January 2013 | UPDATED: 02:23 EST, 1 February 2013 A young couple who receive more than £17,000 a year in benefits appeared on ITV's This Morning to defend their taxpayer-funded lifestyle this week. Danny Creamer, 21, and Gina Allan, 18, who live in a comfortable two-bedroom flat in Portsmouth  with their four month old daughter, Talulah Rose, infuriated viewers and Daily Mail readers as they argued they are better off on £17k benefits and that unless they are able to find jobs that pay £18,000 a year or more, there's no point in working.
