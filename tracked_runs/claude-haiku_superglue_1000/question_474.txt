Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The federal government's response manager to the Gulf oil disaster said Sunday that BP has made progress, but cautioned it was too early to call the effort a success. "We're making the right progress. I don't think anyone should be pleased as long as there's oil in the water," Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said on CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday. Allen was responding to remarks over the weekend by BP's senior vice president, Bob Fryar, who said the company was "pleased" with its operation to funnel crude up from the ruptured undersea well to a drilling ship a mile above on the Gulf of Mexico.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and extract the relevant data to calculate the impact on the tourist season.

Given information:
- The federal government's response manager, Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, stated that it is too early to call the oil spill response effort a success as there is still oil in the water.
- BP's senior vice president, Bob Fryar, said the company was "pleased" with its operation to funnel crude up from the ruptured undersea well.
- The governor of Mississippi stated that the state is seeing no oil on its beaches, but tourists are still staying away.

The key information we need to focus on is the governor's statement about tourists staying away despite the lack of oil on the beaches. This suggests that the tourist season has been hurt by misperceptions or misconceptions about the situation in the Gulf region.

To quantify the impact on the tourist season, we would need additional data such as:
- Typical tourist numbers or revenue for the Gulf region during the peak tourist season
- Actual tourist numbers or revenue for the current tourist season
- Percentage decrease in tourist numbers or revenue compared to the typical season

Response:
To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The federal government's response manager to the Gulf oil disaster, Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, said it was too early to call the effort a success.
- BP's senior vice president, Bob Fryar, said the company was "pleased" with its operation to funnel crude up from the ruptured undersea well.
- The governor of Mississippi said the state is seeing no oil on beaches, but tourists are staying away.

The query is asking about the governor's statement that "tourist season has been hurt by misperceptions of what's going on down here."

To analyze this, we need to consider the following:
1. The governor's statement implies that the actual situation on the beaches (no oil) is different from the public's perception (that there is oil).
2. This mismatch between reality and perception has led to a decline in tourism.

So the governor is suggesting that the negative impact on tourism is due to "misperceptions" rather than the actual conditions on the beaches.

This aligns with the overall context provided in the passage, where the federal response manager

To analyze this, we need to consider the following:
1. The oil spill is causing damage to the Gulf region, including beaches and wildlife.
2. However, the governor of Mississippi is saying that even though there is no oil on their beaches, tourists are still staying away.
3. This suggests that the perception of the oil spill's impact is worse than the actual on-the-ground situation in some areas.
4. The governor is implying that the misperceptions about the extent of the oil sp
