Question:
Passage: By Martin Robinson The teacher who organised vile Thatcher ‘death parties’ and compared the Baroness to Hitler, bought her council house using the Iron Lady's right-to-buy scheme and then doubled her money, it was revealed today. Romany Blythe, 45, made £150,0000 when she sold her North London home four years after buying it off the local authority in Islington. Lady Thatcher wanted to increase house ownership in the 1980s after she came to power, so she let council property residents snap them up for bargain prices from local authorities. And it appears that extreme anti-Thatcherite Miss Blythe used the scheme to make a huge sum of cash.
