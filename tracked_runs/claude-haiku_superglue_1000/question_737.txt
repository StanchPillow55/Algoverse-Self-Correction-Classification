Question:
Passage: Ireland coasted to a six-try, 49-7 victory over Georgia in a Dublin clash marred by an unpunished stamp to debutant Dominic Ryan's face. The hosts were left incensed by flanker Viktor Kolelishvili bringing his boot down on back-rower Ryan's face but captain Eoin Reddan's complaints went unheeded by referee JP Doyle. Ryan somehow escaped serious injury in a scrappy first-half, before Felix Jones claimed a brace while Dave Kilcoyne, Richardt Strauss, Simon Zebo and Stuart Olding all crossed, with Giorgi Nemsadze responding for Georgia. Leinster fly half Ian Madigan impressed for Ireland with his attacking play and accurate goal kicking
