Question:
Passage: A gay British man who has flown home after being jailed in Morocco for 'homosexual acts' has described his ordeal as a 'nightmare'. Ray Cole, 69, from Deal, Kent, was imprisoned for four months in Marrakech with his Moroccan friend after police found homosexual images on his phone. Today, after being unexpectedly freed, he told how he was kept in 'a tank of 40 or 50 people' and said the conditions were 'indescribable', adding: 'Dickens couldn't paint it any worse'. The grandfather, who flew home to Britain last night after being released on appeal yesterday, said he knew that homosexuality was illegal and said he and his friend, 20-year-old Jamal Jam Wald Nass, were careful to be 'discreet'.
