Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- Senate Republicans on Thursday blocked a Democratic measure championed by President Barack Obama to end tax breaks for the major oil companies. The procedural vote of 51-47, which failed to reach the needed threshold of 60 in favor, killed the measure, which was given little chance of eventually winning approval in the Republican-controlled House. Four Democrats opposed the bill while one Republican supported it. Obama and Democrats had pushed it in an attempt to gain political advantage as rising gas prices continue to hurt and anger American voters in an election year. In remarks shortly before the Senate voted, Obama said the nation will be watching to see where Congress stands on the issue.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the missing word in the query.

Given information:
- The passage discusses a vote in the Senate to end tax breaks for major oil companies.
- The vote failed to reach the needed threshold of 60 in favor, with 51-47 against the measure.
- President Obama had championed the measure, and framed the vote as a choice between his vision and protecting the status quo.
- The query states that Obama said the American people will be watching "@placeholder to see if they have that same faith."

To find the missing word, we need to determine what the American people will be watching to see if they have the same faith as Obama's vision.

Based on the context, the missing word is likely "Congress" or "Senators". The passage indicates that the vote was in the Senate, and Obama is referring to the American people watching Congress/Senators to see if they have the same faith as his vision.

Therefore, the complete query would be:

"Today, the American people are going to be watching Congress to see if they have that same faith."

Final answer: Congress

Given information:
- The Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic measure championed by President Barack Obama to end tax breaks for the major oil companies.
- The procedural vote was 51-47, which failed to reach the needed threshold of 60 in favor.
- Four Democrats opposed the bill while one Republican supported it.
- President Obama framed the oil subsidy vote as a choice between that vision and protecting the status quo.
- Obama said "Today, the American people are going to be watching @placeholder to see if they have that same faith."

Step 1: Identify the key elements in the problem.
- The vote on ending oil company tax breaks
- The vote count and threshold needed
- The party affiliations of the senators who voted
- President Obama's framing of the vote
- The placeholder in Obama's statement

Response:
To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. The passage states that the Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic measure to end tax breaks for major oil companies. The vote was 51-47, failing to reach the 60 votes needed to pass.

2. The passage mentions that 4 Democrats opposed the bill, while 1 Republican supported it.

3. To find the total number of Senators, I need to add up the votes:
   - 51 Republicans voted against the bill
   - 47 Democrats voted for the bill
   - 1 Republican voted for the bill
   - 4 Democrats voted against the bill

   Total Senators = 51 + 47 + 1 + 4 = 103

4. The passage states that the vote failed to reach the needed threshold of 60 in favor. This means the final vote count was 51-47.

5. To find the placeholder value, I need to subtract the number of Senators who voted against the bill from the total number of Senators:
   - Total Senators = 103
   - Senators who voted against the bill =


Extracted Answer: 103
