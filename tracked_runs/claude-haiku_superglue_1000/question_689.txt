Question:
Passage: McDonald's restaurants in many Chinese cities have been eerily quiet this past week. The fast food giant is enormously popular in China where it has 2,000 outlets, each one typically overflowing with hungry crowds. But many McDonald's addicts have been forced to go cold turkey as numerous branches have yanked flagship burgers off the menu amid a tainted meat scandal. The food scare broke when a video surfaced in Chinese media last week, showing appalling practices in a Shanghai food-processing factory that supplies ingredients to many international restaurant brands. Since then, the tainted meat supply has been found to reach across China, all the way to Hong Kong, and even to Japan.
