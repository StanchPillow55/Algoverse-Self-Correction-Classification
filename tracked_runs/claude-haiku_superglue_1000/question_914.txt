Question:
Passage: His beanie hat may be slightly askew but Joleon Lescott is talking straight. For the first time since leaving Manchester City last summer he opens up about his disappointment at the manner in which his successful five-year spell ended. Lescott is still confused by decisions made by Roberto Mancini and Manuel Pellegrini to omit him from their line-ups, most crushingly from last season's Capital One Cup final, and how a lack of action hampered his chance of cementing an England place. This is not to suggest he is gloomy. Chatting after training with West Bromwich Albion he is quite the opposite. Lescott is back playing regularly and enjoying the responsibility that comes from being an experienced figure in a side of humbler aspirations.
