Question:
Passage: Carl Froch delivered his riposte to the unfortunate 'Death Row' taunt from George Groves, which is also likely to get the Londoner in a little trouble with the authorities. At the weigh-in in front of 4,000 boisterous fans, Froch said: 'I want to send him back into the hole he crawled out of and put this saga behind me'. Groves had likened Froch to a man on death row and his comment has not gone unnoticed by the Boxing Board of Control.
