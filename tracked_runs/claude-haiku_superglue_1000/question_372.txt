Response:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and apply logical reasoning to determine the appropriate response.

Given information:
- Experts have stated that moving to online voting at this time would be "insane" from a security point of view.
- Reports have found that voting machines can be hacked for as little as $10.50 in parts.
- Studies have concluded that voting machines without a paper ballot backup "is not acceptable."
- Within 48 hours of going live, hackers had nearly taken over a D.C. test system for online voting.
- Officials acknowledged the lessons learned but maintained that voters expect online voting to be as simple as paying bills or taxes.

Reasoning:
1. Security concerns: The experts' assessment that online voting would be "insane" from a security point of view is a significant concern. Hacking voting machines for a relatively low cost and the near-takeover of a D.C. test system demonstrate the vulnerabilities of online voting systems.
2. Lack of paper ballot backup: The requirement for voting machines to have a paper ballot backup is crucial for ensuring the integrity and verifiability of the voting process. Voting machines without this backup
