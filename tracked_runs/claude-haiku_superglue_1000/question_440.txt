Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Glamorous tennis star Ana Ivanovic has reached the quarterfinals of the Generali Ladies Linz tournament -- despite being penalized a game for taking too long in the toilet. The former world No. 1, who was given a wildcard entry into the Austrian event after the late withdrawal of the injured Serena Williams, had been leading 1-0 in the second set on Thursday when she needed to leave the court. When she finally returned, the 22-year-old Serbian -- whose last tournament win came in Liz in 2008 -- discovered that her opponent Barbora Zahlavova Strycova had been awarded the next game of the second-round match.
