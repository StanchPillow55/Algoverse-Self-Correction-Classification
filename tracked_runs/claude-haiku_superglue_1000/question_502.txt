Question:
Passage: A popular high school basketball coach believes he lost his job after a disgruntled and vengeful parent emailed a controversial film he acted in ten years ago to the school principal. Mike Hvizdo, who worked at Weston High School in Connecticut, was asked to resign on February 6 after administrators saw a short film called Forbidden Fruit that he acted in back in 2003. The nine-minute black and white comedy video contains vulgar language and raunchy themes but no pornography, nudity or illegal material. School officials said the film was 'offensive' and compromised Hvizdo's position as coach of the Trojans basketball team.
