Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Russians go to the polls on Sunday March 4 to elect a new president. Current Prime Minister Vladimir Putin is attempting to regain the post he held between 1999 and 2008. He has been a dominant force in Russian politics for more than a decade but his popularity has suffered recent setbacks. So who is challenging him and what will the poll mean for Russia? CNN examines some of the key questions. Russia recently had elections. What is this one about? Russia's top job -- that of president -- is being contested this time. It follows parliamentary elections in December in which Putin's ruling United Russia Party received 49.5% of the vote -- down from 64% four years ago. It kept United Russia in power in the lower house, called the Duma, with 238 of the 450 seats but also triggered major protests over allegations of vote rigging and ballot stuffing. Putin dismissed calls for a review, but the outgoing president Dmitry Medvedev announced political reforms in the wake of large demonstrations.
