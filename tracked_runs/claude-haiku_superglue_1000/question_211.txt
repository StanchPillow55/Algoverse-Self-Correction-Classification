Response:
To determine if the word "smear" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and the usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "Smear the wall with paint."
In this sentence, the word "smear" is used as a verb, and it means to apply or spread a substance (in this case, paint) over a surface in a thick or messy way.

Sentence 2: "The opposition party attempted to smear the candidate by spreading incorrect and unverifiable rumors about their personal behavior."
In this sentence, the word "smear" is also used as a verb, but it has a different meaning. Here, "smear" means to damage or undermine someone's reputation by spreading negative or false information about them.

Analyzing the two usages of the word "smear":
1. In the first sentence, "smear" means to apply or spread a substance over a surface.
2. In the second sentence, "smear" means to damage or undermine someone's reputation by spreading negative or false information.

Therefore, the word "smear" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences

Sentence 1: "Smear the wall with paint."
In this sentence, the word "smear" is used as a verb, meaning to apply or spread a substance, in this case, paint, onto a surface.

Sentence 2: "The opposition party attempted to smear the candidate by spreading incorrect and unverifiable rumors about their personal behavior."
In this sentence, the word "smear" is used as a verb, but with a different meaning. Here, it means to damage or tarnish the reputation of the candidate by spreading negative and unverified information about their personal behavior.
