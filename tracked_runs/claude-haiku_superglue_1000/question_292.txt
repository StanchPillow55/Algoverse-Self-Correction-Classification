Question:
Passage: Boris Johnson has attacked Islamists who want to impose ‘mumbo-jumbo’ sharia law on Britain. The Mayor of London condemned as ‘bunk’ the idea that there was a clash of civilisations and warned against exaggerating the ‘plague’ of militants. Britain should not give the killers the prize they craved most – dividing us through perpetuating the myth of a 'war', he said. Boris Johnson, pictured during a media conference in Woolwich, said Britain should not let the killers divide the country through perpetuating a myth of a 'war' 'This is a sinister political agenda that promotes a sense of grievance and victimhood among a minority of Muslims,’ he wrote in his regular column for the Telegraph.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to determine what information is missing from the passage and use the context to infer the most appropriate word to fill in the blank.

Based on the passage, it seems that Boris Johnson is discussing the threat of Islamism, which he distinguishes from the religion of Islam itself. He condemns the idea of a "clash of civilizations" and warns against exaggerating the "plague" of militants.

The passage also mentions that the killers should not be allowed to divide the country through perpetuating the "myth of a 'war'". This suggests that the missing word in the query is likely related to the number of Islamist militants or extremists, rather than the broader Muslim population.

Given this context, the most appropriate word to fill in the blank would be "Islamists". The passage states that the number of Islamists is in the "low thousands", yet there were "one million" of them, which seems to contradict the information provided.

Therefore, the final answer would be:

The passage states that the number of Islamists is in the "low thousands", yet there were one million Islamists.
