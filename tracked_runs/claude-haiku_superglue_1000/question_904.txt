Question:
Passage: Steven Nzonzi has just been reminded of his role in a TV advert for Venky’s chicken. It was the summer of 2011 and Blackburn’s players were filmed eating platefuls of the stuff in the dressing-room at Ewood Park to promote the club’s new Indian owners. The final scene features captain Ryan Nelsen licking his fingers as he leads his team down the tunnel, as if this was a perfectly normal pre-match routine. Mention of that last bit brings a burst of laughter from Nzonzi, his Gallic calm giving way to a fit of the giggles. Steven Nzonzi has started every Premier League game for Stoke City this season
