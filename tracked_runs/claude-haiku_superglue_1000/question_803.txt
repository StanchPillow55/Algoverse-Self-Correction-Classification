Question:
Context: Alcohol laws of South Carolina -- Prohibition was a major issue in the state's history. Voters endorsed prohibition in 1892 but instead were given the ``Dispensary System'' of state-owned liquor stores, They soon became symbols of political corruption controlled by Ben Tillman's machine and were shut down in 1907. Today, the retail sale of liquor statewide is permitted from 9 a.m. until 7 p.m. Monday--Saturday, and Sunday sales are banned by state law. However, counties and cities may hold referendums to allow Sunday sales of beer and wine only. Counties currently allowing Sunday beer and wine sales: Berkeley, Beaufort, Charleston, Dorchester, Georgetown, Horry, Newberry, Oconee, Richland (unincorporated areas only), and York. Lancaster and Lexington allow in cities with referendums. Cities and towns that have passed laws allowing Sunday beer and wine sales include Columbia, Spartanburg, Charleston, Greenville, Aiken, Rock Hill, Summerville, Santee, Daniel Island, Hardeeville and Tega Cay.
