Question:
Passage: Roberto Mancini knows his second coming at Internazionale will be a whole lot tougher than his first after this Milan derby. Where previously he commanded players the calibre of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Patrick Vieira in a league shorn of Juventus, his squad now are not at that level and Juventus reign supreme. He returned to the San Siro dugout, where he won three Serie A titles and two Coppe Italia before his sacking in May 2008, more experienced from his time at Manchester City. He will need all his nous to send Inter to the summit once more. In his first match since taking over from Walter Mazzarri, Mancini oversaw a 1-1 draw here, in an encounter that was low on quality.
