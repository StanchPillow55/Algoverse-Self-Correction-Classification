Question:
Premise: Two Belgian soldiers, part of the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, were wounded Friday after stepping on a cluster bomb during a mine-clearing operation in southern Lebanon. One of the two soldiers stepped on a cluster bomb while clearing a minefield near the village of Majdel Silim. Their injuries were "serious but not life-threatening", a UNIFIL spokesman said, however this was denied by the cabinet of the Belgian Minister of Defence, Andr√© Flahaut. One soldier was wounded at the neck, the second was wounded at the foot.

Hypothesis: UNIFIL is affiliated with the Belgian Minister of Defence.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?
