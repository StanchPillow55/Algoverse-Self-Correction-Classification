Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- Backers of a comprehensive new farm bill held a campaign-style rally Wednesday on Capitol Hill, cranking up the political heat on House Republican leaders struggling to balance competing election year and ideological pressures. "All of us gathered here today ... share one common and resounding message," said Bob Stallman, head of the American Farm Bureau Federation. "Congress, for our farm and ranch families, their communities and for our nation, pass the farm bill now." Stallman was cheered by a boisterous crowd at the Capitol Reflecting Pool. "We are out here to let our congressmen know it is important that they pass the farm bill," Julie Taylor, an independent voter from Indiana, told CNN. "It is frustrating. ... Knowing that we don't know what to do or what to plan for is very difficult."

Response:
To solve this problem, I need to analyze the given passage and determine the appropriate placeholder to fill in the query.

The passage discusses the efforts of farm bill backers to rally support on Capitol Hill for the passage of a new comprehensive farm bill. It mentions that House Republicans are sharply divided on the issue, and that failure to pass a new farm bill could result in major political and economic fallout.

The key information relevant to the query is that the Senate has already passed a new farm bill with a bipartisan vote in June.

Therefore, the appropriate placeholder in the query would be "Senate's", as the committee's bill is broadly similar to the Senate's plan.

The complete reasoning and work is as follows:

1. The passage states that the Senate has passed a new farm bill with a bipartisan vote in June.
2. The query asks about the committee's bill being similar to a "placeholder" plan.
3. Based on the information in the passage, the most relevant "placeholder" plan is the Senate's farm bill, as it is the only specific plan mentioned.
4. Therefore, the appropriate placeholder to fill in the query is "Senate's".

Final answer: The committee's bill is broadly similar

Response:
To solve this problem, I will need to make some assumptions based on the given information in the passage. The passage discusses the ongoing debate and political pressure surrounding the passage of a new comprehensive farm bill in the U.S. Congress. However, it does not provide any specific details about the contents or provisions of the proposed farm bill.

Given the information provided:
- The passage mentions that the Senate has already passed a new farm bill with bipartisan support.
- It also states that House Republicans are "sharply divided" on the issue, suggesting there may be differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill.
- The passage refers to a "committee's bill" that is "broadly similar" to some unspecified "plan", but does not provide any details about this plan.

Without more specifics about the contents of the various farm bill proposals, I will need to make some reasonable assumptions in order to provide a complete response.

Assumption 1: The "committee's bill" referred to in the query is likely the farm bill proposal that has been developed by the House Agriculture Committee.
Assumption 2: The "plan" that the committee's bill is "broadly similar to" is likely the farm bill that was previously
