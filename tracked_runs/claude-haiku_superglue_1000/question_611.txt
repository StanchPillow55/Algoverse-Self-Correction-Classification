Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Watch out! Lock up your loved ones! Another bloated, over-produced, high-concept monstrosity has escaped from the labs at Dreamworks Animation, and it's out to devour your kids. Susan, aka "Ginormica," has to save the world in "Monsters vs. Aliens." But don't be too alarmed. "Monsters vs. Aliens" is relatively harmless -- a toothless satire with a knee-jerk feminist theme and a sorry excuse for a plot. That sounds harsh, I know. Who doesn't want to see a 50-foot woman careening through San Francisco on skates that turn out to be automobiles -- the ultimate demolition roller derby? But think about that, just for a second. Roller skates work because they have fixed wheels. Try it with motorcars and you won't get very far.
@highlight
"Monsters vs. Aliens" about Earth-born "monsters" taking on megalomaniacal alien
@highlight
Film's main character is almost 50-foot woman voiced by Reese Witherspoon
@highlight
"Monsters" has great talent but no script to speak of, says Tom Charity

Query: @placeholder gets a kick-butt finale, and is a much stronger character -- in any number of ways -- than the movie's president.
