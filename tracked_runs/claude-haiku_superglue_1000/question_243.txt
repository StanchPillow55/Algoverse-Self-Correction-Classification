Question:
Passage: By Michael Zennie A Blackwater security contractor threatened to kill a State Department investigator in Iraq who was looking into allegations of the company's cost over-runs, boozy parties, mistreatment of migrant workers and violence against civilians, according to a newly-released report. Daniel Carroll, Blackwaterâ€™s project manager in Iraq, allegedly told Jean C. Richter that 'he could kill me at that very moment and no one could or would do anything about it as we were in Iraq,' in August 31, 2007, Richter claimed in an official report he filed after the fact. But instead of Mr Carroll, a former member of the elite Navy SEAL Team Six, being disciplined, Mr Richter was the one sent home. U.S. Embassy officials in Baghdad told him he had to end his investigation and leave Iraq because he was disrupting the security options Blackwater was providing for diplomatic staff, the New York Times reports.

Response:
To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. The passage states that a Blackwater security contractor, Daniel Carroll, threatened to kill a State Department investigator, Jean C. Richter, who was looking into allegations of Blackwater's cost over-runs, boozy parties, mistreatment of migrant workers, and violence against civilians.

2. The passage also states that instead of Carroll being disciplined, Richter was the one sent home and ordered to stop his investigation and leave Iraq.

3. The query asks about Blackwater over-billing the State Department and falsifying records, which the passage alleges.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The passage alleges that Blackwater over-billed the State Department and falsified records.

The reasoning is that the passage discusses various allegations against Blackwater, including cost over-runs, which implies over-billing the State Department. Additionally, the passage states that Richter's report made "scathing" allegations against Blackwater's $1 billion security contract for State Department employees in Iraq, which suggests Blackwater may have falsified records related to that contract.

2. The passage also states that instead of Carroll being disciplined, Richter was the one ordered to stop his investigation and leave Iraq.

4. However, the passage does mention that Richter's report alleged "massive abuse in $1billion security contract for State Department employees in Iraq".

5. This suggests that the allegations in Richter's report likely included claims of Blackwater over-billing and falsifying records related to the $1 billion security contract.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The passage alleges that Blackwater over-billed the State Department and falsified records related to the $1 billion security contract for State Department employees in Iraq.
