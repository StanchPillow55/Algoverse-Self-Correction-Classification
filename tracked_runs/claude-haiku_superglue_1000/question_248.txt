Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Israel and Hamas agreed to a 12-hour cease-fire starting Saturday morning, temporarily halting more than two weeks of bloodshed that has claimed more than 900 mostly civilian lives. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Secretary of State John Kerry that Israel would agree to the truce, according to a U.S. official traveling with Kerry. And Palestinian parliament member Mustafa Barghouti said Hamas will comply. "Of course, they will," Barghouti told CNN's "The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer" Friday. "Not only Hamas but all Palestinians." Both Barghouti and the chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said Hamas was willing to sign on to a proposed seven-day cease-fire as well.
