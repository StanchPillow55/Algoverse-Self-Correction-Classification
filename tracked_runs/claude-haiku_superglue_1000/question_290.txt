Question:
Passage: Santa Cruz, California (CNN) -- The arrest of Alix Catherine Tichelman in the death of a Google executive has shed a new light on the so-called sugar daddy websites where women are paid, sometimes thousands of dollars a month, by older suitors for their company. Tichelman, 26, is suspected in the death of Forrest Timothy Hayes, 51, a married father of five who was found dead in November on his 50-foot yacht. On Wednesday, she pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and other charges in a Santa Cruz County, California, court. Her defense asked that she be released on her own recognizance, but a judge said no because he was "uncertain" that she would return to court. Her family was in the courtroom.
