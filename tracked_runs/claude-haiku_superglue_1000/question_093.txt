Question:
Context: Pennsylvania Station (New York City) -- Despite the improvements, Penn Station continues to be criticized as a low-ceilinged ``catacomb'' lacking charm, especially when compared to New York's much larger and ornate Grand Central Terminal. The New York Times, in a November 2007 editorial supporting development of an enlarged railroad terminal, said that ``Amtrak's beleaguered customers...now scurry through underground rooms bereft of light or character.'' Times transit reporter Michael M. Grynbaum later called Penn Station ``the ugly stepchild of the city's two great rail terminals.''
