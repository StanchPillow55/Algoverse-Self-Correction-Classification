Question:
Passage: Paris (CNN) -- French prosecutors named the suspect held in connection with a newspaper shooting this week as Abdelhakim Dekhar. Dekhar allegedly shot a photographer at the daily newspaper Liberation in Paris on Monday. On Thursday, French President Francois Hollande thanked police for capturing him. It "prevented the worst from happening again," he said in a statement. Dekhar was arrested Wednesday in Bois Colombes, in the northwestern suburbs of Paris, the prosecutor's office said. Investigators are trying to determine if the man is connected to the shooting at the newspaper, as well as two other Monday crimes -- a shooting that injured no one in front of the Societe Generale towers in Paris, and a carjacking near the towers in the Paris neighborhood of La Defense, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV.
