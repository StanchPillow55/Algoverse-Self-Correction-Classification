Question:
Passage: By Beth Stebner PUBLISHED: 15:38 EST, 20 April 2013 | UPDATED: 16:57 EST, 20 April 2013 A nation is questioning how intelligence agencies failed to stop the Tsarnaev brothers from allegedly launching a terrorist attack on Boston Marathon runners, even after they were outspoken on their extreme views on various social media platforms. Older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, who was killed Thursday night in a shootout with police, was interviewed by the FBI in 2011 after a foreign government, later identified as Russia, alerted U.S. authorities that he could have possible ties to extremists and radical Islamists. The surviving ethnic Chechen brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is being treated at a hospital in Boston for critical injuries. A Twitter page identified by several news outlets to be his is full of cryptic messages like, ‘We try to find ways to kill time but time kills us.’
