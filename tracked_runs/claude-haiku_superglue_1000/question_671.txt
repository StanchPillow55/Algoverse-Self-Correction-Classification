Question:
Passage: London (CNN) -- A British girl who survived the execution-style killing of her father, mother and grandmother in a normally idyllic region of the Alps last week returned to Britain on Friday, authorities said. Zainab al-Hilli, 7, left France in the morning and arrived in the UK, Surrey police said. As the only survivor, she could be a key witness who saw who carried out the shooting, according to the French prosecutor leading the investigation. She spent several days in a medically induced coma, and as of Wednesday, she remained too badly injured to be questioned, Eric Maillaud said. She was beaten and shot in the attack, and rescued by a British cyclist who came upon the scene on September 5.
