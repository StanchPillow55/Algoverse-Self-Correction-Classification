To solve this problem, we need to find the number of years Ron Akana spent as a flight attendant.

Given information:
- Ron Akana, 83, worked his final flight from Denver to Kauai last weekend.
- He has spent 63 years in the sky as a flight attendant.

Step 1: Calculate the year Ron Akana started working as a flight attendant.
Current year - Years as a flight attendant = Year he started working as a flight attendant
