Question:
Passage: The countdown has begun for the Orion spacecraft’s test flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida on 4 December. Nasa’s latest capsule, which will take astronauts on deep space missions, now has its rocket in position and is undergoing final checks. Ahead of its launch, Nasa has released a video named ‘Trial by Fire’, which outlines each of the daring stages on Orion's 3,600 mile (5,793km) journey above Earth Scroll down for video The countdown has begun for the Orion spacecraft’s test flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida on 4 December.

@highlight
The 4 December flight will take place from Cape Canaveral in Florida
@highlight
A Delta IV heavy rocket will launch craft 100 miles (160km) above Earth
@highlight
Upper stage rockets will then take it 3,600 miles (5,793km) out into space
@highlight
This is just enough to pass through the Van Allen radiation belts - two rings encircling the Earth and held in place by a magnetic field
@highlight
Orion capsule has been outfitted with sensors to take readings of belts
@highlight
On future missions, Orion will carry astronauts farther into the solar system than ever before, including to an asteroid and Mars

Query: The mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next-generation @placeholder.
