Question:
Passage: Silver Springs, Nevada (CNN) -- The helicopter is on the chase. At first, you can only hear it. Then, from behind the hillside, you see a herd of wild horses running for their freedom, with the helicopter close behind. One escapes the trap, barely. The crowd cheers. This is the scene at the Lahontan wild horse roundup in Silver Springs, Nevada. The helicopter pilot works for the federal government. The crowd is composed mainly of activists opposed to the roundups. More and more, the roundups are becoming showdowns between protesters and the Bureau of Land Management. "They are by law supposed to protect these horses, and in fact they are doing the exact opposite -- they are exterminating them," says Simone Netherlands, founder of the advocacy group Respect 4 Horses. "They are managing them to extinction."

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the information provided in the passage.

The passage discusses the federal government's wild horse roundups in Silver Springs, Nevada. It mentions that the government uses helicopters to round up the wild horses, and that this practice is opposed by activists who believe the government is "exterminating" the horses rather than protecting them.

The query states that the study determining the number of horses that will remain in the management area was done in the mid-1990s. This suggests that the government has a target or goal for the number of wild horses that should remain in the management area.

However, the passage does not provide any specific information about the target number of horses or the details of the study conducted in the mid-1990s. Without this information, it is not possible to determine the final answer.

If the passage had provided the target number of horses for the management area, as well as the current population of wild horses, we could have calculated the difference to determine how many horses would remain. But the passage does not give us these details.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, I do not have enough information to provide a final answer to the query. The passage does

The query states that the study determining the number of horses that will remain in the management area was done in the mid-1990s. This suggests that the information about the number of horses that should remain in the management area is outdated and may not reflect the current situation.

To answer this query, we need to consider the following:
1. The study was done in the mid-1990s, which means the information is likely outdated.
2. The passage mentions that the government is "managing them to extinction," which suggests that the number of horses in the management area may have changed significantly since the mid-1990s.
3. The passage also mentions that protests have increased, which could indicate that the government's actions have had a significant impact on the wild horse population.

Given this information, we can conclude that the study done in the mid-

The query states that the study determining the number of horses that will remain in the management area was done in the mid-1990s.

Given the information provided, we can infer the following:

1. The government conducts wild horse roundups in the Silver Springs, Nevada area using helicopters.
2. The government claims the roundups are to control the population, but activists argue the government is mismanaging the horses.
3. The study that determined the number of horses to remain in the management area was done in the mid-1990s.

However, the passage does not provide any specific numbers or details about the study or the management area. Therefore, we cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.

The best we can say is that the study determining the number of horses to remain in the management area was done in the mid-1990s
