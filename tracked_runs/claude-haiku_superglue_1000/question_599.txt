Passage: By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 11:52 EST, 15 May 2013 | UPDATED: 12:38 EST, 15 May 2013 A teenager in California who only knew the first name of a girl who posted suicidal thoughts online has saved her life after calling police and sparking an against-the-clock search. Jackie Rosas, from Cathedral City, California, alerted her local authorities at 5pm on May 6 after she saw the girl write on Tumblr, a social networking site, that she was going to kill herself. Armed with just the girl's first name, local police and school staff carried out tireless web sleuthing to uncover the identity of the girl - who was found in Union Township, New Jersey eight hours later.
