Question:
Passage: This is the shocking moment a police officer tried to trick a driver into admitting he had marijuana in his car during a routine traffic stop - because 'everyone who plays frisbee golf smokes weed'. Officer Aaron King was captured on video pulling over Scott Beckwith and giving him a warning about driving without any headlights in Ankeny, Iowa, earlier this month. But after spotting Mr Beckwith's frisbee golf bag on the backseat, he started to question the driver about his passion for the game, before quickly moving on to the topic of marijuana. During the interrogation, he claimed all frisbee golf players smoke weed, asked Mr Beckwith how much of the substance he had on him and told him he wanted to search his car.

Given information:
- Officer Aaron King pulled over driver Scott Beckwith for driving without headlights.
- After seeing Beckwith's frisbee golf bag in the backseat, Officer King started questioning him about marijuana.

Step 1: Analyze the officer's statement and question.

Step 2: Evaluate the officer's reasoning.
