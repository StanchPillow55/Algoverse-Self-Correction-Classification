Question:
Passage: Hong Kong (CNN) -- State-run media in China has lambasted Apple Inc. for "unparalleled arrogance" over alleged complaints about customer service in China. The Wednesday opinion piece in the Chinese state-run newspaper, the People's Daily, is one of a series of attacks against the U.S. tech giant by Chinese media since a closely watched consumer affairs show aired on the Chinese state broadcaster CCTV on March 15. CCTV alleged that Apple provides inferior service to Chinese customers, such as a warranty policy that is different from other countries. "If you insist on challenging Chinese customers' love and patience, and continue to be heedless, then your business will eventually decline no matter how glamorous or successful your brand is," said the editorial, one of several articles published this week in the People's Daily critical of Apple.
