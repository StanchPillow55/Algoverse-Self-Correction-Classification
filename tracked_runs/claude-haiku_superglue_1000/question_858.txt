Sara McKenna, 27, gave birth to their son  Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna earlier this year following a three month courtship and moved from San Diego to New York to attend Columbia University. But after initially saying he wanted her to have an abortion, Miller, 35, is now fighting her for joint custody, and a judge ruled she must return to California for the battle, which forces her to give up her studies.
