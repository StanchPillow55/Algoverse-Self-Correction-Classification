Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Game 7 of the NBA Finals will be all about heart, Miami Heat superstar LeBron James said. The four-time MVP is seeking his second NBA crown when his Heat hosts the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday night. Both teams are well-prepared, he said, and they know each other well. They know what will work on offense, what to do on defense. What gives a team an edge will be each player's mental makeup. "I think it's about heart and determination at this point," he said Wednesday. James sparked the Heat to a comeback win in Game 6, hitting a key 3-pointer in the final 20 seconds of regulation.
