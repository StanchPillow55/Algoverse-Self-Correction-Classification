Question:
Passage: By Martha De Lacey PUBLISHED: 09:34 EST, 17 April 2013 | UPDATED: 11:08 EST, 17 April 2013 It was a day when old friends reunited and bitter enemies were urged to put aside their battles. But there were probably few attending Baroness Thatcher's funeral who found this request more difficult than Cherie Blair and Gordon Brown. The two have had a notoriously tricky relationship in private - and often in public - for much of the past 15 years, and their rare meetings are still fraught with tension. But when they met at St Paul's Cathedral today the pair managed to greet each other with impeccable grace, as Brown placed his hand on her arm and leaned in to kiss his arch-rival's wife on the cheek.
