Question:
Passage: So, Mauricio Pochettino’s plan was to wipe the floor with Fiorentina before next week’s second leg in Stadio Artemio Franchi. If only this European lark was so easy. Working out what to do next in the Europa League, against a team sitting fourth in Serie A, is part of Pochettino’s coaching education. Tottenham’s manager learned some valuable lessons here. It is a cardinal sin to concede at home in the first leg of European knockout football and Spurs must score in Florence now to stand any chance of progressing to the round of 16. Roberto Soldado, left, opened the scoring for Tottenham with a stunning volley to give Spurs an early lead against Fiorentina
