Question:
Passage: Captured: U.S. officials have confirmed the capture of Anas al-Libi, his family said he was captured from in front of his home by armed commandos Though they seeked to achieve two very similar objectives - the killing or capture of high-ranking terrorists, the different approaches taken in the two Saturday raids illustrate the versatility of Special Operations commandos. The Somali operation, a raid on a highly-fortified terrorist bunker on the coast south of Mogadishu, used water and darkness to its advantage – but the Tripoli, Libya raid took advantage of the natural barriers provided by cornering the target in his gated community while parking a car.
