Question:
Passage: Jasmine Johnston doesn't consider herself to be racist. The 33-year-old mother of four from Brisbane thinks it's unfair that her mother in law raises four children, and an Aboriginal woman who lives across the road with the same number of kids gets more in welfare payments. 'They're both in housing commissions, the only difference is my mother in law is white and they've got part Aboriginal in them,' she said. 'I feel like it's unfair, my mother in law was in the army when she had my husband and stuff, she's worked, so it's very hard it just seems like more things are given to [Aborigines].'
