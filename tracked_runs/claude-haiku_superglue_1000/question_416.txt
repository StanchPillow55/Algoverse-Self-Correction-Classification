Given information:
- Fuel bills have doubled to £1,250 a year since 2002.
- 5.5 million households are facing fuel poverty, where they spend 10% or more of their income on power.
- The energy watchdog, Ofgem, has ordered the "Big Six" energy suppliers (EDF, E.on, British Gas, Southern, Scottish Power, and npower) to overhaul their tariffs or face a mandatory cap.
- The query states that a company has announced a huge profit despite lower sales.

To find the company that has announced a huge profit despite lower sales, we need to look at the information provided in the passage.

Response:
To solve this problem, I will need to extract the relevant information from the passage and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- Fuel bills have doubled to £1,250 a year since 2002.
- 5.5 million households are facing fuel poverty, where they spend 10% or more of their income on power.
- EDF's profits have risen to £1.6 billion.
- British Gas's profits are expected to be around £550 million.

Step 1: Calculate the total fuel bill for the 5.5 million households facing fuel poverty.
Total fuel bill for 5.5 million households = 5.5 million × £1,250 = £6,875,000,000

Step 2: Calculate the total income of the 5.5 million households facing fuel poverty.
Since they are spending 10% or more of their income on power, their total income can be calculated as:
Total income = Total fuel bill / 0.10
Total income = £6,875,000,000 / 0.10 = £68,750,000,000

Step 3: Calculate the
