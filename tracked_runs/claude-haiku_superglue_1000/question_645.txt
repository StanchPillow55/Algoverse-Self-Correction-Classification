Question:
Passage: England physio Gary Lewin is to return home from the World Cup after suffering a fracture and dislocation of his ankle by standing on a water bottle while celebrating Daniel Sturridge's equaliser. The Three Lions' leveller in the first half of their 2-1 loss to Italy came just moments after Claudio Marchisio had given the Azzurri the lead in their Group D encounter in Manaus. Sturridge celebrated his close-range strike in his normal style, performing his trademark dance, while Lewin jumped off the bench and injured himself in the process.
