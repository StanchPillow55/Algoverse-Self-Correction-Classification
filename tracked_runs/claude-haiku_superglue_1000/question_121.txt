Response:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and make reasonable assumptions to determine the impact of Ukraine's decision to reject the EU trade deal.

Given information:
- Ukraine's trade is split more or less equally between Russia and the EU.
- Ukraine rejected the EU trade deal due to concerns about losing trade with Russia.

Assumptions:
1. We will assume that Ukraine's trade with Russia and the EU is approximately 50% each.
2. We will assume that if Ukraine had signed the EU trade deal, it would have resulted in a significant increase in trade with the EU, potentially doubling or tripling the trade volume.
3. We will assume that rejecting the EU trade deal would lead to a significant decrease in trade with the EU, potentially by 50% or more.

Reasoning and Calculations:
1. Let's assume Ukraine's total trade volume is 100 units, with 50 units going to Russia and 50 units going to the EU.
2. If Ukraine had signed the EU trade deal, the trade volume with the EU could have increased to 100 units or more, while the trade with Russia would have remained at 50 units.
3.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the context provided in the passage and then use the given information to calculate the approximate trade split between Russia and the EU for Ukraine.

Given information:
- Ukraine rejected a trade agreement with the EU, opting to appease Russia instead.
- The Ukrainian prime minister stated that the EU could not offer Ukraine any compensation if the country lost trade with Russia.

Reasoning:
1. The passage suggests that Ukraine's trade is split more or less equally between Russia and the EU.
2. If Ukraine rejected the EU trade deal to appease Russia, it implies that Ukraine's trade with Russia is significant and important to its economy.
3. The prime minister's statement about the EU not being able to compensate for lost trade with Russia further supports the idea that Ukraine's trade with Russia is substantial.

Calculation:
Based on the information provided, we can assume that Ukraine's trade is split approximately 50% with Russia and 50% with the EU.

Final answer:
Ukraine's trade is split more or less equally, with approximately 50% of its trade going to Russia and 50% going to the EU.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and make calculations based on the provided details.

Given information:
- Ukraine's trade is split more or less equally between Russia and the EU.

Step 1: Assume that Ukraine's total trade is 100 units.
Since the trade is split more or less equally between Russia and the EU, we can divide the total trade into two equal parts:
Trade with Russia = 50 units
Trade with the EU = 50 units

Step 2: Analyze the impact of rejecting the EU trade deal.
If Ukraine rejects the EU trade deal, it will lose its trade with the EU, which is 50 units.

Step 3: Determine the impact on Ukraine's overall trade.
Total trade before rejecting the EU deal = 100 units
Total trade after rejecting the EU deal = Trade with Russia (50 units) + Trade with the EU (0 units) = 50 units

Step 4: Calculate the percentage change in Ukraine's total trade.
Percentage change in total trade = (New total trade - Original total trade) / Original total trade × 100
Percentage change in total
