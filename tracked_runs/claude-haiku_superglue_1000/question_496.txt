Question:
Passage: Windsor, England (CNN) -- The choice of Westminster Abbey as location for the most eagerly awaited royal wedding in 30 years has taken most royal experts by surprise; their consensus of opinion over the past week suggested that St. Paul's would oversee the marriage of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. But on reflection, the abbey is the most obvious and perfect venue. By choosing it, William is showing an astute awareness of his royal status and ultimate destiny as king of England. As a modern royal couple in a modern royal family, William and Kate will start their married life in the most ancient of royal buildings, stepping into the future with one foot firmly in the past and an obliging nod to those kings and queens buried there.
