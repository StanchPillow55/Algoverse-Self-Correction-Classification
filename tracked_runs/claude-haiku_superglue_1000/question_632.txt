Question:
Passage: Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli airstrikes pounded targets in Gaza, killing scores of people Wednesday as dozens of militant rockets streaked into Israel. The continued Hamas barrage prompted Israel's Prime Minister to step up the offensive against the militant group. "The operation will be expanded and will continue until the firing at our communities stops and quiet is restored," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. He did not detail what the expansion would entail but said Israel's military "is prepared for all possibilities." President Shimon Peres, whose role is largely ceremonial and is not involved in setting policy, said in an exclusive interview with CNN's Becky Anderson that he believed a ground offensive "may happen quite soon" unless Hamas stops firing rockets at Israel.
