Question:
Passage: Loretta Lynch won approval from a key Senate committee Thursday to serve as the nation's next attorney general, as divided Republicans clashed over her support for President Barack Obama's immigration policies. The 12 to 8 vote in the Judiciary Committee sent Lynch's nomination to the full Senate. Lynch is a career prosecutor who is currently the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn. Three Republicans – Orrin Hatch of Utah, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina – joined all none committee Democrats in voting 'yes.' Attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday but her fate in the full Senate could be a squeaker
@highlight
Loretta Lynch passed her first test by a 12-8 vote, with three of 11 Republicans joining all nine Democrats on the panel
@highlight
New rules require only a simple majority vote of 51 on presidential nominees, so she could be confirmed quickly
@highlight
Lynch, a New York City federal prosecutor, would replace outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder
@highlight
Vote will not be overwhelming because Lynch supports Obama administration 'amnesty' on immigration

Query: But she appears unlikely to win confirmation resoundingly, as Thursday's debate demonstrated that many Republicans will oppose her over Obama's executive actions granting work permits and deportation stays for millions of immigrants in the @placeholder illegally.
