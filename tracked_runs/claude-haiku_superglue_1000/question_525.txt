Question:
Passage: A fundraising page started to support the grieving family of a Gold Coast man who died protecting his wife and children during a lightning storm has raised $26,000 overnight, as strangers and friends alike pay tribute to the 'devoted' father of two. Kane Bennett, 39, was killed on Saturday after he, along with his wife Mary Mourgelas, their 22-month-old son Max and 12-week-old daughter Bella, were all hit by lightning during an electrical storm in Worongary. The family had taken shelter in a gazebo after voting in the Queensland election when the lightning struck, killing Mr Bennett, who took the impact of the blow to protect his two young children and partner of 19 years.
