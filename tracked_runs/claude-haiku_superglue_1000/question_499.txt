Question:
Passage: Britain's Ebola screening plans remained in chaos yesterday as airports said they had been given no instructions. After days of Government indecision over whether to screen airline passengers to halt the spread of the deadly virus, Downing Street was yesterday still unable to say when the process would start or where it would find the medics to oversee it. With the incubation period for the disease as long as 21 days, it was feared the delay in introducing measures could mean the deadly virus is already in the UK.
