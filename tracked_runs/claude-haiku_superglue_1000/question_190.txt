Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- He might be fighting it out with Lionel Messi for the title of the world's top soccer player, but Cristiano Ronaldo is in a league of his very own when it comes to social media followers. Tuesday saw the Portuguese superstar top 100 million "fans" on Facebook -- way ahead of the nearest sporting opposition. He is adding fans at the rate of nearly one every second, 54 per minute on average. The next best tally is not an individual but a club, FC Barcelona, which has over 76 million 'likes' -- just edging ahead of Ronaldo's own team, European champion Real Madrid.
