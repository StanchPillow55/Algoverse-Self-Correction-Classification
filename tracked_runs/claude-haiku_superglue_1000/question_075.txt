Question:
Passage: These bizarre forms look as if they were delicately sculpted by hand - but in fact, they are the work of blustery winds across the Midwest. 'Snow rollers' have started sweeping into yards and fields throughout Ohio, Illinois and Pennsylvania thanks to the right balance of light snow, firm winds and cold temperatures. The strange sculptures have since become a hit on Twitter and Facebook as residents across the country have shared photographs of the wispy forms and the fields where they've found them. They are usually not tightly-packed enough to be picked up, but some images on Twitter show people have succeeded in taking them inside, in a bid to preserve their shapes.
