Question:
Passage: Even after Boomer Esiason apologized for what he called his "insensitive" comment about scheduling a C-section before the season started, his suggestion plus critical stances by other radio hosts demonstrate how much paternity leave is still not widely accepted in our society. In conversations with men across the country, it's clear that while most join many women in expressing outrage at the view that a Major League Baseball game should come before the birth of a child, there were men who felt the player should have gotten back to his job as quickly as possible. By now, you probably know the particulars: the New York Mets' Daniel Murphy missed the first two games of the season to attend his son's birth. He didn't do anything he wasn't allowed to do. Major League Baseball permits a player to take up to three days off for paternity leave.
