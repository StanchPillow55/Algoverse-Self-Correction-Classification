Question:
Passage: Beheira Province, Egypt (CNN) -- Amre Moussa sweeps through chaotic crowds in Egypt's Beheira province, hailed in the pandemonium by his supporters as "ar-rayis," the president. In the nation's first democratic presidential election, Moussa is one of a few candidates who can boast of any practical government experience. He served as foreign minister under Hosni Mubarak and headed the Arab League. Now, he's one of the top contenders in the voting to be held Wednesday and Thursday. Experience, however, can be a thorn in a nation where 18 days of fervent, anti-government uprising last year toppled Mubarak's decades-long dictatorship. Moussa, 75, is intent on turning that liability into gain.
