Question:
Passage: Furious Swansea boss Garry Monk accused Stoke winger Victor Moses and referee Michael Oliver of cheating his team after a controversial penalty decision at the Britannia Stadium on Sunday. Monk, who now faces an FA disciplinary charge, called for Moses to be punished for diving. The Swansea boss added that if he had ‘dived’ in that manner he would have been too ashamed to face his own family. But when Moses tumbled in the penalty area shortly before the break Oliver was convinced and awarded his second spot-kick of the match. The 29-year-old Northumberland official had earlier upset Stoke by penalising Ryan Shawcross for impeding Wilfried Bony at a corner, and the debate completely overshadowed Jonathan Walters’ 76th-minute winner.
