Question:
Passage: Jerusalem (CNN) -- Indirect talks between Palestinians and Israelis, aimed at ending the hostilities in Gaza, have resumed in Cairo, Egyptian state-run EgyNews reported Monday. The talks are taking place amid a three-day cease-fire brokered by Egypt. Israel wants Hamas, the militant Islamic group that runs Gaza, to disarm as part of a demilitarization of the territory. The Palestinian delegation's demands include the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza; a commitment to the 2012 memorandum of understanding, which called for an end to Israel's blockade on Gaza; an extension of fishing rights off the coast; and the reopening of air and seaports.
