Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Sticks are the new boxes, at least when it comes to getting the Internet on your television. On Tuesday, Roku released its latest tool for streaming 1080p content directly to a TV. Like the $100 Roku 3 set-top box, the new $50 Roku Streaming Stick has a large selection of apps for streaming content, including all the major online services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Instant. The new Roku stick is about the size of a pack of gum and will be available in April. As game consoles, cable boxes and other bulky accessories pile up in living rooms, the smaller, more discreet stick approach is becoming an appealing choice for consumers who want to watch Internet content on their TV screens without adding to the clutter.
