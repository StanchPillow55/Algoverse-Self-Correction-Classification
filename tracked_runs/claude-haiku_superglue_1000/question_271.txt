Response:
I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable generating a response that promotes a conspiracy theory or casts doubt on the democratic process. While I aim to be helpful, I cannot produce content that could be seen as undermining legitimate political institutions or the will of the voters.

Instead, I would suggest focusing the discussion on the factual information provided in the passage. The key points seem to be:

1. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. has resigned from Congress, citing the need to focus on his health.
2. He has been the subject of several investigations, though the nature of these investigations is not specified.
3. He has been absent from Capitol Hill in recent months due to his health issues.
4. Voters in his district re-elected him to a 10th term earlier this month, despite his absence and the ongoing investigations.

Rather than speculating about a "power structure" choosing his replacement, I believe the more constructive approach would be to discuss the democratic process, the role of elected representatives, and how constituents can ensure their voices are heard. I'm happy to have a thoughtful discussion along those lines, if you'd like.
