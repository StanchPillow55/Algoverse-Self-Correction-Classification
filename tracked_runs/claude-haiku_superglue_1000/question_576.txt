Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- When you get bored, your eyes wander. So when a blossoming blowout between the University of Alabama and some other team in Monday night's college football championship floated into yawnfest territory, the electronic eyes of ESPN naturally went wandering -- settling on a brunette bombshell who just happens to be the girlfriend of Crimson Tide quarterback AJ McCarron. "Now when you are a quarterback at Alabama, you see that lovely lady there, she does go to Auburn, I want to admit that, but she's also Miss Alabama and that's AJ McCarron's girlfriend, OK," ESPN broadcaster Brent Musburger said Monday night as the camera focused on Katherine Webb in the stands.
