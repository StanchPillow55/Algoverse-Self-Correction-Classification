Question:
Passage: Melbourne, Australia (CNN) -- Dominika Cibulkova is proving that, at the Australian Open anyway, size doesn't matter. Cibulkova thumped Agnieszka Radwanska in the women's semifinals Thursday to move one match away from becoming the joint shortest grand slam singles winner in the Open Era. The 5-foot-3-inch Cibulkova needed a mere one hour, 10 minutes to dispose of the world No. 5, winning 6-1 6-2 to set up an encounter Saturday against now three-time Australian Open finalist Li Na. Li, the ouster of Canadian upstart Eugenie Bouchard 6-2 6-4, hasn't lost to Cibulkova in their four outings but the 20th seed will be buoyed by victories over former Wimbledon finalist Radwanska and four-time grand slam champion Maria Sharapova this fortnight.

Given information:
- The passage discusses Dominika Cibulkova's victory over Agnieszka Radwanska in the women's semifinals of the Australian Open.
