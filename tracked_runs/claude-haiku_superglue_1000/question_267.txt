Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Russia will not cede control of the Crimea any time soon. Western saber-rattling would prove hollow: NATO has insufficient forces in the region to challenge Russian control and economic sanctions are not likely to work. Paranoia about Western threats to its security incline Russians to endure great costs to assert the "sphere of privileged interest" Vladimir Putin claims regarding former Soviet Republics now outside the Russian Federation. Near term, Russia holds the cards. It supplies Europe with about 30% of its natural gas, or 8% of its energy overall. While that gas can be replaced, Europe can't change course overnight.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the information provided in the passage.

The passage discusses Russia's control over the Crimea region and its leverage over Europe's energy supply. It states that Russia supplies about 30% of Europe's natural gas, which is 8% of Europe's overall energy.

The query mentions that Russian oil producers are burning off huge amounts of gas they can't sell. This suggests that Russia has an excess of natural gas that it is unable to sell or utilize effectively.

To solve this problem, we need to find the placeholder value that represents the location where Russian oil producers are burning off the excess natural gas.

Given information:
- Russia supplies about 30% of Europe's natural gas, which is 8% of Europe's overall energy.
- Russian oil producers are burning off huge amounts of gas they can't sell in @placeholder.

Step 1: Determine the location represented by the @placeholder.
Based on the context provided in the passage, the most likely location where Russian oil producers are burning off excess natural gas is in Russia itself, as they are unable to sell it elsewhere.

Therefore, the @placeholder represents Russia.
