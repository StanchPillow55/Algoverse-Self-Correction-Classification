Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- While all about him were losing their heads, Roger Federer kept his cool. In a week when grand slam champions have been falling like flies at the Australian Open, the old master survived a fourth-set fightback to defeat world No. 4 Andy Murray 6-3 6-4 6-7 (6-8) 6-3. Federer's win means he advances to the last four in Melbourne for the 11th year in a row, with his archrival Rafael Nadal standing between him and a sixth final. Top seed Nadal had beaten Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov earlier on Wednesday to continue his bid for a 14th grand slam title.
