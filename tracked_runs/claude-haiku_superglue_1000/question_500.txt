Question:
Passage: By Graham Poll There was nothing surprising or unexpected in watching Alan Pardew explode with rage at St James’ Park this weekend. The Newcastle United manager has two distinct sides to his character: a sort of Jekyll and Hyde. The one seen away from the heat of battle is a smiling, charming, innocent ‘cheeky chap’ who is ‘doing ever so well’ on limited resources at Newcastle. The other will do whatever is needed to try to wring out any advantage for his team. As we have seen, he is also prone to combustible behaviour — and he seems to think that whatever is said or insinuated when under pressure can be forgiven and forgotten with an apology.
