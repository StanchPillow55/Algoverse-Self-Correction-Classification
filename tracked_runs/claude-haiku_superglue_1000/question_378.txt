Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Charges against a man accused of killing an alleged Whitey Bulger extortion victim have been upgraded to murder, according to a press release from the Middlesex, Massachusetts, District Attorney's Office. A grand jury indicted William Camuti, 69, in the death of Stephen Rakes, 59, on Friday, according to the press release. The Massachusetts Medical Examiner's Office determined in October the cause of Rakes' death was acute cyanide poisoning, according to MaryBeth Long, a spokeswoman for the Middlesex District Attorney's Office. Camuti previously confessed to putting potassium cyanide in an iced coffee that he provided to Rakes, according to testimony by Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Banks at a hearing in Concord District Court on September 10.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the passage and the given query to determine the appropriate response.

Given information:
- William Camuti is accused of killing Stephen Rakes by putting potassium cyanide in an iced coffee that he provided to Rakes.
- The query states that the person (presumably Rakes) took a sip and decided the coffee tasted too bitter.

Reasoning:
1. The passage indicates that Camuti confessed to putting potassium cyanide in the iced coffee he provided to Rakes.
2. Potassium cyanide is an extremely toxic substance that can cause acute poisoning and death if ingested.
3. The query suggests that the person (Rakes) took a sip of the coffee and found it to be too bitter.
4. The bitterness of the coffee is likely due to the presence of the potassium cyanide, which has a distinctly bitter taste.
5. The fact that Rakes found the coffee to be too bitter suggests that he recognized the unusual taste and did not consume the entire drink, potentially saving his life.
