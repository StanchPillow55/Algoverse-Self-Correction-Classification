Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Passengers from a United Airlines 787 Dreamliner that made an unscheduled landing in Seattle were expected to resume their journey to Japan on Wednesday morning. Flight 139 from Denver to Tokyo was diverted to Seattle on Tuesday afternoon "due to an indication of a problem with an oil filter," United said in a statement to CNN. The aircraft landed normally, said spokeswoman Mary Ryan. The plane's 210 passengers were asked to stay overnight in Seattle. Coverage from CNN affiliate KIRO The incident comes five months after the FAA and other officials grounded the Dreamliner worldwide due to troubles with its battery system. In April, the FAA ordered all 787 operators to make specific modifications and United has been flying its fleet of six 787s since May 20.
