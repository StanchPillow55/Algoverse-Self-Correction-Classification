Passage: Ukip is planning to fight for 100 seats at the next election, with a third of voters saying they are prepared to back Nigel Farage. Paul Sykes, the party’s biggest donor, revealed he is ready to write a cheque for £1.5million to bankroll the ambitious push. As Tory divisions deepen over how to respond to the Eurosceptic threat, a new poll put Ukip on 18 per cent, with one in three people willing to back the party if they thought they could win in their local area. Almost a third of people say they would be willing to support Ukip if they thought Mr Farage's party could win in the constituency where they live
