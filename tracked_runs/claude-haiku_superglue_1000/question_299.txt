Passage: By Helen Pow The real Wolf of Wall Street has admitted he lost his soul 'as much as a person can and still be walking around' in the midst of his wheeling and dealing and debauched life of 90's excess. Jordan Belfort, who is played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the Oscar-nominated film, described in a Monday night interview the moment he learned he was selling a scam, cheating innocent people out of millions of dollars of savings. 'It was about a month in when I realized. That was the first moment where I allowed greed to get the better of me,' he told Piers Morgan Live.
