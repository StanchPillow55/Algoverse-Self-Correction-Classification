Question:
Paragraph: Our sun and other stars release light energy. At least this is what we see. Our Sun and stars also emit more than just light. Scientists call the type of energy that our Sun and stars release electromagnetic energy. This form of energy travels through space. Electromagnetic energy includes the light we see. It also includes much more. Many of these things we know about, but dont always think about. Electromagnetic energy includes radio waves, microwaves, and X rays. We now have devices in our homes and offices that release these same forms of energy. We use electromagnetic energy to make our lives better. 

Question: What are the four forms of energy that are electromagnetic?

Answer: Light energy,radio waves, microwaves, and X rays

Response:
To solve this problem, I will go through the given paragraph and identify the four forms of electromagnetic energy mentioned.

Given information:
- Our sun and other stars release light energy.
- Scientists call the type of energy that our Sun and stars release electromagnetic energy.
- Electromagnetic energy includes the light we see.
- Electromagnetic energy also includes radio waves, microwaves, and X-rays.

Step 1: Identify the four forms of electromagnetic energy mentioned in the paragraph.
The four forms of electromagnetic energy mentioned in the paragraph are:
1. Light energy
2. Radio waves
3. Microwaves
4. X-rays

Step 2: Explain the reasoning behind the answer.
The paragraph clearly states that electromagnetic energy includes the light we see, as well as radio waves, microwaves, and X-rays. These four forms of energy are explicitly mentioned as being part of the electromagnetic energy spectrum.

Final answer:
The four forms of electromagnetic energy are:
1. Light energy
2. Radio waves
3. Microwaves
4. X-rays
