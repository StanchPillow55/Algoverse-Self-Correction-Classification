Question:
Paragraph: You couldnt survive without your skin. It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air. 

Question: Does the skin have any control over body temperature and if so in how many ways does it?

Answer: Yes it controls body temperature by sweat and sweat gland to cool the body

Response:
To answer this question, we need to analyze the information provided in the paragraph and identify the ways in which the skin controls body temperature.

The paragraph states that the skin has two main ways of controlling body temperature:

1. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body.
2. Blood vessels in the skin dilate (widen) or constrict (narrow) to regulate heat loss and retention.

Let's break down each of these mechanisms:

1. Sweat and Sweat Glands:
   - The paragraph states that the skin has sweat glands that produce sweat.
   - When the body needs to cool down, the sweat glands secrete sweat onto the skin's surface.
   - As the sweat evaporates from the skin, it removes heat from the body, effectively cooling it down.

2. Blood Vessel Dilation and Constriction:
   - The paragraph explains that blood vessels in the skin can dilate (widen) or constrict (narrow) to regulate heat loss and retention.
   - When the body needs to cool down, the blood vessels in the skin dilate,
