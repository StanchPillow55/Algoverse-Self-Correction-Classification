Question:
Paragraph: The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to extract the relevant information from the given paragraph and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c.
- Around 3000 b.c., native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture.

To find the approximate year when native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture, we need to convert the given dates from "b.c." (Before Christ) to a more standard year format.

Step 1: Convert 23,000 b.c. to a standard year.
23,000 b.c. = 23,000 years before the year 0 (the birth of Christ)
Therefore, 23,000 b.c. = 23,000 years ago from the present day.

Step 2: Convert 3000 b.c. to a standard year.
3000 b.c. = 3000 years before the year 0 (the birth of Christ)
Therefore, 3000 b.c. = 3000 years ago

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the approximate time when native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture in the Las Vegas Valley.

Given information:
- The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c.
- Around 3000 b.c., native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture.

Reasoning:
1. The passage states that the native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture "around 3000 b.c.".
2. This means that the native Archaic Indians started developing their culture approximately 3000 years before the present (b.c.).

Therefore, the approximate time when native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture is 3000 b.c.

Final answer: 3000 b.c.

To solve this problem, we need to extract the relevant information from the given paragraph and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c.
- Around 3000 b.c., native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture.

To find the approximate time when native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture, we need to convert the given dates from b.c. to a.d.

Step 1: Convert 23,000 b.c. to a.d.
23,000 b.c. = 23,000 years before the current era (a.d.)
Current era (a.d.) = 2023
23,000 b.c. = 23,000 + 2023 = 25,023 years ago

Step 2: Convert 3000 b.c. to a.d.
3000 b.c. = 3000 years before the current era (a.d.)
Current era (a.d.) = 2023
3000
