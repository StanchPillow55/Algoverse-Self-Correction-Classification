Question:
Passage: A dozen of the United States Air Force’s most feared attack aircraft are to be deployed in the battle against ISIS. Twelve A-10 ‘Warthogs’ are being moved from Afghanistan to Kuwait to carry out patrols against the Islamic State militants who have taken swathes of Iraqi and Syrian territory. The new deployment will boost the USAF’s ability to patrol the skies and take out ISIS targets. Deadly force: A line up of A-10s at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina. Planes of this type will arrive in Kuwait for combat operations next week Slow and steady: An unarmed A-10 shows the maneuverability which makes it a deadly foe to ground forces. It can fly steadily at slow speed at just 50 feet above enemy positions and is heavily armored against gunfire
@highlight
A dozen A-10s are being moved from Afghanistan to Kuwait by next week to start patrols over Iraq and Syria
@highlight
Fearsome planes can approach targets low and slow and are protected against small arms fire and RPGs - ISIS's favored weapons
@highlight
More drones armed with missiles will patrol the skies within weeks as war on the Islamic State is stepped up
@highlight
Deployment comes after 200 commanders held talks on defeating ISIS, which is half-army, half-insurgency

Query: Slow-moving and equipped with a devastating 30mm cannon capable of firing almost 4,000 rounds a minute - as well as missiles and 500lb bombs -  they can fly as low as 50ft and engage targets far more slowly than the bombers and fighter-bombers which have so far been deployed in @placeholder and Syria.
