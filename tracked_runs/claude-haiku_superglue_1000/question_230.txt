Question:
Passage: Barman Robbie Dale served a first-half double for non-league Blyth Spartans but their FA Cup of cheer ran dry as Birmingham’s Wesley Thomas called time on their remarkable run. The 30-year-old Spartans skipper will be opening up The Blacksmiths Arms in Newcastle on Sunday morning as he returns to the day job he chose over a career as a professional footballer. On this evidence, Dale would not be out of place in the Championship. There were certainly no half measures during a pulsating opening period in which Blyth – of the seventh-tier Northern Premier League and playing their seventh match in this season’s competition – took a deserved two-goal lead thanks to the devastating Dale in front of a sold out Croft Park.
@highlight
Robbie Dale opened the scoring for Blyth Spartans in the 35th minute against Birmingham City
@highlight
The forward doubled the lead for non-League club Blyth in the 41st minute
@highlight
Birmingham hit back after going in 2-0 down at half time with Lee Novak getting the first to make it 2-1
@highlight
Wes Thomas then scored twice in the 55th and 58th minute to put Birmingham 3-2 up

Query: Without that stop @placeholder’s confidence would have been irreversibly sapped.
