Question:
Passage: Five penalties from Tim Swiel saved Harlequins from a surprise home defeat at the Stoop as they edged strugglers Newcastle Falcons 15-7. For three-quarters of the match, Newcastle were easily the better side but they failed to take their chances and only had a solitary try from Alex Tuilagi, which was converted by Juan Pablo Socino. Tuilagi and fellow wing, Sinoti Sinoti, had caused the home defence huge problems but ill-discipline and careless errors cost Falcons the match. Five penalties from Tim Swiel saved Harlequins from a surprise home defeat by Newcastle at the Stoop Harlequins fielded a much weakened line-up with Chris Robshaw, Nick Evans and Luke Wallace all absent through injury. Joe Marler and Nick Easter were also rested, while Danny Care started on the bench. Fly-half Swiel, and number eight James Chisholm both made their first Premiership starts.
