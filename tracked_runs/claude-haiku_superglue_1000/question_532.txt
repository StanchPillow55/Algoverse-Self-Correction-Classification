Question:
Passage: A French politician has reacted furiously to the German Chancellor's accusations that France and Italy have not done enough to trim their budgets. Angela Merkel's calls for the countries to make further cuts was met negatively by Jean-Luc Melenchon, who tweeted in German: 'Shut your trap, Miss Merkel! France is free!' The former Presidential candidate added she should concern herself more with the poor people in her country, and its 'ruined equipment'. Mr Melenchon's reaction mirrored that of his President, Francois Hollande, as he tries to claw back support from left-wing voters.
