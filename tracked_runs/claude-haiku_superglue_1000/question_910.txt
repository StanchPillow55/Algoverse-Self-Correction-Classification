Question:
Passage: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal authorities are looking for a Delta Air Lines passenger who they say caused an uproar aboard a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on Tuesday. According to a criminal complaint, Jared Layne Hansen faces charges of interfering with a flight crew, making false statements about having weapons and saying the plane was being hijacked, and assaulting federal air marshals. An arrest warrant was issued. Hansen, 31, from Salt Lake City, Utah, was sitting in seat 10B of the main cabin of Delta Flight 235. The trouble began, according to an affidavit filed by air marshal Dennis Scott, when Hansen tried to go into the front section of the cabin, which is restricted to business class passengers for security reasons.
