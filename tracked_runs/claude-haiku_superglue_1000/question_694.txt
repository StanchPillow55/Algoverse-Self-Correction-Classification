Question:
Passage: (CNN)You can't escape Disney's phenomenon "Frozen." It is the highest-grossing animated film of all time and one of Disney's top franchises. It was the most downloaded movie from Apple last year, and kids everywhere are still singing the movie's anthem, "Let It Go." Heck, it's now probably stuck in your own head right now, even if you have never seen the film. So why has the 2013 movie stuck around for so long for the under-5 set? Experts say it is not just because you can find images of movie's sisters on everything. Elsa and Anna are on dresses, on scooters and, just in time for the Easter season, even on jelly beans.
