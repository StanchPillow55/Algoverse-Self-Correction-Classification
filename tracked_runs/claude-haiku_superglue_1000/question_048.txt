Question:
Passage: As I was speaking to a meeting of 200 small businesses in Southampton last week, I was asked a question that is increasingly on my own mind. 'With the economy suddenly looking so rosy,' said one employer, 'how come David Cameron and the Tories are not on for a convincing victory at the next General Election?' Twenty-four hours earlier, the same query was put by a member of the audience during BBC1's Question Time. It's a fascinating subject. Because there is no denying that in recent weeks, the economic news has been good. Lord Digby Jones, former trade minister under Labour, claims Ed Miliband and Ed Balls were wrong on the economy
