Question:
Passage: By Sean Gallagher Mike Tyson has defended Luis Suarez for his bite on Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini by claiming it was just 'the heat of the moment'. Suarez has received worldwide criticism for the bite but former world heavyweight champion Tyson has shown his support for the Liverpool forward. Tyson was involved in perhaps the most famous biting incident in sporting history when he took a chomp out of Evander Holyfield's right ear in a Las Vegas world title bout in 1997. And in a Q & A with social media site Reddit he showed his support for the Uruguayan after he was handed a four-month ban by FIFA and a nine-game international suspension over the incident in the World Cup clash last month.

Response:
I do not have enough information to solve this problem as a math problem. The passage provided is about a sports-related incident involving biting, and does not contain any numerical data or mathematical elements that I can use to perform calculations. 

Without specific numerical values or a clear mathematical question, I cannot provide a step-by-step solution. This appears to be more of a qualitative comparison between the biting incidents of Luis Suarez and Mike Tyson, rather than a quantitative math problem.

To address this query, I would need more details about the specific aspects you want me to compare, such as the severity of the bites, the consequences faced by the players, the public reactions, etc. With that additional context, I could attempt to analyze and compare the two incidents in a more meaningful way. But as a math problem solver, I do not have enough information to work through this particular problem. Please let me know if you can provide more specific details that I can use to approach this as a math-based question.
