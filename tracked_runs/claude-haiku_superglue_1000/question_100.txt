Question:
Passage: Melbourne-born Fiona Graham lives a life starkly different to any Australian- working in one of Japan's largest cities as the first Caucasian geisha in the notoriously secretive profession in almost 400 years. Ms Graham, who holds a PhD in Social Anthropology from Oxford, formally debuted as a geisha in 2007 after a life-long fascination with Japanese culture and a lengthy training period. Working under the name 'Sayuki', which means 'transparent happiness', she was first introduced to Japan on a school trip when she was just 15, and was so taken with the country that she moved to continue her schooling at a Japanese High School.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of geishas in Japan based on the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- The number of geishas in Japan has shrunk from 80,000 in 1920 to 2,000 currently.

Step 1: Calculate the decrease in the number of geishas from 1920 to the present.
Decrease in the number of geishas = 80,000 - 2,000 = 78,000

Step 2: Calculate the percentage decrease in the number of geishas.
Percentage decrease = (Decrease in the number of geishas / Original number of geishas) × 100
Percentage decrease = (78,000 / 80,000) × 100 = 97.5%

Therefore, the number of geishas in Japan has decreased by 97.5% from 80,000 in 1920 to 2,000 currently.

Final answer: The number of geishas in Japan has decreased by 97.5% from 80,000 in 1920 to 2,000
