Question:
Passage: For someone comfortable to let the spotlight shine on others, James Milner is probably in two minds about being regarded as the new must-have accessory for all the Premier League's top clubs. But he can't avoid the truth any longer. Having just celebrated his 29th birthday with two FA Cup goals against Sheffield Wednesday at the weekend, Milner's stock has never been higher. He is one of the stars of the season. Manchester City, with all their injury problems and squad restrictions, couldn't have done without him this season. Rivals like Arsenal and Liverpool covet him. And as his contract at the Etihad runs into the final six months, Milner's bargaining position has never been stronger.
