Question:
Passage: By Neil Ashton Follow @@neilashton_ In the weeks to come, it would be something special if it was Germany's turn to drool over Roy Hodgson's audacious decision to take the kids to a World Cup. Back in 2010, when Germany humbled England 4-1 in the second round, it felt like a young man's tournament. Three of Joachim Low's forwards - Sami Khedira (23), Mesut Ozil (21) and Thomas Muller (20) - danced around Matthew Upson and John Terry at the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein. Aged 20, Toni Kroos, now regarded as one of the best midfielders in the game, was on the substitutes' bench. Manuel Neuer (24), Philipp Lahm (26), Jerome Boateng (21), Per Mertesacker (25) taught England a lesson in possession.
