Question:
Paragraph:  Paul put the despised watch away And laid out before him his array Of stones and metals, and when the morning Struck the stones to their best adorning, He chose the brightest, and this new watch Was so light and thin it seemed to catch The sunlight's nothingness, and its gleam.  Topazes ran in a foamy stream Over the cover, the hands were studded With garnets, and seemed red roses, budded.  The face was of crystal, and engraved Upon it the figures flashed and waved With zircons, and beryls, and amethysts.  It took a week to make, and his trysts At night with the Shadow were his alone.  Paul swore not to speak till his task was done.  The night that the jewel was worthy to give.  Paul watched the long hours of daylight live To the faintest streak; then lit his light, And sharp against the wall's pure white The outline of the Shadow started Into form.  His burning-hearted Words so long imprisoned swelled To tumbling speech.  Like one compelled, He told the lady all his love, And holding out the watch above His head, he knelt, imploring some Littlest sign.  The Shadow was dumb.
