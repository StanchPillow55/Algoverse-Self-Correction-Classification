Question:
Passage: Germany was plunged into darkness last night as the authorities switched off the lights at some of the country's most famous landmarks in a mark of disapproval at protests against the so-called 'Islamisation of Europe'. Protesters from the mounting right-wing group the Patriotic Europeans Against Islamisation of the West marched through the streets of several German cities in the latest round of demonstrations against what they say is the growing influence of Islam on the country. But campaigners in Cologne, Berlin and Dresden were met with darkness as opponents staged a silent coordinated campaign to switch off the power at a number of buildings.
