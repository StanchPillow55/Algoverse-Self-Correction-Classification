Question:
Passage: Everton and England defender Phil Jagielka talks to Sportsmail about everything from his sporting heroes and career highlight to who would play him in a movie about his life. WHO IS YOUR SPORTING HERO? My brother, Stephen. You always want to do what your big brother does. He started out with Manchester City and had spells at Shrewsbury and Accrington. Stephen  encouraged me to chase my dream and became my idol. WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN IF YOU WERE NOT A SPORTSMAN? I think I’d have always been in sports. If I hadn’t been a footballer, I’d have wanted to be a golfer. In reality, I’d probably be a PE teacher. I couldn’t work in an office. That would send me stir crazy.
