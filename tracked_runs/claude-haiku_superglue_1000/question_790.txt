Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Two people were killed when unusually large and powerful waves crashed into a cruise ship in the Mediterranean Sea this week. Here CNN Senior Meteorologist Brandon Miller explains the science behind the deadly squall that hit the Louis Majesty as it traveled from Barcelona, Spain to Genoa, Italy. What caused the wave that hit the cruise ship? There was a strong storm moving through the Mediterranean which brought winds gusting well over 100 kph. Winds of this magnitude will result in a very rough sea state and large waves. Buoys nearby recorded significant wave heights (defined as the average of the largest 1/3 of waves over a 20 minute period) over 6 meters. The waves which hit the ship were reported to be between 8-9 meters. This would not be considered a "rogue" wave, as rogue waves must have a height at least double the significant wave height, but it is nevertheless abnormally high. Several factors can contribute to an increase in the size of the wave, including wind direction, ocean current direction, and shape and depth of the sea floor.
@highlight
Powerful storm waves uncommon in the Mediterranean
@highlight
Wind, ocean current, and shape and depth of sea floor can contribute
@highlight
Storm waves not connected to recent tsunamis caused by Chile quake

Query: They were in no way related to the @placeholder earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
