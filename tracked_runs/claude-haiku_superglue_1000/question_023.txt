Question:
Passage: For most of the year it is a quaint seaside town, but the picturesque port of Whitby in Yorkshire took on an altogether more sinister air this weekend as thousands of Goths, steampunks, and fans of the macabre descended for a twice-yearly celebration of gothic culture, and all things that go bump in the night. Fans travelled from across the globe to attend the famous Whitby Goth Weekend, donning their spookiest finery for the five-day extravaganza promising music, dance and shopping.
