Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The divorce of golfer Tiger Woods and wife Elin Nordegren was finalized Monday, according to a joint statement issued by their attorneys. The marriage's end comes nine months after allegations surfaced that Woods carried on several extramarital affairs.

"While we are no longer married, we are the parents of two wonderful children and their happiness has been, and will always be, of paramount importance to both of us." The judgment, issued Monday in Bay County, Florida, Circuit Court, allows for "shared parenting of their two children," their attorneys said in a statement.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the given information.

The passage states that the divorce of Tiger Woods and Elin Nordegren was finalized on Monday, and that they reached a settlement on July 3. It also mentions that the judgment allows for "shared parenting of their two children."

The query asks whether both Woods and Nordegren agreed to waive the 20-day delay period offered before a final judgment.

To answer this, we need to consider the typical legal process for a divorce.

In many jurisdictions, there is a mandatory waiting period between the time a divorce is filed and the time the final judgment is issued. This waiting period is often 20 days or more, and it allows the parties to reconsider their decision or make any final arrangements before the divorce is finalized.

However, the passage states that the "judgment, issued Monday in Bay County, Florida, Circuit Court, allows for 'shared parenting of their two children.'" This suggests that the final judgment was issued on Monday, which means that the 20-day delay period was likely waived by both parties.

If the 20-day delay period had not been waived,
