Passage: By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 10:35 EST, 22 May 2012 | UPDATED: 11:04 EST, 22 May 2012 Tebow time: Chuck Shriner, 17, dropped to one knee and Tebow-ed his principal at his high school graduation in Fort Myers, Florida A high school student who 'Tebowed' on stage at his graduation ceremony was denied his diploma for the stunt.

Inspired by Tim Tebow, the New York Jets stand-in quarterback, the move mimics the football star's trademark pose of dropping to one knee and resting his hand on his forehead as he prays.

Response:
To solve this problem, I will need to make some assumptions and inferences based on the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- The passage is about a high school student named Chuck Shriner who "Tebowed" on stage during his graduation ceremony.
- The passage does not mention anything about a senior asking a placeholder to prom or taking a cardboard cutout of the Jets player instead.

Since the query mentions a "dateless senior" asking "@placeholder" to prom, and the passage does not contain any information about this, I will assume that the query is referring to a separate and unrelated event.

Without any additional information provided in the query, I do not have enough context to solve this problem. The query seems to be asking about a different situation that is not described in the passage.

Therefore, I do not have a complete answer to provide. I can only state that the information given in the query does not match the information provided in the passage, and I do not have enough context to solve the problem as stated.

Final answer: I do not have enough information to solve this problem.
