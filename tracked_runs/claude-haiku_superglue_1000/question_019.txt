Response:
I apologize, but I do not see a math problem in the given passage. The passage discusses an investigation into the Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his connections to a distant cousin named Magomed Kartashov, who is the founder of an Islamist group called "The Union of the Just". 

The query at the end states that "@placeholder is currently in jail on charges of resisting police in an unrelated matter." However, there is no information provided in the passage about a "@placeholder" person or any math-related problem.

Without a clear math problem statement and the necessary information to solve it, I am unable to provide a step-by-step solution or a final answer. If you could restate the problem in a more explicit mathematical form, I would be happy to assist you further.

Response:
I apologize, but I do not have enough information to solve this problem. The passage provided does not contain any numerical data or mathematical information that I can use to perform calculations. The passage is about an investigation into the Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his connections to a group called The Union of the Just. There is no mention of anyone being in jail on charges of resisting police in an unrelated matter. Without any quantitative information or a clear mathematical question, I am unable to demonstrate step-by-step reasoning or provide a final answer. I am a math problem solver, but I cannot generate a solution without the necessary mathematical components in the problem statement. Please provide more specific information if you would like me to attempt to solve a math-related problem.

I apologize, but I do not have enough information to solve this problem. The passage provided does not contain any numerical data or mathematical information that I can use to perform calculations. The passage is about an investigation into the Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his potential connections to an Islamist group leader named Magomed Kartashov. Without any specific numbers, quantities, or mathematical relationships in the text, I cannot generate a meaningful solution. If you could provide additional details or a more clearly defined mathematical question, I would be happy to try solving it step-by-step. However, based on the information given in the passage alone, I do not have the necessary elements to work through a math problem. Please let me know if you can rephrase the question in a way that involves numerical data or mathematical concepts.
