Response:
To determine whether the word "block" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and the meaning of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "He reserved a large block of seats."
In this sentence, the word "block" is used to refer to a large group or set of seats that are reserved together. This usage of "block" suggests a physical or spatial arrangement of seats.

Sentence 2: "He held a large block of the company's stock."
In this sentence, the word "block" is used to refer to a large portion or quantity of the company's stock that is owned or controlled by the person. This usage of "block" suggests a financial or ownership-related meaning.

Reasoning:
The word "block" is used in two different contexts in the given sentences, and the meanings are not the same.

In the first sentence, "block" refers to a physical arrangement of seats, while in the second sentence, "block" refers to a financial or ownership-related quantity of stock.

Therefore, the word "block" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
