Question:
Passage: The world’s most wanted female terrorist has fled to Syria, it was revealed last night – as police admitted they stopped surveillance on her deadly Parisian cell six months ago because they were deemed ‘low-risk’. Hayat Boumeddiene, the widow of one of the gunmen who massacred 17 civilians in the French capital – is now thought to be with her murderous Islamic State allies after fleeing the country. Official sources in Paris said that 24-hour scrutiny of members of her terror cell had been dropped to focus on other targets. Last night, Boumeddiene, 26, was branded ‘armed and dangerous’ by France’s top policeman Jean-Marc Falcone, who said she was believed to have helped plan the attacks.
