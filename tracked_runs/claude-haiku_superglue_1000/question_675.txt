Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- It wouldn't be an election year without Florida exhibiting its usual despicable efforts to keep residents from voting. After the 2000 debacle where the nation had to contend with hanging chads, ballots not being counted, more lawyering than anyone ever needs to deal with, and finally a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, you would think officials there would do all they can to stay out of the news. But, no. Leave it to the state legislature and Gov. Rick Scott to create another mess that could have easily been avoided. This time, it's the purging of the state's voting rolls in an effort to keep U.S. noncitizens from voting. According to Scott, potentially 182,000 voters on the rolls are noncitizens.
