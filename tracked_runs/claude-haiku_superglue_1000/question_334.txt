Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Patriarch Bartholomew is the living embodiment of one of the world's oldest institutions -- the Greek Orthodox Church in Constantinople. But he could be the last to hold the title in what is modern-day Istanbul, in secular but Muslim majority Turkey. CNN's "World's Untold Stories" examines the dwindling Greek Orthodox community in Turkey and how they are faring. There has been a patriarch in Constantinople for 14 centuries, ever since it was the capital of Byzantium and the Eastern Roman Empire, ruling over the Eastern Mediterranean and much of the Middle East. To this day, Orthodox Christians around the world recite prayers to the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the "first among equals."
