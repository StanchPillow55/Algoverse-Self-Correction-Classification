Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The amazing discoveries from NASA's Kepler planet-hunting space telescope keep rolling in. The latest, announced this week by astronomers, is the discovery of a planet just 10% larger than the Earth orbiting in the so-called "habitable zone" of the star Kepler-186. In our solar system, Earth is the only planet in the habitable zone -- the distance from the sun where liquid water can exist on the surface without boiling away (like on Venus), or turning to ice (like on Mars). The new planet, imaginatively dubbed Kepler-186f for now, appears to be in the same kind of Goldilocks place in its solar system. Not too hot, not too cold, just right. 186f could be the closest planet yet found.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the value that should replace the @placeholder in the given query.

Given information:
- NASA's Kepler telescope discovered a planet that is 10% larger than Earth.
- The new planet, 186f, may or may not be inhabitable.
- There appears to be a large number of Earth-like extrasolar planets.
- The discovery supports the idea that habitable worlds are probably common.
- New space observatories are being planned to follow up and expand on the results from the @placeholder.

The @placeholder refers to the Kepler telescope, which stopped collecting new planet data last year.

Therefore, the value that should replace the @placeholder is "Kepler telescope".

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The passage mentions that the Kepler telescope made the discovery of the planet that is 10% larger than Earth.
2. The passage also states that the Kepler telescope stopped collecting new planet data last year.
3. The query mentions that new space observatories are being planned to follow up and expand on the results from the @placeholder.
4. Based on the information provided, the @placeholder refers

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the value that should replace the @placeholder in the given query.

Given information:
- NASA's Kepler telescope discovered a planet that is 10% larger than Earth.
- The new planet, 186f, may or may not be inhabitable.
- There appears to be a large number of Earth-like extrasolar planets.
- The discovery supports the idea that habitable worlds are probably common.
- New space observatories are being planned to follow up and expand on the results from the @placeholder.

To determine the value that should replace the @placeholder, we need to identify the space telescope that was used to make the discoveries mentioned in the passage.

Based on the information provided, the space telescope that made the discoveries is the Kepler telescope.

Therefore, the value that should replace the @placeholder is Kepler.

Final answer: Kepler

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the name of the space observatory mentioned in the passage.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that NASA's Kepler planet-hunting space telescope made the discovery of the planet Kepler-186f.
- The passage also mentions that "new space observatories are being planned to try to follow up and expand on the results from the @placeholder (which stopped collecting new planet data last year)."

The @placeholder in the query refers to the space observatory mentioned in the passage, which is the Kepler space telescope.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Kepler
