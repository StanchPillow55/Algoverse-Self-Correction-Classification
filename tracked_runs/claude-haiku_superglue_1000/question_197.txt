To solve this problem, I need to fill in the missing information in the given statement.

The passage mentions that the hot air balloons included "a variety of colours and recognisable shapes such as Mickey Mouse, SpongeBob SquarePants and a killer whale."

2. The statement asks to fill in the missing recognizable character, and the only one mentioned in the passage that fits this is SpongeBob SquarePants.
