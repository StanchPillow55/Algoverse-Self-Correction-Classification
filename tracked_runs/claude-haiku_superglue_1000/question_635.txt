Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Dubai police Monday identified 11 people suspected in the killing of a top Hamas official last month and vowed "to hunt them down." At the same time, police offered a chilling scenario of how Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a founding member of Hamas' military wing who had survived at least three other previous attempts on his life, was killed in his hotel room January 19 just hours after arriving in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The 11 suspects identified Monday include one woman and 10 men. All of them hold valid European passports -- one from France, three from Ireland, six from Britain, and one from Germany. None of the suspects has been arrested or charged in the killing.
