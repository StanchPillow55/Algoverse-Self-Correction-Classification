Question:
Passage: A warning for those planning to spend Saturday night on January 31 outside a Barclays Premier League club in the hope of inadvertently getting on SkySports: don’t bother. The window actually closes on Monday February 2 at 11pm, having belatedly opened on January 3, and what do we have to show with it being a week old? Bupkis. Well, that may be a fib. We have Steven Gerrard for one, joining LA Galaxy after May, and Wilfried Bony’s impending £30million deal as another. Yet there remains a few that should be looking for the exit door themselves. West Bromwich Albion’s Saido Berahino, Newcastle United’s Moussa Sissoko and West Ham’s Winston Reid are among those, and here’s why they ought to leave.

West Brom would be joint-bottom if it was not for Saido Berahino's goals
