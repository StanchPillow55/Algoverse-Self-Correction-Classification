Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Known as the cradle of the Renaissance, Florence is a culture-rich city in the heart of Tuscany, Italy. Over the centuries, it has been home to Renaissance masters Leonardo da Vinci, Giotto, Michelangelo, Dante and Brunelleschi, who have left their legacy in a trove of art and architecture that is world renowned. It is this rich legacy that inspires art-lovers to visit, and in summer the city is crammed with tourists determined to make the most of the city's treasures. While small, Florence contains a quarter of the planet's UNESCO world heritage sites, which can be overwhelming for first-time visitors.
