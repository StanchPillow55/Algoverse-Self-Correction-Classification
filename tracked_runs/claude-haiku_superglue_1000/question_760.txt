Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Do you know why so many children think they're entitled to a comfy life filled with toys, smiles and puppy dogs? I blame Santa Claus. Not "white" Santa Claus or "nonwhite" Santa Claus. Just Santa Claus. Christmas came early for perennial critics of Fox News when host Megyn Kelly got sucked into the country's racial vortex by insisting that Santa Claus -- and, also, for that matter, Jesus -- is white. It all began with a column by Slate culture blogger Aisha Harris, who is African-American. In the piece, provocatively titled "Santa Claus should not be a white man anymore," Harris noted that she grew up with "two different Santa Clauses" -- one in popular culture that was white, and one she knew in her household, who was black. She advocated that, from this point on, Santa should be depicted as, eh, a penguin.
