Question:
Passage: It took seven match points to do it but Angelique Kerber finally silenced Maria Sharapova, beating the Russian former champion 6-7 (4-7) 6-4 4-6 in the most thrilling match of these Championships on Centre Court. Sharapova was broken in the first and final game of the match. In between she fought doggedly, as she always does, saving five match points as she served to stay in the match. But ultimately the German was too consistent, scurrying after every ball and surprising with the pinpoint accuracy of some of her shots. Sharapova’s exit means 2012 Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova is the only Grand Slam Champion left in the women’s draw. If Canadian Eugenie Bouchard was watching, this result will have brought some cheer.
