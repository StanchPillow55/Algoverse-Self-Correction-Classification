Question:
Passage: A day after talks in Geneva between Iran and six world powers over Tehran's nuclear ambitions ended on a promising note, Iran's state-run news agency quoted government officials as expressing optimism that differences can be resolved. Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said the so-called P5+1 -- the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain, all countries with permanent seats on the U.N.

"Araqchi further referred to uranium enrichment as Iran's red line in the negotiations, adding that Iran could still negotiate over the level and the volume of enrichment," it added.
