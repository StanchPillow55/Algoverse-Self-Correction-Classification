Response:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the passage and determine the probability of one of the daredevils losing their balance and falling into the tracks.

Given information:
- The video shows two men jumping across subway platforms in Brooklyn, New York.
- The platforms are located at the 9th Avenue and 39th Street stop on the D line.
- The two men appear to be in their late teens or early twenties.
- One of the men almost loses his balance and topples into the tracks.

To calculate the probability of one of the daredevils falling into the tracks, we need to consider the following factors:

1. The distance between the platforms:
   - The passage does not provide the exact distance between the platforms, but we can assume it is a typical subway platform distance, which is usually around 4-5 feet.
   - The risk of falling increases as the distance between the platforms increases.

2. The height of the platforms:
   - Subway platforms are typically around 3-4 feet high.
   - The higher the platforms, the greater the risk of injury or death if someone falls.

3. The presence of a

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the passage and determine the probability of one of the daredevils losing their balance and falling into the tracks.

Given information:
- The video shows two men jumping across subway platforms in Brooklyn, New York.
- The platforms are located at the 9th Avenue and 39th Street stop on the D line.
- The two men appear to be in their late teens or early twenties.
- One of the men almost loses his balance and topples into the tracks.

Step 1: Identify the relevant factors that could affect the probability of the man losing his balance.
Factors to consider:
- Distance between the platforms
- Width of the platforms
- Condition of the platforms (e.g., slippery, uneven)
- Physical abilities and coordination of the jumpers
- Potential distractions or environmental factors

Step 2: Estimate the distance between the platforms.
The passage does not provide the exact distance, but we can make an educated guess based on typical subway platform dimensions.
Assuming a standard subway platform width of around 12 feet, the distance between the platforms is likely to be in the

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the passage and determine the probability of the person losing their balance and falling into the tracks.

Given information:
- The video shows two men jumping across subway platforms in Brooklyn, New York.
- The platforms are located at the 9th Avenue and 39st stop on the D line.
- One of the men "almost loses his balance and topples into the tracks."

To calculate the probability of the person losing their balance and falling into the tracks, we need to consider the following factors:

1. Distance between the platforms:
   - The passage does not provide the exact distance between the platforms, but we can assume it is a significant distance, as the act is described as "life-risking" and "dangerous."
   - The wider the gap between the platforms, the higher the probability of the person losing their balance and falling.

2. Platform width:
   - The passage does not provide the width of the platforms, but we can assume they are standard subway platform widths, which are typically around 12-15 feet (3.7-4.6 meters).
   - A narrower platform would make it more challenging for
