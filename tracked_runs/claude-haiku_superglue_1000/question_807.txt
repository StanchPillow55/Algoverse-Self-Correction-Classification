Question:
Passage: WENT THE DAY WELL? WITNESSING WATERLOO by David Crane (William Collins, £20) We know that it was not until Wednesday, June 21, 1815, three days after almost 200,000 men had clashed in the dreary fields of modern-day Belgium, that news of the Battle of Waterloo reached London. The Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, was dining with friends when the exhausted figure of Major Henry Percy burst in, carrying two captured French imperial eagle standards. Liverpool immediately insisted on going to see the Prince Regent, the future George IV, who was also dining nearby. The Prince was naturally delighted, but hoped that ‘we have not suffered much loss’.
