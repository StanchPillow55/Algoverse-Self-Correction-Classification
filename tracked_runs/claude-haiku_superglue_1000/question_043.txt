Question:
Passage: Santa Monica, California (CNN) -- The alleged East Coast mobster and his girlfriend were known as Charlie and Carol Gasko, a May-December couple living in the heart of sunny Southern California, just two blocks from the beach and an upscale outdoor mall, in a town known for its unapologetic liberalism. But their real names were James "Whitey" Bulger, 81, and Catherine Elizabeth Greig, 60. And recently, Greig had been telling friends that Bulger was showing signs of Alzheimer's and was suffering depression, unable to sleep or to get out of bed, neighbor Catalina Schlank told CNN. One manager of a restaurant just down the street recalled how the alleged gangster and his girlfriend liked the privacy of a far corner table and once worked up a $192 bill, plus tip, for a steak and lobster dinner, accompanied by foie gras, vodka highballs and chardonnay.
