Question:
Passage: County police in riot gear and armored tanks gave way to state troopers walking side-by-side with thousands of protesters as the St. Louis suburb where an unarmed black teen was shot by a city police officer overwhelmingly avoided violence on Thursday after nearly a week of unrest and mounting public tension. The dramatic shift came after Missouri Governor Jay Nixon assigned oversight of the protests to the state Highway Patrol, stripping local police from the St. Louis County Police Department of their authority after four days of clashes with furious crowds protesting the weekend death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. 'All they did was look at us and shoot tear gas,' said Pedro Smith, 41, who has participated in the nightly protests. 'This is totally different. Now we're being treated with respect.'
