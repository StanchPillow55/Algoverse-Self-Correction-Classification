Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Dealing with Merion is turning out to be tough enough. But Tiger Woods is also battling an injury at the U.S. Open in Pennsylvania. Woods revealed that he hurt his left arm while winning The Players Championship last month, which would explain why he grimaced noticeably on several occasions in the first round. The world's top-ranked golfer was back in action in the second round Friday and shot a level-par 70 to complete two rounds at three-over-par 143. Asked to provide more details about injury, Woods didn't elaborate. "Well, it is what it is," Woods said. Woods is bidding to win his 15th major but first since 2008 at the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines.
