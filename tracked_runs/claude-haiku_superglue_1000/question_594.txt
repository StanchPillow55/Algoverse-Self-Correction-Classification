Question:
Passage: Manchester City are set to take on Liverpool on Monday night in the first super heavyweight clash of the new Premier League season. The two sides filled the top two spots at the end of last season, and after two epic ties between the sides, more fireworks will be expected at the Etihad Stadium. Here, Martin Keown runs the rule over the key factors that could determine the result of the game.
