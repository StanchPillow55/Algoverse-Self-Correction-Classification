Response:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of people who can be with us in Macksville to celebrate Phillip Hughes' life.

Given information:
- The town of Macksville has a population of 2,600 people.
- The passage mentions that "thousands of people from Australia and overseas inundate the 2,600-strong town in New South Wales" to attend the funeral service.

Step 1: Determine the maximum number of people who can attend the funeral service.
Since the passage mentions "thousands of people" attending the funeral, we can assume that the maximum number of people who can attend is 3,000.

Step 2: Determine the number of people who cannot be with us in Macksville to celebrate Phillip's life.
The total population of the town is 2,600 people. However, the passage states that "thousands of people from Australia and overseas inundate the 2,600-strong town in New South Wales" to attend the funeral service.

Therefore, the number of people who cannot be with us in Macksville to celebrate Phillip's life is the total population of the town (2,600) minus the maximum number
