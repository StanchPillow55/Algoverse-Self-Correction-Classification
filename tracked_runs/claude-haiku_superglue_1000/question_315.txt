Question:
Passage: By David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor At a time of national wage stagnation and economic uncertainty outside the beltway, a Virginia Democratic congressman wants a raise – arguing that a $174,000 salary isn't enough for a federal legislator to live comfortably in or around Washington, D.C. 'I think the American people should know that the members of Congress are underpaid,' Moran told Roll Call. 'I understand that it’s widely felt that they underperform, but the fact is that this is the board of directors for the largest economic entity in the world.' Congress' approval rating among voters typically hovers under 20 per cent.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the information provided in the passage, and then apply logical reasoning to determine the original purpose of serving in Congress.

Given information:
- The passage discusses a Virginia Democratic congressman, Jim Moran, who believes that members of Congress are underpaid, with a salary of $174,000.
- The passage mentions that Congress' approval rating among voters is typically under 20%.
- The original question asks about the original purpose of serving in Congress, which was a part-time avocation for various professions, with a compensation of $6 per day.

Reasoning:
1. The passage suggests that the current members of Congress view their role as a full-time profession, with a relatively high salary of $174,000. This is in contrast with the original purpose of serving in Congress, which was a part-time avocation.
2. The passage indicates that the original purpose of serving in Congress was for farmers, ranchers, lawyers, and homesteaders, who spent most of their time at home and collected $6 per day for their service. This suggests that serving in Congress was not a primary occupation, but rather a secondary or part-time activity
