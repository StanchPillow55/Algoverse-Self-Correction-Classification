Question:
Passage: By Daily Mail Reporter Father James Martin, the Jesuit priest who had the unfortunate task of presiding over Philip Seymour Hoffmanâ€™s funeral this week, opened up about their decade-long friendship, saying that the actor had taught him humility. Martin first met Hoffman when the actor reached out to him in 2003 seeking advice about the Labyrinth Theater Company's production of the Off-Broadway play 'The Last Days of Judas Iscariot directed by Hoffman. The clergyman and writer also helped Hoffman with the part of Father Flynn in the 2008 film 'Doubt' starring Meryl Streep about a priest in a Catholic school who may or may not have molested a boy. The role earned Hoffman an Academy Award nomination.
