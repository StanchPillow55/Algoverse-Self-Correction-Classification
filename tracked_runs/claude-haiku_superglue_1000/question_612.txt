Question:
Passage: By Sami Mokbel Follow @@SamiMokbel81_DM Jose Mourinho accused referees of all but deciding the Premier League title after losing his 77-game unbeaten League record at Stamford Bridge with defeat by Sunderland. The Chelsea manager was furious with officials for awarding a penalty when Cesar Azpilicueta brought down Jozy Altidore and Fabio Borini, a former Chelsea striker who is at Sunderland on loan from title rivals Liverpool, made it 2-1 from the penalty spot. Mourinho blasted Dean and referee’s chief Mike Riley, aiming a sarcastic rant at the officials — even though his own assistant Rui Faria was sent off for an extraordinary rant after the spot-kick when he had to be restrained by fellow members of the back-room team.
