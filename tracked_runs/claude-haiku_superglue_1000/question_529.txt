Question:
Passage: What Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers have done with Jordan Henderson deserves more recognition. It’s almost gone under the radar that Henderson is now a regular for club and country, and indeed when he was suspended at the end of last season, that’s when Liverpool dropped crucial points. I saw him play for Sunderland on the right side of midfield and despite lacking killer pace he looked a threat because of the quality of his delivery. Liverpool have taken him to Anfield and under Rodgers he has become a brilliant midfield player who can control a game, keep the ball and use it with intelligence and quality.
