Question:
Passage: 'You watch and just wonder if he was born to play football,' declared Everton boss Roberto Martinez after his star midfielder Ross Barkley graced the Goodison Park turf for the first time this season following a speedy recovery from the knee ligament injury he suffered in August. To the surprise of most Toffees fans, Barkley was hurled into Martinez's starting line-up as he drove his side to a 3-0 victory against Aston Villa on Saturday, picking up an assist and a standing ovation along the way. Now, with Lille looming, Barkley will get the chance to make his European bow as Everton prepare for their Europa League Group H clash against the 2011 Ligue 1 champions on Thursday.

Given information:
- The passage discusses Everton's upcoming Europa League match against Lille.
- It mentions that Everton's young midfielder, Ross Barkley, is set to start the match after returning from injury.
