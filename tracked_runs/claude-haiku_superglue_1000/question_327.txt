Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- This was not how it was supposed to end. The past week had been a procession -- the next few days were supposed to end in a coronation. With the future King of England in the Royal Box, the man who wore the Wimbledon crown so proudly allowed it to slip on Centre Court. Andy Murray, the first British man to win the tournament in 77 years, was not just thrown out of his court, he was brushed aside by a man threatening mutiny at the top of the men's game. Grigor Dimitrov has hinted at performances like this before -- but this was the announcement his potential had always promised to deliver.
