Question:
Paragraph: { { lang } } centers on a man who roams the street night after night . Hidden under his hat and rain jacket he strives for one goal : to find the culprit - the one whom he can make responsible for his suffering . If he wanted to , he could confront him , but he lacks the audacity to do so . He considers suicide , but his courage fails him once again . The options do not appear to present him with a way out and would not personally satisfy him . Finley blames not himself , but only others . In this case he looks to his girlfriend , Violet . He drowns Violet in the bath whilst giving her a massage , Which had become a common ritual for them . On one hand he does this out of malice , on the other to be close to her just one more time . Through this action he wishes to break the growing distance he has come to feel between them , though the actual outcome is the infliction of the greatest possible loneliness , as he turns into a monster . Finley only realizes with hindsight that his misdeeds far surpass those of Violet . 

Question: What was Finley doing with Violet before he killed her?

Answer: Roaming the street together in the night
