Question:
Passage: By Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press PUBLISHED: 14:10 EST, 3 June 2013 | UPDATED: 14:56 EST, 3 June 2013 The Supreme Court has ruled that police can collect DNA from anyone they arrest, equating a DNA cheek swab to common jailhouse procedures like take fingerprints and mug shots. Civil liberties groups condemned Monday's decision - saying it amounts to creating a 'gaping new exception to the Fourth Amendment' by allowing authorities to collect a person's DNA and add it to national criminal databases without a warrant - no matter whether they are convicted or not. The split 5-4 decision saw conservative Justice Antonin Scalia join three liberal colleagues, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in opposing the ruling.
