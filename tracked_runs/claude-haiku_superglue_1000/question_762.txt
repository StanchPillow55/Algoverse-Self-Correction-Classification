Question:
Passage: Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Ignoring international protests, China may have repatriated around 30 North Korean defectors who had been caught while trying to escape their homeland, a South Korean official said Friday. Park Sun-young, a South Korean lawmaker who had been on hunger strike protesting such repatriations, told CNN she believes the North Koreans have been sent back. CNN cannot in dependently confirm the assertion. Defectors who have made it to South Korea say anyone sent back faces a long term of imprisonment in a brutal labor camp or even execution. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, meeting with the South Korean foreign minister Thursday, said he shared Seoul's concerns about defectors and "stressed the importance of giving priority to the international standards and humanitarian considerations for the well-being of those persons."
