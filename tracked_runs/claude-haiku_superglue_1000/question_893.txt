Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The little boy sits proudly next to his snowman, and smiles. He has no coat, gloves or hat to protect him from the freezing cold, but for a moment he is distracted from the harsh reality of life inside a makeshift refugee camp in Lebanon. We do not know his name, but he is one of 842,000 refugees the U.N. says are spending the winter in Lebanon after fleeing a brutal three-year civil war in Syria. They thought that life could not get much harsher. But that was before winter storm "Alexa" moved in, bringing snow, rain and freezing temperatures across the region.
