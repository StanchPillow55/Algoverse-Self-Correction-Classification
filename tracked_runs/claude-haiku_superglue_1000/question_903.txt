Question:
Passage: Kevin Pietersen fired another shot in his verbal battle with Matt Prior on Friday when he hit back over the wicketkeeper’s claim that the England dressing room will be a better place without him. Prior, whose relationship with Pietersen deteriorated badly towards the end of the Ashes, became the first player to publicly express his feelings over the maverick’s sacking when he spoke at a question-and-answer session in Dubai about the need to ‘rediscover the honour and pride of playing for England’. Hitting back: Kevin Pietersen told Matt Prior to spend more time in the nets and less doing 'Q&As'
@highlight
Kevin Pietersen tells Matt Prior 'Fewer Q&As, more Sussex nets methinks'
@highlight
He then taunts 'The Big Cheese' with responses to Twitter followers
@highlight
Prior said the England dressing room would be a better place without KP
@highlight
ECB 'only want people in England dressing room who are passionate'
@highlight
Prior was instrumental to Pietersen's 're-integration' after 2012 text scandal

Query: It is a tiresome extension of a row that does little credit to anyone but it is further evidence Pietersen will be lurking in the background to provide a distraction to @placeholder’s attempts to move on without him.
