Question:
Passage: Poisoned spy Alexander Litvinenko was a top analyst for MI6, causing the KGB to have him murdered for 'treason'. That's according to one of the Russian dissident's closest confidantes Yuri Felshtinsky, a historian who co-authored the book Blowing Up Russia with the former secret agent. He has claimed his former collaborator should have been protected by British intelligence from the KGB assassins who allegedly poisoned him with radioactive plutonium-210 at a central London hotel in November 2006. Scroll down for video Yuri Felshtinsky (left) claims Alexander Litvinenko (right) was murdered by the KGB for working with MI6 In an interview with police while he lay on his deathbed, Mr Litvinenko said that Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun 'wanted to kill me'.
