Question:
Passage: By Meghan Keneally PUBLISHED: 10:39 EST, 3 October 2012 | UPDATED: 23:23 EST, 3 October 2012 Millions of voters will be focusing the presidential candidates and their 'zingers' tonight in Denver, but plenty of attention has already been paid by organizers behind the scenes who have spent much time- and money- setting an even stage for this election's first presidential debate. At 9pm ET, President Barack Obama and Republican rival Mitt Romney will begin their orchestrated dance of appearing relaxed and candid even though they have been practicing their answers for weeks and timing every response down to the second.
@highlight
Obama and Romney go head-to-head at 9pm ET in first presidential debate
@highlight
Will be Jim Lehrer's 12th time moderating a debate, earning him the title of hosting one-third of all televised presidential debates
@highlight
Wednesday night's debate is first of three for candidates before election
@highlight
Expected to have TV audience of 60million viewers

Query: One possible explanation for why analysts aren't predicting a higher headcount is because many voters are already rife with campaign fatigue: during the @placeholder primary, there were 20 televised debates between the ever-changing cast of candidates.
