Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- What do you remember about April 20, 1999? Families visit the graves of the Columbine shooting victims at Chapel Hill Memorial Gardens in 2007.

Ten years after the massacre in Littleton, Colorado, there's still a collective memory of two Goth-obsessed loners, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who went on a shooting rampage and killed 12 of their classmates and a teacher, injured 23 others and then turned their guns on themselves.
