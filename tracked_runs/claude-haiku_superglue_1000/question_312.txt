Response:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given premise and the two choices to determine the most likely cause.

Choice 1: The spy bugged the enemy's phone.
Choice 2: The spy was hired by the government.

Reasoning:
1. Bugging the enemy's phone (Choice 1) could be a possible cause for the spy discovering the enemy's location. This would allow the spy to intercept and gather information about the enemy's whereabouts.

2. Being hired by the government (Choice 2) could also be a possible cause for the spy discovering the enemy's location. The government may have provided the spy with resources, intelligence, or other means to locate the enemy.

To determine the most likely cause, we need to consider the information provided in the premise and the two choices.

The premise states that the spy "discovered" the enemy's location, which suggests that the spy actively sought out and found the enemy's location, rather than being passively informed of it.

Between the two choices, the more likely cause is that the spy bugged the enemy's phone (Choice 1). This would align with
