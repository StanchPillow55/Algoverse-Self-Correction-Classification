Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of the 30 Rolls-Royce Phantoms and the cost of the two most expensive Phantoms.

Given information:
- The businessman, Stephen Hung, has splashed out £20 million on 30 bespoke Rolls-Royce Phantoms.
- The two most expensive Phantoms will feature external and internal gold-plated detailing.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the 30 Rolls-Royce Phantoms.
Total cost of 30 Rolls-Royce Phantoms = £20 million

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the two most expensive Phantoms.
Since the passage does not provide the specific cost of the two most expensive Phantoms, we cannot determine the exact cost. However, we can infer that the two most expensive Phantoms are part of the 30 Phantoms ordered, and their cost is included in the total cost of £20 million.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The businessman, Stephen Hung, has splashed out £20 million on 30 bespoke

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of the 30 Rolls-Royce Phantoms and the cost of the two most expensive Phantoms.

Given information:
- The businessman, Stephen Hung, has splashed out £20 million on 30 bespoke Rolls-Royce Phantoms.
- The two most expensive Phantoms will feature external and internal gold-plated detailing.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the 30 Rolls-Royce Phantoms.
Total cost of 30 Rolls-Royce Phantoms = £20 million

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the two most expensive Phantoms.
Since the passage states that the two most expensive Phantoms will feature external and internal gold-plated detailing, we can assume that the cost of these two Phantoms will be higher than the cost of the other 28 Phantoms.
However, the passage does not provide the exact cost of the two most expensive Phantoms.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The businessman, Stephen Hung, has splashed out £20 million on

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of the two most expensive Rolls-Royce Phantoms that Stephen Hung ordered.

Given information:
- Stephen Hung ordered 30 bespoke Rolls-Royce Phantoms for £20 million.
- The two most expensive Phantoms in the fleet will feature external and internal gold-plated detailing.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of each Rolls-Royce Phantom.
Total cost of 30 Phantoms = £20 million
Cost of each Phantom = Total cost / Number of Phantoms
Cost of each Phantom = £20 million / 30 = £666,666.67

Step 2: Determine the additional cost of the two most expensive Phantoms with gold-plated detailing.
Since the passage states that these two Phantoms are the "most luxurious vehicles Rolls-Royce has ever built," we can assume that the additional cost for the gold-plated detailing is significant.
Let's estimate the additional cost for the gold-plating to be 50% of the base cost of each Phantom
