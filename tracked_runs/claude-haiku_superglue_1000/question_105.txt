Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- It took five days for Colorado authorities to realize a parolee disabled his ankle monitor and fled, beginning what investigators would later say was a deadly crime spree that ended in a shootout in Texas, according to records released Tuesday. The documents released by the Colorado Department of Corrections detail how 28-year-old Evan Ebel managed to elude authorities in the days leading up to the killings of prisons chief Tom Clements and part-time pizza deliveryman Nathan Leon. The state Department of Corrections did not respond to repeated requests from CNN for comment. The release of the documents follows news this week that a clerical error resulted in Ebel's release four years early from prison. That revelation prompted an apology from the district court where the mistake was made.
