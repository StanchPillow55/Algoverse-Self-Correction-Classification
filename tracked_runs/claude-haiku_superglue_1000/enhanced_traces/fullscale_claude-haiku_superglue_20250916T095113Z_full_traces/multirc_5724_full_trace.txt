FULL TRACE FOR SAMPLE: multirc_5724
==================================================

Sample ID: multirc_5724
Final Prediction: To determine who was taken by surprise at the presence of their foe, I will carefully analyze the details provided in the paragraph.

The key information is:
- Harry formed his men with a front across the whole road and directed the lines to advance, twenty yards apart.
- Then, placing himself at their head, he gave the word, and charged down the street upon the Roundheads.
- The Roundheads, occupied by their attack on the houses, were unconscious of the presence of their foe until he was close upon them, and were taken utterly by surprise.

From this, we can see that the Roundheads were the ones who were taken by surprise at the presence of their foe, which was Harry and his men. The paragraph clearly states that the Roundheads were "unconscious of the presence of their foe until he was close upon them, and were taken utterly by surprise."

Therefore, the answer is:
The Roundheads were taken by surprise at the presence of their foe.
