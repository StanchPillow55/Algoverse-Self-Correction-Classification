Final Prediction: To solve this problem, we need to find the location of Bethea's hometown, which is not explicitly stated in the passage. We can infer this information from the context provided.

Given information:

- The passage mentions that Bethea's school has become a symbol of the kind of crumbling infrastructure that President Obama hopes to improve.
