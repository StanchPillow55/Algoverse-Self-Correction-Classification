Sample ID: record_46247
Final Prediction: I apologize, but I do not see a clear mathematical problem or calculation in the given passage. The passage discusses the importance of the state of Ohio in presidential elections and the intense campaigning efforts by the Obama and Romney campaigns in that state. 

However, the query "voters alienated by Obama who wanted to like @placeholder" does not seem to be directly related to the information provided in the passage. This query appears to be asking about voter sentiment and preferences, which is more of a qualitative, political analysis rather than a quantitative math problem.

Without a clearly defined mathematical problem or set of data to work with, I am unable to provide a step-by-step solution or calculation. My role is to assist with math-related problems, not to speculate on political opinions or voter behavior. If you have a specific math-based question related to the information in the passage, please provide that, and I'll be happy to try to solve it.
