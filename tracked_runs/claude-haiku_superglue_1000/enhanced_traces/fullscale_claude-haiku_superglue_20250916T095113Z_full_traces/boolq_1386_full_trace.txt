FULL TRACE FOR SAMPLE: boolq_1386
==================================================

Sample ID: boolq_1386
Final Prediction: To determine if ISO and film speed are the same thing, we need to understand the relationship between the two concepts.

Film speed:
- Film speed is a measure of a photographic film's sensitivity to light.
- It is determined by sensitometry, which is the measurement and evaluation of the relationship between the exposure of photographic film and the resulting density of the image.
- Film speed is measured on various numerical scales, with the most recent being the ISO system.

ISO:
- ISO (International Organization for Standardization) is a system used to describe the relationship between exposure and output image lightness in digital cameras.
- The ISO system is closely related to the film speed system, as it serves a similar purpose of measuring the sensitivity of the image sensor in a digital camera.

Relationship between ISO and film speed:
- The ISO system is based on the same principles as the film speed system, but it is applied to digital cameras instead of photographic film.
- In both cases, the higher the ISO/film speed, the more sensitive the medium (digital sensor or film) is to light, which means that less exposure is required to capture an image.
- The ISO and film speed scales are designed to be directly
