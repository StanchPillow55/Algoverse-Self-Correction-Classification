Final Prediction: To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of "carried interest" and how it relates to the federal tax code.

Carried interest is a share of the profits of an investment fund that is paid to the fund's investment managers, typically as compensation. This compensation is often taxed at the capital gains rate, which is lower than the ordinary income tax rate.

The elimination of this specialized "carried interest" provision in the federal tax code would mean that the investment managers would have to pay taxes on their compensation at the higher ordinary income tax rate, rather than the lower capital gains rate.

This would result in an increase in the taxes paid by the wealthiest individuals, as they are the ones who typically receive this type of compensation.

To calculate the impact of this change, we would need to know the specific details of the carried interest provision, such as the current tax rate, the proposed tax rate, and the amount of income that is affected by this provision.

However, without these specific details, we cannot provide a precise calculation of the impact. The passage simply states that this change would be "another hit to the wealthiest," but does not provide enough information to quantify the impact.

Therefore, the final answer is:
