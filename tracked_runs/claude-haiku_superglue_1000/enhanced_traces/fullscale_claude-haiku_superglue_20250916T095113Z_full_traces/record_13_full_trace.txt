FULL TRACE FOR SAMPLE: record_13
==================================================

Sample ID: record_13
Final Prediction: To solve this problem, I need to carefully analyze the information provided in the passage and determine which social media platform the study found to be a "megaphone" for younger web users.

The key information from the passage is:
- The study examined the link between social media usage and narcissism.
- It found that middle-aged narcissists are more likely to frequently update their Facebook status.
- It also found that younger narcissists are more likely to use Twitter to satisfy their vanity.
- According to the researcher Elliot Panek, college students prefer Twitter because they over-value their own opinions.

Based on this information, the passage indicates that Twitter acts as a "megaphone" for younger web users, as they use it to boost their ego and over-value their own opinions.

Therefore, the answer to the query is:

@placeholder = Twitter

The passage directly states that younger narcissists are more likely to use Twitter to satisfy their vanity, and that college students prefer Twitter because they over-value their own opinions. This suggests that Twitter serves as a "megaphone" for younger web users to amplify their narcissistic tendencies.
