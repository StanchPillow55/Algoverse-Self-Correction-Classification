==================================================

Sample ID: multirc_14798
Final Prediction: To solve this problem, I will carefully read through the given paragraph and extract the relevant information to determine the color of the dog that Pester saw.

Key information from the paragraph:
- Pester came running into the room and saw a dog.
- Pester had seen a dog before, and he used to live with a black dog named Henry.
- However, Pester had never seen a brown dog before.
- The paragraph states that "He'd never seen a brown one before. It seemed strange to him."

Based on this information, the color of the dog that Pester saw when he came running into the room was brown.

The paragraph explicitly states that Pester had never seen a brown dog before, and that seeing the brown dog seemed strange to him. This indicates that the dog he saw was brown in color.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The color of the dog Pester saw when he came running into the room was brownish.
Final Correct: False
