FULL TRACE FOR SAMPLE: record_99934
==================================================

Sample ID: record_99934
Final Prediction: Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

The passage does not mention anything about a senior asking a placeholder to prom. It is about a high school student named Chuck Shriner who "Tebowed" during his graduation ceremony, and was denied his diploma as a result.

The query asks about a dateless senior who asked a placeholder to prom, and then took a cardboard cutout instead when she didn't hear back. However, this scenario is not described in the passage provided.

Since the passage does not contain any information about a senior asking a placeholder to prom, there is not enough information given to solve this problem. The query appears to be referencing a different situation that is not covered in the provided passage.

Without any relevant details from the passage, I do not have the necessary information to work through this problem step-by-step or provide a final answer. The query seems to be about a separate event that is not described in the given text.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in the passage, I am unable to solve the problem or provide a final answer, as the query is asking about a scenario that is not covered in the given text.
