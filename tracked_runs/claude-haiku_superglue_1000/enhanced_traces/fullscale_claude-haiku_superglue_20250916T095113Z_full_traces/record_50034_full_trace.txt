FULL TRACE FOR SAMPLE: record_50034
==================================================

Sample ID: record_50034
Final Prediction: To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and determine what additional information is required to answer the query.

The passage discusses a government ban on YouTube in Pakistan that was implemented after the release of a controversial film called "Innocence of Muslims" on the platform. The passage also mentions that Pakistani artists, such as rapper Adil Omar, have used YouTube to launch their careers and gain exposure.

The query asks whether YouTube is the only social media website that was taken away from Pakistani web users. To answer this, I would need to know if any other social media platforms were also banned or restricted in Pakistan around the same time as the YouTube ban.

The passage does not provide any information about other social media platforms being banned. It only discusses the YouTube ban. Therefore, to answer the query, I would need to research whether any other social media websites were restricted or banned in Pakistan during the time period mentioned in the passage.

Without additional information about other social media bans in Pakistan, I cannot definitively answer the query. The passage only discusses the YouTube ban, so I cannot conclude whether YouTube is the only social media website that was taken away from Pakistani web users.

Final answer: Based on the information provided in the passage,
Final Correct: False
