FULL TRACE FOR SAMPLE: boolq_2508
==================================================

Sample ID: boolq_2508
Final Prediction: To determine if membrane potential and resting potential are the same, we need to understand the concepts of membrane potential and resting potential.

Membrane Potential:
- The membrane potential is the voltage difference across the cell membrane, which is created by the unequal distribution of ions (such as sodium, potassium, and chloride) inside and outside the cell.
- The membrane potential is a dynamic property that can change in response to various factors, such as ion movements, ion pump activity, and changes in ion permeability.

Resting Potential:
- The resting potential is the relatively stable membrane potential of a quiescent (non-active) cell, when the cell is not generating any action potentials or other electrical signals.
- The resting potential is typically maintained by the active transport of ions, such as the sodium-potassium pump, which helps to maintain the unequal distribution of ions across the cell membrane.

Relationship between Membrane Potential and Resting Potential:
- The resting potential is a specific type of membrane potential, which is the stable, baseline membrane potential of a quiescent cell.
- In other words, the resting potential is a
