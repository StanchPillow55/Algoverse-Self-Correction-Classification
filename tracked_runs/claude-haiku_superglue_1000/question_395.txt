Question:
Paragraph: Heat supplies the energy that causes motion. The deeper you go into toward the Earths core, the hotter it gets. At the core it is really hot. All that heat tries to rise toward the surface. In the Mantle, the rock is partially melted and is able to move. As it is heated, the material in the mantle moves toward the surface. As the mantle material rises, it cools. When it reaches the Earths crust, it is mostly stopped. A little of the material can break through the surface, but not all. Instead, it begins to move horizontally. The mantle material moves horizontally away from a mid-ocean ridge crest. Toward the surface, the mantle material starts to cool. As it cools it sinks back down into the mantle. These areas are where deep sea trench occur. The material sinks back down to the core. The system operates like a giant conveyor belt. The motion due to heating and cooling is called convection.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of heat transfer and the structure of the Earth.

Given information:
- The deeper you go towards the Earth's core, the hotter it gets.
- At the core, it is really hot.
- All the heat from the core tries to rise towards the surface.

Reasoning:
1. The Earth's interior is composed of several layers, including the core, mantle, and crust.
2. The core is the hottest part of the Earth, as it is the innermost layer and is believed to be composed of molten iron and nickel.
3. The heat generated in the core, due to various processes such as radioactive decay and gravitational compression, tries to move towards the surface of the Earth.
4. Heat transfer occurs through the process of convection, where the hot material in the mantle rises towards the surface, and the cooler material sinks back down.
5. As the hot material in the mantle rises, it cools and eventually reaches the Earth's crust, where it is mostly stopped.
6. However, some of the material can break through the surface, forming features like volcanoes and mi

Response:
To solve this problem, I will go through the information provided in the paragraph step-by-step and explain the reasoning behind the answer.

The key information from the paragraph is:
1. The deeper you go towards the Earth's core, the hotter it gets.
2. At the core, it is really hot.
3. All that heat tries to rise toward the surface.
4. In the Mantle, the rock is partially melted and is able to move.
5. As the mantle material is heated, it moves toward the surface.
6. As the mantle material rises, it cools.

Based on this information, the heat deep in the Earth tries to go towards the surface. The paragraph clearly states that "All that heat tries to rise toward the surface."

The reasoning behind this is that the heat generated deep within the Earth's core is trying to escape and move towards the cooler surface. This is a natural process driven by the temperature difference between the core and the surface.

As the hot material in the mantle is heated, it becomes less dense and rises towards the surface. This rising motion is driven by the convection currents within the mantle, which are caused by the
