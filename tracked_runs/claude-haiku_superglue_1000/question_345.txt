Question:
Passage: Al Qaeda-linked militants justified their takeover of a strategic opposition-held town near the Syrian border with Turkey by accusing the Syrian rebels who held it of being pro-democracy traitors who cooperated with Western officials like U.S. Sen. John McCain. The ousted rebels "have called for democracy ... which conflicts with Islamic teachings," the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria announced in an online statement Monday. ISIS said it "cleansed" the northern border town of Azaz of more moderate fighters from the rebel Free Syrian Army in the past week because the rebels "received American Senator McCain and agreed with him to fight Islamists."
