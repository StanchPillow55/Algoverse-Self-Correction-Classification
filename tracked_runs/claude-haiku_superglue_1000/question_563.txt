Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- The attorney for an Indian diplomat whose arrest and detention in New York sparked an international controversy on visa fraud charges said Thursday the allegations are baseless. And he accused U.S. authorities of deliberately mishandling her arrest. "They were trying to humiliate her and flex their muscle, and they succeeded in doing that," Dan Arshack, lawyer for Devyani Khobragade, told CNN's "New Day." But the attorney for a housekeeper at the center of allegations that Khobragade violated an agreement in a visa document by underpaying her said Arshack is the one who doesn't have the facts straight. The salvos came a day after the chief federal prosecutor in Manhattan, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, lashed out at those questioning the legitimacy of the case, which has infuriated Indian society and led to repercussions from the Indian government.
