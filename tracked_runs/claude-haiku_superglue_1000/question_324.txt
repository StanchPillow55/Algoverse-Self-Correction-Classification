Question:
Passage: Washington (CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie opted for a special election to fill a newly vacant Senate seat through 2014 instead of appointing a replacement through that time, saying the decision was about giving voters "a choice and a voice in the process" and was not driven by political self-interest. While the Republican's decision for a special October ballot could help him avoid stronger Democratic turnout in his re-election bid a month later, it also opens him up to criticism from his own party that is on the short end of the balance of power in the Senate.

Response:
To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given information and make logical inferences to determine the most appropriate response.

Given information:
- New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has decided to hold a special election in October to fill the vacant Senate seat, rather than appointing a replacement.
- Christie claims his decision is not politically motivated, but rather to give voters a choice and a voice in the process.
- However, the decision could help Christie avoid stronger Democratic turnout in his own re-election bid a month later.
- The opposition has criticized Christie's decision, asserting that he is wasting taxpayer money to protect his own political ambitions.

Reasoning:
1. The opposition's claim that Christie is wasting taxpayer money to protect his own ambitions is a reasonable inference, given the potential political benefits of the special election timing for Christie's re-election bid.
2. However, Christie's stated reason of giving voters a choice and a voice in the process is also a valid consideration. Allowing the electorate to directly choose the new senator could be seen as a more democratic approach.
3. Ultimately, it is difficult to definitively determine whether Christie's decision was primarily motivated by political self-interest
