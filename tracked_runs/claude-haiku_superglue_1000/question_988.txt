Question:
Passage: By Sam Webb Assisted suicide: Rogue trader Nick Leeson, whose risky investments destroyed Barings Bank, has admitted he contemplated paying two men with Mafia connections to kill him in prison The man who became a symbol of the excess, macho culture and greed of stock market trading has admitted he considered paying a hitman to murder him in prison. 'Rogue Trader' Nick Leeson, in an interview with CNN, spoke of the dark period of his life in a German cell. Leeson's risk-taking deals led to an £827million loss and single-handedly destroyed the centuries-old Barings Bank. A Watford schoolboy-turned-City whizzkid, Mr Leeson's early career was a success and he was promoted within the bank, but things began to unravel when he started making losses while trading in Singapore and used a secret account to hide them.
