Question:
Passage: By David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor PUBLISHED: 12:51 EST, 4 March 2014 | UPDATED: 14:47 EST, 4 March 2014 Much of President Obama's 2015 budget proposal won't get through the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, but the White House has unveiled it anyway â€“ a liberal Democratic wish list of policies, many of which the GOP has already nixed or refused to take up. The White House said Tuesday that the president's budget, all $3.901 trillion of it, would fully fund Obamacare, raise the national minimum wage to $10.10 per hour and index it to inflation, vastly expand infrastructure-repair plans that benefit labor unions, and significantly reduces the size of the U.S. standing army.
@highlight
Wish list is likely dead-on-arrival in the GOP-controlled House of Representatives
@highlight
It would formalize a national minimum wage hike while enforcing the 'Buffett Rule' that sets minimum actual income tax levels for millionaires
@highlight
Obama has eliminated cuts to Social Security that he promised as part of last year's budget negotiation
@highlight
He also wants more than $300 billion in infrastructure improvements, helping labor unions in an election year
@highlight
Paul Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, slammed the White House budget, saying it's a 'campaign brochure,' not a practical list

Query: Another hit to the wealthiest @placeholder will come in the elimination of a specialized 'carried interest' provision in the federal tax code.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the information provided in the passage.

The passage discusses President Obama's 2015 budget proposal, which includes several policy proposals that are likely to face opposition from the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. One of the proposals mentioned is the elimination of a specialized "carried interest" provision in the federal tax code, which would be "another hit to the wealthiest."

To determine the final answer, we need to understand what the "carried interest" provision is and how its elimination would impact the wealthiest individuals.

Carried Interest Provision:
The carried interest provision in the tax code allows certain investment managers, such as private equity and hedge fund managers, to have their compensation taxed at the capital gains rate (currently 20%) rather than the higher ordinary income tax rate (up to 37%). This is because the carried interest is considered a share of the investment's profits, rather than regular compensation.

Elimination of the Carried Interest Provision:
If the carried interest provision is eliminated, the investment managers' compensation would be taxed at the higher ordinary income tax rate instead of the lower capital gains rate. This would result in a higher tax burden for the wealthiest

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the information provided in the passage, and then use that to determine the impact on the wealthiest individuals.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that the president's 2015 budget proposal includes the elimination of a specialized "carried interest" provision in the federal tax code.
- This is described as "another hit to the wealthiest" individuals.

Reasoning:
The "carried interest" provision in the tax code is a loophole that allows certain investment managers, such as hedge fund and private equity managers, to pay a lower tax rate on their income. Typically, this income would be taxed as ordinary income, which has a higher tax rate. However, the carried interest provision allows them to have this income taxed at the lower capital gains tax rate.

By eliminating this provision, the wealthiest individuals who have been benefiting from this loophole will now have to pay a higher tax rate on their income. This will result in a higher tax burden for them, which is described as "another hit to the wealthiest" in the passage.

Final answer:
The elimination of the "carried interest" provision in the federal tax code

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of "carried interest" and how it relates to the federal tax code.

Carried interest is a share of the profits of an investment fund that is paid to the fund's investment managers, typically as compensation. This compensation is often taxed at the capital gains rate, which is lower than the ordinary income tax rate.

The elimination of this specialized "carried interest" provision in the federal tax code would mean that the investment managers would have to pay taxes on their compensation at the higher ordinary income tax rate, rather than the lower capital gains rate.

This would result in an increase in the taxes paid by the wealthiest individuals, as they are the ones who typically receive this type of compensation.

To calculate the impact of this change, we would need to know the specific details of the carried interest provision, such as the current tax rate, the proposed tax rate, and the amount of income that is affected by this provision.

However, without these specific details, we cannot provide a precise calculation of the impact. The passage simply states that this change would be "another hit to the wealthiest," but does not provide enough information to quantify the impact.

Therefore, the final answer is:
