Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- A soccer whistle-blower has criticized FIFA's "culture of self-protection" after the world governing body rejected her claim over a breach of confidentiality as the World Cup bidding saga rumbled on. "Woe be to any other person who cares enough to risk personal safety to report FIFA corruption," said Phaedra Al-Majid, who was in charge of international media relations for the Qatar 2022 bid until 2010, in a public statement. Al-Majid along with another whistle-blower -- Australian Bonita Mersiades -- gave evidence to American lawyer Michael Garcia, who has investigated the bidding process surrounding the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.
