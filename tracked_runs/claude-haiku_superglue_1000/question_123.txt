Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the placeholder in the given passage.

Given information:
- Tom Daley won the gold medal at the Commonwealth Games with a score of 516.55.
- The passage mentions that Daley secured his win in his fifth dive with a "superb back 3.5 somersault".

To find the value of the placeholder, we need to determine the score for the back 3.5 somersault dive.

The total score of 516.55 is the sum of the scores from all the dives. We can assume that the back 3.5 somersault dive was the fifth dive, as mentioned in the passage.

Let's denote the score for the back 3.5 somersault dive as "x".

The total score can be expressed as the sum of the scores from the first four dives and the score for the back 3.5 somersault dive:

516.55 = (sum of scores from first four dives) + x

Since we don't have the individual scores for the first four dives, we can't determine the exact value of "x".
