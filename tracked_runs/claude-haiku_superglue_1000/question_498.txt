Question:
Passage: Atlanta (CNN) -- He once walked through fire; now, he's using fire to forge a September 11 memorial. Artist, sculptor and former Marine firefighter Curtis James Miller will unveil his memorial Sunday, the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks, in an Atlanta suburb. He recently spoke to CNN about his work; here's an edited transcript of that interview: CNN: Tell me a little about how this project started. Curtis James Miller: Doug Harms, who works with (the) DeKalb (County) Fire (Department), approached me about doing this memorial. I guess he saw my work online. So, he contacted me and told me about his idea to do a memorial outside the fire station using a piece of Trade Center steel. From the time we spoke, I kind of had one idea stuck in my head: the phoenix wing, rising out of the ashes.
