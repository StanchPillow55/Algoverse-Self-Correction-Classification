Question:
Passage: Two of Muhammad Ali's daughters have played down concerns regarding the former heavyweight boxing champion's health. Ali, often regarded as one of the greatest fighters of all time, was diagnosed with Parkinson's syndrome in 1984 and speculation has been rife in recent years that his condition is deteriorating. He appeared frail while attending the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics, while his brother, Rahman, said in an interview in February last year that his sibling could die within days. Ali recently posted a picture on Twitter with the caption: 'Don't believe the hype. Feeling great earlier today' Ali makes a face in New York ahead of his Rumble in the Jungle with George Foreman in 1974

The progression of Parkinson's disease is typically divided into five stages:
- Stage 1: Mild symptoms that generally do not interfere with daily activities.
- Stage 2: Symptoms worsen, and there is bilateral involvement (both sides of the body).
