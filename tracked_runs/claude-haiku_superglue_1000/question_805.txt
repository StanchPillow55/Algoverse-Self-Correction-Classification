Question:
Passage: It has been 16 years since Hearts and Rangers have arguably played in a match of such magnitude. It’s mere coincidence that the game would also be Ally McCoist’s last appearance as a player in the Light Blue. The Tynecastle club triumphed 2-1 on that occasion, lifting the Scottish Cup to end a 36-year trophy drought. Tomorrow, the stakes are rather different — as are the circumstances of both clubs. A win for either could go a long way to deciding the destination of the Championship title and an automatic ticket back to the top flight from which they had plunged in varying states of disarray.

Hearts take on Rangers in Scottish Championship top of the table clash
@highlight
Tynecastle club can open a nine-point advantage over Rangers with a win
@highlight
Former Maroons defender Gary Naysmith: 'If Hearts win, I don’t see them losing a nine-point lead'

Query: But it’s an even bigger game for @placeholder, because they know losing would see them fall so far behind.
