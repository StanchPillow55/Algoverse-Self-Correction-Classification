Question:
Passage: Graham Dorrans remembers the moment vividly. He was at West Bromwich Albion’s Birmingham Road training ground when the phone call came that would put his life on hold. His baby daughter was in hospital with suspected meningitis. ‘It was pre-season and we’d been training,’ recalls Dorrans. ‘I got a shout that Ava had been taken into hospital but my doctor told me it was nothing to worry about so it was a real shock when I got there and saw her. It was clear it was serious. She was three months old, so fragile.’ It had been just two years since he and wife Yvonne had lost their second child, Logan, to stillbirth. Was this really happening again?
