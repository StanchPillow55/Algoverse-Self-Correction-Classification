Passage: By Associated Press Reporter PUBLISHED: 14:41 EST, 4 August 2013 | UPDATED: 14:48 EST, 4 August 2013 Three million Time Warner Cable customers in New York, Los Angeles, Dallas and other cities remained without access to CBS on Sunday, meaning they could miss Tiger Woods' attempt to win the Bridgestone Invitational. The cable provider cut off CBS for viewers in those markets on Friday, saying the network is demanding retransmission fees that are out of line with what it pays other broadcasters. CBS says it's never been dropped by a cable provider before and that it has successfully negotiated deals with other providers including AT&T, Cablevision, Comcast, DirecTV and Verizon.
