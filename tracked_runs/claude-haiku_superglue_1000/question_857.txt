Question:
Passage: TV show Undercover Boss has caused outrage among viewers after it featured a sports bar where the CEO fired a bartender for refusing to wear just her bikini top on camera and gave a waitress a 'work incentive' of free implants. Sunday night's episode focused on Bikinis Sports Bar and Grill, an establishment which prides itself on waitresses and bartenders who dress in bikini tops, jean shorts and cowboy boots and is a trademarked 'breastaurant'. CEO Doug Guller disguised himself to go undercover at one restaurant of his chain which has several locations in Texas, Oklahoma and North Carolina. Guller has said that his restaurant focuses on four things - booze, food, sports and sex - and boasted that makes it 'recession-proof'.
