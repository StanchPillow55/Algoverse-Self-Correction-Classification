Question:
Passage: The Keenan family are living in the wrong era. From their retro wardrobes to every single room and appliance in their house - they eat, breathe and live the 1950s lifestyle - today. The Keenans’ home is decked out with vintage appliances that colour coordinate with the 50s wallpaper. And then there's the outfits and hair do's. It's a style that Pixie Keenan, from Sydney, has been embracing for more than 30 years. ‘I dress like this every day and have done so since the age of 15,’ Mrs Keenan told Daily Mail Australia.
