Question:
Passage: Alan Pardew protested it was only the result that mattered in his first match against Newcastle since he quit the North-East — but the manner in which he celebrated Fraizer Campbell’s equaliser suggested it meant more to him than that. The 53-year-old was delighted after substitutes Yannick Bolasie and Campbell combined to cancel out Papiss Cisse’s first-half header. But the game was tarnished as a coin thrown from the stands hit Fabricio Coloccini, which furious Newcastle manager John Carver claimed could have blinded his defender. Palace substitute Fraizer Campbell toe-poked the ball home from close range on 71 minutes to earn the hosts a point against Newcastle
