Question:
Paragraph: Mike and Jeff are close friends. Their school is having a guessing game to guess how many gumballs are in a box. If they get the right amount they win $100. If they get close they get a $20 gift card. The box looks like it is missing some gumballs. It turns out some people are eating them when they place their guess. 100 people guessed and took a piece of candy. The box is 10" by 10" by 10". Each gumball is 1" each. Mike guessed 500. Jeff guessed 800. They both said they would split their money they win, if they win.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the volume of the box and then calculate the number of gumballs that can fit inside it.

Given information:
- The box is 10" by 10" by 10".
- Each gumball is 1" each.
- 100 people guessed and took a piece of candy.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the box.
Volume of the box = Length × Width × Height
Volume of the box = 10" × 10" × 10" = 1,000 cubic inches

Step 2: Calculate the volume of one gumball.
Volume of one gumball = 1" × 1" × 1" = 1 cubic inch

Step 3: Calculate the maximum number of gumballs that can fit in the box.
Maximum number of gumballs = Volume of the box / Volume of one gumball
Maximum number of gumballs = 1,000 cubic inches / 1 cubic inch = 1,000 gumballs

Step 4: Adjust the maximum number of gumballs to account for the 100 people who gu

Response:
To make an educated guess about the number of gumballs in the box, we can use the given information to calculate the approximate volume of the box and the volume of each gumball, then estimate the number of gumballs that can fit in the box.

Given information:
- The box is 10" by 10" by 10".
- Each gumball is 1" each.
- 100 people guessed and took a piece of candy.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the box.
Volume of the box = Length × Width × Height
Volume of the box = 10" × 10" × 10" = 1,000 cubic inches

Step 2: Calculate the volume of each gumball.
Volume of each gumball = 1" × 1" × 1" = 1 cubic inch

Step 3: Estimate the number of gumballs that can fit in the box.
Number of gumballs = Volume of the box / Volume of each gumball
Number of gumballs = 1,000 cubic inches / 1 cubic inch = 1,000 gumballs
