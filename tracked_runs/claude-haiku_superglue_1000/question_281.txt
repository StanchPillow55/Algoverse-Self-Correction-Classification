Question:
Passage: Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- Despite all the questions surrounding the war in Afghanistan, congressional Democrats have not challenged the administration's policies since President Obama announced a surge of troops in 2009. The release of classified documents about the war by the website WikiLeaks seemed to have no impact on Capitol Hill. The same week that the documents were released, the House approved legislation with almost no debate that will provide tens of billions of dollars for the war effort. Even though the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is chaired by John Kerry, who entered the national spotlight in the 1970s with his riveting testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about the problems with the war in Vietnam, the panel has been relatively quiescent.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the missing word in the given query.

Given information:
- The passage discusses the lack of congressional opposition to the war in Afghanistan, despite the release of classified documents by WikiLeaks.
- The query mentions the "intensity of the opposition" in a certain location, which is missing.

To find the missing word, we need to analyze the context of the passage and the query.

The passage does not mention any specific location where there was intense opposition to the war. It focuses on the lack of opposition in Congress, particularly from the Democratic party.

The query seems to be referring to a different situation, possibly a past war, where there was intense opposition from across the political spectrum.

Based on this analysis, the most likely missing word in the query is "Vietnam". The passage mentions the war in Vietnam, and the query appears to be referring to the intense opposition to that war.

Therefore, the complete query would be:

"Most remarkable was the intensity of the opposition in Vietnam that came from across the political spectrum."

This aligns with the context of the passage, which discusses the lack of similar opposition in the current war in Afghanistan.

Final answer: Vietnam

Response:
To solve this problem, I will need to fill in the missing information in the query. The query states that the most remarkable thing was the intensity of the opposition in "@placeholder" that came from across the political spectrum. 

Based on the passage, the most relevant context seems to be the lack of opposition in Congress to the administration's policies in the war in Afghanistan, despite the release of classified documents by WikiLeaks. 

Therefore, the missing information in the "@placeholder" is likely referring to the Vietnam War, not the war in Afghanistan.

The passage mentions that the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, chaired by John Kerry, who had previously provided "riveting testimony" about the problems with the Vietnam War, has been "relatively quiescent" regarding the war in Afghanistan.

This suggests that the intensity of the opposition in the Vietnam War, which is the "placeholder" in the query, was much more pronounced compared to the lack of opposition in Congress regarding the war in Afghanistan.

So the complete query would be:

"Most remarkable was the intensity of the opposition in the Vietnam War that came from across the political spectrum."

The reasoning and work is as follows:

1. Identified the missing information in the "@placeholder" as likely
