Question:
Passage: Hull put the damp squib of 2014 behind them in spectacular fashion by running roughshod over a miserable Everton in a manner not properly reflected by the scoreline. Ahmed Elmohamady and former Toffee Nikica Jelavic scored the first-half goals that secured the points although Hull’s star man was their Uruguayan forward Abel Hernandez, who dazzled with his best performance of the season at the heart of everything good about the hosts. And then there was Everton; poor, sorry, shambolically defensive Everton, losing a fourth game on the bounce to leave their campaign beached if not quite mired in a relegation battle. They improved from woeful in the first half to mediocre in the second but something is badly awry in Roberto Martinez’s team and needs fixing, quickly.
