Question:
Context: Sahara -- The desert comprises much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and Sudan. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains. To the south, it is bounded by the Sahel, a belt of semi-arid tropical savanna around the Niger River valley and the Sudan Region of Sub-Saharan Africa. The Sahara can be divided into several regions including: the western Sahara, the central Ahaggar Mountains, the Tibesti Mountains, the Aïr Mountains, the Ténéré desert, and the Libyan Desert.

=== Turn 1 ===


Response:
To determine if the Sahara desert stretches across the northern half of Africa, we need to consider the geographical extent of the desert and compare it to the overall size of the African continent.

Given information:
- The Sahara desert comprises much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and Sudan.
- The Sahara desert stretches from the Red Sea in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, and is bounded by the Sahel region to the south.

Step 1: Determine the approximate north-south extent of the Sahara desert.
The Sahara desert is bounded by the Mediterranean Sea in the north and the Sahel region in the south. The Sahel region is a belt of semi-arid tropical savanna around the Niger River valley and the Sudan Region of Sub-Saharan Africa.

Based on the given information, the Sahara desert covers a significant portion of the northern half of the African continent, but it does not stretch across the entire northern half.
