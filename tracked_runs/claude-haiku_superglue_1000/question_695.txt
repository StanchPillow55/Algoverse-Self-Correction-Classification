Question:
Passage: The shaking of Welsh heads said it all. Warren Gatland’s side trudged off the field at the Millennium Stadium after a victory that felt more like defeat. Such a performance against the All Blacks next week will only end one way. The Kiwis will provide a far more brutal assessment of Welsh mettle than this spirited Fijian bunch who survive on a shoe-string budget and almost snatched a famous victory – despite playing just under half an hour with 14-men after a red card to Campese Ma’afu. If Warren Gatland and his selection panel were using this fixture as a trial ahead of the New Zealand Test, then only full back Liam Williams put his hand up. Too many of his colleagues in the red jersey were anonymous and the big guns – notably Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones – will be welcomed back to the starting XV with open arms.
