To solve this problem, I will need to fill in the missing word in the given statement. Based on the context provided in the passage, the missing word is likely to be "O'Neill" since the passage mentions that Quinlan, O'Neill, and Cooper were involved in the fight.

The complete statement with the missing word filled in would be:

Locals rushed to try and break up the fight as Quinlan and his friends O'Neill and Cooper piled in to the melee.

To arrive at this answer, I have reasoned as follows:

1. The passage states that the fight involved "former Grand National jockey Sean Quinlan and two of his friends" - one of whom is named as "race horse trainer Paul O'Neill".
2. The passage also mentions a third person involved, named "Luke Cooper".
3. The statement provided has a placeholder for one of the names of Quinlan's friends, which based on the information in the passage, is most likely "O'Neill".

Therefore, the complete statement with the missing word filled in is:

Locals rushed to try and break up the fight as Quinlan and his friends O'Neill and Cooper piled in
