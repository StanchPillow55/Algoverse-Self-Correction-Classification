Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- Hurricane Sandy could affect as many as 60 million people across the eastern U.S. according to power officials. While some will only loose power, the strong winds, storm surge and pelting rain may cause unprecedented damage for others. Relief organizations are readying supplies and volunteers to respond as needed. Red Cross has opened 190 shelters along the Eastern Seaboard and has hundreds of disaster workers on standby with emergency supplies. "Red cross will be here for weeks to come. This is a large-scale disaster response," Red Cross spokeswoman Catherine Barde told CNN. "And really we rely on the generosity of volunteers and the public to be able to support such service, whether it's shelters, mass feeding, all of the services that we are going to be providing.

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of lives claimed by Hurricane Sandy across the affected regions.

Given information:
- Hurricane Sandy could affect as many as 60 million people across the eastern U.S.
- The query states that Hurricane Sandy claimed at least 67 lives, 51 in Haiti, as it crossed the region last week.

Total lives claimed = 67

Therefore, the total number of lives claimed by Hurricane Sandy is at least 67.

Final answer: Hurricane Sandy claimed at least 67 lives across the affected regions.
