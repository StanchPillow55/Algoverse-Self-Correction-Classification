Question:
Passage: (CNN) -- At first, the children's eyes light up with anticipation. Christmas comes early. Tanzanian students celebrate receiving Books for Africa textbooks. Then they stare in wonder. Some reach out and cradle the object as if it were treasure to be guarded. Others lift it up in triumph, singing and dancing in joy. The gift that inspires this kind of marvel in many African children is none other than a simple schoolbook. Books are so rare in many African countries that children celebrate receiving them as if it were Christmas morning, says Brad Mattson, a manager for Books for Africa, a nonprofit group that ships donated books to African countries.
