## 🔍 **DETAILED ANALYSIS BY DOMAIN**

### **1. SuperGLUE (Language Understanding)**
- **Ensemble Performance**: 2.0% (Poor)

## 🎭 **FAILURE MODE ANALYSIS**

### **Ensemble Voting Failures:**
1. **Static Responses**: Cannot iteratively improve reasoning
2. **Averaging Effect**: Correct minority answers get overruled
3. **Consensus Bias**: Multiple models can share the same systematic errors
4. **Limited Context**: Each model operates independently

### **Multi-Turn Self-Correction Failures:**
1. **Single Model Bias**: Inherits specific model limitations
2. **Confirmation Loops**: May reinforce incorrect initial responses
3. **Context Length**: Limited by single model's context window
4. **Catastrophic Errors**: Single point of failure
