# API Keys Verification Summary

**Date:** September 20, 2025 at 09:23 UTC  
**Status:** ✅ BOTH APIs ARE NOW WORKING  

## Previous Status
Based on test files from September 18, 2025:
- ✅ **OpenAI API**: Working correctly
- ❌ **Claude/Anthropic API**: Authentication issues (improper environment variable loading)

## Current Status (After Re-testing)

### OpenAI API Status: ✅ FUNCTIONAL
- **API Key**: Present and valid (ends with: ...9kK0oA)
- **Model**: gpt-4o-mini
- **Test Results**: 5/5 successful API calls
- **Response Quality**: All math questions answered correctly
- **Issues**: None

#### Test Details:
- Math question: 15 + 27 = ✓ 42
- Math question: 6 × 7 = ✓ 42  
- Math question: 100 ÷ 4 = ✓ 25
- Math question: 2³ = ✓ 8
- Word problem: Pizza slices = ✓ 5

### Claude/Anthropic API Status: ✅ FUNCTIONAL
- **API Key**: Present and valid (ends with: ...FEHwAA)
- **Model**: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 (with deprecation warning)
- **Test Results**: 5/5 successful API calls
- **Response Quality**: All questions answered correctly with detailed explanations
- **Issues**: Model deprecation warning (will reach end-of-life October 22, 2025)

#### Test Details:
- Math question: 10 + 5 = ✓ 15
- Math question: 8 × 3 = ✓ 24
- Math question: 20 ÷ 4 = ✓ 5
- Geography: Capital of France = ✓ Paris
- Color mixing: Red + Yellow = ✓ Orange

## Key Findings

### Issue Resolution
The Claude API authentication issues were resolved by:
1. **Proper Environment Loading**: Using `load_dotenv()` to read the .env file
2. **Explicit API Key Passing**: Passing the API key explicitly to `Anthropic(api_key=api_key)`
3. **Updated Model ID**: Using correct model identifier

### API Key Status
- Both API keys are present in `.env` file
- Both keys are valid and functional
- No rate limiting or quota issues detected

### Recommendations
1. **Update Claude Model**: Migrate from `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` to a newer model before October 22, 2025
2. **Monitor Usage**: Both APIs are consuming tokens/credits with each call
3. **Environment Loading**: Ensure all scripts use `load_dotenv()` for proper environment variable loading

## Files Updated
- ✅ `openai_api_test_results.json` - Updated with current test results
- ✅ `claude_api_test_results.json` - New file with working Claude test results  
- ✅ `test_claude_api_fixed.py` - Fixed Claude test script with proper environment loading

## Conclusion
**VERIFICATION COMPLETE: Both API keys are functional and working correctly.**

The previous issues with the Claude API were due to improper environment variable loading in the test script, not invalid API keys. Both services are now confirmed to be operational.
