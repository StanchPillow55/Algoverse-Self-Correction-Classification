Code-Specific Coaching Templates

This module provides targeted coaching templates for code generation tasks,
designed to address specific cognitive biases identified in programming responses.

Each template provides actionable guidance tailored to common programming mistakes
and cognitive biases that affect code quality.

The examples are just illustrations - your code needs to handle the entire problem space:

1. What is the core logic, independent of example values?

Your solution uses familiar patterns that might not be optimal for this specific problem:

1. What other algorithms or data structures could solve this?
