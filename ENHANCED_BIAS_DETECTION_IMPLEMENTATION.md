## 🧠 Cognitive Bias Detection Improvements

### **Anchoring Bias**
- **Before**: Text search for numbers in extracted code
- **After**: Detects hardcoded values from problem examples, copied variable names, structural copying
- **Example**: Catches `return "flower"[:2]` when problem examples use "flower"

### **Availability Heuristic** 
- **Before**: Text search for "everyone", "commonly" in code
- **After**: Detects C-style loops, repeated patterns across turns, unnecessary complexity
- **Example**: Catches `for i in range(len(numbers))` when better patterns exist

### **Bandwagon Effect**
- **Before**: Combined with availability
- **After**: Separate detection for trendy patterns without justification, social proof language
- **Example**: Catches unnecessary f-strings, complex comprehensions without clear benefit

### **Hindsight Bias**
- **Before**: Text search for "obvious because" in code  
- **After**: Detects overconfident reasoning that failed execution, post-hoc rationalization
- **Example**: Catches "This will definitely work" followed by test failures

### **Overgeneralization**
- **Before**: Text search for "always", "never" in code
- **After**: Detects rigid patterns, missing edge case handling, inflexible assumptions
- **Example**: Catches hardcoded length checks, missing empty input handling

## 🎯 Code-Specific Coaching Templates

### **Template Categories**
- **Anchoring**: `counter_anchor_code_v1`, `generalize_from_examples_v1`
- **Availability**: `explore_alternatives_v1`, `match_pattern_to_problem_v1`
- **Bandwagon**: `justify_choices_v1`, `simple_over_trendy_v1`
- **Hindsight**: `test_assumptions_v1`, `debug_systematically_v1`
- **Overgeneralization**: `handle_edge_cases_v1`, `flexible_patterns_v1`
- **Logic-error**: `step_by_step_debug_v1`, `verify_requirements_v1`

### **Sample Coaching Messages**

**Anchoring → `counter_anchor_code_v1`**:
> "Don't hardcode values from the examples. Step back and identify the general pattern or algorithm needed. What would work for ANY valid input, not just the given examples?"

**Availability → `explore_alternatives_v1`**:
> "Consider alternative approaches beyond your first instinct. What other algorithms or data structures could solve this? Challenge yourself to think of at least 2 different approaches."

**Overgeneralization → `handle_edge_cases_v1`**:
> "Consider edge cases and exceptions to make your solution robust. What happens with empty inputs or single elements? Make your solution flexible enough to handle the full range of possible inputs."
