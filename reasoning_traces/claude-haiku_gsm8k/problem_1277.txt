Question: Mia and Emma are currently 16 years apart in age. If Mia, who is younger than Emma, is 40 years old, what's the average of their ages?

Reference Answer: If Mia is 40 years old, Emma is 40+16 = <<40+16=56>>56 years old.
The sum of their ages is 56+40 = <<56+40=96>>96 years
The average age of the two is 96/2 = <<96/2=48>>48 years
