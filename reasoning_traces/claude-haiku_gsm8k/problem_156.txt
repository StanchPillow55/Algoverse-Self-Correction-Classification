Question: The zookeeper feeds all the apes in the zoo. He orders all the bananas from a local farm every 2 months. If the monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas need 400 bananas, and the baboons need 100 bananas every month, how many bananas does he need to order to last for 2 months?

Reference Answer: The total number of bananas the prime apes need every month is 200+400+100= <<200+400+100=700>>700.
Therefore in 2 months, the total number of bananas they need is 700x2= <<700*2=1400>>1400.
