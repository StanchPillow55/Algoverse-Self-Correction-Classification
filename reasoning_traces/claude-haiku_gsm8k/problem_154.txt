Reference Answer: Kimo spends 3 x 1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours in class on any given Monday, Wednesday or Friday.
Each week, he spends 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 hours in class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
In one semester, he spends 9 x 16 = <<9*16=144>>144 hours in class for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
He spends 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours in class on any given Tuesday or Thursday.
Each week, he spends 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 hours in class on Tuesday and Thursday.
In one semester, he spends 8 x 16 = <<8*16=128>>128 hours in class on Tuesday and Thursday.
In total for one semester, Kimo spends 144 + 128 = <<144+128=272>>272 hours attending classes.
