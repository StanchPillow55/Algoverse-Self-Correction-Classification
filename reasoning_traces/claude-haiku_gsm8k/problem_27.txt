Question: Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night.  She buys cartons of ice cream with 15 servings of ice cream per carton at a cost of $4.00 per carton.  After 60 days, how much will she spend on ice cream?

Reference Answer: Each container of ice cream has 15 servings and she eats 1 serving a night so after 60 days she will need 60/15 = 4 containers of ice cream
If each carton costs $4.00 and she needs 4 containers then it will cost her 4*4 = $<<4*4=16.00>>16.00
