Question: Ducks need to eat 3.5 pounds of insects each week to survive. If there is a flock of ten ducks, how many pounds of insects do they need per day?

Reference Answer: The flock needs 35 pounds per week because 10 x 3.5 = <<10*3.5=35>>35
They need 5 pounds per day because 35 / 7 = <<35/7=5>>5
