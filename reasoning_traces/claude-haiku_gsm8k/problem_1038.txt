Question: Jim decides to go to college to earn some more money.  It takes him 4 years to finish and he gets $50,000 in loans per year.  If he had a 25k a year job before college and his college degree tripled his income, how long would it take to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

Reference Answer: His salary increased to 25000*3=$<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 per year
So he earns an extra 75,000-25,000=$<<75000-25000=50000>>50,000 a year
His loan cost 50,000*4=$<<50000*4=200000>>200,000
He lost out on 25,000*4=$<<25000*4=100000>>100,000 from not working
So he needs to make 200,000+100,000=$<<200000+100000=300000>>300,000
That means it will take 300,000/50,000=<<300000/50000=6>>6 years
