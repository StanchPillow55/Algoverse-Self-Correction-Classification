Question: James buys a new wardrobe.  He buys 10 suits and 10 dress pants.  He also buys 3 dress shirts per suit.  The suits cost $750 each and the dress pants cost 1/5 that cost.  The dress shirts were $60 each.  How much did everything cost?

Reference Answer: The suits cost 750*10=$<<750*10=7500>>7500
The dress pants cost 750/5=$<<750/5=150>>150 each
So in total they cost 150*10=$<<150*10=1500>>1500
He bought 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 dress shirts
so he spends 30*60=$<<30*60=1800>>1800 on dress shirts
Thus the total cost is 7500+1500+1800=$<<7500+1500+1800=10800>>10,800
#### 10,800
