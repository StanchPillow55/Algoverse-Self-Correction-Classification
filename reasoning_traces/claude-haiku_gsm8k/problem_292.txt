Question: Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes for an online task she does. If she works between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. and pauses in between for half an hour, how much money does she earn for the online task?

Reference Answer: Because she rests for half an hour, the time she works is 11 - 8 - 0.5 = <<11-8-0.5=2.5>>2.5 hours.
So she works 2.5 * 60 = <<2.5*60=150>>150 minutes
She earns $5 per 10 minutes, so for the online task she earns in total 150 * 5/10=$<<150*5/10=75>>75.
