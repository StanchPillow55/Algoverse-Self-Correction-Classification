Question: Jen works for 7.5 hours a day 6 days a week. Her hourly rate is $1.5. Jen also receives an additional $10 if she has complete attendance. Suppose Jen did not incur any absences for  April, and there are exactly 4 weeks in April, how much will she receive?

Reference Answer: In a week, Jen works for 7.5 hours/day x 6 days = <<7.5*6=45>>45 hours/week
So in a month, she works for 45 hours/week x 4 weeks = <<45*4=180>>180 hours.
180 hours of work is equal to 180 hours x $1.5 = $<<180*1.5=270>>270.
Since she has complete attendance, she will receive a total of $270 + $10 = $<<270+10=280>>280.
