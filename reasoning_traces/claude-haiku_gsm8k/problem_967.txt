Question: Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. What is the total age of all three of the family members?

Reference Answer: Nani's brother is 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 years old.
Nani's sister is 25/100 * 8 = <<25/100*8=2>>2 years younger than he is.
That means she is 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 years old.
In total all mentioned family members, are 16 + 6 + 8 = <<16+6+8=30>>30 years old.
