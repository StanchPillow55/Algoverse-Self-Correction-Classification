Question: The amount of water passing through a river at one point in time is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles at the same point. If the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases by 6000 gallons on the third day, calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point.

Reference Answer: After a day of rain, the volume of water in the river passing at one point in time doubled to 2*4000 = <<2*4000=8000>>8000 gallons.
After more heavy rains, the volume of water passing through the river on the third day is 8000+6000 = <<8000+6000=14000>>14000 gallons.
