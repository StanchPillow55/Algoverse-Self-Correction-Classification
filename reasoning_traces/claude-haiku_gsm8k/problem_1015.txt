Question: Anne purchased a box of sweets that contains 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. She kept two packs and gave the rest to her 10 friends equally. How many pieces of sweets did each of her friends receive?

Reference Answer: After Anne kept 2 packs, there were only 15 - 2 = <<15-2=13>>13 packs left.
Therefore, there were 13 x 60 = <<13*60=780>>780 pieces of sweets left.
So, each of her 10 friends received 780 / 10 = <<780/10=78>>78 pieces of sweets.
