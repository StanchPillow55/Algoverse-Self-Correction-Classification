Question: James has to buy insurance.  Since he had an accident it was 60% more than normal.  The normal cost is $120 a month.  How much does he pay a year?

Reference Answer: The insurance is 120*.6=$<<120*.6=72>>72 per month more expensive than normal
So he paid 120+72=$<<120+72=192>>192 a month
That means he pays 12*192=$<<12*192=2304>>2304
