Question: Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes cost. If her shoes cost $80, how much did her bag cost?

Reference Answer: First triple the cost of the shoes: $80 * 3 = $<<80*3=240>>240
Then subtract $20 to find the cost of the handbag: $240 - $20 = $<<240-20=220>>220
#### 220
