Question: Rita hand-picks Junebugs off of her plants every summer.  On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.  On both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday.  Thursday she removed 48 and on Friday she removed 57.  What is the average number of Junebugs that she removes per day?

Reference Answer: On both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as the 39 on Monday so she removed 2*39 = <<2*39=78>>78 Junebugs
All total she has removed 39+78+78+48+57 = <<39+78+78+48+57=300>>300 Junebugs
She has removed 300 Junebugs over 5 days so she has removed, on average 300/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 Junebugs per day
