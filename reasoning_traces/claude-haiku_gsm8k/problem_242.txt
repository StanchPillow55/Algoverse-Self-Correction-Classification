Question: Mike was a pen pal with 5 people.  He stopped being penpals with 2 of them.  They each send 2 letters a week that are 5 pages long.  He responds in kind.  He can write a page every 6 minutes.  How many hours does he spend writing a week?

Reference Answer: He is penpals with 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 people
Thus he gets 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 letters a week
So he writes 6*5=<<6*5=30>>30 pages a week
So he writes for 30*6=<<30*6=180>>180 minutes a week
So he writes 180/60=<<180/60=3>>3 hours a week
