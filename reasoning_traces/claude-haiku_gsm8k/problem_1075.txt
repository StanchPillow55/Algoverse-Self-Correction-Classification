Question: Jenny goes to the florist to buy some flowers. Roses cost $2 each and $15 for a dozen. If she bought 15 roses and arrived with five 5 dollar bills and they only have quarters for change, how many quarters does she leave with?

Reference Answer: Jenny has $25 because 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25
She buys 1 dozen roses and 3 single roses because 15 - 12 - 3 = <<15-12-3=0>>0
She spends $6 on the single roses because 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6
She spends $21 on roses because 15 + 6 = <<15+6=21>>21
She gets $4 in change because 25 - 21 = <<25-21=4>>4
She gets 16 quarters because 4 x 4 = <<4*4=16>>16
