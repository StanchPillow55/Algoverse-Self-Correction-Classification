Question: Two friends are playing pick-up sticks. While playing, they noticed that there are 9 red sticks, and 5 more blue sticks than red. Also, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. How many sticks do they have?

Reference Answer: There are 9 + 5 = <<9+5=14>>14 blue sticks.
There are 14 - 3 = <<14-3=11>>11 yellow sticks.
There are a total of 9 + 14 + 11 = <<9+14+11=34>>34 sticks.
