Question: Steve loves playing video games.  His parents get him a console along with 5 games for his birthday.  He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the following year he starts buying 2 games a month.  For the third year he buys 4 games a month as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year.  How many games does Steve have after 3 years?

Reference Answer: Steve buys 1 game a month his first year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*1=<<1*12=12>>12 games
Steve then buys 2 games per month for a year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*2=<<2*12=24>>24 games
Steve then buys 4 games per month for a year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*4=<<4*12=48>>48 games
Steve also gets 5 games for Christmas each year for three years, for another 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 games.
In total over three years, Steve gets 12+24+48+15=<<12+24+48+15=99>>99 games
Since Steve started with 5 games, he has 5+99=<<5+99=104>>104 games after 3 years
