Question: To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. How much money would Sam have to spend to make 4 liters of juice?

Reference Answer: To make 4 liters of juice, Sam needs 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 kilograms of oranges.
If one kilogram of oranges costs $3, then 20 kilograms would cost 20 * 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60.
