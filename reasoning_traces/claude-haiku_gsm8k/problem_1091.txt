Question: An apple orchard sells apples in bags of 10. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples one day. How much did an orchard earn for selling this at $5 per bag?

Reference Answer: There were 2000/10 = <<2000/10=200>>200 bags of apples sold.
Therefore, the orchard earned 200 x $5 = $<<200*5=1000>>1000.
