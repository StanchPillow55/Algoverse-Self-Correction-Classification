Question: Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared 4 pizzas. Each pizza had 8 slices. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did. Silvia ate twice as many slices than Jake did. If Becky ate 10 slices, how many total slices did they eat?

Reference Answer: Jake ate 10-3 = <<10-3=7>>7 slices of pizza.
Silvia ate 7*2 = <<7*2=14>>14 slices of pizza.
Jake, Silvia, and Becky ate 10+7+14 = <<10+7+14=31>>31 slices all together.
