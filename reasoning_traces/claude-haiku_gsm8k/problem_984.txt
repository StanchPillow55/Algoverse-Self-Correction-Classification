Question: Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Reference Answer: Pat's flower bed is 111 feet / 1.5 feet per plant = <<111/1.5=74>>74 plants needed.
Pat needs to buy 74 plants - 17 plants = <<74-17=57>>57 plants needed to purchase.
Pat will spend 57 plants * $6 = $<<57*6=342>>342.
