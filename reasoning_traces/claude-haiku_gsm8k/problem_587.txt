Question: At the Burger Palace restaurant, there is an enormous jar containing red, blue and green jelly beans.  On the outside of the jar is a note that reads, "This jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans."  If the jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans, how many more green jelly beans does it contain than red jelly beans?

Reference Answer: If the total number of jelly beans is 4500, there must be 1500 blue jelly beans
4500/3= <<4500/3=1500>>1500
1500/100= <<1500/100=15>>15 jelly beans (1% of blue jelly beans)
1500+15= <<1500+15=1515>>1515 Green Jelly beans
1500-15= <<1500-15=1485>>1485 Red Jelly beans
1515-1485= <<1515-1485=30>>30 jelly beans difference between red and green
