Question: John visits his parents twice a month.  It takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph.  Considering the round trip, how many miles a month does he drive when visiting his parents?

Reference Answer: His parents live 70*2=<<70*2=140>>140 miles away
So he drives 140*2=<<140*2=280>>280 miles a round trip
280*2 = <<280*2=560>>560 miles a month
#### 560
