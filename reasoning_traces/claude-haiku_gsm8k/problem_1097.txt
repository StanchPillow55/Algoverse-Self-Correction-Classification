Question: Mary and John got married last weekend.  There were 20 private cars and 12 buses parked outside the church.  After the ceremony, each bus carried 35 people and each car carried 3 people. How many people were inside the church?

Reference Answer: There were 20 private cars * 3 people = <<20*3=60>>60 people.
There were 12 buses * 35 people = <<12*35=420>>420 people.
Total inside the church was 60 people + 420 people = <<60+420=480>>480 people.
#### 480
