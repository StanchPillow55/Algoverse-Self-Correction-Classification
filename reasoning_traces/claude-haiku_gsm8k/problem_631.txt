Question: In a jewelers store, the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell. The cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold. If a diamond Jewell is $2000, find the total price for all three jewels.

Reference Answer: If a diamond Jewellcosts $2000, the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5*$2000 = $1600
Silver costs $400 less than gold Jewell, which means a silver Jewell costs $1600-$400 = $1200
The price of the three jewels combined is $1200+$1600+$2000 = $<<1200+1600+2000=4800>>4800
