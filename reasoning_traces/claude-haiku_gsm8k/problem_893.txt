Question: Mark works at his job for 8 hours a day for 5 days a week.  He used to make $10 an hour but they raised his pay by $2 per hour.  How much does he make a week?

Reference Answer: He works 8*5=<<8*5=40>>40 hours a week
He gets paid 10+2=$<<10+2=12>>12 an hour
So he now gets 40*12=$<<40*12=480>>480 per week
#### 480
