Question: Dijana and Anis live near a lake, and every weekend they go out rowing into the lake. On a Sunday morning, both went out rowing, and Dijana rowed for 50 miles the whole day. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Calculate the total distance the two of them rowed on that day.

Reference Answer: Anis rowed for 1/5 * 50 = <<1/5*50=10>>10 more miles than Dijana.
The total distance Anis covered is 50 + 10 = <<50+10=60>>60 miles.
The two of them rowed for 60 + 50 = <<60+50=110>>110 miles on that day.
