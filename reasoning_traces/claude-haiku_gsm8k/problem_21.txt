Question: Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. If Samantha is now 31, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?

Reference Answer: When Raymond's son was born Samantha was 23 - 6 = <<23-6=17>>17 years old.
Thus it has been 31 - 17 = <<31-17=14>>14 years since Raymond's son was born.
