Question: Dylan attended a wedding where there were 100 guests in the reception. Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door as a thank you for helping in the wedding reception. If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, how many people were in the church next door?

Reference Answer: If each of the 100 guests brought a plate of 15 cookies, then the total number of cookies brought is 100*15 = <<100*15=1500>>1500 cookies.
If the next church was given 1/2 the number of cookies, then they got 1/2*1500 = <<1/2*1500=750>>750 cookies.
If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, then there were 750/15 = <<750/15=50>>50 people.
