Question: 4 adults and 8 children are to share 8 packets of chocolate bars. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. If each adult gets 6 chocolate bars and the rest are to be shared equally among the children, how many will each child get?

Reference Answer: Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars so 8 packets contain a total of 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40 bars
Each adult gets 6 bars so 4 adults will get 6*4 = <<6*4=24>>24 bars in total
There are now 40-24 = <<40-24=16>>16 bars left
16 bars are shared equally among 8 children, so each child will get 16/8 = <<16/8=2>>2 bars
