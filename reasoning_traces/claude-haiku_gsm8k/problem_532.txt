Question: Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.  In 8 years his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age.  How many years separate the age of the two now?

Reference Answer: James is 27-5=<<27-5=22>>22 years old
In 8 years he will be 22+8=<<22+8=30>>30 years old
So in 8 years, his cousin will be 30*2-5=<<30*2-5=55>>55
So his cousin is 55-8=<<55-8=47>>47 years old now
So there is a 47-22=<<47-22=25>>25 year gap
