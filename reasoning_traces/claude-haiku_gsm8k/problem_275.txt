Question: Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?

Reference Answer: The first scene has twice the number of lines as his solo song, so it has 2 * 54 = <<2*54=108>>108 lines.
A third of them are Sean’s lines, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = <<108/3=36>>36 lines.
The second scene has 54 + 6 = <<54+6=60>>60 lines.
Four fifths of the second scene’s lines are Sean’s, so he has to memorize 4 * 60 / 5 = 4 * 12 = <<4*60/5=48>>48 lines.
Sean has to memorize his entire solo song, so he has to memorize 54 + 36 + 48 = <<54+36+48=138>>138 lines in all.
