Question: 200 pounds of carrots are to be distributed to 40 restaurants in a certain city. Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. How many pounds of carrots will not be used?

Reference Answer: The restaurants need 40 * 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 lbs. of carrots.
So 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120 lbs. of carrots will not be used.
