Question: Jennifer bought 12 oranges from the market, she gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, and her only boy got 3 oranges. How many oranges did she remain with?

Reference Answer: Her three daughters received a total of 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 oranges.
She gave her children 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 oranges in total.
She remained with 12 - 9 = <<12-9=3>>3 oranges.
