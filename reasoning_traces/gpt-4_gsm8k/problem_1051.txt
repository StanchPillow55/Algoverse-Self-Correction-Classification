Question: Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day.  If there are 16 cups in a gallon, how many gallons of water does she drink in 30 days?

Reference Answer: She drinks 8 cups of water a day so after 30 days she drinks 8*30 = <<8*30=240>>240 cups of water
There are 16 cups in 1 gallon so she drinks 240/16 = <<240/16=15>>15 gallons of water in 30 days
