Question: Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, how many face masks does he use every 2 days?

Reference Answer: Tyrion uses 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 face masks every day.
Therefore, the total number of face masks he uses every 2 days is 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12.
