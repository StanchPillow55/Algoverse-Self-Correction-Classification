Question: Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10000 and a phone for $800. Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200 to help him. How much money does he still need?

Reference Answer: The amount of purchases Gabriel wants to make is $10000 + $800 = $<<10000+800=10800>>10800.
And Gabriel has $5000 + $200 = $<<5000+200=5200>>5200.
So, Gabriel still needs $10800 - $5200 = $<<10800-5200=5600>>5600.
