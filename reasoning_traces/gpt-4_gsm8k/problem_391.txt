Question: The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. If the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, how many more popsicles does Sam have more than Betty?

Reference Answer: The total ratio representing the number of popsicles that Betty and sam have is 5+6 = <<5+6=11>>11.
Since Betty has 5/11 of the total number of popsicles they have together, she has 5/11*165 = <<5/11*165=75>>75 popsicles.
Sam has 165-75 = <<165-75=90>>90 popsicles.
Sam has 90-75 = <<90-75=15>>15 more popsicles than Betty.
