Question: James decided to walk to the store.  When he got halfway there he realized he forgot something at home and had to walk back.  If his home is 4 miles from the store and he walks 4 miles per hour how long did it take him to reach the store?

Reference Answer: He walked 4/2=<<4/2=2>>2 miles there before turning around
So in total he walked 2+2+4=<<2+2+4=8>>8 miles, he walked 2 miles to the halfway point than 2 miles home.
That means it took him 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 hours
