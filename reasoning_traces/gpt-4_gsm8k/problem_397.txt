Question: Mark has $50 in his bank account. He earns $10 per day at his work. If he wants to buy a bike that costs $300, how many days does Mark have to save his money?

Reference Answer: Mike has $50 in his bank account, so the amount he needs to save to reach the bike goal is $300 - $50 = $250
He earns $10 per day, so $250 / $10/day = <<250/10=25>>25 days
