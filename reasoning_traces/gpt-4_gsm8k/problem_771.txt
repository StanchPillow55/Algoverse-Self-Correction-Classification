Question: Bennet is a farmer. He sells 20 of his eggplants for $3 each. He has 25 ears of corn that he can sell as well. If Bennet wants to make a total of $135, how much should he sell each ear of corn for?

Reference Answer: From his eggplants, Bennet makes 20 * $3 = $<<20*3=60>>60
Bennet needs to make $135 - $60 = $<<135-60=75>>75 from the sale of his corn
Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $75 / 25 = $<<75/25=3>>3
