Question: Jack decides to visit a museum 150 miles from home.  He drives 75 mph there and back.  He spends 6 hours at the museum.  How long is he gone from home?

Reference Answer: He drove a total of 150+150=<<150+150=300>>300 miles
So he drove for 300/75=<<300/75=4>>4 hours
That means he was gone from home for 4+6=<<4+6=10>>10 hours
