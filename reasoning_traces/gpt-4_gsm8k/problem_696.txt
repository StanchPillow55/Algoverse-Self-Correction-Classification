Question: Students in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior. If they get enough points in total, they can go on a trip. In the class, there are Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam has collected 50 points. Betty was better than Adam and collected 30% more. Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom, who has 30 points less than Betty. How many points is the class missing to go on the trip if the minimum threshold is 400 points?

Reference Answer: Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.
Betty's total is therefore 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.
So the class is missing 400 - 255 = <<400-255=145>>145 points to go on the trip.
