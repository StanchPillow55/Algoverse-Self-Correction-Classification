Question: Raphael went to buy some school supplies. He bought 4 pens which cost $1.5 each, 2 notebooks which cost $4 each, and a rim of bond paper which cost $20. How much did Raphael spend on everything?

Reference Answer: Raphael spent 4 x $1.5 = $<<4*1.5=6>>6 for the pens.
He also spent 2 x $4 = $<<2*4=8>>8 for the notebooks.
Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $6 + $8 + $20 = $<<6+8+20=34>>34 for the school supplies.
