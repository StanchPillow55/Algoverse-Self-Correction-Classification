Question: Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agreed to have monthly interest of 2%. If Mandy was able to pay it after 3 months, how much should she give to Benedict?

Reference Answer: The monthly interest is $100 x 2/100 = $<<100*2/100=2>>2.
After 3 months, the total interest amount to $2 x 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.
Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict a total of $100 + $6 = $<<100+6=106>>106.
