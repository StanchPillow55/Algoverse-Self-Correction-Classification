Question: Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns. How many books will she need to carry to complete her task?

Reference Answer: The capacity of the shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns is 6*6=<<6*6=36>>36 books.
Double the capacity of the shelving system is 2*36=<<2*36=72>>72
If Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns, she wants to place 20+72=92 books.
