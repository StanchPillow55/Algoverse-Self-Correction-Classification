Question: Baldur gets water from a well. He gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. If each pail contains 5 liters of water, how many liters of water does he get every day?

Reference Answer: Baldur gets 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 liters of water in the morning.
He gets 6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 liters of water in the afternoon.
Therefore, the total liters of water he gets every day is 30 + 25 = <<30+25=55>>55.
