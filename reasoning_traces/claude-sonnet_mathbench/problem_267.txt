Question: It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.  It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees.  After warming the oil it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.  How much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken?

Reference Answer: It takes 20*.4=8 more minutes to go from 300 to 400 degrees than from room temperature to 300
So it takes 20+8=<<20+8=28>>28 minutes to warm up
So the total warming time was 28+20=<<28+20=48>>48 minutes
So it took 48-5=<<48-5=43>>43 minutes to cook the chicken
So it took 48+43=<<48+43=91>>91 minutes to make the chicken.
