Question: A basket of green food costs $25 and a basket of red food costs $18. If you buy 3 baskets of green food and red food, how much will you have to pay in total if you get $2 off for each basket of red food?

Reference Answer: The 3 baskets of green food will cost $25 x 3 = $<<25*3=75>>75.
The 3 baskets of red food will cost $18 x 3 = $<<18*3=54>>54.
There will be $2 x 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6 off for the baskets of red food.
So, the 3 baskets of red food will now cost $54 - $6 = $<<54-6=48>>48.
You will have to pay $75 + $48 = $<<75+48=123>>123 for all the baskets of food.
