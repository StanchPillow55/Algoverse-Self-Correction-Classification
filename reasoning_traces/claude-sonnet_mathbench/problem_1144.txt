Question: The ratio of men to women on a bus is 5:9. If the total number of passengers on the bus is 84, and 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, how many women have remained on the bus?

Reference Answer: The total ratio representing the number of women on the bus is 5+9=<<5+9=14>>14
The fraction from the ratio representing the number of women is 9/14, and since the total number of passengers representing the full ratio is 84, there are 9/14*84=<<9/14*84=54>>54 women on the bus.
If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus becomes 54-20=<<54-20=34>>34
