Question: Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.  If he was stapling reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, how many reports did he staple altogether?

Reference Answer: In one hour, there are 60 / 15 = <<60/15=4>>4 (15 minutes).
From 8am - 11am, there are 11 - 8 = <<11-8=3>>3 hours.
In 3 hours, there are 3 x 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 (15 minutes).
In those 3 hours, Vince stapled 12 x 30 = <<12*30=360>>360 reports.
#### 360
