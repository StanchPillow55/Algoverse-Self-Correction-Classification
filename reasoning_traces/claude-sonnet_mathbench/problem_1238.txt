Question: Bud makes homemade macaroni and cheese once a week.  The pasta costs $1.00 a box, and he spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese and twice that amount for the gruyere cheese.  How much money does Bud spend on making macaroni and cheese in one year?

Reference Answer: The gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the $3.00 cheddar cheese so it costs 2*3 = $<<2*3=6.00>>6.00
The pasta costs $1.00, the cheddar cheese costs $3.00 and the gruyere cheese is $6.00 for a total of 1+3+6 = $<<1+3+6=10.00>>10.00
There are 52 weeks in a year and he makes this dish once a week so it will cost him 52*10 = $<<52*10=520.00>>520.00 in one year
