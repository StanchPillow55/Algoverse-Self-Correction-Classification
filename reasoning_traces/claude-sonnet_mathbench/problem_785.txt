Question: Carrie was given ten twenties and 140 quarters by her aunt to use for lunch. If she spent all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties, calculate the total amount of money she paid for the lunch.

Reference Answer: Since she spent all the quarters, she paid her lunch partly by quarters totaling 140*$0.25 = $<<140*0.25=35>>35
She also used 3/5*10 = <<3/5*10=6>>6 of the twenties to pay for the lunch.
The total amount of the twenties that she used is 6*$20 = $<<6*20=120>>120
She spent $120+$35 = $<<120+35=155>>155 on the lunch.
