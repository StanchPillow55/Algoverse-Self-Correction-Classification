Question: The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100. How much do both cars cost?

Reference Answer: The red car is 40/100 * 100 = $<<40/100*100=40>>40 cheaper than the blue car.
That means, that the red car costs 100 - 40 = $<<100-40=60>>60.
So both cars cost 100 + 60 = $<<100+60=160>>160.
