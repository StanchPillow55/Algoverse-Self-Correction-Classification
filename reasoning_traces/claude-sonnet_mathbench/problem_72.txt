Question: Tommy is fundraising for his charity by selling brownies for $3 a slice and cheesecakes for $4 a slice. If Tommy sells 43 brownies and 23 slices of cheesecake, how much money does Tommy raise?

Reference Answer: Tommy raised 43 brownies x $3/brownie = $<<43*3=129>>129 by selling brownies.
Tommy raised 23 slices x $4 = $<<23*4=92>>92 by selling cheesecakes.
In total Tommy has raised $129 + $92 = $<<129+92=221>>221
