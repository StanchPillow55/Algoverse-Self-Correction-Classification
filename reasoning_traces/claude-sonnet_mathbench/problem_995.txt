Question: Adam bought himself some new trousers for $30. His mother gave him $6 for this purpose, and his father gave him twice as much. How much money did Adam have to contribute from his savings?

Reference Answer: Adam's father gave him $6 * 2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.
So considering the price Adam needed to pay $30 - $12 - $6 = $<<30-12-6=12>>12 for his trousers from his savings.
