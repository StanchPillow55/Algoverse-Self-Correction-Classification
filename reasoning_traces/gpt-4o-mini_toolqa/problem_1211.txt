Question: For one medical dosage, Saanvi had to combine 14 mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. How many mL of medicine would be in 8 doses?

Reference Answer: First medicine = <<14=14>>14 mL
Second medicine = 3 * 14 = <<3*14=42>>42 mL
One dose = 14 + 42 = <<14+42=56>>56 mL
Eight doses = 8 * 56 = <<8*56=448>>448 mL
Eight doses of Saanvi's medicine contained 448 mL of medicine.
