Question: Boris has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, how many fewer apples does Beck have than Boris now?

Reference Answer: Boris has 100 apples, but gives 10 away, so now he has 100 apples - 10 apples = <<100-10=90>>90 apples.
Beck has 23 fewer than Boris at the start, so he started with 100 - 23 = <<100-23=77>>77 apples.
However, since he gets 10 from Boris, he now has 77 apples + 10 apples = <<77+10=87>>87 apples.
Thus Beck has 90 - 87 = <<90-87=3>>3 apples fewer than Boris.
