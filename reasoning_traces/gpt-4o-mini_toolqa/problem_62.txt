Question: If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000/year. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. If she quits after 30 years, what will her annual pension be?

Reference Answer: First find how many years Marcy works after 20 years: 30 years - 20 years = <<30-20=10>>10 years
Then multiply that number by the amount of her pension she gets per year: 10 years * 5% = 50%
Then multiply that percentage by the total amount of the full pension to find how much she gets: $50,000 * 50% = $<<50000*50*.01=25000>>25,000
#### 25000
