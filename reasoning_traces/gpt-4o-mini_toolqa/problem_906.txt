Question: Tim has a box with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. If he uses 3 blue shoeboxes and 1/3 red of his shoeboxes to go fishing, how many red and blue shoe boxes are left in Tim's box?

Reference Answer: If Tim uses 3 blue shoeboxes, he remains with 7-3=<<7-3=4>>4 blue shoe boxes in the box.
Tim also uses 1/3 of the red shoeboxes, a total of 1/3*9=<<1/3*9=3>>3 red shoe boxes.
Tim remains with 9-3=<<9-3=6>>6 red shoeboxes.
The total number of red and blue shoe boxes left in Tim's box is 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10
