Question: Shannon makes herself iced coffee by brewing hot coffee and adding ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees but makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Any added liquid also weakens the coffee. How many milliliters weaker is Shannon’s iced coffee when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream?

Reference Answer: Shannon’s iced coffee has 65 / 13 = <<65/13=5>>5 ice cubes in it.
The ice makes the coffee 5 * 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 milliliters weaker.
After adding cream, Shannon’s iced coffee is 60 + 15 = <<60+15=75>>75 milliliters weaker.
