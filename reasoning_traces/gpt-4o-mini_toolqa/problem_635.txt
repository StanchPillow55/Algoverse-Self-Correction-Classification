Question: Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60. His parents tell him that if his classes end up costing more than $10 per class, then they won't sign him up again. If there are 10 total classes, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?

Reference Answer: He must attend at least six classes, because 60 / 6 = <<60/6=10>>10
He can skip 4 class because 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6
