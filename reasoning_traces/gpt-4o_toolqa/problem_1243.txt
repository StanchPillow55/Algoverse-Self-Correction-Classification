Question: Archie buys beef jerky that comes 30 sticks to a bag and costs $18.00 per bag.  If Archie buys 1 bag while they're $3.00 off a bag, how much will each stick of jerky cost in cents?

Reference Answer: The bags are $18.00 with a $3.00 coupon so each bag is 18-3 = $<<18-3=15.00>>15.00
The bag has 30 sticks of jerky and costs $15.00 so each stick will cost 15/30 = $0.50
