Question: If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, how much would a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?

Reference Answer: When the price of the bag of marble increase by 20%, the price increases by 20/100*20 = $<<20/100*20=4>>4
If the price increases after every two months, in 36 months, it will increase 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 times.
If each increase is $4, the total amount the price of the bag of marbles will have increased by after 36 months is 18*$4 = $<<18*4=72>>72
After the total increase of the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, the total cost will be $20+$72 = $<<20+72=92>>92
