Question: Leila buys 3 cucumbers from the market. Cucumbers are $2 each. Jack buys 5 tomatoes from the grocery store.  Tomatoes are $1 each. Chase buys 1 head of lettuce from the farmerâ€™s market.  Lettuce cost $3 each. Together, how much did the three of them spend to make a salad for the potluck?

Reference Answer: Leila spends 3 x $2 = $<<3*2=6>>6.
Jack spends 5 x $1 = $<<5*1=5>>5.
Chase spends 1 x $3 = $<<1*3=3>>3.
Together, they spend a total of $6 + $5 + $3 = $<<6+5+3=14>>14.
