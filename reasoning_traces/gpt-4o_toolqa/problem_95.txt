Question: Out of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. How many girls are not in the girl scout?

Reference Answer: There are 200 x 2/5 = <<200*2/5=80>>80 boys in Grade 5.
So, 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120 are girls.
Out of the 120 girls, 120 x 2/3 = <<120*2/3=80>>80 are in the girl scout.
Therefore, 120 - 80 = <<120-80=40>>40 girls are not in the girl scout.
