Question: In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, how many miles will Brian walk in seven days?

Reference Answer: If Sofie walks 10 miles each day, she will walk 7*10 = <<10*7=70>>70 miles in seven days.
Since Sofie is walking twice as far as Brian, Brian will walk 70/2 = <<70/2=35>>35 miles in seven days.
