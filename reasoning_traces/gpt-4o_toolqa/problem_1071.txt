Question: Kayla is having her birthday party at a movie theater. The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Kayla invited her 25 classmates and the 7 girls in her dance class, as well as 13 family members. Only 4 people said they could not come. How much will the party cost?

Reference Answer: Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class friends + 13 family members = <<25+7+13=45>>45 people invited.
Of the 45 people invited – 4 people cannot come = <<45-4=41>>41 people attending the party.
Of the 41 people attending – 20 are included in the fee = <<41-20=21>>21 additional guests not included in the fee.
The cost for 21 additional guests is 21 x $6 = $<<21*6=126>>126.
The total cost for the party is the $125 fee + $126 for additional guests = $<<125+126=251>>251.
