Question: A football team played 22 games. They won 8 more than they lost. How many did they win?

Reference Answer: Let L be the number of losses.
The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.
The team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.
So, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14
So L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.
Therefore, the team won 22 â€“ 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.
