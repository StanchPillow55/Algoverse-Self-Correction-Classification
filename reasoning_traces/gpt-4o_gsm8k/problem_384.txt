Question: Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. How much land did he have at first?

Reference Answer: Mr. Ruther is left with 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of his land.
Since 2/5 is equal to 12.8 hectares, then 1/5 is equal to 12.8/2 = <<12.8/2=6.4>>6.4 hectares.
Hence, Mr. Ruther had 6.4 x 5 = <<6.4*5=32>>32 hectares of land at first.
