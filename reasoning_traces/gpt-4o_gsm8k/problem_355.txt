Question: There are three trees in Eddy's backyard. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet, and the second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. How tall is the tallest tree?

Reference Answer: The height of the second tree is 6 + 5 = <<6+5=11>>11 feet.
Thus, the combined height of the two trees is 6 + 11 = <<6+11=17>>17 feet.
Therefore the height of the tallest tree is 2 x 17 = <<2*17=34>>34 feet.
