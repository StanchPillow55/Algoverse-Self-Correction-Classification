Question: May is getting her hair cut and colored. It costs $40 for the color and $30 per inch of haircut. If her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8, how much did her cut and color cost?

Reference Answer: She had 2 inches cut because 10-8=<<10-8=2>>2
It cost $60 for the cut because 2 x 30 =<<2*30=60>>60
It cost $100 total because 40+60=<<40+60=100>>100
