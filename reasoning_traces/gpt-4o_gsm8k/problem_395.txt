Question: Erica made 20 Valentine's cards to pass out.  Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each.  She passed out 24 to her classmates, 5 to her family and received 17 from family and friends.  How many Valentine's Day cards does Erica now have?

Reference Answer: Her dad gave her 2 boxes of 15 cards so 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30
She made 20, was given 30 and received 17 so 20+30+17 = <<20+30+17=67>>67 cards
She passed out 24 and gave 5 cards to family and friends so she gave away 24+5 = <<24+5=29>>29 cards
She had 67 cards and gave away 29 cards so 67-29 = <<67-29=38>>38 cards left
