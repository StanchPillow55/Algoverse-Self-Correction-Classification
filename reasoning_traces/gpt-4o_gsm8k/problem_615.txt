Question: Scarlett found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale.  At the pet store, she bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each and 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 apiece.  She bought 20 fish at $0.50 each and she needed fish food that cost $2.00.  How much did she spend?

Reference Answer: a bag of rocks cost $2.50 and she bought 2 bags so 2*2.50 = $<<2*2.5=5.00>>5.00
She bought 3 pieces of coral for $2.00 each so she spent 3*2 = $<<3*2=6.00>>6.00
She bought 20 fish that costs $0.50 each so 20*.50 = $<<20*.50=10.00>>10.00
All total she spent $10 on the aquarium, $5 on the rocks, $6 on coral, $10 on fish and $2 on food so 10+5+6+10+2 = $<<10+5+6+10+2=33.00>>33.00
