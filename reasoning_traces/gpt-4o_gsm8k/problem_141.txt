Question: There are 700 bees in a hive. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and there are twice as many babies as queens.  How many worker bees are there?

Reference Answer: Let x represent the number of queens
Babies:2x
Workers:2(2x)=4x
Total:x+2x+4x=700
7x=700
x=<<100=100>>100 queen bees
Workers:4(100)=400 worker bees
