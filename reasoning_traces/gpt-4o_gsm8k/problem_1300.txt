Question: Josh runs a car shop and services 3 cars a day.  He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday.  He gets paid $4 per car.  How much does he make in 2 weeks?

Reference Answer: He runs 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 days a week
That means he serves 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 cars a week
So he makes 15*4=$<<15*4=60>>60 a week
So he makes 60*2=$<<60*2=120>>120 in 2 weeks
#### 120
