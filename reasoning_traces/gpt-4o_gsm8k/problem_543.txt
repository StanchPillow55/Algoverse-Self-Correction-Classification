Question: For each small task accomplished, Jairus gets $0.8 while Jenny gets $0.5. If each of them finished 20 tasks, how much more will Jairus get than Jenny?

Reference Answer: The difference of the amount received by Jairus and Jenny is $0.8/task - $0.5/task = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3/task.
So, Jairus will get $0.3/task x 20 tasks = $<<0.3*20=6>>6 more than Jenny.
