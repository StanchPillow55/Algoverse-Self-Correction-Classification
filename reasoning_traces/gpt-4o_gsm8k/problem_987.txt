Question: Artemis is potting flowers with her father. They buy a 30-pound bag of soil. Each rose needs 1 pound. Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds. Each Sunflower needs 3 pounds. If they plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations, how many roses can they plant?

Reference Answer: They used 12 pounds on the sunflowers because 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12
They used 15 pounds on carnations because 10 x 1.5 = <<10*1.5=15>>15
They have used 27 pounds in total because 12 + 15 = <<12+15=27>>27
They have 30 pounds left because 30 - 27 = <<30-27=3>>3
The can plant three roses because 3 / 1 = <<3/1=3>>3
