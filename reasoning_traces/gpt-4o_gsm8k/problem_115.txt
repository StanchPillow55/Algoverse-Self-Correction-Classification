Question: Sasha notices that prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months after she bought some lumber. Since she has leftovers, she decides to sell them. She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?

Reference Answer: She bought the 2 x 4s for $100 because 10 x 10 = 100
She bought the 4 x 4s for 80 because 5 x 16 = 80
She paid $180 for the lumber because 100 + 80 = <<100+80=180>>180
The same number now sells for $270 because 180 x 1.5 = <<180*1.5=270>>270
She made $90 in profit because 270 - 180 = <<270-180=90>>90
#### 90
