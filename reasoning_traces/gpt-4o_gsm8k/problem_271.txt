Question: John has 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each.  Each bedroom has 2 windows each.  There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.  How many total windows are there between the houses?

Reference Answer: Each house has 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 windows for the bedrooms
So each house has 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10 windows
So the total number of windows is 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 windows
#### 20
