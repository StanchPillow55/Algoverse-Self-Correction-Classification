Question: Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. If she continues to walk dogs at the same rate, how much would she earn after 12 hours?

Reference Answer: Ella earned $33 / 3 hours of dog walking = $<<33/3=11>>11 per hour.
So for 12 hours of dog walking, Ella would earn $11 x 12 = $<<12*11=132>>132.
