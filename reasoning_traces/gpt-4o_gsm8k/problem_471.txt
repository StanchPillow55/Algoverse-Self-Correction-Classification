Question: There are 30 students in Marissaâ€™s class. Each student started the year with 10 pencils. After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils in class were used. At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. How many pencils were left?

Reference Answer: There were 30 x 10 = <<30*10=300>>300 pencils in the class at the start of the year.
After two months, 300 x 1/5 = <<300*1/5=60>>60 pencils were used.
Thus, 300 - 60 = <<300-60=240>>240 pencils were left unused after two months.
Therefore, 240 x 1/3 = <<240*1/3=80>>80 pencils were left at the end of the year.
