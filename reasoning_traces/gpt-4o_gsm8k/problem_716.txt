Question: John makes himself a 6 egg omelet with 2 oz of cheese and an equal amount of ham.  Eggs are 75 calories each.  Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.  Ham is 40 calories per ounce.  How many calories is the omelet?

Reference Answer: The eggs contributed 6*75=<<6*75=450>>450 calories
He eats 2*120=<<2*120=240>>240 calories of cheese
He eats 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80 calories of ham
So in total he eats 450+240+80=<<450+240+80=770>>770 calories
