Question: Lindsay is doing the laundry, and thinks she has missed some socks. There are 50 socks that need washing. If she washes 10 pairs of socks and 15 loose socks, how many socks has Lindsay missed?

Reference Answer: Splitting the pairs shows there were 10 pairs of socks * 2 socks/pair = <<10*2=20>>20 socks paired together.
This means she has washed a total of 20 paired socks + 15 loose socks = <<20+15=35>>35 socks.
She has therefore missed 50 socks â€“ 35 socks = <<50-35=15>>15 socks.
