Question: A certain company is in the business of selling fresh fruit. One crate of such fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. The price for such a crate depends on the price of its individual fruits. One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?

Reference Answer: The price for apples in the crate would be 12 * 0.5 = $<<12*0.5=6>>6.
Cost of banana is 0.5 * 2 = $<<0.5*2=1>>1.
So the bananas in this crate cost 5 * 1 = $<<5*1=5>>5.
One orange is three times more expensive than a banana, so it costs 1 * 3 = $<<1*3=3>>3.
So for the oranges in the crate, one needs to pay 7 * 3 = $<<7*3=21>>21.
So the whole crate costs 6 + 5 + 21 = $<<6+5+21=32>>32.
