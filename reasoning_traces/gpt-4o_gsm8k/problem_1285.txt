Question: The recent floods in Mamouâ€™s country have left many families without food or shelter. To help, Mamou has volunteered to distribute 1,360 meals to the affected families. She gave out 64 meals on Friday, 30 meals on Saturday, and 48 meals on Sunday. How many meals does she have left to distribute?

Reference Answer: On Friday, Saturday and Sunday, Mamou distributed a total of 64 meals + 30 meals + 48 meals = <<64+30+48=142>>142 meals
The remaining meals are 1,360 meals - 142 meals = <<1360-142=1218>>1,218 meals
