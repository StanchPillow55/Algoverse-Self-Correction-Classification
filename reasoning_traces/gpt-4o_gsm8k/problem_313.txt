Question: Six years ago, when Noah was half as old as Cera, the population of Chile was half what it is now. Currently, Cera is 46 years old. If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, calculate the population of Chile now.

Reference Answer: If Cera is 46 years old now, she was 46-6 = <<46-6=40>>40 years old six years ago.
Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, meaning Noah was 1/2*40 = 20 years.
If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, there were 3000*20 = <<3000*20=60000>>60000 people living in chile.
Since the population of Chile was half what it was now six years ago, currently Chile has 60000*2 = <<60000*2=120000>>120000 people
#### 120000
