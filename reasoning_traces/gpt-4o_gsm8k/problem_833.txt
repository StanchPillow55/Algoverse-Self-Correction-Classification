Question: Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami can.  But Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can.  And Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can.  If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, how high can Naruto lift a mountain, in feet?

Reference Answer: If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12*1=12 inches=1 foot.
Since Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, then Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4*1=<<4*1=4>>4 feet.
And since Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami. then Naruto can lift a mountain 10*4=<<10*4=40>>40 feet.
