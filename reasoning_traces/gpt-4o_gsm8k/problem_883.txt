Question: Elaina is holding the final concert in her tour. To celebrate her final concert, she makes the concert twice as long as her usual concerts. At the end of the concert, she also performs a 15-minute encore. If the runtime of this final concert is 65 minutes then how long, in minutes, do her usual concerts run for?

Reference Answer: The concert, minus the encore, lasted for 65-minute concert â€“ 15-minute encore = <<65-15=50>>50 minutes.
This is twice as long as her usual concerts so her usual concert must have a runtime of 50 minutes / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.
