Question: There are 90 rooms at the KozyInn Motel. It takes housekeeping 20 minutes to clean each room. How many hours would it take to clean one-half of the rooms?

Reference Answer: 90 * 20 = <<90*20=1800>>1800 minutes
1800/2 = <<1800/2=900>>900 minutes
900 minutes = <<900/60=15>>15 hours
It would take 15 hours to clean 45 rooms at the KozyInn Motel.
