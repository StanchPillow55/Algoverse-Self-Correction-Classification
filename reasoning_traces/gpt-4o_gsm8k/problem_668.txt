Question: In a company of 50 employees, 20% of the employees are management.  Out of this 20%, only 30% oversee the entire company.  How many employees oversee the company?

Reference Answer: 20% of 50 employees are part of management so that's .20*50 = <<.20*50=10>>10 employees
Out of these 10 employees, only 30% oversee the entire company so 10*.30 = <<10*.3=3>>3 people oversee the company
