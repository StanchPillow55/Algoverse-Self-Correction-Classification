Question: George has 45% more pears than bananas. If George has 200 bananas, how many fruits does George have?

Reference Answer: If George has 200 bananas, 45% more than that number is 45/100*200 = <<200*0.45=90>>90
The total number of pears that George has is 200+90 =<<200+90=290>>290
Together, George has 290 pears + 200 bananas = <<290+200=490>>490 fruits
