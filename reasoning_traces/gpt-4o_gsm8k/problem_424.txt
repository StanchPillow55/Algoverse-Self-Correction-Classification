Question: The employees of Google went on a day trip. 4 buses were rented that have the capacity of holding 60 employees. 6 minibusses that can hold 30 employees, and 10 minivans that can hold 15 employees. How many employees can join the day trip?

Reference Answer: 60 x 4 = <<60*4=240>>240 employees can ride on the bus.
30 x 6 = <<30*6=180>>180 employees can ride on the minibusses.
15 x 10 = <<15*10=150>>150 employees can ride on the minivans.
Therefore 240 + 180 + 150 = <<240+180+150=570>>570 employees can join the day trip.
