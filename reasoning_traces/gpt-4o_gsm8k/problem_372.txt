Question: Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays.  On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class.  How many hours a week did she have dance practice?

Reference Answer: She had practice for 1 hour on Tuesday and 2 hours on Thursday so she practiced for 1+2 = <<1+2=3>>3 hours
Saturday's class was twice as long as Tuesday's so she danced 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 hours on Saturday
In one week she danced 3 hours on the weekdays and 2 hours on the weekend for a total of 3+2 = <<3+2=5>>5 hours
