Question: A new program had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, but then reduced by 30% in the third month. How many downloads did the program have total over the three months?

Reference Answer: The number of downloads of the program in the second month increased to 3*60 = <<3*60=180>>180
In the first two months, the total number of downloads of the program was 180+60 = <<180+60=240>>240
In the third month, the number of downloads of the program reduced by 30/100*180 = <<30/100*180=54>>54
There were 180-54 = <<180-54=126>>126 downloads in the third month.
In the three months, the total number of downloads of the program was 126+240 = <<126+240=366>>366
#### 366
