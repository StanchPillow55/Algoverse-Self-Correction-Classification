Question: Elise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full twice, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Elise written in total?

Reference Answer: Elise has written the alphabet twice which is a total of 26 * 2 = <<26*2=52>>52 letters.
She then writes half the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = <<26/2=13>>13 letters.
So far, this is a total of 52 + 13 = <<52+13=65>>65 letters.
Writing this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 65 * 2 = <<65*2=130>>130 letters.
