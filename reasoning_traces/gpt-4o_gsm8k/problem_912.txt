Question: John drinks a bottle of water every half hour.  A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes.  An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long.  How many bottles of water does he drink in that time?

Reference Answer: He drinks a bottle of water every 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 minutes
It takes him 45*4=<<45*4=180>>180 minutes to solve an extreme sudoku
So he drinks 180/30=<<180/30=6>>6 bottles in that time
