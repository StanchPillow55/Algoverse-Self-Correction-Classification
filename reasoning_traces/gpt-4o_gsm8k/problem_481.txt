Question: Belen has two kinds of pennies, a 2010 penny and a 1959 penny. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. If the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, what is the combined weight of the two pennies?

Reference Answer: If the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, the 2010 penny weighs 3/4 * 48 grains = <<48*3/4=36>>36 grains
The combined weight for the two is 36 grains + 48 grains = <<36+48=84>>84 grains
