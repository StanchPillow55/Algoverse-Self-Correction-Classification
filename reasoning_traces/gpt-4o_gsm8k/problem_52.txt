Question: Uriah's book bag is getting too heavy for him. He needs to remove 15 pounds from it. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each and his toys weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys does he need to remove?

Reference Answer: 30 comic books weigh 7.5 pounds because 30 x .25 = <<30*.25=7.5>>7.5
He needs to remove 7.5 more pounds because 15 - 7.5 = <<15-7.5=7.5>>7.5
He needs to remove 15 toys because 7.5 / .5 = <<15=15>>15
#### 15
