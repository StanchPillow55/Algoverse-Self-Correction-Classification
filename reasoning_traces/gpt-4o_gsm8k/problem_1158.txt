Question: The Hortex company produces bottled carrot juices. Every day it can produce 4200 bottles of these juices. Each juice can cover 20% of 1 person'ts daily energy demand. How many more bottles of juices would Hortex have to produce to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people?

Reference Answer: Each juice covers only 20% of the daily energy demand, so to cover 100%, one person would need 100 / 20 = <<100/20=5>>5 juices.
So 2300 people, need 5 * 2300 = <<2300*5=11500>>11500 juices for this purpose.
To cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need to produce 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles of juices.
