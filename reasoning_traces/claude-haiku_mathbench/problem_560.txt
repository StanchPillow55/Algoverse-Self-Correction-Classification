Question: A pet shop had 6 cages of rodents. 3 of the cages have 10 hamsters and the other 3 have 5 guinea pigs. How many rodents did the pet shop have in total?

Reference Answer: There are 3 cages x 10 hamsters/cage = <<3*10=30>>30 hamsters in the pet shop.
There are 3 cages x 5 guinea pigs/cage = <<3*5=15>>15 guinea pigs in the pet shop.
The pet shop has a total of 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = <<30+15=45>>45 rodents.
