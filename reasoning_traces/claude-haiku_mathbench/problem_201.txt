Question: John wins an award at work.  The award has a 1 time monetary reward of $5000 and a 5% raise in salary.  If he makes 2000 a week, every week of the year and he got the award on the first day of the year how much money did he make that year?

Reference Answer: He makes 2000*52=$<<2000*52=104000>>104,000 a year
So the raise is worth .05*104,000=$<<.05*104000=5200>>5200
So he makes 104,000+5200=$<<104000+5200=109200>>109,200 from his salary
So in total he made 109,200+5,000=$<<109200+5000=114200>>114,200
#### 114,200
