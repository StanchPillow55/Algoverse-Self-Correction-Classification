Question: John orders some pizzas to share with his friends.  There are 20 friends in total, and John wants to make sure each can have 4 slices.  Pizzas are only sold sliced into 8 portions.  How many Pizzas does John need to order?

Reference Answer: John's 20 friends each need 4 slices, so that means 4*20= <<4*20=80>>80 slices are needed
Each pizza has 8 slices, so to get 80 slices in total 80/8= <<80/8=10>>10 pizzas are needed
