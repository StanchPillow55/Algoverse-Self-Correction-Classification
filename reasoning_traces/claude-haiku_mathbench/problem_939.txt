Question: Craig and his brother take turns spelling out the longest letter words they know and counting the number of the letters in those words. After ten rounds, Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. If Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, calculate the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds.

Reference Answer: After ten rounds, Craig has spelled out 20*15 = <<20*15=300>>300 letters from the longest letter words he knows.
Since Craig's brother spelled out words with a total count of 50 more letters than Craig's words, he got 300+50 = 350 letters.
The brothers spelled out words with a total count of 350+300 = <<350+300=650>>650 letters.
