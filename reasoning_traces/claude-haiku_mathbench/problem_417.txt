Question: Tom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day, and over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all. During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?

Reference Answer: In the first four days, Tom made 4 * 200 = <<4*200=800>>800 kilometers.
For the next two days, he made only 30/100 * 800 = <<30/100*800=240>>240 kilometers.
During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day, which means 7 * 300 = <<7*300=2100>>2100 kilometers during the whole week.
During his whole trip, Tom made 800 + 240 + 2100 = <<800+240+2100=3140>>3140 kilometers.
