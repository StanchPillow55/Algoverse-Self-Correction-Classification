Question: Four students scored a total of 251 points in a board game. Naomi scored 68 of the points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi and Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. How many points did Jojo score?

Reference Answer: Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 1/2 (68) + 10 = 44 points
Brianna scored 68 + 17 = <<68+17=85>>85 points
Naomi, Yuri + Brianna scored = 68 + 44 + 85 = <<68+44+85=197>>197 points
Jojo scored the rest 251 - 197 = <<251-197=54>>54 points
Jojo scored 54 points.
