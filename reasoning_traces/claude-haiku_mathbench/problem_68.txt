Question: There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 girls and 5 students to every teacher, how many teachers are there?

Reference Answer: There are twice as many boys as girls, so if there are 60 girls, there are 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 boys
There are 120 + 60 = <<120+60=180>>180 students in total
If there are 5 students to each teacher, then 180 students would need 180/5 = <<180/5=36>>36 teachers
#### 36
