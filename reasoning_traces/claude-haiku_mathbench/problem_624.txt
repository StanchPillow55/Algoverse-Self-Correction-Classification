Question: Two sports coaches went shopping together. The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each. The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each. How much more did the basketball coach spend than the baseball coach?

Reference Answer: The cost of the baseballs is 9 × $3 = $<<9*3=27>>27.
The cost of the basketballs is 8 × $14 = $<<8*14=112>>112.
Basketballs cost $112 − $27 = $85 more.
