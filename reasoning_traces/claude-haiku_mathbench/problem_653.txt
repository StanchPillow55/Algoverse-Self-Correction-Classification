Question: Sally has realized she did not receive a full wage this week. Her bank account, which held $200 at the start of the week, now holds $420. She has received no other money into her bank account this week. If her weekly wage should be $300, how many dollars were withheld from Sally’s wage?

Reference Answer: The wage she received was $420 – $200 = $<<420-200=220>>220
This means her wage was $300 – $220 = $<<300-220=80>>80 short
