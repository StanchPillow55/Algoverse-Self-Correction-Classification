Question: Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. If her gym teacher tells her to run 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km, how many milliliters of water will Hannah need to drink?

Reference Answer: First find the total number of kilometers Hannah runs: 8 laps * .25 km/lap = <<8*.25=2>>2 km
Then multiply the number of kilometers she runs by the amount of water she needs per kilometer to find the total amount of water she needs: 60 ml/km * 2 km = <<60*2=120>>120 ml
