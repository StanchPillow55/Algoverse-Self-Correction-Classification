Question: A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba. If there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in a snake park, what is half the number of spots they all have combined?

Reference Answer: A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba, meaning a mamba has 70/2= <<70/2=35>>35 spots.
If there are 40 cobras in a snake park, they all have a total of 70*40 = <<40*70=2800>>2800 spots.
60 mambas in a snake park, each having 35 spots, have 60*35 = <<60*35=2100>>2100 spots total.
Together, all the snakes in the park have 2100+2800=<<2100+2800=4900>>4900 spots.
Half the number of spots they all have combined is 1/2*4900=<<1/2*4900=2450>>2450
