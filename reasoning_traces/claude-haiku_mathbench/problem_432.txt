Question: Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons with his mighty sword, while Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.  Using a rusty iron axe, Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.  But Prince Bruce, having forgot his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter using a nail file.  How many Dragons has Prince Bruce slain?

Reference Answer: Prince Arthur slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, or 100*(3/4)=<<100*(3/4)=75>>75 dragons.
Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, or 2*75=<<2*75=150>>150 dragons.
Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, or 150/5=<<150/5=30>>30 dragons.
