Question: At the local Pick Your Own fruit orchard, you could pick your own peaches for $2.00 per pound, plums were $1.00 per pound and apricots were $3.00 per pound.  If Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches, 8 pounds of plums and 6 pounds of apricots, how much did he spend on fruit?

Reference Answer: He bought 6 pounds of peaches that are $2.00 per pound so he spent 6*2 = $<<6*2=12.00>>12.00 on peaches
He bought 8 pounds of plums that are $1.00 per pound so he spent 8*1 = $<<8*1=8.00>>8.00 on plums
He bought 6 pounds of apricots that are $3.00 per pound so he spent 6*3 = $<<6*3=18.00>>18.00 on apricots
That day, he spent 12+8+18 = $<<12+8+18=38.00>>38.00 on fruit
