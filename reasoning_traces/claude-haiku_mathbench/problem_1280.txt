Question: Steve put together a puzzle that took 10 hours of hard work to complete. Anna put together the same puzzle in 2 hours more than half Steve's time. How long did it take Anna to finish the difficult puzzle?

Reference Answer: Half the time it took Steve to put together the puzzle is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5
If Anna put together the same puzzle in 2 hours more than half the time it took Steve, she took 5+2=7 hours to finish the puzzle.
