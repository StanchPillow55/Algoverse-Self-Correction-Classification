Question: Mark buys a fleet of 12 cars for his company.  Each car sells for $20,000.  He pays 10% tax on the cars and then another $1000 for registration on each of them.  How much does he pay for everything?

Reference Answer: The cars cost 20000*12=$<<20000*12=240000>>240,000
So the tax came out to 240,000*.1=$<<240000*.1=24000>>24,000
So the cars cost 240,000+24,000=$<<240000+24000=264000>>264,000
Registration cost another 12*1000=<<12*1000=12000>>12,000
So his total cost is 264,000+12,000=$<<264000+12000=276000>>276,000
#### 276,000
