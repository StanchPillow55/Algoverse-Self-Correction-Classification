Question: Tim gets a promotion that offers him a 5% raise on his $20000 a month salary.  It also gives him a bonus worth half a month's salary. How much money will he make in a year?

Reference Answer: The promotion increased his monthly salary by 20000*.05=$<<20000*0.05=1000>>1000
So his new salary is 20000+1000=$<<20000+1000=21000>>21000 a month
So he makes 21000*12=$<<21000*12=252000>>252,000 a year
The bonus is worth 21000*.5=$<<21000*.5=10500>>10500
So he makes 252,000+10,500=$<<252000+10500=262500>>262,500 for the year
#### 262500
