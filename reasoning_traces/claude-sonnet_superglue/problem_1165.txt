Question: John collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes.  The first two have 200 apartments each and the last one is 60% bigger than the other two combined.  He collects garbage 3 times a week from each place and he gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment.  How much money does he make in a week?

Reference Answer: The first two complexes have 200+200=<<200+200=400>>400 apartments
The third one has 400*.6=<<400*.6=240>>240 more apartments than those 2 combined
So in total, it has 400+240=<<400+240=640>>640 apartments
So he goes to 640+400=<<640+400=1040>>1040 apartments each time
That means he visits 1040*3=<<1040*3=3120>>3120 apartments every week
So he makes 3120*$0.4=$<<3120*0.4=1248>>1248 every week
#### 1248
