Question: Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, who has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. If Bo has 40 crabs, calculate the total number of crabs the three have together.

Reference Answer: If Bo has 40 crabs, then Monic, who has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, has 40-4 = <<40-4=36>>36 crabs.
Bo and Monic have a total of 36+40 = <<36+40=76>>76 crabs.
Since Monic has 36 crabs, Rani's number of crabs is 36+ 10 = <<36+10=46>>46.
Together, the three have 76+46 = <<76+46=122>>122 crabs.
