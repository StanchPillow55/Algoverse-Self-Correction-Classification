Question: Jess is trying to guess the number of blue jellybeans in a jar. She can see that there are 17 green jelly beans and twice as many red jelly beans. The rest of the jellybeans are blue jelly beans. If there are a total of 60 jelly beans in total, how many blue jellybeans are there?

Reference Answer: There are 17 green jelly beans * 2 = <<17*2=34>>34 red jelly beans.
So in the green and red jelly beans, there are a total of 17 + 34 = <<17+34=51>>51 jellybeans.
As the rest are blue, there must be 60 total jellybeans â€“ 51 red and green jelly beans = <<60-51=9>>9 blue jelly beans.
