Question: Jen decides to travel to 3 different countries.  He has to pay $400 for the supplies he needs, in total.  The tickets for travel cost, in total, 50% more than the supplies.  How much does travel cost?

Reference Answer: He pays 400*.5=$<<400*.5=200>>200 more for tickets than supplies
That means the tickets cost 400+200=$<<400+200=600>>600
So it cost 600+400=$<<600+400=1000>>1000 in total.
