Question: Carly wants to treat her friends. She orders five hamburgers at $4 each, ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each pack, and five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each can.  How much change does Carly get back if she gives one fifty-dollar bill?

Reference Answer: The cost of 5 hamburgers is 5 x $4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
The cost of 10 packs of potato fries is 10 x $0.30 = $<<10*0.3=3>>3.
And, the cost of 5 cans of fruit drinks is 5 x $2 = $<<5*2=10>>10.
Thus, the total cost is $20 + $3 + $10 = $<<20+3+10=33>>33.
Therefore, Carly gets a change of $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.
