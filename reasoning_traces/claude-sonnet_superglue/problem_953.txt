Question: Kim sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room. Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. She is a sleepwalker. One day, after reviewing the cameras, she finds that she woke up that day and was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am.  Also, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?

Reference Answer: Out of 24 hours in a day, 10 pm represents 22 hours.
Until 12 p.m. or 24 hours, Kim slept 24 - 22 = <<24-22=2>>2 hours.
In total, Kim usually sleeps 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 hours a day.
In minutes, Kim usually sleeps 8 * 60 = <<8*60=480>>480 minutes
Kim was sleepwalking for a total of 38 - 15 = <<38-15=23>>23 minutes.
Within her usual sleep routine, Kim was sleepwalking or awake a total of 23 + 5 =<<23+5=28>>28 minutes.
On that day, Kim slept in her bed for 480 - 28 = <<480-28=452>>452 minutes.
