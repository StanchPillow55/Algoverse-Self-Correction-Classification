Question: Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill.  In each basket she wants to add 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.  The petunias cost $3.00 apiece and the sweet potato vines cost $2.50 apiece.  How much will she spend filling all 5 hanging baskets?

Reference Answer: The petunia are $3.00 each and she wants 3 per basket so that's 3.00*3 = $<<3*3=9.00>>9.00
The sweet potato vines are $2.50 each and she wants 2 per basket so that's 2.5*2 = $<<2.5*2=5.00>>5.00
For 1 basket, the petunias will cost $9.00 and the sweet potato vines will cost $5.00 for a total of 9+5 = $<<9+5=14.00>>14.00
Each basket will cost $14.00 to fill and she needs to fill 5 baskets for a total of 14*5 = $<<14*5=70.00>>70.00
