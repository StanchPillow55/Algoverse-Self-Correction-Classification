Question: Lauren is a cartoonist.  She can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, or she can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, or she can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.  She was hired for a big project to create 45 large-sized picture scenes, 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and 49 small-sized picture scenes.  How many days will it take for her to create all of the picture scenes?

Reference Answer: At 5 small-sized picture scenes per day, 45 small-sized scenes will take 45/5 = <<45/5=9>>9 days.
At 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, 36 medium-sized scenes will take 36/6 = <<36/6=6>>6 days.
At 7 large-sized picture scenes per day, 49 large-sized scenes will take 49/7 = <<49/7=7>>7 days.
Altogether, the entire project will take 9 + 6 +7 = <<9+6+7=22>>22 days to complete.
