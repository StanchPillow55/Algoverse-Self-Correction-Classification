Question: Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills. He buys six squirt guns for $2 each.  He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each.  How much money does he have left?

Reference Answer: Craig starts off with 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.
Craig spends 6 squirt guns * $2 = $<<6*2=12>>12 on squirt guns.
Craig spends 3 packs of water balloons * $3 = $<<3*3=9>>9 on water balloons.
Total Craig has spent $12 + $9 = $<<12+9=21>>21.
Craig has $40 - $21 = $<<40-21=19>>19 remaining.
