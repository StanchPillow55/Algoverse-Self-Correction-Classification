Question: Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. If they worked for 12 hours in a day, calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together.

Reference Answer: Merissa makes 3/4 * 120 pounds = <<3/4*120=90>>90 pounds of chocolate in an hour.
Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolate in two hours; this means she makes 120 pounds / 2 hours = <<120/2=60>>60 pounds of chocolate in an hour.
If they worked for 12 hours, Ruiz made 12 hours * 60 pounds/hour = <<12*60=720>>720 pounds of chocolate while
Marissa made 90 pounds/hour * 12 hours = <<90*12=1080>>1080 pounds of chocolate
The combined amount of pounds of chocolate they both ate is 1080 pounds + 720 pounds = <<1080+720=1800>>1800 pounds of chocolate
