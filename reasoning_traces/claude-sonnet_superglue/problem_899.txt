Question: Susan made 100 cookies for Christmas and was going to equally divide them between her 6 nephews. Before Susan could package them, her husband snuck 4 cookies for himself. How many cookies will each of Susanâ€™s nephews get?

Reference Answer: Subtract 4 from 100 to see how many cookies are left. 100 cookies - 4 cookies = <<100-4=96>>96 cookies
Divide 96 cookies between her 6 nephews = 96 cookies/6 people = <<96/6=16>>16 cookies/person
#### 16
