Question: Millie decides to open a lemonade stand. She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?

Reference Answer: She has enough supplies to make 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 cups of lemonade.
She sells all of the lemonade for 36 * $1 = $<<36*1=36>>36.
Her total profit for selling the lemonade is $36 - $18 = $<<36-18=18>>18.
It will take Millie 36 / 4 = <<36/4=9>>9 hours of work to sell all of the lemonade.
Her hourly profit is $18 / 9 hours = $<<18/9=2>>2 per hour.
