To solve the problem of counting the number of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1, we need to consider a few key points:

### Understanding the Problem

1. **n-digit Numbers**: An n-digit number is a number that has exactly n digits. For example, if n = 3, the numbers range from 100 to 999.

2. **Starting or Ending with 1**: We need to count numbers that either start with 1 or end with 1, or both.

### Approach

1. **Counting Numbers Starting with 1**:
   - For an n-digit number starting with 1, the first digit is fixed as 1.
   - The remaining (n-1) digits can be anything from 0 to 9.
   - Therefore, there are \(10^{(n-1)}\) such numbers.

2. **Counting Numbers Ending with 1**:
   - For an n-digit number ending with 1, the last digit is fixed as 1.
   - The first digit can be anything from 1 to 9 (to ensure it's an n-digit number).
   - The remaining (n-2) digits can be anything from 0 to 9.
   - Therefore, there are \(9 \times 10^{(n-2)}\) such numbers.

3. **Avoid Double Counting**:
   - Numbers that both start and end with 1 are counted in both of the above cases.
   - These numbers have the form 1xxxx...x1, where there are (n-2) digits in between.
   - There are \(10^{(n-2)}\) such numbers.

4. **Total Count**:
   - The total count is the sum of numbers starting with 1 and numbers ending with 1, minus the double-counted numbers.
   - Formula: \(10^{(n-1)} + 9 \times 10^{(n-2)} - 10^{(n-2)}\)

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function using the above logic:

```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """
    if n == 1:
        # Special case: for 1-digit numbers, they are 1, 2, ..., 9
        # Only 1 and 11 (which is not a 1-digit number) start or end with 1
        return 1
    
    # Calculate the number of n-digit numbers starting with 1
    start_with_1 = 10**(n-1)
    
    # Calculate the number of n-digit numbers ending with 1
    end_with_1 = 9 * 10**(n-2)
    
    # Calculate the number of n-digit numbers both starting and ending with 1
    both_start_and_end_with_1 = 10**(n-2)
    
    # Total count
    total_count = start_with_1 + end_with_1 - both_start_and_end_with_1
    
    return total_count

# Example usage:
# print(starts_one_ends(2))  # Should return 18
```

### Explanation of Edge Cases

- **n = 1**: For single-digit numbers, only the number 1 starts or ends with 1. Hence, the result is 1.
- **General Case**: For n > 1, the formula derived above applies.

This solution efficiently calculates the count using mathematical operations, ensuring it runs in constant time regardless of the size of n.
