To solve this problem, we need to create a function `sort_third` that takes a list `l` and returns a new list `l'`. The new list should have the same elements as `l`, but the elements at indices that are divisible by three should be sorted, while the rest of the elements remain in their original positions.

Let's break down the steps to achieve this:

1. **Identify Indices Divisible by Three**: We need to identify which indices in the list are divisible by three. These indices are 0, 3, 6, 9, etc.

2. **Extract Elements at These Indices**: Once we have identified these indices, we need to extract the elements from the list `l` that are located at these indices.

3. **Sort the Extracted Elements**: After extracting these elements, we sort them in ascending order.

4. **Reconstruct the List**: We then reconstruct the list `l'` by placing the sorted elements back into their original positions (indices divisible by three) and leaving the rest of the elements unchanged.

5. **Return the New List**: Finally, we return the newly constructed list `l'`.

Now, let's implement this logic in the function `sort_third`.

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    # Step 1: Identify indices divisible by three and extract corresponding elements
    divisible_by_three_indices = [i for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0]
    elements_to_sort = [l[i] for i in divisible_by_three_indices]
    
    # Step 2: Sort the extracted elements
    elements_to_sort.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Reconstruct the list with sorted elements at the correct positions
    l_prime = l[:]  # Make a copy of the original list
    for index, sorted_value in zip(divisible_by_three_indices, elements_to_sort):
        l_prime[index] = sorted_value
    
    # Step 4: Return the new list
    return l_prime

# Testing the function with provided examples
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # Output: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:
- We first create a list of indices that are divisible by three using a list comprehension.
- We then extract the elements from the original list `l` at these indices.
- We sort the extracted elements.
- We create a copy of the original list to avoid modifying it directly.
- We replace the elements at the indices divisible by three in the copied list with the sorted elements.
- Finally, we return the modified list.

This approach ensures that only the elements at indices divisible by three are sorted, while the rest of the list remains unchanged.
