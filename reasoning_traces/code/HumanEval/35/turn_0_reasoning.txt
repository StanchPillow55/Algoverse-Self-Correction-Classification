To solve the problem of finding the maximum element in a list, we need to consider a few key points:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We are given a list of numbers, and we need to return the maximum element from this list. The list can contain both positive and negative integers, and it can be of any length, including zero.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - An empty list: If the list is empty, there is no maximum element. In Python, this typically raises an exception since there is no element to compare.
   - A list with one element: The maximum element is the element itself.
   - A list with all negative numbers: The maximum will be the least negative number.

3. **Approach**:
   - If the list is empty, we should decide on a behavior. A common approach is to raise a `ValueError` indicating that the list is empty.
   - Initialize a variable to hold the maximum value. We can start by assuming the first element is the maximum.
   - Iterate through the list, comparing each element with the current maximum. If an element is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum.
   - Return the maximum value after completing the iteration.

4. **Implementation**:
   - We will define a function `max_element` that takes a list as an argument.
   - We will handle the empty list case by raising a `ValueError`.
   - We will iterate through the list to find the maximum value.

Here is the implementation of the `max_element` function:

```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    """
    if not l:
        raise ValueError("The list is empty, no maximum element exists.")
    
    # Assume the first element is the maximum initially
    max_val = l[0]
    
    # Iterate through the list starting from the second element
    for num in l[1:]:
        if num > max_val:
            max_val = num
    
    return max_val
```

### Explanation:
- **Empty List Check**: We first check if the list is empty using `if not l:`. If it is, we raise a `ValueError`.
- **Initialization**: We initialize `max_val` with the first element of the list.
- **Iteration**: We iterate over the list starting from the second element. For each element, we check if it is greater than `max_val`. If it is, we update `max_val`.
- **Return**: After the loop, `max_val` contains the maximum value, which we return.

This solution efficiently finds the maximum element in a list with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
