To solve the problem of finding the minimum path of length `k` in a grid, we need to consider the following steps:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Grid Structure**: The grid is an `N x N` matrix where each cell contains a unique integer from `1` to `N*N`. This means each number appears exactly once in the grid.

2. **Path Definition**: A path of length `k` means visiting exactly `k` cells. The path can start from any cell, and you can move to any of the neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) without going off the grid.

3. **Lexicographical Order**: The path is considered minimal if the sequence of numbers collected from the path is lexicographically smallest. This means we need to compare paths based on the sequence of numbers they collect.

4. **Constraints**: We cannot go off the grid, and the path length is exactly `k`.

### Approach

1. **Starting Point**: Since we can start from any cell, we need to consider all possible starting points in the grid.

2. **Path Exploration**: Use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to explore all possible paths of length `k` starting from each cell.

3. **Path Comparison**: As we explore paths, we keep track of the lexicographically smallest path found so far.

4. **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure that during exploration, we do not go off the grid.

5. **Optimization**: Since the grid contains unique numbers from `1` to `N*N`, starting from the smallest number might help in quickly finding the minimal path. However, we still need to explore all possibilities to ensure correctness.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function `minPath` using the above approach:

```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # right, down, left, up
    
    def is_valid(x, y):
        return 0 <= x < N and 0 <= y < N
    
    def dfs(x, y, path):
        if len(path) == k:
            return path
        
        min_path = None
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if is_valid(nx, ny):
                new_path = path + [grid[nx][ny]]
                candidate_path = dfs(nx, ny, new_path)
                if min_path is None or candidate_path < min_path:
                    min_path = candidate_path
        return min_path
    
    # Start from all possible cells and find the minimum path
    min_path_overall = None
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            path = [grid[i][j]]
            candidate_path = dfs(i, j, path)
            if min_path_overall is None or candidate_path < min_path_overall:
                min_path_overall = candidate_path
    
    return min_path_overall

# Example usage:
print(minPath([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 3))  # Output: [1, 2, 1]
print(minPath([[5, 9, 3], [4, 1, 6], [7, 8, 2]], 1))  # Output: [1]
```

### Explanation

- **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function recursively explores all paths of length `k` starting from a given cell `(x, y)`. It returns the lexicographically smallest path found from that starting point.

- **Path Comparison**: We compare paths using the natural list comparison in Python, which is lexicographical.

- **Overall Minimum Path**: We keep track of the overall minimum path found across all starting points.

This solution ensures that we explore all possible paths of length `k` and find the lexicographically smallest one. The complexity is manageable due to the constraints, and the guarantee of a unique solution simplifies the comparison logic.
