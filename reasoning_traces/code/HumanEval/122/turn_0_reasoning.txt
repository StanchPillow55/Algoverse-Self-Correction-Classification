==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to sum the elements of an array that have at most two digits, but only consider the first `k` elements of the array. Let's break down the steps needed to achieve this:

1. **Understand the Input and Output**:
   - We have an array `arr` of integers and an integer `k`.
   - We need to consider only the first `k` elements of `arr`.
   - From these `k` elements, we need to sum only those elements that have at most two digits.

2. **Constraints**:
   - The array `arr` is non-empty, and its length is between 1 and 100.
   - The integer `k` is at least 1 and at most the length of `arr`.

3. **Plan**:
   - Initialize a variable `total_sum` to 0 to keep track of the sum of elements with at most two digits.
   - Iterate over the first `k` elements of `arr`.
   - For each element, check if it has at most two digits. An integer has at most two digits if its absolute value is less than 100 (i.e., `-99` to `99`).
   - If the element meets the criteria, add it to `total_sum`.
   - After iterating through the first `k` elements, return `total_sum`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all elements in the first `k` elements have more than two digits, the result should be 0.
   - If `k` is equal to the length of `arr`, we consider all elements in `arr`.

Now, let's implement the function based on this plan:

```python
def add_elements(arr, k):
    """
    Given a non-empty array of integers arr and an integer k, return
    the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of arr.
    """
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if -99 <= arr[i] <= 99:
            total_sum += arr[i]
    return total_sum

# Example usage:
# arr = [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], k = 4
# The output should be 24 because only 21 and 3 have at most two digits.
```

This function iterates over the first `k` elements of `arr`, checks if each element has at most two digits, and sums those that do. The solution is efficient given the constraints and should work for all valid inputs as specified.
