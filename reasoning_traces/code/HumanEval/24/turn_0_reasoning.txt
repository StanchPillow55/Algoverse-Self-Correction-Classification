To solve the problem of finding the largest divisor of a given number \( n \) that is smaller than \( n \), we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the problem and think through the steps needed to implement the solution.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Understanding Divisors**: A divisor of a number \( n \) is any integer \( d \) such that \( n \mod d = 0 \). This means that when \( n \) is divided by \( d \), there is no remainder.

2. **Largest Divisor Smaller than \( n \)**: We are specifically looking for the largest divisor of \( n \) that is less than \( n \). This means we should start checking from \( n-1 \) downwards to find the first number that divides \( n \) evenly.

### Approach

1. **Iterate Backwards**: Start from \( n-1 \) and iterate downwards to 1. For each number \( i \), check if it divides \( n \) evenly (i.e., \( n \mod i = 0 \)).

2. **First Match**: The first number \( i \) that satisfies the condition \( n \mod i = 0 \) is the largest divisor of \( n \) that is smaller than \( n \).

3. **Return the Result**: Once we find such a number, return it immediately as it is the largest by virtue of our reverse iteration.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function `largest_divisor` based on the above reasoning:

```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n """
    # Start from n-1 and go down to 1
    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
    # In case n is 1, the loop will not execute, but by definition, 1 has no divisors less than itself.
    # However, since the problem doesn't specify behavior for n=1, we assume n is always > 1.
```

### Explanation

- **Loop**: We use a `for` loop to iterate from \( n-1 \) down to 1. This ensures that we check the largest possible divisors first.
- **Condition**: The condition `n % i == 0` checks if \( i \) is a divisor of \( n \).
- **Return**: As soon as we find a divisor, we return it because it is the largest one due to our iteration order.

This solution efficiently finds the largest divisor smaller than \( n \) by leveraging a simple loop and modulus operation.
