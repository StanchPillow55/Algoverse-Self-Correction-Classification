To solve the problem of implementing the `add` function, let's break down the requirements and the steps needed to achieve the solution.

### Problem Understanding

The task is to implement a function named `add` that takes two integer arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns their sum. The function should work as demonstrated in the provided examples:

- `add(2, 3)` should return `5`.
- `add(5, 7)` should return `12`.

### Approach

1. **Function Signature**: The function is defined with two parameters, `x` and `y`, both of which are integers. The return type is also an integer.

2. **Operation**: The core operation required is addition. In Python, the `+` operator is used to add two numbers.

3. **Return Statement**: The function should return the result of the addition of `x` and `y`.

4. **Docstring**: The function includes a docstring that provides a brief description of its purpose and includes examples of how the function should behave.

### Implementation

Given the simplicity of the task, the implementation is straightforward. We will define the function `add`, perform the addition of `x` and `y`, and return the result.

Here's the complete implementation:

```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y
```

### Explanation

- **Function Definition**: `def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:` defines a function named `add` that takes two integer arguments and returns an integer.
  
- **Docstring**: The docstring provides a brief description of the function's purpose and includes examples of expected input and output.

- **Return Statement**: `return x + y` computes the sum of `x` and `y` and returns the result.

This implementation is efficient and meets the requirements specified in the problem statement. The function will correctly add two integers and return their sum.
