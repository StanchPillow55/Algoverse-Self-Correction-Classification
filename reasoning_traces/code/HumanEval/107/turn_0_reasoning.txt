To solve this problem, we need to determine how many even and odd integer palindromes exist within the range from 1 to a given number \( n \), inclusive. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Understanding the Problem

1. **Palindrome Definition**: A number is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 and 9 are palindromes, but 123 is not.

2. **Even and Odd Numbers**:
   - An even number is divisible by 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 6).
   - An odd number is not divisible by 2 (e.g., 1, 3, 5).

3. **Task**: For a given \( n \), count how many numbers from 1 to \( n \) are palindromes, and among those, how many are even and how many are odd.

### Approach

1. **Iterate through the Range**: We will iterate through each number from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Check for Palindrome**: For each number, we need to check if it is a palindrome. This can be done by converting the number to a string and checking if the string is equal to its reverse.

3. **Check for Even or Odd**: If a number is a palindrome, we then check if it is even or odd.

4. **Count Even and Odd Palindromes**: Maintain two counters, one for even palindromes and one for odd palindromes, and update these counters accordingly.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd palindromes.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the solution based on the above approach:

```python
def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        # Convert the number to a string
        num_str = str(num)
        
        # Check if the number is a palindrome
        if num_str == num_str[::-1]:
            # Check if the number is even or odd
            if num % 2 == 0:
                even_count += 1
            else:
                odd_count += 1
    
    return (even_count, odd_count)

# Example usage:
print(even_odd_palindrome(3))  # Output: (1, 2)
print(even_odd_palindrome(12)) # Output: (4, 6)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We initialize `even_count` and `odd_count` to zero.
- We loop through each number from 1 to \( n \).
- For each number, we convert it to a string and check if it is a palindrome by comparing the string to its reverse.
- If it is a palindrome, we check if it is even or odd and update the respective counter.
- Finally, we return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd palindromes.

This solution efficiently counts the even and odd palindromes within the given range, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.
