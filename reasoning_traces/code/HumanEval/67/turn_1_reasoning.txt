To solve the problem of determining the number of mangoes in a basket given a string representation of the number of apples and oranges, and the total number of fruits, we can break down the task into a series of logical steps:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input Details:**
   - A string `s` that contains the number of apples and oranges in a specific format: "X apples and Y oranges".
   - An integer `n` that represents the total number of fruits in the basket.

2. **Output:**
   - An integer representing the number of mangoes in the basket.

3. **Examples:**
   - `fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19)` should return `8` because there are 19 fruits in total, 5 are apples, and 6 are oranges, leaving 8 mangoes.
   - `fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3)` should return `2` because there are 3 fruits in total, 0 are apples, and 1 is an orange, leaving 2 mangoes.

### Approach

1. **Extract Numbers from the String:**
   - We need to extract the numbers representing apples and oranges from the string `s`.
   - The format is consistent: "X apples and Y oranges", so we can split the string and extract the numbers.

2. **Calculate the Number of Mangoes:**
   - Subtract the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits `n` to get the number of mangoes.

3. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Split the string `s` using spaces to separate the components.
   - Convert the appropriate parts of the split string to integers to get the number of apples and oranges.
   - Subtract these numbers from `n` to find the number of mangoes.

### Implementation

Here's how we can implement this logic in Python:

```python
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    """
    Calculate the number of mangoes in the basket given the number of apples and oranges.
    
    Parameters:
    s (str): A string in the format "X apples and Y oranges".
    n (int): Total number of fruits in the basket.
    
    Returns:
    int: Number of mangoes in the basket.
    """
    # Split the string to extract numbers
    parts = s.split()
    
    # Extract the number of apples and oranges
    num_apples = int(parts[0])
    num_oranges = int(parts[3])
    
    # Calculate the number of mangoes
    num_mangoes = n - num_apples - num_oranges
    
    return num_mangoes

# Test cases
print(fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19))  # Output: 8
print(fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3))   # Output: 2
print(fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100)) # Output: 95
print(fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120)) # Output: 19
```

### Explanation

- We split the string `s` into parts using the `split()` method, which breaks the string into a list of words.
- We then extract the first and fourth elements of this list, which correspond to the number of apples and oranges, respectively.
- These extracted values are converted to integers.
- Finally, we subtract the sum of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits `n` to get the number of mangoes. This result is returned by the function.
