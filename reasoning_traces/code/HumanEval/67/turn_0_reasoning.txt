To solve the problem of determining the number of mangoes in a basket given a string that specifies the number of apples and oranges, and an integer that represents the total number of fruits, we can break down the problem into the following steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Input:**
   - We have a string that contains the number of apples and oranges in a specific format, e.g., "5 apples and 6 oranges".
   - We also have an integer `n` that represents the total number of fruits in the basket.

2. **Understand the Output:**
   - We need to calculate the number of mangoes in the basket. This can be done by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits.

3. **Extract Numbers from the String:**
   - The string is formatted in a way that the number of apples and oranges are given as integers followed by the words "apples" and "oranges".
   - We can use regular expressions to extract these numbers from the string.

4. **Calculate the Number of Mangoes:**
   - Once we have the number of apples and oranges, we subtract these from the total number of fruits to get the number of mangoes.

5. **Implement the Solution:**
   - Use Python's `re` module to extract numbers from the string.
   - Convert these extracted numbers to integers.
   - Perform the subtraction to find the number of mangoes.

### Implementation:

Let's implement the function `fruit_distribution` based on the above reasoning:

```python
import re

def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    """
    Calculate the number of mangoes in the basket given the number of apples and oranges.
    
    :param s: A string representing the number of apples and oranges.
    :param n: An integer representing the total number of fruits in the basket.
    :return: An integer representing the number of mangoes in the basket.
    """
    # Use regular expression to find all numbers in the string
    numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', s)
    
    # Convert the extracted numbers to integers
    apples = int(numbers[0])
    oranges = int(numbers[1])
    
    # Calculate the number of mangoes
    mangoes = n - apples - oranges
    
    return mangoes

# Test cases
print(fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19))  # Output: 8
print(fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3))   # Output: 2
print(fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100)) # Output: 95
print(fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120)) # Output: 19
```

### Explanation:

- **Regular Expression (`re.findall`)**: We use `re.findall(r'\d+', s)` to extract all sequences of digits from the string `s`. This will give us a list of strings representing the numbers.
- **Conversion to Integers**: We convert these string numbers to integers to perform arithmetic operations.
- **Subtraction**: We subtract the sum of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits to get the number of mangoes.
- **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the calculated number of mangoes. 

This approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging regular expressions to parse the input string and simple arithmetic to compute the result.
