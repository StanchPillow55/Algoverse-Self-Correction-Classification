To solve the problem of determining whether a list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, we need to understand what these terms mean:

1. **Monotonically Increasing**: A sequence is monotonically increasing if each element is greater than or equal to the previous one. For example, [1, 2, 2, 3] is monotonically increasing.

2. **Monotonically Decreasing**: A sequence is monotonically decreasing if each element is less than or equal to the previous one. For example, [5, 4, 4, 1] is monotonically decreasing.

Given these definitions, our task is to check if a list is either monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing.

### Approach

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the list is empty or contains only one element, it is trivially monotonic (both increasing and decreasing).
   
2. **Iterate Through the List**:
   - We can iterate through the list and compare each element with the next one to determine if the list is increasing or decreasing.
   
3. **Flags for Monotonicity**:
   - Use two boolean flags: `increasing` and `decreasing`.
   - Initialize both flags to `True`.
   - As we iterate through the list:
     - If we find an element that is smaller than the previous one, set `increasing` to `False`.
     - If we find an element that is larger than the previous one, set `decreasing` to `False`.
   
4. **Final Check**:
   - After iterating through the list, if either `increasing` or `decreasing` is still `True`, the list is monotonic.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Return `True` if the list is monotonic, otherwise `False`.

Let's implement this logic in the `monotonic` function:

```python
def monotonic(l: list) -> bool:
    """Return True if list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing."""
    if len(l) <= 1:
        return True
    
    increasing = True
    decreasing = True
    
    for i in range(1, len(l)):
        if l[i] > l[i - 1]:
            decreasing = False
        elif l[i] < l[i - 1]:
            increasing = False
    
    return increasing or decreasing

# Test cases
print(monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20]))  # True
print(monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])) # False
print(monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])) # True
```

### Explanation of the Implementation

- **Edge Case Handling**: We first check if the list has 0 or 1 element, in which case it is trivially monotonic.
- **Loop Through the List**: We start from the second element and compare each element with the previous one.
- **Update Flags**: Depending on whether the current element is greater or smaller than the previous one, we update the `increasing` and `decreasing` flags.
- **Return Result**: After the loop, if either flag is `True`, the list is monotonic, so we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

This solution efficiently checks the monotonicity of the list in a single pass with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
