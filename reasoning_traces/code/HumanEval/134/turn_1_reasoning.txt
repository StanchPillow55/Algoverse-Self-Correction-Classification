==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word. Let's break down the requirements and approach step by step:

### Understanding the Problem

1. **Alphabetical Character**: A character is considered alphabetical if it is a letter from A-Z or a-z.

2. **Not Part of a Word**: A word is defined as a sequence of characters separated by spaces. Therefore, a character is not part of a word if it is the only character or if it is preceded by a space.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - An empty string should return `False` because there is no character to check.
   - A string that ends with a space should return `False` because the last character is not a letter.
   - A string where the last character is a letter but is part of a word should return `False`.

### Approach

1. **Check for Empty String**: If the input string is empty, return `False`.

2. **Trim Trailing Spaces**: Use the `rstrip()` method to remove any trailing spaces from the string. This ensures that the last character we check is not a space.

3. **Check Last Character**:
   - After trimming, if the string is empty, return `False`.
   - Check if the last character is an alphabetical character using `isalpha()`.
   - If it is alphabetical, check if it is preceded by a space or if it is the only character in the string.

4. **Return Result**: Based on the checks, return `True` if the last character is an alphabetical character and not part of a word, otherwise return `False`.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above approach:

```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    # Step 1: Check for empty string
    if not txt:
        return False
    
    # Step 2: Trim trailing spaces
    txt = txt.rstrip()
    
    # Step 3: Check if the string is empty after trimming
    if not txt:
        return False
    
    # Step 4: Check the last character
    last_char = txt[-1]
    if last_char.isalpha():
        # Check if it's the only character or preceded by a space
        if len(txt) == 1 or txt[-2] == ' ':
            return True
    
    # Step 5: Return False if conditions are not met
    return False

# Test cases
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie"))  # ➞ False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e"))  # ➞ True
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e "))  # ➞ False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""))  # ➞ False
```

This implementation follows the outlined approach and handles the edge cases effectively. The function checks the conditions and returns the appropriate boolean value based on whether the last character is an alphabetical character and not part of a word.
