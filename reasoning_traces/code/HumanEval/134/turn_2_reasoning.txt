==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word. Let's break down the problem and think through the solution step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if the last character of the string is an alphabetical character (a-z or A-Z).
   - The last character should not be part of a word. A word is defined as a group of characters separated by spaces.
   - If the string is empty or the last character is not alphabetical, the function should return `False`.

2. **Analyzing Examples:**
   - For the string "apple pie", the last character is 'e', which is part of the word "pie", so the function should return `False`.
   - For the string "apple pi e", the last character is 'e', which is not part of a word (as it's not followed by any non-space character), so the function should return `True`.
   - For the string "apple pi e ", the last character is a space, so the function should return `False`.
   - For an empty string, there is no last character, so the function should return `False`.

3. **Plan:**
   - First, check if the string is empty. If it is, return `False`.
   - Trim any trailing spaces from the string to focus on the last meaningful character.
   - Check if the last character is an alphabetical character.
   - If it is, check if it is part of a word by ensuring that it is not preceded by another alphabetical character.
   - Return `True` if the last character is an alphabetical character and not part of a word, otherwise return `False`.

4. **Implementation:**
   - Use Python's string methods to trim spaces and check characters.
   - Use the `str.isalpha()` method to check if a character is alphabetical.

Here is the implementation of the function:

```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    # Trim trailing spaces
    txt = txt.rstrip()
    
    # If the string is empty after trimming, return False
    if not txt:
        return False
    
    # Check if the last character is an alphabetical character
    if txt[-1].isalpha():
        # Check if it is part of a word by looking at the character before it
        if len(txt) > 1 and txt[-2].isalpha():
            return False
        else:
            return True
    else:
        return False

# Test cases
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie"))  # ➞ False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e"))  # ➞ True
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e "))  # ➞ False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""))  # ➞ False
```

This function should correctly handle the given examples and other similar cases by following the outlined logic.
