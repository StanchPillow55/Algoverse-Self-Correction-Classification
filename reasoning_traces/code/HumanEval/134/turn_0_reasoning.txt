To solve the problem, we need to determine if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word. Let's break down the problem and think through the solution step by step:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Identify the Last Character**: We need to focus on the last character of the string. If the string is empty, we should immediately return `False` because there is no last character to check.

2. **Check if the Last Character is Alphabetical**: We need to verify if the last character is an alphabetical character (i.e., a letter from 'a' to 'z' or 'A' to 'Z').

3. **Determine if the Last Character is Part of a Word**: A character is considered part of a word if it is preceded by another alphabetical character without any space in between. Therefore, if the last character is a letter, we should check the character before it:
   - If the character before the last character is a space or doesn't exist (meaning the last character is the only character), then the last character is not part of a word.
   - If the character before the last character is also a letter, then the last character is part of a word.

### Plan

1. **Handle Edge Cases**: If the string is empty, return `False`.

2. **Trim Trailing Spaces**: Use `rstrip()` to remove any trailing spaces from the string. This ensures that we are checking the actual last character that is not a space.

3. **Check the Last Character**:
   - If the last character is not a letter, return `False`.
   - If it is a letter, check the character before it:
     - If the character before it is a space or doesn't exist, return `True`.
     - Otherwise, return `False`.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function based on the above plan:

```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    # Step 1: Handle the edge case of an empty string
    if not txt:
        return False
    
    # Step 2: Trim trailing spaces
    txt = txt.rstrip()
    
    # Step 3: Check if the last character is a letter
    if txt and txt[-1].isalpha():
        # Check the character before the last character
        if len(txt) == 1 or txt[-2] == ' ':
            return True
        else:
            return False
    else:
        return False

# Test cases
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie"))  # ➞ False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e"))  # ➞ True
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e "))  # ➞ False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""))  # ➞ False
```

### Explanation of the Implementation

- We first check if the input string is empty. If it is, we return `False` immediately.
- We use `rstrip()` to remove any trailing spaces from the string, ensuring that the last character we check is not a space.
- We then check if the last character is a letter using `isalpha()`.
- If the last character is a letter, we check the character before it. If the character before it is a space or doesn't exist (meaning the last character is the only character), we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

This solution efficiently checks the conditions specified in the problem statement and handles edge cases appropriately.
