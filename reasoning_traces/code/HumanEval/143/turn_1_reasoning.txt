To solve the problem of extracting words from a sentence whose lengths are prime numbers, we need to follow a structured approach. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to extract words from a given sentence such that the length of each word is a prime number. The order of words in the output should be the same as in the input sentence.

### Step 2: Define Prime Numbers
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc., are prime numbers.

### Step 3: Plan the Solution
1. **Split the Sentence**: First, we need to split the sentence into individual words.
2. **Check Prime Length**: For each word, calculate its length and check if this length is a prime number.
3. **Collect Prime-Length Words**: If a word's length is prime, add it to the result list.
4. **Return Result**: Join the collected words into a single string separated by spaces and return it.

### Step 4: Implement Helper Function
To check if a number is prime, we can create a helper function `is_prime(n)`:
- If `n` is less than 2, it's not prime.
- Check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it's not prime.
- If no divisors are found, `n` is prime.

### Step 5: Implement the Main Function
Using the helper function, we can implement the main function `words_in_sentence(sentence)` to process the sentence as planned.

### Step 6: Code Implementation

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    Extract words from the sentence whose lengths are prime numbers.
    """
    words = sentence.split()
    prime_length_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    return ' '.join(prime_length_words)

# Example usage:
# print(words_in_sentence("This is a test"))  # Output: "is"
# print(words_in_sentence("lets go for swimming"))  # Output: "go for"
```

### Explanation of the Code
- **`is_prime(n)`**: This function checks if a number `n` is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of `n`.
- **`words_in_sentence(sentence)`**: This function splits the sentence into words, filters words whose lengths are prime using list comprehension, and joins the filtered words into a single string.

This solution efficiently handles the problem within the given constraints and provides the desired output.
