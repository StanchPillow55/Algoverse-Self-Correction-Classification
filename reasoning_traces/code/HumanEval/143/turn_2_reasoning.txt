==================================================

To solve the problem of extracting words from a sentence whose lengths are prime numbers, we need to follow a structured approach. Let's break down the problem and work through the solution step by step.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a sentence with words separated by spaces.
   - We need to identify words whose lengths are prime numbers.
   - Return these words in the same order they appear in the sentence.

2. **Prime Number Check:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - For this problem, we need a helper function to determine if a given number is prime.

3. **Splitting the Sentence:**
   - We can split the sentence into words using Python's `str.split()` method, which will give us a list of words.

4. **Filter Words by Prime Length:**
   - Iterate over the list of words.
   - For each word, calculate its length and check if it is a prime number using the helper function.
   - Collect words with prime lengths.

5. **Return the Result:**
   - Join the filtered words back into a single string with spaces separating them.
   - Return this string as the result.

### Implementation

Let's implement the solution based on the above reasoning:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    Returns a string containing words from the original sentence
    whose lengths are prime numbers.
    """
    words = sentence.split()
    prime_length_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    return ' '.join(prime_length_words)

# Example usage:
print(words_in_sentence("This is a test"))  # Output: "is"
print(words_in_sentence("lets go for swimming"))  # Output: "go for"
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **`is_prime` Function:** This function checks if a number is prime. It handles small numbers directly and uses a loop to check divisibility for larger numbers, optimizing by checking up to the square root of `n`.
  
- **`words_in_sentence` Function:**
  - Splits the input sentence into a list of words.
  - Uses a list comprehension to filter words whose lengths are prime.
  - Joins the filtered words into a single string and returns it.

This solution efficiently identifies words with prime lengths and maintains the order of words as required by the problem statement.
