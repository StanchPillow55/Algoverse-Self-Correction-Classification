To solve the problem of concatenating a list of strings into a single string, let's break down the requirements and the steps needed to implement the solution.

### Problem Understanding

The task is to take a list of strings and concatenate them into a single string. The function should handle the following cases:
1. An empty list should return an empty string.
2. A list with one or more strings should return a single string that is the result of concatenating all the strings in the list in the order they appear.

### Approach

1. **Input Type**: The input is a list of strings (`List[str]`).
2. **Output Type**: The output is a single string (`str`).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the list is empty, the result should be an empty string.
   - If the list contains one string, the result should be that string itself.
   - If the list contains multiple strings, they should be concatenated in the order they appear.

4. **Concatenation Method**:
   - Python provides a straightforward way to concatenate strings using the `join` method. This method is efficient and concise.
   - The `join` method is called on a string separator and takes an iterable (in this case, a list of strings) as an argument. It concatenates the elements of the iterable, inserting the separator between each element. For our problem, the separator should be an empty string (`''`), as we want to concatenate the strings directly without any additional characters between them.

### Implementation

Given the above understanding, the implementation is straightforward. We will use the `join` method to concatenate the strings in the list. Let's implement the function:

```python
from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    """
    # Use the join method to concatenate the list of strings
    return ''.join(strings)
```

### Explanation

- **`join` Method**: The `join` method is used here with an empty string as the separator. This means that the elements of the list will be concatenated directly without any additional characters between them.
- **Efficiency**: The `join` method is generally more efficient than using a loop to concatenate strings, especially for large lists, because it minimizes the number of intermediate string objects created.

This implementation efficiently handles all the specified cases and edge cases, providing the correct output for any list of strings.
