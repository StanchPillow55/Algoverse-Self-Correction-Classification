To solve the problem of generating a list of rolling maximum elements from a given list of integers, we need to understand the concept of a "rolling maximum." The rolling maximum at each position in the list is the maximum value encountered from the start of the list up to that position.

Let's break down the problem and approach it step by step:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Input and Output:**
   - **Input:** A list of integers, `numbers`.
   - **Output:** A list of integers where each element is the maximum value encountered from the start of the list up to that position.

2. **Example Analysis:**
   - Given the input `[1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]`, the rolling maximum should be calculated as follows:
     - Start with the first element: `1`. The rolling maximum is `[1]`.
     - Next element is `2`. The maximum of `[1, 2]` is `2`. Rolling maximum becomes `[1, 2]`.
     - Next element is `3`. The maximum of `[1, 2, 3]` is `3`. Rolling maximum becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.
     - Next element is `2`. The maximum of `[1, 2, 3, 2]` is `3`. Rolling maximum becomes `[1, 2, 3, 3]`.
     - Next element is `3`. The maximum of `[1, 2, 3, 2, 3]` is `3`. Rolling maximum becomes `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3]`.
     - Next element is `4`. The maximum of `[1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4]` is `4`. Rolling maximum becomes `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`.
     - Last element is `2`. The maximum of `[1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]` is `4`. Rolling maximum becomes `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]`.

3. **Algorithm Design:**
   - Initialize an empty list `rolling_max_list` to store the rolling maximum values.
   - Initialize a variable `current_max` to keep track of the maximum value encountered so far. Start with a very small value (or the first element of the list).
   - Iterate through each element in the input list `numbers`:
     - Update `current_max` to be the maximum of `current_max` and the current element.
     - Append `current_max` to `rolling_max_list`.
   - Return the `rolling_max_list` as the result.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the input list is empty, the output should also be an empty list.

Now, let's implement the solution in Python:

```python
from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
    in the sequence.
    """
    if not numbers:
        return []
    
    rolling_max_list = []
    current_max = float('-inf')  # Start with the smallest possible value
    
    for num in numbers:
        current_max = max(current_max, num)
        rolling_max_list.append(current_max)
    
    return rolling_max_list

# Example usage:
# print(rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
```

### Explanation:
- We start with `current_max` initialized to negative infinity to ensure any number in the list will be larger initially.
- As we iterate through the list, we update `current_max` to be the maximum of itself and the current number.
- We append this `current_max` to the `rolling_max_list` at each step.
- This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the rolling maximum in a single pass through the list, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list.
