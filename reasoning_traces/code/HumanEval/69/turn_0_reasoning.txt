==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest integer in the list that satisfies two conditions:
1. The integer is greater than zero.
2. The frequency of the integer in the list is greater than or equal to the integer itself.

Let's break down the approach step by step:

1. **Understand the Problem Requirements**: 
   - We need to find an integer `x` such that `x > 0` and the frequency of `x` in the list is `>= x`.
   - We need to return the greatest such integer. If no such integer exists, return `-1`.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - We need to calculate the frequency of each integer in the list. This can be efficiently done using a dictionary or the `collections.Counter` class in Python.

3. **Iterate and Check Conditions**:
   - Once we have the frequency of each integer, we iterate through the unique integers and check if the frequency condition is satisfied.
   - Keep track of the greatest integer that satisfies the condition.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - If we find at least one integer that satisfies the condition, return the greatest one. Otherwise, return `-1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Since the list is non-empty and contains positive integers, we don't need to handle empty lists or non-positive integers.

Now, let's implement the solution:

```python
from collections import Counter

def search(lst):
    # Calculate the frequency of each integer in the list
    frequency = Counter(lst)
    
    # Initialize the variable to store the greatest integer that satisfies the condition
    greatest_valid_integer = -1
    
    # Iterate through each unique integer in the list
    for num in frequency:
        # Check if the frequency of the integer is greater than or equal to the integer itself
        if frequency[num] >= num:
            # Update the greatest_valid_integer if the current number is greater
            greatest_valid_integer = max(greatest_valid_integer, num)
    
    return greatest_valid_integer

# Test cases
print(search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]))  # Output: 2
print(search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]))  # Output: 3
print(search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]))  # Output: -1
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We use `collections.Counter` to get the frequency of each integer in the list.
- We initialize `greatest_valid_integer` to `-1` to handle the case where no integer satisfies the condition.
- We iterate through each unique integer in the frequency dictionary.
- For each integer, we check if its frequency is greater than or equal to the integer itself.
- If the condition is satisfied, we update `greatest_valid_integer` to be the maximum of its current value and the integer.
- Finally, we return `greatest_valid_integer`, which will be `-1` if no integer met the condition.
