==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest integer in a list that meets a specific condition: the integer's frequency in the list must be greater than or equal to the integer's value itself. If no such integer exists, we should return -1.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Problem Requirements:**
   - We have a list of positive integers.
   - We need to find an integer `x` such that the frequency of `x` in the list is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - We need to return the greatest such integer.
   - If no integer satisfies the condition, return -1.

2. **Plan the Solution:**
   - First, calculate the frequency of each integer in the list. This can be done using a dictionary where the keys are the integers and the values are their respective frequencies.
   - Iterate through the dictionary to find integers that satisfy the condition (frequency >= integer value).
   - Track the greatest integer that satisfies the condition.
   - If no integer satisfies the condition, return -1.

3. **Implement the Solution:**
   - Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each integer in the list.
   - Iterate over the dictionary to check which integers meet the condition.
   - Keep track of the maximum integer that satisfies the condition.
   - Return the maximum integer found, or -1 if none are found.

Let's implement the function based on this plan:

```python
def search(lst):
    # Step 1: Calculate the frequency of each integer in the list
    frequency = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in frequency:
            frequency[num] += 1
        else:
            frequency[num] = 1
    
    # Step 2: Find the greatest integer that satisfies the condition
    max_value = -1
    for num, count in frequency.items():
        if count >= num:
            max_value = max(max_value, num)
    
    return max_value

# Test cases
print(search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]))  # Output: 2
print(search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]))  # Output: 3
print(search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]))  # Output: -1
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first create a dictionary `frequency` to store the count of each integer in the list.
- We iterate over each number in the list and update its count in the dictionary.
- We then iterate over the items in the dictionary to find the greatest integer that satisfies the condition (frequency >= integer value).
- We use a variable `max_value` initialized to -1 to keep track of the greatest integer found that meets the condition.
- Finally, we return `max_value`. If no integer meets the condition, `max_value` remains -1, which is returned as specified.
