==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break it down into a few steps:

1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**
   - We are given an array `arr` of integers.
   - We need to calculate the sum of the magnitudes (absolute values) of the integers in the array.
   - We also need to calculate the product of the signs of each number in the array. The sign of a number is represented by:
     - `1` for positive numbers,
     - `-1` for negative numbers,
     - `0` for zero.
   - The final result should be the sum of magnitudes multiplied by the product of signs.
   - If the array is empty, we should return `None`.

2. **Plan the Solution:**
   - First, check if the array is empty. If it is, return `None`.
   - Initialize a variable `sum_magnitudes` to store the sum of magnitudes.
   - Initialize a variable `product_of_signs` to store the product of signs. Start with `1` because multiplying by 1 doesn't change the product.
   - Iterate over each number in the array:
     - Add the absolute value of the number to `sum_magnitudes`.
     - Determine the sign of the number and multiply it with `product_of_signs`.
   - After processing all numbers, multiply `sum_magnitudes` by `product_of_signs` to get the final result.
   - Return the result.

3. **Consider Edge Cases:**
   - An empty array should return `None`.
   - If the array contains a zero, the product of signs will be zero, making the final result zero regardless of the sum of magnitudes.

4. **Implement the Solution:**

```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    """
    You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return
    sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs
    of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.
    Note: return None for empty arr.
    """
    if not arr:
        return None
    
    sum_magnitudes = 0
    product_of_signs = 1
    
    for num in arr:
        sum_magnitudes += abs(num)
        if num > 0:
            sign = 1
        elif num < 0:
            sign = -1
        else:
            sign = 0
        product_of_signs *= sign
    
    return sum_magnitudes * product_of_signs

# Test cases
print(prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]))  # Expected output: -9
print(prod_signs([0, 1]))         # Expected output: 0
print(prod_signs([]))             # Expected output: None
```

This implementation follows the plan and handles the edge cases as discussed. The function should work correctly for the given problem statement and examples.
