To solve the problem of finding the two closest numbers in a list, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here's how we can think through the problem step by step:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understand the Problem**: 
   - We are given a list of floating-point numbers.
   - We need to find two numbers in this list that have the smallest absolute difference between them.
   - The result should be returned as a tuple with the smaller number first.

2. **Constraints and Assumptions**:
   - The list will have at least two numbers.
   - The numbers can be any floating-point values.
   - We need to ensure that the result is sorted in ascending order.

3. **Approach**:
   - **Sorting**: Start by sorting the list. Sorting will help us easily find the closest numbers because the smallest difference will be between consecutive elements in a sorted list.
   - **Iterate and Compare**: Once sorted, iterate through the list and calculate the difference between each pair of consecutive elements.
   - **Track the Minimum Difference**: Keep track of the smallest difference and the corresponding pair of numbers.
   - **Return the Result**: Once the iteration is complete, return the pair with the smallest difference, ensuring they are in ascending order.

4. **Complexity Consideration**:
   - Sorting the list takes \(O(n \log n)\) time.
   - Iterating through the list to find the closest pair takes \(O(n)\) time.
   - Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Since the list has at least two elements, we don't need to handle cases with fewer elements.
   - If there are multiple pairs with the same smallest difference, the first encountered pair will be returned due to the nature of our iteration.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the solution based on the above reasoning:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    # Step 1: Sort the list
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    
    # Step 2: Initialize variables to track the minimum difference and the closest pair
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[0], sorted_numbers[1])
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through the sorted list to find the closest pair
    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the difference between consecutive elements
        diff = sorted_numbers[i + 1] - sorted_numbers[i]
        
        # If this difference is smaller than the current minimum, update the closest pair
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[i], sorted_numbers[i + 1])
    
    # Step 4: Return the closest pair
    return closest_pair

# Example usage:
# print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.2)
# print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.0)
```

This implementation follows the outlined approach and efficiently finds the closest pair of numbers in the list.
