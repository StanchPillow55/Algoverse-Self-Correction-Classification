==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to sort an array of non-negative integers based on two criteria:

1. The primary sorting criterion is the number of `1`s in the binary representation of each integer. We need to count the number of `1`s in the binary form of each number and sort the numbers in ascending order based on this count.

2. If two numbers have the same number of `1`s in their binary representation, we then sort them based on their decimal value in ascending order.

Let's break down the steps to achieve this:

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Convert to Binary and Count `1`s**: For each number in the array, convert it to its binary representation and count the number of `1`s. In Python, we can use the `bin()` function to get the binary representation of a number as a string, and then use the `count('1')` method to count the `1`s.

2. **Sort the Array**: Use Python's built-in `sorted()` function to sort the array. The `sorted()` function allows us to specify a custom sorting key using the `key` parameter. We will use a tuple as the key, where the first element is the count of `1`s and the second element is the number itself. This ensures that numbers are primarily sorted by the count of `1`s, and secondarily by their decimal value.

3. **Return the Sorted Array**: After sorting, return the sorted array.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the `sort_array` function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def sort_array(arr):
    """
    Sort an array of non-negative integers according to the number of ones
    in their binary representation in ascending order. For similar number of ones,
    sort based on decimal value.
    """
    # Use sorted with a custom key
    # The key is a tuple: (number of 1s in binary, the number itself)
    return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x))

# Test cases
print(sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
print(sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]))  # Expected: [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]
print(sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected: [0, 1, 2, 4, 3]
```

### Explanation of Test Cases

- **Test Case 1**: `[1, 5, 2, 3, 4]`
  - Binary representations: `1` -> `0b1`, `5` -> `0b101`, `2` -> `0b10`, `3` -> `0b11`, `4` -> `0b100`
  - Number of `1`s: `1` -> 1, `5` -> 2, `2` -> 1, `3` -> 2, `4` -> 1
  - Sorted by number of `1`s and then by value: `[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]`

- **Test Case 2**: `[-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]`
  - This test case is invalid based on the problem statement since it involves negative numbers, which are not non-negative integers. However, if we were to handle negative numbers, we would sort them by their absolute values.

- **Test Case 3**: `[1, 0, 2, 3, 4]`
  - Binary representations: `1` -> `0b1`, `0` -> `0b0`, `2` -> `0b10`, `3` -> `0b11`, `4` -> `0b100`
  - Number of `1`s: `1` -> 1, `0` -> 0, `2` -> 1, `3` -> 2, `4` -> 1
  - Sorted by number of `1`s and then by value: `[0, 1, 2, 4, 3]`

The implementation should work correctly for non-negative integers as specified in the problem statement.
