To solve this problem, we need to determine if the intersection of two given intervals has a length that is a prime number. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Interval Representation:**
   - Each interval is represented as a tuple of two integers `(start, end)`.
   - The intervals are closed, meaning they include both the start and end points.

2. **Determine the Intersection:**
   - For two intervals `(start1, end1)` and `(start2, end2)`, the intersection interval can be determined as:
     - `intersection_start = max(start1, start2)`
     - `intersection_end = min(end1, end2)`
   - The intervals intersect if `intersection_start <= intersection_end`.

3. **Calculate the Length of the Intersection:**
   - If the intervals intersect, the length of the intersection is `intersection_end - intersection_start + 1`.
   - If they do not intersect, the length is effectively zero.

4. **Check if the Length is a Prime Number:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - We need a helper function to check if a number is prime.

5. **Return the Result:**
   - If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return "YES".
   - Otherwise, return "NO".

### Implementation:

Let's implement the solution based on the above approach:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    """Determine if the length of the intersection of two intervals is a prime number."""
    start1, end1 = interval1
    start2, end2 = interval2
    
    # Calculate the intersection interval
    intersection_start = max(start1, start2)
    intersection_end = min(end1, end2)
    
    # Check if there is an intersection
    if intersection_start <= intersection_end:
        # Calculate the length of the intersection
        intersection_length = intersection_end - intersection_start + 1
        # Check if the length is a prime number
        if is_prime(intersection_length):
            return "YES"
    
    return "NO"

# Test cases
print(intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)))  # Output: "NO"
print(intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)))  # Output: "NO"
print(intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)))  # Output: "YES"
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:

- **`is_prime` Function:** This helper function checks if a number is prime. It handles small numbers directly and uses trial division for larger numbers, checking divisibility up to the square root of `n`.
  
- **`intersection` Function:** This function calculates the intersection of two intervals, determines its length, and checks if the length is a prime number using the `is_prime` function. It returns "YES" if the length is prime and "NO" otherwise.

This solution efficiently determines the intersection and checks for primality, providing the correct result based on the problem requirements.
