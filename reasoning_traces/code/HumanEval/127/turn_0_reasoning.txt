To solve this problem, we need to determine whether the intersection of two given intervals has a length that is a prime number. Let's break down the steps needed to achieve this:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Intersection of Intervals:**
   - Given two intervals, `interval1 = (start1, end1)` and `interval2 = (start2, end2)`, the intersection of these intervals is defined as the interval that is common to both.
   - The intersection can be calculated as:
     - `start_intersection = max(start1, start2)`
     - `end_intersection = min(end1, end2)`
   - If `start_intersection` is greater than `end_intersection`, the intervals do not intersect.

2. **Calculate the Length of the Intersection:**
   - If the intervals intersect, the length of the intersection is given by:
     - `length_of_intersection = end_intersection - start_intersection + 1`
   - The `+1` accounts for the fact that the intervals are closed, meaning both endpoints are included.

3. **Check if the Length is a Prime Number:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - We need a helper function to check if a number is prime.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return "YES".
   - Otherwise, return "NO".

### Implementation:

Let's implement the solution based on the above steps:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    """Determine if the length of the intersection of two intervals is a prime number."""
    start1, end1 = interval1
    start2, end2 = interval2
    
    # Calculate the intersection
    start_intersection = max(start1, start2)
    end_intersection = min(end1, end2)
    
    # Check if there is an intersection
    if start_intersection > end_intersection:
        return "NO"
    
    # Calculate the length of the intersection
    length_of_intersection = end_intersection - start_intersection + 1
    
    # Check if the length is a prime number
    if is_prime(length_of_intersection):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"

# Test cases
print(intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)))  # Output: "NO"
print(intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)))  # Output: "NO"
print(intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)))  # Output: "YES"
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **`is_prime` Function:** This function checks if a number is prime. It handles small numbers directly and uses a loop to check divisibility for larger numbers, optimizing by skipping even numbers and using the 6k Â± 1 rule.
- **`intersection` Function:** This function calculates the intersection of two intervals and checks if the length of the intersection is prime using the `is_prime` helper function. It returns "YES" if the length is prime and "NO" otherwise.
