==================================================

To solve the problem of determining whether the length of the intersection of two intervals is a prime number, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given two intervals, each defined by a pair of integers (start, end). The intervals are closed, meaning they include both the start and end points. We need to find the intersection of these intervals and check if the length of this intersection is a prime number.

2. **Intersection of Intervals**: The intersection of two intervals (a, b) and (c, d) is defined by:
   - The start of the intersection is the maximum of the two start points: `max(a, c)`.
   - The end of the intersection is the minimum of the two end points: `min(b, d)`.
   - If the start of the intersection is greater than the end, the intervals do not intersect.

3. **Length of Intersection**: If the intervals intersect, the length of the intersection is calculated as `end - start + 1`. The `+1` accounts for the closed nature of the intervals.

4. **Prime Number Check**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. We need to check if the length of the intersection is a prime number.

5. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Calculate the intersection of the two intervals.
   - Determine the length of the intersection.
   - Check if the length is a prime number.
   - Return "YES" if the length is prime, otherwise return "NO".

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the intervals do not intersect, the length is zero, which is not prime.
   - Handle intervals with negative numbers correctly.

Let's implement the solution:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    """Determine if the length of the intersection of two intervals is a prime number."""
    start1, end1 = interval1
    start2, end2 = interval2
    
    # Calculate the intersection
    intersection_start = max(start1, start2)
    intersection_end = min(end1, end2)
    
    # Check if there is an intersection
    if intersection_start > intersection_end:
        return "NO"
    
    # Calculate the length of the intersection
    intersection_length = intersection_end - intersection_start + 1
    
    # Check if the length is a prime number
    if is_prime(intersection_length):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"

# Test cases
print(intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)))  # Output: "NO"
print(intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)))  # Output: "NO"
print(intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)))  # Output: "YES"
```

This solution correctly calculates the intersection of two intervals, determines the length of the intersection, and checks if that length is a prime number. The helper function `is_prime` efficiently checks for primality.
