==================================================

To solve the problem of decoding a string that has been encoded using the `encode_cyclic` function, we need to understand how the encoding process works and then reverse it.

### Understanding the Encoding Process

1. **Splitting into Groups**: The `encode_cyclic` function splits the input string into groups of three characters. If the string length is not a multiple of three, the last group will contain the remaining characters (either one or two characters).

2. **Cycling Characters**: For each group of exactly three characters, the function cycles the characters to the left. This means the first character of the group moves to the end, and the second and third characters move one position to the left. For example, the group "abc" becomes "bca".

3. **Handling Short Groups**: If a group has fewer than three characters, it remains unchanged.

### Decoding Strategy

To decode the string, we need to reverse the encoding process:

1. **Split the Encoded String into Groups**: Just like the encoding process, we split the string into groups of three characters. The last group may contain fewer than three characters.

2. **Reverse the Cycling**: For each group of exactly three characters, we need to reverse the cycling. This means taking the last character of the group and moving it to the front. For example, the group "bca" should be transformed back to "abc".

3. **Handle Short Groups**: Groups with fewer than three characters should remain unchanged.

4. **Reconstruct the String**: Finally, we concatenate all the groups back together to form the decoded string.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the `decode_cyclic` function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def decode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Takes as input a string encoded with the encode_cyclic function.
    Returns the decoded string.
    """
    # Split the string into groups of three characters
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    
    # Reverse the cycling for each group of exactly three characters
    groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    
    # Join the groups back into a single string
    return "".join(groups)

# Example usage:
# encoded = encode_cyclic("abcdefghi")
# decoded = decode_cyclic(encoded)
# print(decoded)  # Should output: "abcdefghi"
```

### Explanation of the Implementation

- **Splitting into Groups**: We use list comprehension to split the string into groups of three characters, similar to the encoding function.

- **Reversing the Cycling**: For each group of exactly three characters, we take the last character and move it to the front. This is done using slicing: `group[-1] + group[:-1]`.

- **Handling Short Groups**: Groups with fewer than three characters are left unchanged.

- **Reconstructing the String**: Finally, we join all the groups together to form the decoded string.

This approach ensures that the `decode_cyclic` function accurately reverses the transformations made by the `encode_cyclic` function.
