==================================================

To solve the problem of decoding a string that has been encoded using the `encode_cyclic` function, we need to understand the encoding process first. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the encoding process and how we can reverse it:

### Encoding Process

1. **Splitting into Groups**: The string `s` is divided into groups of three characters. If the length of the string is not a multiple of three, the last group will have fewer than three characters.

2. **Cycling Characters**: For each group of exactly three characters, the characters are cycled such that the first character moves to the end of the group. For example, the group "abc" becomes "bca".

3. **Joining Groups**: The modified groups are then concatenated back together to form the encoded string.

### Decoding Process

To decode the string, we need to reverse the above steps:

1. **Splitting into Groups**: Similar to encoding, split the encoded string into groups of three characters. The last group may have fewer than three characters.

2. **Reversing the Cycle**: For each group of exactly three characters, reverse the cycle by moving the last character to the front. For example, the group "bca" should be transformed back to "abc".

3. **Joining Groups**: Concatenate the modified groups to form the original string.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the `decode_cyclic` function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def decode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Takes as input a string encoded with the encode_cyclic function. Returns the decoded string.
    """
    # Split the string into groups of three characters
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    
    # Reverse the cycle for each group of exactly three characters
    groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    
    # Join the groups back together to form the decoded string
    return "".join(groups)

# Example usage:
encoded_string = encode_cyclic("abcdefghi")
decoded_string = decode_cyclic(encoded_string)
print(decoded_string)  # Should print "abcdefghi"
```

### Explanation

- **Splitting**: We use list comprehension to split the string into groups of three characters, similar to the encoding process.

- **Reversing the Cycle**: For each group of exactly three characters, we move the last character to the front to reverse the cycle. This is done using slicing: `group[-1] + group[:-1]`.

- **Joining**: Finally, we join the groups back together to reconstruct the original string.

This function should correctly decode any string that was encoded using the `encode_cyclic` function.
