==================================================

To solve the problem of decoding a string that was encoded using the `encode_cyclic` function, we need to understand the encoding process and then reverse it.

### Understanding the Encoding Process

1. **Splitting into Groups**: The `encode_cyclic` function splits the input string into groups of three characters. If the length of the string is not a multiple of three, the last group will contain one or two characters.

2. **Cycling Characters**: For each group of exactly three characters, the function cycles the characters by moving the first character to the end of the group. For groups with fewer than three characters, no cycling is performed.

3. **Rejoining Groups**: The function then concatenates all the groups back into a single string.

### Decoding Process

To decode the string, we need to reverse the encoding process:

1. **Splitting into Groups**: Similar to the encoding process, split the string into groups of three characters. This is necessary to identify how the characters were cycled.

2. **Reversing the Cycle**: For each group of exactly three characters, we need to reverse the cycle. Since the encoding moved the first character to the end, decoding should move the last character to the front.

3. **Rejoining Groups**: Concatenate all the groups back into a single string to get the original string.

### Implementation

Let's implement the `decode_cyclic` function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def decode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Takes as input a string encoded with the encode_cyclic function. Returns the decoded string.
    """
    # Split the string into groups of three characters
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    
    # Reverse the cycle for each group of exactly three characters
    groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    
    # Join the groups back into a single string
    return "".join(groups)

# Example usage:
encoded_string = encode_cyclic("abcdefghi")
decoded_string = decode_cyclic(encoded_string)
print(decoded_string)  # Should output "abcdefghi"
```

### Explanation

- **Splitting**: We use the same logic as in `encode_cyclic` to split the string into groups of three characters.
- **Reversing the Cycle**: For groups of length three, we move the last character to the front to reverse the cycle.
- **Joining**: Finally, we concatenate all the groups to form the decoded string.

This function should correctly decode any string that was encoded using the `encode_cyclic` function.
