To solve the problem of determining whether a given number `a` (where `a` is less than 100) is the product of exactly three prime numbers, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps. Here's how we can approach it:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understand the Problem Requirements:**
   - We need to check if a number `a` can be expressed as a product of exactly three prime numbers.
   - The number `a` is guaranteed to be less than 100.

2. **Identify Prime Numbers Less Than 100:**
   - The prime numbers less than 100 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

3. **Generate All Possible Products of Three Primes:**
   - We need to generate all possible products of three distinct primes from the list above.
   - Since `a` is less than 100, we only need to consider combinations where the product is less than 100.

4. **Check if `a` is in the List of Products:**
   - Once we have a list of all possible products of three primes, we simply check if `a` is in this list.

5. **Implementation:**
   - We will iterate over all combinations of three primes and calculate their products.
   - Store these products in a set for efficient lookup.
   - Finally, check if `a` is in this set.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function `is_multiply_prime` based on the above reasoning:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_multiply_prime(a):
    """Returns true if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers and false otherwise."""
    if a >= 100:
        return False
    
    # List of prime numbers less than 100
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
    
    # Generate all possible products of three distinct primes
    products_of_three_primes = set()
    for combo in combinations(primes, 3):
        product = combo[0] * combo[1] * combo[2]
        if product < 100:
            products_of_three_primes.add(product)
    
    # Check if the given number is in the set of products
    return a in products_of_three_primes

# Example usage:
print(is_multiply_prime(30))  # Output: True
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We first check if `a` is greater than or equal to 100, in which case we immediately return `False` since `a` must be less than 100.
- We define a list of prime numbers less than 100.
- Using `itertools.combinations`, we generate all combinations of three distinct primes.
- For each combination, we calculate the product and add it to a set if it's less than 100.
- Finally, we check if `a` is in the set of products and return the result.

This approach efficiently determines if `a` is the product of exactly three prime numbers.
