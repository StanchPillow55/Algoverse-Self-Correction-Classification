==================================================

To solve the problem of determining if a given number \( a \) (where \( a < 100 \)) is the product of exactly three prime numbers, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understand the Problem**: 
   - We need to check if a number \( a \) is the product of exactly three prime numbers.
   - The number \( a \) is guaranteed to be less than 100.

2. **Identify Prime Numbers Less Than 100**:
   - The prime numbers less than 100 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

3. **Generate Combinations of Three Primes**:
   - We need to consider all possible combinations of three distinct prime numbers from the list above.
   - For each combination, calculate the product of the three primes.

4. **Check if the Product Matches \( a \)**:
   - If any of the products from the combinations equals \( a \), return `True`.
   - If none of the products match \( a \), return `False`.

5. **Optimization Considerations**:
   - Since \( a \) is less than 100, the number of combinations to check is limited.
   - We can use itertools to generate combinations efficiently.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function following the above reasoning:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_multiply_prime(a):
    """Returns true if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers and false otherwise."""
    # List of prime numbers less than 100
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
    
    # Generate all combinations of 3 primes
    for combo in combinations(primes, 3):
        # Calculate the product of the three primes
        product = combo[0] * combo[1] * combo[2]
        # Check if the product equals the given number
        if product == a:
            return True
    
    # If no combination matches, return False
    return False

# Example usage
print(is_multiply_prime(30))  # Expected output: True
```

### Explanation

- **Prime List**: We start by listing all prime numbers less than 100.
- **Combinations**: We use `itertools.combinations` to generate all possible combinations of three primes.
- **Product Calculation**: For each combination, we calculate the product of the three primes.
- **Comparison**: We check if this product equals the input number \( a \).
- **Return Value**: If a matching product is found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach efficiently checks all possible combinations and determines if the number is a product of exactly three primes.
