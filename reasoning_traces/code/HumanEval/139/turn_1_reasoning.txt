To solve the problem of calculating the "Brazilian factorial" (as defined in the problem statement), we need to understand the steps involved in computing this special factorial.

### Problem Understanding

The Brazilian factorial of a number `n` is defined as the product of all factorials from `n!` down to `1!`. This means:

\[ \text{brazilian\_factorial}(n) = n! \times (n-1)! \times (n-2)! \times \ldots \times 1! \]

For example, if `n = 4`, the calculation would be:

\[ 4! \times 3! \times 2! \times 1! \]

Calculating each factorial:

- \( 4! = 24 \)
- \( 3! = 6 \)
- \( 2! = 2 \)
- \( 1! = 1 \)

Then, the Brazilian factorial of 4 is:

\[ 24 \times 6 \times 2 \times 1 = 288 \]

### Approach

1. **Iterate from `n` down to `1`:** We need to calculate the factorial for each integer from `n` down to `1`.
2. **Calculate each factorial:** Use a helper function or Python's built-in `math.factorial` to compute the factorial of each number.
3. **Multiply the results:** Accumulate the product of these factorials to get the final result.

### Implementation Steps

1. Import the `factorial` function from Python's `math` module for efficient computation of factorials.
2. Initialize a variable `result` to 1, which will hold the accumulated product of the factorials.
3. Loop over each integer from `n` down to `1`, calculate its factorial, and multiply it with `result`.
4. Return the final accumulated product as the Brazilian factorial.

### Implementation

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
import math

def special_factorial(n):
    """The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
    where n > 0
    """
    result = 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        result *= math.factorial(i)
    return result

# Example usage:
print(special_factorial(4))  # Output: 288
```

### Explanation

- **Importing `math.factorial`:** This function is efficient and handles the computation of factorials internally, which is preferable to manually implementing the factorial calculation.
- **Looping from `n` to `1`:** We iterate in reverse order to multiply each factorial starting from `n!` down to `1!`.
- **Accumulating the product:** We use a variable `result` initialized to 1 to accumulate the product of factorials, as multiplying by 1 does not affect the result.

This approach efficiently computes the Brazilian factorial by leveraging Python's built-in capabilities and ensures correctness by following the problem's definition.
