To solve the problem of calculating the "Brazilian factorial" (as defined in the problem statement), we need to understand the definition and then implement it in Python.

### Problem Understanding

The Brazilian factorial of a number `n` is defined as the product of factorials of all integers from `n` down to `1`. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

\[ \text{brazilian\_factorial}(n) = n! \times (n-1)! \times (n-2)! \times \ldots \times 1! \]

Where `n!` denotes the factorial of `n`, which is the product of all positive integers up to `n`.

### Approach

1. **Input Validation**: Ensure that the input `n` is a positive integer. The problem statement specifies `n > 0`.

2. **Calculate Factorials**: For each integer `k` from `1` to `n`, calculate the factorial `k!`.

3. **Product of Factorials**: Multiply all these factorials together to get the Brazilian factorial.

4. **Return the Result**: Return the computed product as the result.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Import Required Module**: Use the `math` module's `factorial` function to compute factorials efficiently.

2. **Iterate and Compute**: Loop through each integer from `1` to `n`, compute its factorial, and multiply it to a running product.

3. **Return the Product**: After the loop, return the accumulated product.

Now, let's implement the function:

```python
import math

def special_factorial(n):
    """The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
    where n > 0
    """
    # Initialize the product to 1 (multiplicative identity)
    product = 1
    
    # Loop through each number from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Multiply the current product by the factorial of i
        product *= math.factorial(i)
    
    # Return the final product
    return product

# Example usage:
# print(special_factorial(4))  # Should output 288
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**: We start with `product = 1` because multiplying by 1 does not change the product, and it serves as a neutral element for multiplication.

- **Loop and Multiply**: For each integer `i` from `1` to `n`, we calculate `i!` using `math.factorial(i)` and multiply it to the `product`.

- **Efficiency**: Using Python's `math.factorial` is efficient and handles large numbers well, which is important since factorials grow very quickly.

- **Return**: Finally, we return the accumulated product, which is the Brazilian factorial of `n`.

This solution efficiently computes the desired result by leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for handling large integers and factorial calculations.
