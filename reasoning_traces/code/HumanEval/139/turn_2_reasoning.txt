To solve the problem of calculating the "Brazilian factorial" (or special factorial) of a number `n`, we need to understand the definition provided:

The Brazilian factorial of a number `n` is defined as the product of the factorials of all integers from `n` down to 1. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[ \text{brazilian\_factorial}(n) = n! \times (n-1)! \times (n-2)! \times \ldots \times 1! \]

For example, if `n = 4`, the Brazilian factorial would be:

\[ 4! \times 3! \times 2! \times 1! \]

Let's break down the steps to implement this:

1. **Calculate Factorials**: For each integer `k` from `n` down to 1, calculate the factorial `k!`.
2. **Product of Factorials**: Multiply all these factorials together to get the Brazilian factorial.

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Initialize a Result Variable**: Start with a variable `result` initialized to 1. This will hold the product of all factorials.

2. **Iterate from 1 to n**: Use a loop to iterate over each integer `k` from 1 to `n`.

3. **Calculate Factorial for Each k**: For each `k`, calculate `k!`. This can be done using a helper function or Python's built-in `math.factorial`.

4. **Multiply Factorials**: Multiply the current `k!` with the `result` to accumulate the product.

5. **Return the Result**: After the loop, `result` will contain the Brazilian factorial of `n`.

### Implementation:

Let's implement the function `special_factorial` using the above approach:

```python
import math

def special_factorial(n):
    """Calculate the Brazilian factorial of n."""
    result = 1
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= math.factorial(k)
    return result

# Example usage:
# print(special_factorial(4))  # Output should be 288
```

### Explanation:

- We import the `math` module to use the `math.factorial` function, which efficiently computes the factorial of a number.
- We initialize `result` to 1 because multiplying by 1 does not change the product.
- We loop over each integer `k` from 1 to `n`, calculate `k!`, and multiply it with `result`.
- Finally, we return `result`, which contains the product of all factorials from `1!` to `n!`.

This solution is efficient for reasonably small values of `n`, as factorials grow very quickly and can lead to large numbers. For very large `n`, this approach may need optimization or handling of large integers.
