To solve the problem of finding three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero, we need to consider a few key points:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to determine if there are any three distinct numbers in the list whose sum is zero. If such a triplet exists, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.

2. **Constraints and Edge Cases**:
   - If the list has fewer than three elements, it's impossible to find such a triplet, so we should return `False`.
   - The elements must be distinct, meaning the same element cannot be used more than once in forming the triplet.

3. **Approach**:
   - A brute-force approach would involve checking all possible triplets in the list. This would involve three nested loops, leading to a time complexity of \(O(n^3)\), which is inefficient for large lists.
   - A more efficient approach is to use a two-pointer technique after sorting the list. This reduces the time complexity to \(O(n^2)\).

4. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - First, sort the list.
   - Iterate through the list, fixing one element at a time.
   - For each fixed element, use two pointers to find if there exists a pair of elements that sum to the negative of the fixed element.
   - If such a pair is found, the sum of the three elements is zero.

5. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Sort the list.
   - Iterate through the list, fixing one element.
   - For each fixed element, use two pointers: one starting just after the fixed element and the other at the end of the list.
   - Adjust the pointers based on the sum of the triplet:
     - If the sum is zero, return `True`.
     - If the sum is less than zero, move the left pointer to the right to increase the sum.
     - If the sum is greater than zero, move the right pointer to the left to decrease the sum.
   - If no such triplet is found after checking all possibilities, return `False`.

Now, let's implement the function:

```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list) -> bool:
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    """
    # If there are fewer than 3 elements, we cannot find a triplet
    if len(l) < 3:
        return False
    
    # Sort the list to use the two-pointer technique
    l.sort()
    
    # Iterate through the list, fixing one element at a time
    for i in range(len(l) - 2):
        # Use two pointers to find the other two elements
        left = i + 1
        right = len(l) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            current_sum = l[i] + l[left] + l[right]
            
            if current_sum == 0:
                return True
            elif current_sum < 0:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
    
    # If no triplet found, return False
    return False

# Test cases
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # True
print(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

This implementation efficiently checks for the existence of a triplet that sums to zero using the two-pointer technique, ensuring a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\).
