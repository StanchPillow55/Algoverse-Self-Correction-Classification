==================================================

To solve the problem of creating a histogram from a string of space-separated lowercase letters, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Input and Output:**
   - Input: A string of space-separated lowercase letters.
   - Output: A dictionary where the keys are the letters with the highest frequency in the input string, and the values are their respective counts.

2. **Plan the Approach:**
   - First, we need to split the input string into individual letters. This can be done using the `split()` method, which will give us a list of letters.
   - We will then count the occurrences of each letter using a dictionary. The keys of this dictionary will be the letters, and the values will be their counts.
   - After counting the occurrences, we need to determine the maximum count value.
   - Finally, we will create a result dictionary containing only the letters that have this maximum count.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the input string is empty, the function should return an empty dictionary.
   - If all letters have the same frequency, all should be included in the result.

4. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Split the input string into a list of letters.
   - Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each letter.
   - Find the maximum count value from the dictionary.
   - Create a new dictionary with only the letters that have the maximum count.
   - Return this dictionary.

Now, let's implement the function based on this plan:

```python
def histogram(test):
    # Step 1: Split the input string into a list of letters
    letters = test.split()
    
    # Step 2: Count occurrences of each letter
    count_dict = {}
    for letter in letters:
        if letter in count_dict:
            count_dict[letter] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[letter] = 1
    
    # Step 3: Find the maximum count value
    if not count_dict:
        return {}
    
    max_count = max(count_dict.values())
    
    # Step 4: Create a dictionary with letters having the maximum count
    result = {letter: count for letter, count in count_dict.items() if count == max_count}
    
    # Step 5: Return the result dictionary
    return result

# Example usage:
# print(histogram('a b c'))  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}
# print(histogram('a b b a'))  # Output: {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
# print(histogram('a b c a b'))  # Output: {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
# print(histogram('b b b b a'))  # Output: {'b': 4}
# print(histogram(''))  # Output: {}
```

This function should correctly handle the input as described and return the expected output for each case.
