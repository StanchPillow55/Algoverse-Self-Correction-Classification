To solve this problem, we need to sum all the odd integers that are located at even indices in a given list. Let's break down the problem and approach it step by step:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Identify Even Positions**: In Python, list indices start at 0. Therefore, even positions in the list are indices 0, 2, 4, etc.

2. **Check for Odd Elements**: An integer is odd if it is not divisible by 2, i.e., `num % 2 != 0`.

3. **Sum the Odd Elements at Even Positions**: We need to iterate over the list, check if the index is even, and if the element at that index is odd, add it to a running total.

### Approach

1. **Initialize a Sum Variable**: Start with a variable `total_sum` set to 0. This will hold the sum of all odd elements at even positions.

2. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop to iterate over the list with both the index and the element. This can be done using `enumerate(lst)` which gives both the index and the element.

3. **Check for Even Index**: For each element, check if the index is even using `index % 2 == 0`.

4. **Check for Odd Element**: If the index is even, check if the element is odd using `element % 2 != 0`.

5. **Update the Sum**: If both conditions are met (even index and odd element), add the element to `total_sum`.

6. **Return the Result**: After the loop, return the `total_sum`.

### Implementation

Here's how the implementation would look in Python:

```python
def solution(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions."""
    total_sum = 0
    for index, element in enumerate(lst):
        if index % 2 == 0 and element % 2 != 0:
            total_sum += element
    return total_sum

# Test cases
print(solution([5, 8, 7, 1]))  # Expected output: 12
print(solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]))  # Expected output: 9
print(solution([30, 13, 24, 321]))  # Expected output: 0
```

### Explanation of Test Cases

- **Test Case 1**: `[5, 8, 7, 1]`
  - Index 0: 5 (odd) -> Add to sum
  - Index 2: 7 (odd) -> Add to sum
  - Total sum = 5 + 7 = 12

- **Test Case 2**: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`
  - Index 0: 3 (odd) -> Add to sum
  - Index 2: 3 (odd) -> Add to sum
  - Index 4: 3 (odd) -> Add to sum
  - Total sum = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9

- **Test Case 3**: `[30, 13, 24, 321]`
  - Index 0: 30 (even) -> Do not add
  - Index 2: 24 (even) -> Do not add
  - Total sum = 0

This solution efficiently checks each element at even indices and sums up the odd ones, providing the correct result for the given problem.
