==================================================

To solve the problem of finding the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array in a given list of integers, we can use a variation of Kadane's algorithm. The original Kadane's algorithm is used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous sub-array, but we can adapt it to find the minimum sum instead.

### Thought Process

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum sum of any contiguous sub-array in a given list of integers.
   - A sub-array is a contiguous part of the array, and it can be as small as one element or as large as the entire array.

2. **Approach:**
   - We will iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum of the current sub-array.
   - At each step, we decide whether to extend the current sub-array by including the current element or start a new sub-array with the current element.
   - We keep track of the minimum sum encountered so far.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - Initialize `current_min` to the first element of the array. This represents the minimum sum of the current sub-array.
   - Initialize `global_min` to the first element of the array. This will store the minimum sum found so far.
   - Iterate through the array starting from the second element:
     - Update `current_min` to be the minimum of the current element itself or the sum of `current_min` and the current element. This step decides whether to start a new sub-array or continue the existing one.
     - Update `global_min` to be the minimum of `global_min` and `current_min`.
   - After iterating through the array, `global_min` will contain the minimum sum of any sub-array.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the array contains only one element, the minimum sub-array sum is the element itself.
   - The array can contain both positive and negative numbers, so the algorithm should handle both cases.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def minSubArraySum(nums):
    """
    Given an array of integers nums, find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array
    of nums.
    """
    if not nums:
        raise ValueError("The input array must contain at least one element.")
    
    # Initialize the current minimum and global minimum with the first element
    current_min = nums[0]
    global_min = nums[0]
    
    # Iterate through the array starting from the second element
    for num in nums[1:]:
        # Update the current minimum sum
        current_min = min(num, current_min + num)
        # Update the global minimum sum
        global_min = min(global_min, current_min)
    
    return global_min

# Test cases
print(minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]))  # Output: 1
print(minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]))        # Output: -6
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We start by checking if the input list is empty. If it is, we raise an error because the problem statement assumes a non-empty list.
- We initialize `current_min` and `global_min` with the first element of the list.
- We iterate through the list starting from the second element. For each element, we update `current_min` to be the minimum of the current element or the sum of `current_min` and the current element.
- We then update `global_min` to be the minimum of itself and `current_min`.
- Finally, we return `global_min`, which holds the minimum sum of any sub-array in the list.
