To solve the problem of extracting only positive numbers from a given list, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the problem and think through the solution step by step:

### Problem Understanding

We are given a list of integers, and our task is to return a new list that contains only the positive numbers from the original list. Positive numbers are those greater than zero.

### Approach

1. **Input and Output**:
   - **Input**: A list of integers, which can include positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero.
   - **Output**: A list of integers containing only the positive numbers from the input list.

2. **Iterate through the List**:
   - We need to examine each element in the list to determine if it is positive.
   - If an element is greater than zero, it is positive and should be included in the output list.

3. **Filtering**:
   - We can use a list comprehension to filter out the positive numbers. List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists based on existing lists.
   - The condition for filtering will be checking if a number is greater than zero.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - An empty list should return an empty list since there are no numbers to evaluate.
   - A list with no positive numbers should also return an empty list.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function `get_positive` using the approach described:

```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    """Return only positive numbers in the list.
    >>> get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6])
    [2, 5, 6]
    >>> get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]
    """
    # Use a list comprehension to filter out positive numbers
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]

# Testing the function with the provided examples
print(get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6]))  # Output: [2, 5, 6]
print(get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]))  # Output: [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]
```

### Explanation

- The function `get_positive` takes a list `l` as input.
- It uses a list comprehension `[x for x in l if x > 0]` to iterate over each element `x` in the list `l`.
- The condition `if x > 0` ensures that only positive numbers are included in the resulting list.
- The function returns this new list of positive numbers.

This implementation is efficient and concise, leveraging Python's list comprehensions to achieve the desired result.
