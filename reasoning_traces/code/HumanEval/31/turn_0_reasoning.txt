To determine whether a given number \( n \) is prime, we need to understand what a prime number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, a prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.

### Steps to Determine if a Number is Prime

1. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   - If \( n \leq 1 \), the number is not prime. By definition, prime numbers are greater than 1.

2. **Check Small Numbers**:
   - If \( n = 2 \), the number is prime. 2 is the smallest and the only even prime number.
   - If \( n = 3 \), the number is prime. 3 is the next smallest prime number.

3. **Eliminate Even Numbers**:
   - If \( n \) is even and greater than 2, it cannot be prime because it is divisible by 2.

4. **Check for Divisibility**:
   - For numbers greater than 3, check divisibility from 3 up to the square root of \( n \). If \( n \) is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.
   - The reason for checking up to the square root of \( n \) is that if \( n \) can be factored into two factors \( a \) and \( b \), then one of those factors must be less than or equal to the square root of \( n \). If both were greater, their product would exceed \( n \).

5. **Optimization with Step Size**:
   - After checking for divisibility by 2, we can skip even numbers and check only odd numbers. This reduces the number of checks needed.

### Implementation

With this understanding, let's implement the `is_prime` function:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True  # 2 and 3 are prime numbers
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False  # Exclude even numbers greater than 2
    
    # Check for factors from 3 to the square root of n
    i = 3
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        i += 2  # Increment by 2 to check only odd numbers
    
    return True
```

### Explanation

- **Edge Cases**: We first handle numbers less than or equal to 1, which are not prime.
- **Small Primes**: We directly return `True` for 2 and 3.
- **Even Numbers**: We eliminate even numbers greater than 2 by checking divisibility by 2.
- **Odd Divisors**: We iterate over odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of \( n \). If \( n \) is divisible by any of these, it is not prime.
- **Efficiency**: By skipping even numbers and stopping at the square root, the function is efficient even for relatively large numbers.

This function efficiently checks if a number is prime by leveraging mathematical properties of prime numbers and optimizing the number of checks needed.
