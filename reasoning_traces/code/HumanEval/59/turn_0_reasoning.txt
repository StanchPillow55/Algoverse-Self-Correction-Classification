To solve the problem of finding the largest prime factor of a given integer \( n \), we need to break down the problem into manageable steps. Here's the thought process and approach to implement the solution:

### Understanding the Problem

1. **Prime Factor**: A prime factor of a number \( n \) is a prime number that divides \( n \) without leaving a remainder.
2. **Largest Prime Factor**: Among all the prime factors of \( n \), we need to find the largest one.

### Approach

1. **Start with the smallest prime**: The smallest prime number is 2. We will start checking divisibility from 2 upwards.
2. **Divide and Conquer**: If a number \( n \) is divisible by a prime \( p \), then divide \( n \) by \( p \) as many times as possible until it is no longer divisible by \( p \). This ensures that we remove all occurrences of \( p \) from \( n \).
3. **Increment the divisor**: Once \( n \) is no longer divisible by the current prime, increment the divisor to the next number and repeat the process.
4. **Stop Condition**: If the divisor squared is greater than \( n \), then \( n \) itself is a prime number. This is because any composite number must have at least one factor less than or equal to its square root.
5. **Return the largest factor**: The largest factor found in the process is the largest prime factor.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function `largest_prime_factor` based on the above approach:

```python
def largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
    # Start with the smallest prime number
    divisor = 2
    largest_factor = None
    
    # Check divisibility starting from 2 upwards
    while divisor * divisor <= n:
        if n % divisor == 0:
            # If divisible, divide n by divisor completely
            while n % divisor == 0:
                n //= divisor
            # Update the largest factor found
            largest_factor = divisor
        # Move to the next potential factor
        divisor += 1
    
    # If n is still greater than 1, then it is a prime number and the largest factor
    if n > 1:
        largest_factor = n
    
    return largest_factor

# Test cases
print(largest_prime_factor(13195))  # Expected output: 29
print(largest_prime_factor(2048))   # Expected output: 2
```

### Explanation

- **Divisor Initialization**: We start with the smallest prime number, 2.
- **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as the square of the divisor is less than or equal to \( n \). This ensures we only check necessary divisors.
- **Divisibility Check**: For each divisor, we check if it divides \( n \). If it does, we divide \( n \) completely by this divisor.
- **Update Largest Factor**: After removing all occurrences of a divisor, we update the largest factor.
- **Final Check**: If after the loop \( n \) is greater than 1, it means \( n \) itself is a prime factor and is the largest one.

This approach efficiently finds the largest prime factor by reducing the problem size at each step and leveraging the properties of prime numbers.
