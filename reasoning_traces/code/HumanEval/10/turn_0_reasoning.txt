To solve the problem of finding the shortest palindrome that begins with a given string, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the problem and devise a solution step-by-step.

### Problem Understanding

The goal is to transform a given string into the shortest possible palindrome by appending characters to its end. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

### Approach

1. **Identify the Longest Palindromic Suffix**: 
   - We need to find the longest suffix of the string that is already a palindrome. This is because we want to minimize the number of characters we need to add to make the entire string a palindrome.
   
2. **Determine the Prefix to Append**:
   - Once we have identified the longest palindromic suffix, the characters that precede this suffix in the original string form a prefix. We need to reverse this prefix and append it to the end of the string to form a palindrome.

3. **Construct the Resulting Palindrome**:
   - By appending the reversed prefix to the original string, we ensure that the entire string becomes a palindrome.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Iterate Over Possible Suffixes**:
   - Start from the end of the string and check each suffix to see if it is a palindrome.
   
2. **Check for Palindrome**:
   - Use the `is_palindrome` function to check if a suffix is a palindrome.
   
3. **Construct the Palindrome**:
   - Once the longest palindromic suffix is found, take the prefix that comes before this suffix, reverse it, and append it to the original string.

### Edge Cases

- If the input string is empty, the result should be an empty string.
- If the entire string is already a palindrome, no additional characters are needed.

### Implementation

Let's implement the `make_palindrome` function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. """
    if not string:
        return string
    
    # Iterate over the string to find the longest palindromic suffix
    for i in range(len(string)):
        # Check if the suffix starting from index i is a palindrome
        if is_palindrome(string[i:]):
            # If it is, the prefix before this suffix is string[:i]
            # Reverse this prefix and append to the original string
            return string + string[:i][::-1]
    
    # If no palindromic suffix is found (which is unlikely since a single character is a palindrome),
    # return the string with its entire reverse appended (this is a fallback)
    return string + string[::-1]

# Test cases
print(make_palindrome(''))      # Output: ''
print(make_palindrome('cat'))   # Output: 'catac'
print(make_palindrome('cata'))  # Output: 'catac'
```

### Explanation

- The function `make_palindrome` iterates over the string to find the longest palindromic suffix.
- For each suffix, it checks if it is a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function.
- Once the longest palindromic suffix is found, it constructs the palindrome by appending the reversed prefix to the original string.
- This approach ensures that we add the minimum number of characters to make the string a palindrome.
