==================================================

To solve the problem of adding the even elements that are at odd indices in a given list of integers, we need to follow a structured approach. Let's break down the problem and devise a solution step by step.

### Problem Understanding

1. **Input**: A non-empty list of integers, `lst`.
2. **Output**: An integer representing the sum of even numbers that are located at odd indices in the list.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Identify Odd Indices**: In Python, list indices start at 0. Therefore, odd indices are 1, 3, 5, etc.
2. **Check for Even Numbers**: An even number is any integer that is divisible by 2 (i.e., `number % 2 == 0`).
3. **Iterate Through the List**: We need to iterate over the list, checking each element at an odd index to see if it is even.
4. **Sum the Even Numbers**: If an element at an odd index is even, add it to a running total.
5. **Return the Total**: After iterating through the list, return the total sum of the even numbers found at odd indices.

### Implementation

Now that we have a clear plan, let's implement the function:

```python
def add(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers lst, add the even elements that are at odd indices."""
    total = 0  # Initialize the sum to zero
    # Iterate over the list using index
    for index in range(1, len(lst), 2):  # Start at index 1 and step by 2 to get odd indices
        if lst[index] % 2 == 0:  # Check if the element at the current index is even
            total += lst[index]  # Add it to the total if it is even
    return total  # Return the total sum

# Example usage:
print(add([4, 2, 6, 7]))  # Output should be 2
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We initialize a variable `total` to keep track of the sum of even numbers at odd indices.
- We use a `for` loop with `range(1, len(lst), 2)` to iterate over the list, starting from index 1 and stepping by 2 to access only odd indices.
- Inside the loop, we check if the element at the current index is even using the condition `lst[index] % 2 == 0`.
- If the condition is true, we add the element to `total`.
- Finally, we return the `total` after the loop completes.

This solution efficiently calculates the desired sum by only iterating over the necessary elements, ensuring optimal performance.
