To solve the problem of counting the number of even and odd digits in a given integer, we need to follow a structured approach. Let's break down the problem and devise a solution step by step.

### Problem Understanding

We are given an integer, which can be positive, negative, or zero. Our task is to count the number of even and odd digits in this integer and return the counts as a tuple `(even_count, odd_count)`.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Handle Negative Numbers**: Since the sign of the number doesn't affect whether a digit is even or odd, we can work with the absolute value of the number. This simplifies the problem by removing the need to handle the negative sign.

2. **Convert Number to String**: By converting the number to a string, we can easily iterate over each digit. This is because iterating over a string allows us to access each character (digit) individually.

3. **Initialize Counters**: We need two counters, one for even digits and one for odd digits. Initialize both to zero.

4. **Iterate Over Digits**: Loop through each character in the string representation of the number:
   - Convert the character back to an integer.
   - Check if the digit is even or odd using the modulus operator `%`.
   - Increment the respective counter based on whether the digit is even or odd.

5. **Return the Result**: After iterating through all the digits, return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd digits.

### Edge Cases

- **Zero**: The number zero has one digit, which is even.
- **Single Digit Numbers**: These should return either (1, 0) or (0, 1) depending on whether the digit is even or odd.
- **Negative Numbers**: The negative sign should be ignored, as it doesn't affect the parity of the digits.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def even_odd_count(num):
    """Given an integer, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively."""
    # Use the absolute value to ignore the sign
    num = abs(num)
    
    # Convert the number to a string to iterate over each digit
    num_str = str(num)
    
    # Initialize counters for even and odd digits
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each digit in the string representation of the number
    for char in num_str:
        digit = int(char)  # Convert the character back to an integer
        if digit % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
    
    # Return the counts as a tuple
    return (even_count, odd_count)

# Example usage:
print(even_odd_count(-12))  # Output: (1, 1)
print(even_odd_count(123))  # Output: (1, 2)
```

This implementation efficiently counts the even and odd digits in the given integer and handles all edge cases appropriately.
