To solve the problem of finding the n-th Fibonacci number, we need to understand the Fibonacci sequence. The sequence is defined as follows:

- The first Fibonacci number is 0.
- The second Fibonacci number is 1.
- Every subsequent Fibonacci number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
- \( F(0) = 0 \)
- \( F(1) = 1 \)
- \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \) for \( n \geq 2 \)

Given this definition, our task is to implement a function `fib(n)` that returns the n-th Fibonacci number.

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If \( n = 0 \), return 0.
   - If \( n = 1 \), return 1.

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - For \( n \geq 2 \), compute the Fibonacci number using the recursive formula: \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \).

3. **Efficiency Consideration**:
   - A naive recursive implementation can be very inefficient due to repeated calculations of the same Fibonacci numbers. This leads to an exponential time complexity.
   - To improve efficiency, we can use an iterative approach or memoization to store previously computed Fibonacci numbers.

4. **Iterative Approach**:
   - We can use a loop to iteratively compute the Fibonacci numbers up to \( n \).
   - Start with the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1) and iteratively compute the next numbers until reaching the n-th number.

5. **Implementation**:
   - Initialize two variables to store the previous two Fibonacci numbers.
   - Use a loop to update these variables until the n-th Fibonacci number is computed.

Let's implement the iterative approach for better efficiency:

```python
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    """Return n-th Fibonacci number."""
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
    a, b = 0, 1
    
    # Compute Fibonacci numbers iteratively
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    
    return b

# Test cases
print(fib(10))  # Output: 55
print(fib(1))   # Output: 1
print(fib(8))   # Output: 21
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:

- We handle the base cases for \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \) directly.
- For \( n \geq 2 \), we use two variables `a` and `b` to keep track of the last two Fibonacci numbers.
- We iterate from 2 to \( n \), updating `a` and `b` such that `b` always holds the current Fibonacci number.
- Finally, we return `b`, which contains the n-th Fibonacci number after the loop completes.

This approach runs in \( O(n) \) time and uses \( O(1) \) space, making it efficient for computing Fibonacci numbers.
