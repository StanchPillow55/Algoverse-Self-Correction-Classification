==================================================

To solve the problem of decoding a string that has been encoded by shifting each character by 5 positions in the alphabet, we need to reverse the encoding process. Let's break down the problem and solution step by step.

### Problem Understanding

The `encode_shift` function takes a string `s` and shifts each character by 5 positions forward in the alphabet. For example, 'a' becomes 'f', 'b' becomes 'g', and so on. The function uses the modulo operation to wrap around the alphabet, so 'z' becomes 'e'.

Our task is to implement the `decode_shift` function, which should reverse this process. This means we need to shift each character in the encoded string 5 positions backward in the alphabet to retrieve the original string.

### Approach

1. **Character Shifting**: 
   - For each character in the encoded string, we need to shift it backward by 5 positions.
   - If a character is 'f', it should become 'a'; if it's 'g', it should become 'b', and so on.
   - We need to handle the wrap-around for characters near the beginning of the alphabet. For example, 'a' should become 'v'.

2. **ASCII Manipulation**:
   - Use the `ord()` function to convert a character to its ASCII value.
   - Subtract 5 from this value to shift backward.
   - Use modulo 26 to handle wrap-around, ensuring the result stays within the range of lowercase letters.
   - Convert the resulting ASCII value back to a character using `chr()`.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Iterate over each character in the input string.
   - Apply the backward shift logic.
   - Construct the decoded string by joining the shifted characters.

### Implementation

Let's implement the `decode_shift` function:

```python
def decode_shift(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Takes as input a string encoded with the encode_shift function.
    Returns the decoded string by shifting every character back by 5 in the alphabet.
    """
    decoded_chars = []
    for ch in s:
        # Shift character back by 5 positions
        new_char = chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord('a')) % 26) + ord('a'))
        decoded_chars.append(new_char)
    
    # Join the list of characters into a single string
    return "".join(decoded_chars)

# Example usage:
# encoded = encode_shift("hello")
# decoded = decode_shift(encoded)
# print(decoded)  # Should print "hello"
```

### Explanation

- We iterate over each character in the input string `s`.
- For each character `ch`, we calculate its new position by subtracting 5 from its ASCII value, adjusting for the alphabet's start using `ord('a')`, and using modulo 26 to handle wrap-around.
- We convert the adjusted ASCII value back to a character and append it to the `decoded_chars` list.
- Finally, we join all characters in `decoded_chars` to form the decoded string and return it.

This solution effectively reverses the encoding process, allowing us to retrieve the original string from its encoded form.
