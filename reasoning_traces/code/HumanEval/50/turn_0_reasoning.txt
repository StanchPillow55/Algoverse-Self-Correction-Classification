To solve this problem, we need to implement the `decode_shift` function, which will reverse the encoding process done by the `encode_shift` function. Let's break down the problem and the solution step-by-step:

### Understanding the `encode_shift` Function

The `encode_shift` function takes a string `s` and shifts each character in the string by 5 positions forward in the alphabet. Here's how it works:

1. **Character to ASCII Conversion**: Each character `ch` in the string is converted to its ASCII value using `ord(ch)`.
2. **Shift and Wrap Around**: The ASCII value is adjusted by adding 5 and then subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' to normalize it to a 0-based index. The result is taken modulo 26 to ensure it wraps around if it goes past 'z'.
3. **Convert Back to Character**: The normalized value is converted back to a character by adding the ASCII value of 'a' and using `chr()`.

For example, if `ch` is 'a', `ord('a')` is 97. After shifting by 5, it becomes 102, which corresponds to 'f'.

### Implementing the `decode_shift` Function

To decode the string, we need to reverse the process:

1. **Character to ASCII Conversion**: Convert each character `ch` in the encoded string to its ASCII value using `ord(ch)`.
2. **Reverse Shift and Wrap Around**: Subtract 5 from the ASCII value, then normalize it by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a'. Use modulo 26 to handle wrap-around cases. If the result is negative (which can happen when subtracting 5), add 26 to ensure it stays within the bounds of the alphabet.
3. **Convert Back to Character**: Convert the normalized value back to a character by adding the ASCII value of 'a' and using `chr()`.

Let's implement the `decode_shift` function:

```python
def decode_shift(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Takes as input a string encoded with the encode_shift function.
    Returns the decoded string by shifting every character back by 5 in the alphabet.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])

# Example usage:
encoded = encode_shift("hello")
decoded = decode_shift(encoded)
print(f"Encoded: {encoded}, Decoded: {decoded}")
```

### Explanation of the `decode_shift` Function

- **`ord(ch) - 5`**: This reverses the shift applied during encoding.
- **`% 26`**: Ensures that the result wraps around correctly if it goes below 'a'.
- **`+ ord("a")`**: Converts the 0-based index back to the correct ASCII value for the character.

This function will correctly decode any string that was encoded using the `encode_shift` function, assuming the input string contains only lowercase alphabetic characters.
