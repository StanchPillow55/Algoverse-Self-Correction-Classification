==================================================

To solve the problem of decoding a string that has been encoded by shifting each character by 5 positions in the alphabet, we need to reverse the encoding process. Let's break down the steps involved in both encoding and decoding:

### Encoding Process:
1. **Character to ASCII Conversion**: Each character in the string is converted to its ASCII value using `ord(ch)`.
2. **Shift by 5**: The ASCII value is increased by 5.
3. **Wrap Around**: Since the alphabet has 26 letters, we use modulo 26 to wrap around if the shift goes past 'z'. This is done by `((ord(ch) + 5 - ord('a')) % 26)`.
4. **Convert Back to Character**: The resulting value is converted back to a character using `chr(...)`, with the base being `ord('a')`.

### Decoding Process:
To decode the string, we need to reverse the above steps:
1. **Character to ASCII Conversion**: Convert each character in the encoded string to its ASCII value using `ord(ch)`.
2. **Reverse the Shift**: Decrease the ASCII value by 5. However, we need to ensure that the result stays within the bounds of the alphabet. This is done by adding 26 before subtracting 5, ensuring a positive result before applying modulo 26.
3. **Wrap Around**: Use modulo 26 to wrap around if the shift goes below 'a'. This is done by `((ord(ch) - 5 - ord('a') + 26) % 26)`.
4. **Convert Back to Character**: Convert the resulting value back to a character using `chr(...)`, with the base being `ord('a')`.

### Implementation:
Now, let's implement the `decode_shift` function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    Takes as input a string encoded with the encode_shift function. Returns the decoded string.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord("a") + 26) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])

# Example usage:
encoded_string = encode_shift("hello")
decoded_string = decode_shift(encoded_string)
print(decoded_string)  # Should print "hello"
```

### Explanation:
- We iterate over each character in the encoded string `s`.
- For each character `ch`, we calculate its original position by reversing the shift: `((ord(ch) - 5 - ord('a') + 26) % 26)`.
- We convert this position back to a character and join all characters to form the decoded string.

This function will correctly decode any string that was encoded using the `encode_shift` function by shifting each character back by 5 positions in the alphabet.
