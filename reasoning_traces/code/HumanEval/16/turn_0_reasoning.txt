To solve the problem of counting distinct characters in a string regardless of their case, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to tackle this problem:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understand the Problem**: 
   - We need to count distinct characters in a string.
   - The count should be case-insensitive, meaning 'a' and 'A' should be considered the same character.

2. **Plan the Approach**:
   - Convert the entire string to lowercase (or uppercase) to ensure case insensitivity.
   - Use a data structure that inherently handles uniqueness, such as a set, to store characters.
   - The size of the set at the end will give us the count of distinct characters.

3. **Choose the Data Structure**:
   - A set is ideal for this problem because it automatically handles duplicates. When we add elements to a set, it only keeps unique elements.

4. **Implement the Solution**:
   - Convert the string to lowercase.
   - Initialize an empty set.
   - Iterate over each character in the string and add it to the set.
   - Return the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct characters.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - An empty string should return 0 because there are no characters.
   - Strings with all identical characters should return 1.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above plan:

```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """ Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of """
    # Convert the string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity
    lowercased_string = string.lower()
    
    # Use a set to store unique characters
    unique_characters = set()
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for char in lowercased_string:
        # Add the character to the set
        unique_characters.add(char)
    
    # The size of the set is the number of distinct characters
    return len(unique_characters)

# Testing the function with the provided examples
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))   # Output: 4
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We first convert the input string to lowercase using `string.lower()`. This ensures that 'A' and 'a' are treated as the same character.
- We initialize an empty set called `unique_characters`.
- We loop through each character in the lowercase string and add it to the set. The set will automatically handle duplicates.
- Finally, we return the length of the set, which gives us the count of distinct characters.

This solution is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's set data structure to handle uniqueness automatically.
