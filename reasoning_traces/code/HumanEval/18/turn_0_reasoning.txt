To solve the problem of counting how many times a given substring can be found in a string, including overlapping occurrences, we need to carefully consider how to iterate through the string and check for matches.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understand the Problem Requirements:**
   - We need to count all occurrences of a substring within a string, including overlapping ones.
   - For example, in the string "aaaa" with the substring "aa", the occurrences are: "aa" (starting at index 0), "aa" (starting at index 1), and "aa" (starting at index 2). This results in 3 occurrences.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the `substring` is empty, logically, it doesn't make sense to count occurrences, so we should return 0.
   - If the `string` is empty, there can't be any occurrences of a non-empty `substring`, so return 0.
   - If both `string` and `substring` are empty, return 0 as there is nothing to count.

3. **Approach:**
   - Use a loop to iterate through the `string` and check for the presence of `substring` starting from each index.
   - If a match is found, increment the count and move to the next index to check for further overlapping occurrences.
   - Continue this process until the end of the string is reached.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - Use a `while` loop to iterate through the `string`.
   - Use the `str.find()` method to find the next occurrence of `substring` starting from the current index.
   - If `str.find()` returns -1, it means no more occurrences are found, and we can break out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, increment the count and update the index to start searching from the next position.

5. **Complexity Consideration:**
   - The time complexity is O(n * m), where n is the length of the `string` and m is the length of the `substring`, due to the repeated searching operation.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """ Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string. Count overlapping cases. """
    if not substring:
        return 0
    
    count = 0
    index = 0
    
    while index <= len(string) - len(substring):
        # Find the next occurrence of the substring
        index = string.find(substring, index)
        
        # If no more occurrences are found, break the loop
        if index == -1:
            break
        
        # Increment the count for each found occurrence
        count += 1
        
        # Move to the next index to allow overlapping
        index += 1
    
    return count

# Test cases
print(how_many_times('', 'a'))  # Expected output: 0
print(how_many_times('aaa', 'a'))  # Expected output: 3
print(how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa'))  # Expected output: 3
```

This implementation correctly counts overlapping occurrences of a substring within a string, handling edge cases appropriately.
