To solve the problem of determining if there are two distinct elements in a list that sum to zero, we can break down the problem and approach it step by step.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if there are two distinct numbers in the list whose sum is zero.
   - The function should return `True` if such a pair exists, otherwise `False`.

2. **Initial Observations:**
   - If the list has fewer than two elements, it's impossible to have a pair, so we should return `False`.
   - For any number `x` in the list, we need to check if `-x` is also present in the list.

3. **Approach:**
   - We can use a set to keep track of the numbers we have seen so far. This allows for O(1) average time complexity for lookups.
   - As we iterate through the list, for each number `x`, we check if `-x` is already in the set:
     - If `-x` is found, it means there exists a pair `(x, -x)` that sums to zero, so we return `True`.
     - If `-x` is not found, we add `x` to the set and continue.
   - If we finish iterating through the list without finding any such pair, we return `False`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Lists with fewer than two elements should immediately return `False`.
   - Lists with only positive or only negative numbers will also return `False`.

5. **Implementation:**
   - We will implement the function using the above logic.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    """
    seen = set()
    for num in l:
        if -num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False

# Test cases
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]))  # True
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:
- We initialize an empty set `seen` to keep track of the numbers we have encountered.
- We iterate over each number `num` in the list `l`.
- For each `num`, we check if `-num` is in the `seen` set:
  - If it is, we immediately return `True` because we found a pair that sums to zero.
  - If not, we add `num` to the `seen` set and continue.
- If the loop completes without finding any such pair, we return `False`.

This solution efficiently checks for pairs that sum to zero using a set for constant-time lookups, ensuring optimal performance.
