To solve the problem of determining whether a given number \( n \) can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers, we need to break down the problem and analyze the conditions under which this is possible.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Even Numbers:**
   - An even number is any integer that is divisible by 2. Positive even numbers start from 2, 4, 6, and so on.

2. **Sum of Four Positive Even Numbers:**
   - If we want to express \( n \) as the sum of four positive even numbers, we can denote these numbers as \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \), where each of these is a positive even number.
   - Therefore, \( n = a + b + c + d \).

3. **Properties of Even Numbers:**
   - The sum of even numbers is always even. Therefore, \( n \) must be even for it to be expressed as the sum of four even numbers.

4. **Minimum Sum of Four Positive Even Numbers:**
   - The smallest positive even number is 2. Thus, the smallest sum of four positive even numbers is \( 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 \).
   - Therefore, if \( n < 8 \), it is impossible to express \( n \) as the sum of four positive even numbers.

5. **General Case:**
   - For \( n \geq 8 \) and \( n \) being even, it is always possible to express \( n \) as the sum of four positive even numbers. This is because we can always adjust the values of \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) to sum up to \( n \) by incrementing or decrementing the even numbers appropriately.

### Conclusion:

- If \( n \) is less than 8 or \( n \) is odd, return `False`.
- If \( n \) is even and \( n \geq 8 \), return `True`.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers."""
    # Check if n is less than 8 or if n is odd
    if n < 8 or n % 2 != 0:
        return False
    # If n is even and greater than or equal to 8
    return True

# Test cases
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(4))  # Expected output: False
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(6))  # Expected output: False
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(8))  # Expected output: True
```

This function checks the conditions derived from our reasoning and returns the appropriate boolean value based on whether \( n \) can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers.
