To solve the problem of calculating the sum of squared numbers from a list after rounding each element to the nearest upper integer (ceiling), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem Requirements:**
   - We are given a list of numbers.
   - Each number in the list should be rounded up to the nearest integer using the ceiling function.
   - After rounding, each number should be squared.
   - Finally, we sum all the squared numbers and return the result.

2. **Analyze the Examples:**
   - For `lst = [1, 2, 3]`, the ceiling values are `[1, 2, 3]`, squaring them gives `[1, 4, 9]`, and their sum is `14`.
   - For `lst = [1, 4, 9]`, the ceiling values are `[1, 4, 9]`, squaring them gives `[1, 16, 81]`, and their sum is `98`.
   - For `lst = [1, 3, 5, 7]`, the ceiling values are `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, squaring them gives `[1, 9, 25, 49]`, and their sum is `84`.
   - For `lst = [1.4, 4.2, 0]`, the ceiling values are `[2, 5, 0]`, squaring them gives `[4, 25, 0]`, and their sum is `29`.
   - For `lst = [-2.4, 1, 1]`, the ceiling values are `[-2, 1, 1]`, squaring them gives `[4, 1, 1]`, and their sum is `6`.

3. **Plan the Solution:**
   - Use the `math.ceil()` function to round each number in the list to the nearest upper integer.
   - Square each of these rounded numbers.
   - Sum all the squared numbers.
   - Return the sum.

4. **Implement the Solution:**
   - Import the `math` module to use the `ceil` function.
   - Iterate over each element in the list, apply the ceiling function, square the result, and accumulate the sum.

Here's the implementation of the solution:

```python
import math

def sum_squares(lst):
    """
    You are given a list of numbers.
    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,
    round each element in the list to the upper int (Ceiling) first.
    """
    total = 0
    for num in lst:
        # Round up to the nearest integer
        rounded_num = math.ceil(num)
        # Square the rounded number
        squared_num = rounded_num ** 2
        # Add to the total sum
        total += squared_num
    return total
```

This function will correctly compute the sum of squares of the ceiling values of the numbers in the list, as demonstrated by the examples provided.
