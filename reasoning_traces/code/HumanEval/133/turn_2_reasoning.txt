To solve the problem of summing the squares of numbers in a list after rounding each number up to the nearest integer, we can break down the task into a few clear steps:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We are given a list of numbers, which can be integers or floating-point numbers.
   - For each number in the list, we need to round it up to the nearest integer. This is known as taking the ceiling of the number.
   - After rounding each number, we square it.
   - Finally, we sum all the squared numbers and return the result.

2. **Examples Analysis**:
   - For `lst = [1, 2, 3]`, the ceiling values are `[1, 2, 3]`, their squares are `[1, 4, 9]`, and the sum is `14`.
   - For `lst = [1, 4, 9]`, the ceiling values are `[1, 4, 9]`, their squares are `[1, 16, 81]`, and the sum is `98`.
   - For `lst = [1, 3, 5, 7]`, the ceiling values are `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, their squares are `[1, 9, 25, 49]`, and the sum is `84`.
   - For `lst = [1.4, 4.2, 0]`, the ceiling values are `[2, 5, 0]`, their squares are `[4, 25, 0]`, and the sum is `29`.
   - For `lst = [-2.4, 1, 1]`, the ceiling values are `[-2, 1, 1]`, their squares are `[4, 1, 1]`, and the sum is `6`.

3. **Plan**:
   - Use the `math.ceil` function to round each number up to the nearest integer.
   - Square each of these rounded numbers.
   - Sum all the squared numbers.
   - Return the sum.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Import the `math` module to use the `ceil` function.
   - Iterate over the list, apply `ceil`, square the result, and accumulate the sum.

Here's the implementation:

```python
import math

def sum_squares(lst):
    """You are given a list of numbers.
    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,
    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.
    """
    total_sum = 0
    for num in lst:
        # Round up to the nearest integer
        rounded_num = math.ceil(num)
        # Square the rounded number
        squared_num = rounded_num ** 2
        # Add to the total sum
        total_sum += squared_num
    return total_sum
```

This function will correctly compute the sum of the squares of the ceiling values of the numbers in the list, as required by the problem statement.
