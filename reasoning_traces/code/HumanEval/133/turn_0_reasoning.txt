==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We are given a list of numbers, and we need to:
   - Round each number in the list to the nearest upper integer (ceiling).
   - Square each of these rounded numbers.
   - Sum all the squared numbers.
   - Return the resulting sum.

2. **Examples Analysis**:
   - For `lst = [1, 2, 3]`, after applying the ceiling function, the list remains `[1, 2, 3]`. Squaring each gives `[1, 4, 9]`, and their sum is `14`.
   - For `lst = [1, 4, 9]`, the list remains `[1, 4, 9]` after ceiling. Squaring gives `[1, 16, 81]`, and their sum is `98`.
   - For `lst = [1, 3, 5, 7]`, the list remains `[1, 3, 5, 7]` after ceiling. Squaring gives `[1, 9, 25, 49]`, and their sum is `84`.
   - For `lst = [1.4, 4.2, 0]`, after ceiling, the list becomes `[2, 5, 0]`. Squaring gives `[4, 25, 0]`, and their sum is `29`.
   - For `lst = [-2.4, 1, 1]`, after ceiling, the list becomes `[-2, 1, 1]`. Squaring gives `[4, 1, 1]`, and their sum is `6`.

3. **Plan the Solution**:
   - Use the `math.ceil` function to round each number in the list to the nearest upper integer.
   - Square each of these rounded numbers.
   - Use the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the squared numbers.
   - Return the sum.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Import the `math` module to use the `ceil` function.
   - Iterate over each element in the list, apply the ceiling function, square the result, and accumulate the sum.

Here's the implementation of the solution:

```python
import math

def sum_squares(lst):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over each element in the list
    for num in lst:
        # Round the number to the nearest upper integer using math.ceil
        rounded_num = math.ceil(num)
        
        # Square the rounded number
        squared_num = rounded_num ** 2
        
        # Add the squared number to the total sum
        total_sum += squared_num
    
    # Return the total sum
    return total_sum

# Test cases
print(sum_squares([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 14
print(sum_squares([1, 4, 9]))  # Output: 98
print(sum_squares([1, 3, 5, 7]))  # Output: 84
print(sum_squares([1.4, 4.2, 0]))  # Output: 29
print(sum_squares([-2.4, 1, 1]))  # Output: 6
```

This function should correctly compute the sum of squared numbers after rounding each to the nearest upper integer for any given list of numbers.
