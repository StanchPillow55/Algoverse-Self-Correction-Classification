To solve the problem of computing the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence, we need to understand the sequence definition and then devise an efficient way to compute it without using recursion.

### Understanding the Fib4 Sequence

The Fib4 sequence is defined as follows:
- `fib4(0) = 0`
- `fib4(1) = 0`
- `fib4(2) = 2`
- `fib4(3) = 0`
- For `n >= 4`, `fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)`

This sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but involves the sum of the previous four terms instead of two.

### Approach

1. **Base Cases**: Directly return the known values for `n = 0`, `n = 1`, `n = 2`, and `n = 3`.

2. **Iterative Calculation**: For `n >= 4`, use an iterative approach to compute the sequence. This avoids the overhead of recursion and is more efficient in terms of both time and space.

3. **Use a List to Store Values**: Maintain a list to store the last four computed values of the sequence. This allows us to compute the next value in constant time by summing the last four values.

4. **Iterate Until n**: Start from the base cases and iteratively compute up to the n-th term using the relation `fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)`.

5. **Return the Result**: After computing up to the n-th term, return the result.

### Implementation

Here's the implementation of the above approach:

```python
def fib4(n: int) -> int:
    # Base cases
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize the first four values of the sequence
    fib_values = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    
    # Compute the sequence iteratively up to the n-th term
    for i in range(4, n + 1):
        next_value = fib_values[-1] + fib_values[-2] + fib_values[-3] + fib_values[-4]
        # Update the list to hold the last four values
        fib_values = [fib_values[1], fib_values[2], fib_values[3], next_value]
    
    # The last computed value is the n-th term
    return fib_values[-1]

# Test cases
print(fib4(5))  # Output: 4
print(fib4(6))  # Output: 8
print(fib4(7))  # Output: 14
```

### Explanation

- **Base Cases**: We handle the first four terms directly since they are predefined.
- **Iterative Loop**: We start from the 4th term and compute each subsequent term by summing the last four terms.
- **Efficient Storage**: By maintaining only the last four terms, we keep our space usage constant, making the solution efficient.
- **Return**: Finally, we return the last computed value, which corresponds to `fib4(n)`.

This approach ensures that we compute the sequence efficiently without recursion, adhering to the problem constraints.
