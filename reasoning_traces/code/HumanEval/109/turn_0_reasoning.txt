==================================================

To solve the problem of determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing any number of right shift operations, we need to understand the mechanics of the right shift and how it affects the order of elements.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Right Shift Operation**: A right shift operation moves each element of the array one position to the right, and the last element moves to the first position. For example, a right shift on `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]` results in `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`.

2. **Objective**: We need to determine if there exists a number of right shifts that can transform the array into a non-decreasing order.

3. **Key Insight**: If an array can be sorted by right shifts, it means there is a "break point" in the array where the order is disrupted. By shifting the elements such that this break point becomes the start of the array, the array should become sorted.

### Approach

1. **Identify the Break Point**: 
   - Traverse the array to find where the order is disrupted. This is where an element is greater than the next element.
   - Count the number of such disruptions. If there is more than one disruption, it is impossible to sort the array with right shifts.

2. **Check for Validity**:
   - If there is no disruption, the array is already sorted.
   - If there is exactly one disruption, check if the array can be rotated to become sorted. This means the last element should be less than or equal to the first element after the break point.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - An empty array is trivially sorted, so return `True`.
   - A single-element array is also trivially sorted.

### Implementation

```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    if not arr:  # Handle empty array
        return True
    
    n = len(arr)
    break_count = 0
    break_point = -1
    
    # Identify the break point
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > arr[(i + 1) % n]:
            break_count += 1
            break_point = i
    
    # If there is more than one break point, sorting by right shifts is impossible
    if break_count > 1:
        return False
    
    # If there is no break point, the array is already sorted
    if break_count == 0:
        return True
    
    # Check if the array can be rotated to become sorted
    # The element after the break point should be the smallest
    # and the last element should be less than or equal to the first element
    return arr[break_point] <= arr[(break_point + 1) % n]

# Test cases
print(move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2]))  # True
print(move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2]))  # False
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We first check if the array is empty and return `True` if it is.
- We then iterate through the array to find the number of disruptions (break points) where the order is not maintained.
- If there is more than one break point, it is impossible to sort the array with right shifts, so we return `False`.
- If there is exactly one break point, we check if the array can be rotated to become sorted by ensuring that the last element before the break point is less than or equal to the first element after the break point.
- If there are no break points, the array is already sorted, so we return `True`.
