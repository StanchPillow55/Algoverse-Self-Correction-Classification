==================================================

To solve the problem of determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing any number of right shift operations, we need to understand the effect of these operations on the array.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Right Shift Operation**: A right shift operation moves all elements of the array one position to the right, with the last element wrapping around to the first position. For example, a right shift on `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]` results in `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`.

2. **Objective**: We need to determine if there exists a number of right shift operations that will result in the array being sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Unique Elements**: The problem guarantees that all elements in the array are unique, which simplifies the problem since we don't have to deal with duplicate values.

### Approach

1. **Identify the Sorted Order**: First, determine what the sorted version of the array looks like. For example, if the array is `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`, the sorted version is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

2. **Simulate Right Shifts**: We can simulate the effect of right shifts by considering each possible starting point in the array and checking if the array can be rotated to match the sorted version.

3. **Check Rotations**: For each index `i` in the array, consider it as the starting point of the array and check if the sequence from `i` to the end followed by the sequence from the start to `i-1` matches the sorted array.

4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If the array is empty, it is trivially sorted, so return `True`.
   - If the array has only one element, it is also trivially sorted.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function `move_one_ball` based on the above approach:

```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    if not arr:
        return True
    
    n = len(arr)
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
    
    # Check each possible rotation
    for i in range(n):
        # Create a rotated version of the array starting from index i
        rotated = arr[i:] + arr[:i]
        if rotated == sorted_arr:
            return True
    
    return False

# Example usage:
print(move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2]))  # True
print(move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2]))  # False
```

### Explanation

- We first check if the array is empty, in which case we return `True`.
- We sort the array to get the target sorted order.
- We iterate over each index `i` and simulate the effect of starting the array from that index.
- For each simulated rotation, we check if it matches the sorted array.
- If any rotation matches, we return `True`. If none match, we return `False`.

This approach efficiently checks all possible rotations and determines if the array can be sorted by right shifts.
