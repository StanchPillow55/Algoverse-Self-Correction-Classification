To solve the problem of determining which of two lists of strings has fewer total characters, we need to follow a structured approach. Let's break down the problem and devise a solution step by step.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Input**: Two lists of strings, `lst1` and `lst2`.
2. **Output**: The list that has a smaller total number of characters across all its strings. If both lists have the same total number of characters, return the first list.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Calculate Total Characters**:
   - For each list, calculate the total number of characters by summing up the lengths of each string in the list.
   - This can be done using Python's built-in `len()` function and a generator expression or list comprehension.

2. **Compare Totals**:
   - Compare the total number of characters from both lists.
   - If `lst1` has fewer characters, return `lst1`.
   - If `lst2` has fewer characters, return `lst2`.
   - If both have the same number of characters, return `lst1`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Both lists are empty: In this case, both have zero characters, so we return `lst1` (which is also an empty list).
   - One list is empty and the other is not: The empty list will have fewer characters, so it should be returned.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function `total_match` based on the outlined approach:

```python
def total_match(lst1, lst2):
    # Calculate the total number of characters in lst1
    total_chars_lst1 = sum(len(s) for s in lst1)
    
    # Calculate the total number of characters in lst2
    total_chars_lst2 = sum(len(s) for s in lst2)
    
    # Compare the total characters and return the appropriate list
    if total_chars_lst1 < total_chars_lst2:
        return lst1
    elif total_chars_lst2 < total_chars_lst1:
        return lst2
    else:
        return lst1

# Test cases
print(total_match([], []))  # ➞ []
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi']))  # ➞ ['hI', 'Hi']
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project']))  # ➞ ['hi', 'admin']
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']))  # ➞ ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']
print(total_match(['4'], ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']))  # ➞ ['4']
```

### Explanation

- We use a generator expression `sum(len(s) for s in lst)` to calculate the total number of characters in each list.
- We then compare these totals and return the list with fewer characters.
- If the totals are equal, we return `lst1` as specified in the problem statement.

This solution efficiently handles the problem requirements and edge cases, providing the correct output for the given examples.
