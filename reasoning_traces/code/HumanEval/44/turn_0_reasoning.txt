To solve the problem of converting a number from base 10 to another base (less than 10), we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the problem and think through the solution step by step.

### Problem Understanding

We are given a number `x` in base 10 and we need to convert it to a string representation in another base, specified by `base`. The base is guaranteed to be less than 10, which simplifies the problem because we don't have to deal with alphabetic characters (like 'A' for 10 in hexadecimal).

### Approach

1. **Input Validation**: 
   - Ensure that the base is valid (i.e., greater than 1 and less than 10). If the base is not valid, we should handle this gracefully.

2. **Conversion Logic**:
   - If `x` is 0, the result is simply "0" since any number in any base is 0 if the number itself is 0.
   - For a positive integer `x`, we repeatedly divide `x` by the base and keep track of the remainders. These remainders represent the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit.
   - Continue this process until `x` becomes 0.
   - The remainders collected in reverse order form the number in the new base.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Initialize an empty list to store the remainders.
   - Use a loop to divide `x` by the base, appending the remainder to the list.
   - Update `x` to be the quotient of the division.
   - Once the loop completes, reverse the list of remainders to get the correct order of digits.
   - Convert the list of digits to a string and return it.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str:
    """Change numerical base of input number x to base.
    Return string representation after the conversion.
    Base numbers are less than 10.
    """
    if base <= 1 or base >= 10:
        raise ValueError("Base must be greater than 1 and less than 10.")
    
    if x == 0:
        return "0"
    
    digits = []
    while x > 0:
        remainder = x % base
        digits.append(str(remainder))
        x = x // base
    
    # The digits are collected in reverse order, so reverse them
    digits.reverse()
    
    # Join the list into a string
    return ''.join(digits)

# Test cases
print(change_base(8, 3))  # Expected output: '22'
print(change_base(8, 2))  # Expected output: '1000'
print(change_base(7, 2))  # Expected output: '111'
```

### Explanation of the Implementation

- We start by checking if the base is valid. If not, we raise a `ValueError`.
- If `x` is 0, we immediately return "0".
- We use a `while` loop to repeatedly divide `x` by the base, storing the remainder each time.
- The remainders are collected in a list and then reversed to form the correct order of digits.
- Finally, we join the list of digits into a string and return it.

This solution efficiently converts a base-10 number to any base less than 10, handling edge cases such as `x = 0` and invalid bases.
