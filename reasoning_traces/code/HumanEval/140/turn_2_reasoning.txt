To solve the problem of replacing spaces in a string according to the specified rules, we need to carefully analyze the requirements and then implement a function that adheres to these rules. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Single Spaces**: 
   - Any single space should be replaced with an underscore (`_`).

2. **Consecutive Spaces**:
   - If there are more than two consecutive spaces, they should be replaced with a single hyphen (`-`).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Strings without any spaces should remain unchanged.
   - Strings that start or end with spaces should be handled correctly according to the rules above.

### Approach

1. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - We will iterate through the string character by character to identify spaces and count consecutive spaces.

2. **Count Consecutive Spaces**:
   - Use a counter to keep track of consecutive spaces.
   - When a non-space character is encountered, decide what to append to the result based on the count of consecutive spaces.

3. **Replace Based on Count**:
   - If the count of consecutive spaces is 1, append an underscore (`_`).
   - If the count is greater than 2, append a hyphen (`-`).
   - Reset the counter after processing the spaces.

4. **Build the Result**:
   - Construct the result string by appending characters and replacements as determined by the above logic.

5. **Edge Handling**:
   - Ensure that the logic correctly handles strings that start or end with spaces.

### Implementation

Here is the implementation of the `fix_spaces` function based on the above approach:

```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    result = []
    space_count = 0
    
    for char in text:
        if char == ' ':
            space_count += 1
        else:
            if space_count == 1:
                result.append('_')
            elif space_count > 2:
                result.append('-')
            elif space_count == 2:
                result.extend(['_', '_'])
            
            space_count = 0
            result.append(char)
    
    # Handle trailing spaces
    if space_count == 1:
        result.append('_')
    elif space_count > 2:
        result.append('-')
    elif space_count == 2:
        result.extend(['_', '_'])
    
    return ''.join(result)

# Test cases
print(fix_spaces("Example"))         # "Example"
print(fix_spaces("Example 1"))       # "Example_1"
print(fix_spaces(" Example 2"))      # "_Example_2"
print(fix_spaces(" Example   3"))    # "_Example-3"
```

### Explanation

- We maintain a `space_count` to track consecutive spaces.
- For each character, if it's a space, we increment the `space_count`.
- If it's a non-space character, we check the `space_count`:
  - Append `_` if there was one space.
  - Append `-` if there were more than two spaces.
  - Append two underscores if there were exactly two spaces.
- Reset the `space_count` after processing spaces.
- Finally, handle any trailing spaces after the loop.

This approach ensures that all spaces are replaced according to the rules given in the problem statement.
