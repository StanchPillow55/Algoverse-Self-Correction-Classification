==================================================

To solve the problem of replacing spaces in a given string according to the specified rules, we need to carefully analyze the requirements and implement a solution that adheres to them. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Single Space Replacement**: 
   - If there is a single space between words or at the start or end of the string, it should be replaced with an underscore (`_`).

2. **Consecutive Spaces Replacement**:
   - If there are more than two consecutive spaces, all of them should be replaced with a single hyphen (`-`).

### Approach

To implement this, we can follow these steps:

1. **Iterate Through the String**: 
   - We'll traverse the string character by character to identify spaces and count consecutive spaces.

2. **Count Consecutive Spaces**:
   - As we iterate, we'll maintain a counter to track consecutive spaces.

3. **Replace Spaces Based on Count**:
   - If we encounter a non-space character after spaces, we'll decide how to replace the spaces based on the count:
     - If the count is 1, replace with `_`.
     - If the count is 2 or more, replace with `-`.

4. **Build the Result String**:
   - We'll construct the result string by appending characters and replacements as we process the input string.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle strings with no spaces.
   - Handle strings that start or end with spaces.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function `fix_spaces` based on the above approach:

```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    """
    Given a string text, replace all spaces in it with underscores, 
    and if a string has more than 2 consecutive spaces, 
    then replace all consecutive spaces with - 
    """
    result = []
    space_count = 0
    
    for char in text:
        if char == ' ':
            space_count += 1
        else:
            if space_count == 1:
                result.append('_')
            elif space_count > 1:
                result.append('-')
            result.append(char)
            space_count = 0
    
    # Handle trailing spaces
    if space_count == 1:
        result.append('_')
    elif space_count > 1:
        result.append('-')
    
    return ''.join(result)

# Test cases
print(fix_spaces("Example"))       # "Example"
print(fix_spaces("Example 1"))     # "Example_1"
print(fix_spaces(" Example 2"))    # "_Example_2"
print(fix_spaces(" Example   3"))  # "_Example-3"
```

### Explanation

- We use a list `result` to build the output string efficiently.
- We keep track of consecutive spaces using `space_count`.
- When a non-space character is encountered, we append the appropriate replacement based on `space_count`.
- After the loop, we check if there are trailing spaces and handle them accordingly.
- Finally, we join the list into a string and return it.

This solution efficiently processes the input string in a single pass, ensuring that all spaces are replaced according to the specified rules.
