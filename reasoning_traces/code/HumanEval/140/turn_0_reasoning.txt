==================================================

To solve the problem of replacing spaces in a given string according to specific rules, we need to carefully consider the requirements and implement a solution that handles all cases correctly. Let's break down the problem and devise a plan:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Single Spaces**: Any single space in the string should be replaced with an underscore (`_`).
2. **Consecutive Spaces**: If there are more than two consecutive spaces, they should be replaced with a single hyphen (`-`).

### Approach

1. **Iterate Through the String**: We will iterate through the string character by character to identify spaces and count consecutive spaces.
2. **Count Consecutive Spaces**: As we iterate, we will keep track of consecutive spaces using a counter.
3. **Replace Spaces**:
   - If we encounter a single space (i.e., the counter is 1), we replace it with an underscore.
   - If the counter exceeds 2 (indicating more than two consecutive spaces), we replace the entire sequence with a hyphen.
4. **Build the Result**: We will construct the resulting string by appending characters and replacements to a list, which we will join at the end to form the final string.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function `fix_spaces` based on the above approach:

```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    result = []
    i = 0
    n = len(text)
    
    while i < n:
        if text[i] == ' ':
            # Start counting spaces
            space_count = 0
            while i < n and text[i] == ' ':
                space_count += 1
                i += 1
            
            # Determine replacement based on space count
            if space_count == 1:
                result.append('_')
            elif space_count > 2:
                result.append('-')
        else:
            # Append non-space characters directly
            result.append(text[i])
            i += 1
    
    return ''.join(result)

# Test cases
print(fix_spaces("Example"))        # "Example"
print(fix_spaces("Example 1"))      # "Example_1"
print(fix_spaces(" Example 2"))     # "_Example_2"
print(fix_spaces(" Example   3"))   # "_Example-3"
```

### Explanation

- **Loop Through Characters**: We use a `while` loop to iterate through the string. The index `i` is incremented as we process each character.
- **Space Counting**: When we encounter a space, we enter a nested loop to count consecutive spaces. We increment `i` within this loop to skip over the spaces.
- **Replacement Logic**: After counting spaces, we decide the replacement based on the count:
  - A single space is replaced with `_`.
  - More than two consecutive spaces are replaced with `-`.
- **Appending Characters**: Non-space characters are directly appended to the result list.
- **Result Construction**: Finally, we join the list of characters into a single string and return it.

This solution efficiently handles the requirements and edge cases specified in the problem statement.
