To solve the problem of sorting a list in a "strange" order, we need to alternate between selecting the minimum and maximum values from the list until all elements are exhausted. Let's break down the steps needed to achieve this:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to sort a list such that we start with the minimum value, then the maximum of the remaining values, then the next minimum, and so on. This pattern continues until all elements are placed in the new list.

2. **Examples Analysis**:
   - For the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the sorted order should be `[1, 4, 2, 3]`.
   - For the list `[5, 5, 5, 5]`, since all elements are the same, the order remains `[5, 5, 5, 5]`.
   - An empty list `[]` should return an empty list `[]`.

3. **Plan the Solution**:
   - Initialize an empty list `result` to store the final sorted order.
   - Use a loop to repeatedly find and remove the minimum and maximum values from the list until it is empty.
   - In each iteration:
     - Find the minimum value, append it to `result`, and remove it from the list.
     - If the list is not empty, find the maximum value, append it to `result`, and remove it from the list.
   - Continue this process until the list is empty.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the list is empty, return an empty list immediately.
   - If all elements are the same, the order remains unchanged.

5. **Implementation**: Now, let's implement the function based on the above plan.

```python
def strange_sort_list(lst):
    result = []
    while lst:
        # Find and append the minimum value
        min_val = min(lst)
        result.append(min_val)
        lst.remove(min_val)
        
        # Check if the list is empty before finding the maximum
        if lst:
            # Find and append the maximum value
            max_val = max(lst)
            result.append(max_val)
            lst.remove(max_val)
    
    return result

# Test cases
print(strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: [1, 4, 2, 3]
print(strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]))  # Output: [5, 5, 5, 5]
print(strange_sort_list([]))            # Output: []
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We use a `while` loop to continue processing until the list `lst` is empty.
- In each iteration, we find the minimum value using `min(lst)`, append it to `result`, and remove it from `lst`.
- We then check if `lst` is still non-empty before finding the maximum value using `max(lst)`, append it to `result`, and remove it from `lst`.
- This alternating process continues until all elements are moved to `result`.
- Finally, the `result` list is returned, which contains the elements in the "strange" sorted order.
