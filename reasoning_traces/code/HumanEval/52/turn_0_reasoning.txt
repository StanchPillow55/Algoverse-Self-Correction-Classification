To solve the problem of determining whether all numbers in a list are below a given threshold, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the problem and think through the solution step by step.

### Problem Understanding

We have a function `below_threshold(l: list, t: int)` that takes two parameters:
1. `l`: A list of numbers.
2. `t`: An integer threshold.

The function should return `True` if every number in the list `l` is less than the threshold `t`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Approach

1. **Iterate Through the List**: We need to check each number in the list `l` to see if it is less than the threshold `t`.

2. **Comparison**: For each number in the list, compare it with the threshold `t`.
   - If we find any number that is greater than or equal to `t`, we can immediately return `False` because not all numbers are below the threshold.

3. **Return True if All Pass**: If we finish checking all numbers and none of them are greater than or equal to `t`, then we return `True`.

### Implementation

To implement this, we can use a simple loop to iterate over the list and perform the necessary checks. Here's how we can do it:

```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    """Return True if all numbers in the list l are below threshold t."""
    for number in l:
        if number >= t:
            return False
    return True
```

### Explanation

- We iterate over each `number` in the list `l`.
- For each `number`, we check if it is greater than or equal to `t`.
  - If it is, we return `False` immediately because this means not all numbers are below the threshold.
- If the loop completes without finding any numbers that are greater than or equal to `t`, we return `True`, indicating that all numbers are indeed below the threshold.

### Testing

Let's verify the function with the provided examples:

```python
print(below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100))  # Expected output: True
print(below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5))   # Expected output: False
```

The function should work correctly for these cases, and it should also handle edge cases like an empty list (which should return `True` since there are no numbers to violate the condition).

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list, as it requires a single pass through the list.
