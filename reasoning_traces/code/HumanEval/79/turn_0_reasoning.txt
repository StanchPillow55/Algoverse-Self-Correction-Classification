To solve the problem of converting a decimal number to a binary string with specific formatting, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Input and Output**:
   - Input: A decimal number (integer).
   - Output: A string that represents the binary form of the input number, prefixed and suffixed with the characters "db".

2. **Conversion from Decimal to Binary**:
   - Python provides a built-in function `bin()` that converts a decimal number to its binary representation as a string. However, this string includes a prefix '0b' to indicate that it is a binary number.
   - For example, `bin(15)` returns `'0b1111'`.

3. **Remove the '0b' Prefix**:
   - We need to remove the '0b' prefix from the result of `bin()` to get just the binary digits.
   - This can be done by slicing the string returned by `bin()`, i.e., `bin(decimal)[2:]`.

4. **Format the Result**:
   - Once we have the binary digits as a string, we need to add the prefix and suffix "db" to it.
   - This can be done using string concatenation: `"db" + binary_string + "db"`.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - The final step is to return the formatted string.

Now, let's implement the function `decimal_to_binary` based on this reasoning:

```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """Converts a decimal number to a binary string with 'db' prefix and suffix."""
    # Convert the decimal number to a binary string and remove the '0b' prefix
    binary_string = bin(decimal)[2:]
    
    # Add the 'db' prefix and suffix
    formatted_binary = f"db{binary_string}db"
    
    # Return the formatted binary string
    return formatted_binary

# Example usage:
# print(decimal_to_binary(15))  # Output: "db1111db"
# print(decimal_to_binary(32))  # Output: "db100000db"
```

### Explanation:
- **`bin(decimal)[2:]`**: This line converts the decimal number to a binary string and removes the '0b' prefix by slicing from the third character onward.
- **`f"db{binary_string}db"`**: This line formats the binary string by adding "db" at the beginning and end using an f-string for clarity and simplicity.
- The function then returns the formatted string, which meets the problem's requirements.
