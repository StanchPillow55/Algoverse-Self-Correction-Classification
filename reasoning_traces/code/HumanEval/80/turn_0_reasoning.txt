To solve the problem of determining if a string is "happy," we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem Requirements:**
   - A string is considered "happy" if:
     - Its length is at least 3.
     - Every set of 3 consecutive characters in the string are distinct.

2. **Plan the Solution:**
   - First, check if the length of the string `s` is less than 3. If it is, return `False` immediately because it cannot be "happy."
   - Iterate through the string, examining each set of 3 consecutive characters.
   - For each set of 3 characters, check if all characters are distinct.
   - If any set of 3 consecutive characters is not distinct, return `False`.
   - If we finish checking all possible sets of 3 characters without finding any duplicates, return `True`.

3. **Implementation Details:**
   - Use a loop to iterate over the string from the start to `len(s) - 2` (inclusive), because we need to check sets of 3 characters.
   - For each index `i`, check the characters `s[i]`, `s[i+1]`, and `s[i+2]`.
   - Use a set to determine if the characters are distinct, as sets do not allow duplicate elements.
   - If the length of the set of these 3 characters is 3, they are distinct; otherwise, they are not.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Strings with length less than 3 should return `False`.
   - Strings with repeating patterns should be handled correctly.

Now, let's implement the function:

```python
def is_happy(s):
    # Check if the string length is less than 3
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    
    # Iterate over the string to check each set of 3 consecutive characters
    for i in range(len(s) - 2):
        # Extract the current set of 3 characters
        triplet = s[i:i+3]
        
        # Check if all characters in the triplet are distinct
        if len(set(triplet)) != 3:
            return False
    
    # If all triplets are distinct, the string is happy
    return True

# Test cases
print(is_happy("a"))      # False
print(is_happy("aa"))     # False
print(is_happy("abcd"))   # True
print(is_happy("aabb"))   # False
print(is_happy("adb"))    # True
print(is_happy("xyy"))    # False
```

This function checks each set of 3 consecutive characters in the string and determines if they are distinct. If any set is not distinct, it returns `False`. If all sets are distinct, it returns `True`, indicating the string is "happy."
