==================================================

To solve the problem of performing a binary XOR operation on two strings consisting of '1's and '0's, we need to follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand XOR Operation**:
   - XOR (exclusive OR) is a binary operation that takes two bits and returns 1 if the bits are different, and 0 if they are the same.
   - The truth table for XOR is:
     - 0 XOR 0 = 0
     - 0 XOR 1 = 1
     - 1 XOR 0 = 1
     - 1 XOR 1 = 0

2. **Input Constraints**:
   - Both input strings `a` and `b` are of the same length.
   - They consist only of the characters '1' and '0'.

3. **Approach**:
   - Iterate over the characters of the strings `a` and `b` simultaneously.
   - For each pair of characters, apply the XOR operation according to the truth table.
   - Collect the results of these operations into a new string.

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - Use a loop to iterate over the indices of the strings.
   - Convert each character to an integer, perform the XOR operation, and convert the result back to a string.
   - Concatenate these results to form the final output string.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Since the problem guarantees that the strings are of the same length and only contain '1's and '0's, we don't need to handle mismatched lengths or invalid characters.

### Implementation:

Here's the implementation of the `string_xor` function based on the above reasoning:

```python
from typing import List

def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Input are two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    Perform binary XOR on these inputs and return result also as a string.
    """
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result characters
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the characters of both strings
    for char_a, char_b in zip(a, b):
        # Convert characters to integers, perform XOR, and convert back to string
        xor_result = str(int(char_a) ^ int(char_b))
        # Append the result to the list
        result.append(xor_result)
    
    # Join the list into a single string and return
    return ''.join(result)

# Example usage
print(string_xor('010', '110'))  # Output: '100'
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We use a list `result` to collect the XOR results of each pair of characters.
- We use `zip(a, b)` to iterate over both strings simultaneously.
- For each pair of characters `(char_a, char_b)`, we convert them to integers, perform the XOR operation using `^`, and convert the result back to a string.
- We append each XOR result to the `result` list.
- Finally, we join the list into a single string using `''.join(result)` and return it.

This solution efficiently computes the XOR of two binary strings and returns the result as a new binary string.
