To solve the problem of determining if two strings of parentheses can be concatenated to form a balanced string, we need to understand the properties of balanced parentheses:

1. A string of parentheses is balanced if:
   - Every opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing parenthesis ')'.
   - At no point in the string, when reading from left to right, should the number of closing parentheses ')' exceed the number of opening parentheses '('.

Given two strings, our task is to determine if there exists an order of concatenation that results in a balanced string. Let's break down the approach:

### Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have two strings, `s1` and `s2`, consisting of only '(' and ')'.
   - We need to check if either `s1 + s2` or `s2 + s1` can form a balanced string.

2. **Properties of Balanced Parentheses:**
   - A string is balanced if, while traversing the string, the count of ')' never exceeds the count of '('.
   - At the end of the string, the count of '(' should equal the count of ')'.

3. **Checking Balance:**
   - We can use a counter to track the balance of parentheses as we iterate through the string.
   - Initialize a counter to zero. For each '(', increment the counter. For each ')', decrement the counter.
   - If the counter ever becomes negative during the traversal, the string is not balanced.
   - At the end of the traversal, the counter should be zero for the string to be balanced.

4. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Define a helper function `is_balanced` that checks if a given string is balanced.
   - Check both concatenations: `s1 + s2` and `s2 + s1`.
   - If either concatenation is balanced, return 'Yes'. Otherwise, return 'No'.

Now, let's implement the solution:

```python
def match_parens(lst):
    def is_balanced(s):
        balance = 0
        for char in s:
            if char == '(':
                balance += 1
            else:
                balance -= 1
            if balance < 0:
                return False
        return balance == 0

    s1, s2 = lst
    if is_balanced(s1 + s2) or is_balanced(s2 + s1):
        return 'Yes'
    else:
        return 'No'

# Test cases
print(match_parens(['()(', ')']))  # Expected output: 'Yes'
print(match_parens([')', ')']))    # Expected output: 'No'
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:

- The `is_balanced` function checks if a string of parentheses is balanced by maintaining a `balance` counter.
- We check both possible concatenations (`s1 + s2` and `s2 + s1`) to see if either results in a balanced string.
- If either concatenation is balanced, we return 'Yes'; otherwise, we return 'No'.
