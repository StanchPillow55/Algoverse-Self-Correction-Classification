==================================================

To solve the problem of determining if two strings of parentheses can be concatenated to form a balanced string, we need to understand the properties of balanced parentheses:

1. A string is considered balanced if:
   - For every opening parenthesis '(', there is a corresponding closing parenthesis ')'.
   - At no point in the string, when reading from left to right, should the number of closing parentheses ')' exceed the number of opening parentheses '('.

Given two strings, our task is to check if there exists an order of concatenation that results in a balanced string. Let's break down the approach:

### Approach:

1. **Understand the Input and Output:**
   - We have two strings consisting of '(' and ')'.
   - We need to determine if there is an order of concatenation that results in a balanced string.
   - Return 'Yes' if possible, otherwise 'No'.

2. **Properties of Balanced Parentheses:**
   - A string is balanced if, at any point from left to right, the count of ')' does not exceed the count of '('.
   - The total number of '(' should equal the total number of ')' for the entire string to be balanced.

3. **Concatenation Possibilities:**
   - We have two possible orders to check:
     - Concatenate the first string with the second: `s1 + s2`
     - Concatenate the second string with the first: `s2 + s1`

4. **Checking Balance:**
   - For each concatenation order, simulate the process of checking balance:
     - Traverse the string while maintaining a balance counter.
     - Increment the counter for '(' and decrement for ')'.
     - If the counter goes negative at any point, the string is not balanced.
     - At the end of traversal, the counter should be zero for the string to be balanced.

5. **Implementation:**
   - Implement a helper function to check if a given string is balanced.
   - Check both concatenation orders using this helper function.
   - Return 'Yes' if either order results in a balanced string, otherwise 'No'.

### Implementation:

```python
def is_balanced(s):
    balance = 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    return balance == 0

def match_parens(lst):
    s1, s2 = lst
    # Check both concatenation orders
    if is_balanced(s1 + s2) or is_balanced(s2 + s1):
        return 'Yes'
    else:
        return 'No'

# Examples:
# match_parens(['()(', ')']) should return 'Yes'
# match_parens([')', ')']) should return 'No'
```

### Explanation:

- The `is_balanced` function checks if a given string of parentheses is balanced by maintaining a balance counter.
- The `match_parens` function checks both possible concatenation orders using the `is_balanced` function.
- If either order results in a balanced string, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.
