To solve the problem of determining whether two strings of parentheses can be concatenated to form a balanced string, we need to understand the properties of balanced parentheses:

1. **Balanced Parentheses**: A string of parentheses is balanced if:
   - Every opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing parenthesis ')'.
   - At no point in the string, when reading from left to right, should the number of closing parentheses ')' exceed the number of opening parentheses '('.

Given two strings, our task is to determine if there exists an order of concatenation that results in a balanced string.

### Approach:

1. **Count Unmatched Parentheses**:
   - For each string, calculate the number of unmatched opening and closing parentheses.
   - Traverse each string and maintain a balance counter:
     - Increment the counter for '('.
     - Decrement the counter for ')'.
     - If the counter goes negative, it indicates unmatched closing parentheses.

2. **Determine Concatenation Possibility**:
   - Calculate the unmatched parentheses for both strings.
   - Check if concatenating the strings in either order results in a balanced string:
     - If the unmatched opening parentheses from the first string can be matched with the unmatched closing parentheses from the second string, and vice versa.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Define a helper function to calculate unmatched parentheses.
   - Use this helper function to determine if a balanced string can be formed by concatenating the strings in either order.

Let's implement this logic in the `match_parens` function:

```python
def match_parens(lst):
    def unmatched_parens(s):
        open_count = 0
        close_count = 0
        for char in s:
            if char == '(':
                open_count += 1
            else:  # char == ')'
                if open_count > 0:
                    open_count -= 1
                else:
                    close_count += 1
        return open_count, close_count

    # Get the two strings
    s1, s2 = lst
    
    # Calculate unmatched parentheses for both strings
    open1, close1 = unmatched_parens(s1)
    open2, close2 = unmatched_parens(s2)
    
    # Check if concatenating s1 + s2 or s2 + s1 results in a balanced string
    if (open1 <= close2 and open2 <= close1):
        return 'Yes'
    else:
        return 'No'

# Test cases
print(match_parens(['()(', ')']))  # Expected output: 'Yes'
print(match_parens([')', ')']))    # Expected output: 'No'
```

### Explanation:

- **unmatched_parens**: This helper function calculates the number of unmatched opening and closing parentheses for a given string.
- **Concatenation Check**: We check if the unmatched opening parentheses from one string can be matched with the unmatched closing parentheses from the other string in either concatenation order.
- **Return**: If either order results in a balanced string, return 'Yes'. Otherwise, return 'No'.

This solution efficiently checks both possible concatenation orders and determines if a balanced string can be formed.
