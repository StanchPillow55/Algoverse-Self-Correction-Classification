==================================================

To solve the problem of determining how many times we need to lower the buckets to empty the wells, we need to follow these steps:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Understand the Grid**: 
   - The grid is a 2D list where each sub-list represents a well.
   - Each element in the sub-list is either `0` (no water) or `1` (a unit of water).

2. **Bucket Capacity**:
   - Each bucket can carry a certain number of water units, given by `capacity`.

3. **Objective**:
   - Calculate the total number of times we need to lower the buckets to remove all the water from the wells.

### Approach

1. **Calculate Total Water Units**:
   - Traverse the grid and count the total number of `1`s. This will give us the total water units present in all wells.

2. **Determine Bucket Lowerings**:
   - Given the total water units and the bucket capacity, calculate how many times we need to lower the bucket.
   - This can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{bucket\_lowerings} = \lceil \frac{\text{total\_water\_units}}{\text{capacity}} \rceil
     \]
   - In Python, this can be achieved using integer division and the `math.ceil` function, or simply using:
     \[
     \text{bucket\_lowerings} = \left(\frac{\text{total\_water\_units} + \text{capacity} - 1}{\text{capacity}}\right)
     \]
   - This formula works because adding `capacity - 1` ensures that any remainder from the division results in an additional bucket lowering.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the solution based on the above approach:

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    
    # Step 1: Calculate total water units
    total_water_units = sum(sum(row) for row in grid)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the number of times to lower the bucket
    # Using integer division to simulate ceiling division
    bucket_lowerings = (total_water_units + capacity - 1) // capacity
    
    return bucket_lowerings

# Test cases
print(max_fill([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 1))  # Output: 6
print(max_fill([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2))  # Output: 5
print(max_fill([[0,0,0], [0,0,0]], 5))  # Output: 0
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Line 4**: We import the `math` module, although we don't end up using it because we use integer arithmetic to achieve the ceiling effect.
- **Line 7**: We calculate the total number of water units by summing up all the `1`s in the grid.
- **Line 10**: We calculate the number of bucket lowerings needed using integer arithmetic to simulate ceiling division.
- **Line 12**: We return the calculated number of bucket lowerings.

This solution efficiently calculates the required number of bucket lowerings using simple arithmetic operations, ensuring it works within the constraints provided.
