==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times we need to lower the buckets to empty all the wells in the grid. Each well is represented by a row in the grid, and each '1' in a row represents a unit of water. The bucket has a fixed capacity, and we need to calculate how many times we need to use the bucket to remove all the water from the grid.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Input and Output:**
   - Input: A grid (list of lists) where each sublist represents a well, and each element in the sublist is either 0 or 1. A bucket capacity which is an integer.
   - Output: An integer representing the number of times the bucket needs to be lowered to remove all the water from the grid.

2. **Plan the Solution:**
   - First, we need to calculate the total amount of water present in the grid. This can be done by summing up all the '1's in the grid.
   - Once we have the total amount of water, we need to determine how many full bucket loads are required to remove all this water. This can be calculated by dividing the total water by the bucket capacity and rounding up to the nearest integer (since any remaining water, even if less than the bucket capacity, will require an additional lowering of the bucket).
   - The mathematical operation to achieve this is the ceiling of the division of total water by bucket capacity.

3. **Implement the Solution:**
   - We will iterate over each row in the grid and sum up the '1's to get the total water.
   - Use the `math.ceil` function to calculate the number of times the bucket needs to be lowered.

Here's the complete implementation:

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    
    # Calculate the total amount of water in the grid
    total_water = sum(sum(row) for row in grid)
    
    # Calculate the number of times the bucket needs to be lowered
    # We use math.ceil to ensure we account for any remaining water
    bucket_uses = math.ceil(total_water / capacity)
    
    return bucket_uses

# Example usage:
# Example 1
print(max_fill([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 1))  # Output: 6

# Example 2
print(max_fill([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2))  # Output: 5

# Example 3
print(max_fill([[0,0,0], [0,0,0]], 5))  # Output: 0
```

**Explanation of the Implementation:**
- We use a generator expression `sum(sum(row) for row in grid)` to calculate the total amount of water in the grid.
- We then calculate the number of bucket uses required using `math.ceil(total_water / capacity)`, which ensures that any leftover water that doesn't fill a complete bucket still requires an additional lowering of the bucket.
- Finally, we return the calculated number of bucket uses.
