To solve the problem of determining how many times we need to lower the buckets to empty the wells, we can break down the problem into the following steps:

1. **Understand the Grid Structure**: The grid is a 2D list where each sublist represents a well. Each element in the sublist is either 0 or 1, where 1 represents a unit of water.

2. **Calculate Total Water Units**: We need to count the total number of 1s in the grid, as each 1 represents a unit of water that needs to be removed.

3. **Determine Bucket Lowerings**: Given the bucket capacity, we need to determine how many times we need to lower the bucket to remove all the water units. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of water units by the bucket capacity and rounding up to account for any remaining water that doesn't fill a full bucket.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Initialize a counter to keep track of the total number of water units.
   - Iterate over each row in the grid and count the number of 1s.
   - Sum these counts to get the total number of water units.
   - Calculate the number of bucket lowerings required using the formula: `ceil(total_water_units / bucket_capacity)`.
   - Return the calculated number of bucket lowerings.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the grid is empty or contains only 0s, the output should be 0 since there is no water to remove.
   - If the bucket capacity is greater than or equal to the total water units, only one lowering is needed.

Now, let's implement the solution:

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    
    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of water units in the grid
    total_water_units = 0
    for row in grid:
        total_water_units += sum(row)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the number of times we need to lower the bucket
    # We use math.ceil to ensure we round up when there's a remainder
    bucket_lowerings = math.ceil(total_water_units / capacity)
    
    return bucket_lowerings

# Test cases
print(max_fill([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 1))  # Output: 6
print(max_fill([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2))  # Output: 5
print(max_fill([[0,0,0], [0,0,0]], 5))  # Output: 0
```

This implementation follows the outlined approach and handles the problem requirements and constraints effectively.
