==================================================

To solve the problem of determining whether a string of brackets is correctly bracketed, we need to ensure that every opening bracket '(' has a corresponding closing bracket ')'. This means that at no point in the string should there be more closing brackets than opening brackets, and by the end of the string, the number of opening and closing brackets should be equal.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialize a Counter**: We'll use a counter to keep track of the balance between opening and closing brackets. Let's call this counter `balance`.

2. **Iterate Through the String**: We'll iterate through each character in the string:
   - If the character is '(', we'll increment the `balance` by 1.
   - If the character is ')', we'll decrement the `balance` by 1.

3. **Check for Imbalance**: During the iteration, if at any point the `balance` becomes negative, it means there are more closing brackets than opening brackets up to that point, which is incorrect bracketing. In such a case, we can immediately return `False`.

4. **Final Check**: After iterating through the entire string, if the `balance` is not zero, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so we should return `False`. If the `balance` is zero, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and we return `True`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently check the string in a single pass with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.

Now, let's implement the function:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        elif char == ')':
            balance -= 1
        
        # If balance is negative, there are more closing brackets than opening ones
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    
    # If balance is not zero, there are unmatched opening brackets
    return balance == 0
```

This function will correctly determine if the input string of brackets is properly balanced according to the rules outlined.
