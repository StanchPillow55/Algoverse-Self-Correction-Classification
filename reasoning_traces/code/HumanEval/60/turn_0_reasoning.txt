To solve the problem of summing numbers from 1 to \( n \), we can use a mathematical approach that leverages the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers can be calculated using the formula:

\[ S = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \]

This formula is derived from the observation that if you list the numbers from 1 to \( n \) and then reverse them, pairing each number from the start with a number from the end, each pair sums to \( n + 1 \). For example, with \( n = 5 \):

- Pair 1: \( 1 + 5 = 6 \)
- Pair 2: \( 2 + 4 = 6 \)
- Middle number: \( 3 \)

Since there are \( n \) numbers, there are \( \frac{n}{2} \) pairs if \( n \) is even, or \( \frac{n-1}{2} \) pairs plus the middle number if \( n \) is odd. However, the formula \( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \) works for both even and odd \( n \).

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to sum all integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Choose the Method**: Instead of using a loop to iterate through each number and sum them, we can use the arithmetic series formula to compute the sum directly.

3. **Implement the Formula**: The formula \( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \) gives us the sum directly.

4. **Consider Edge Cases**: The smallest possible input is \( n = 1 \), which should return 1. The formula handles this correctly as \( \frac{1 \times (1 + 1)}{2} = 1 \).

5. **Implement the Function**: Write a Python function that takes an integer \( n \) and returns the sum using the formula.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int) -> int:
    """sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
    >>> sum_to_n(30)
    465
    >>> sum_to_n(100)
    5050
    >>> sum_to_n(5)
    15
    >>> sum_to_n(10)
    55
    >>> sum_to_n(1)
    1
    """
    return n * (n + 1) // 2

# Test cases
print(sum_to_n(30))  # Expected output: 465
print(sum_to_n(100)) # Expected output: 5050
print(sum_to_n(5))   # Expected output: 15
print(sum_to_n(10))  # Expected output: 55
print(sum_to_n(1))   # Expected output: 1
```

### Explanation:

- **Formula Usage**: The function uses the formula \( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \) to compute the sum efficiently.
- **Integer Division**: We use `//` for integer division to ensure the result is an integer, which is necessary since the sum of integers should be an integer.
- **Efficiency**: This approach is efficient with a time complexity of \( O(1) \), as it computes the result in constant time without iteration.
