To solve the problem of counting the number of prime hexadecimal digits in a given string, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand Hexadecimal Digits**: Hexadecimal numbers use the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F. Each of these represents a value from 0 to 15.

2. **Identify Prime Numbers**: In the context of hexadecimal digits, we need to identify which of these digits correspond to prime numbers. The prime numbers less than 16 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. In hexadecimal, these correspond to:
   - 2 (decimal 2)
   - 3 (decimal 3)
   - 5 (decimal 5)
   - 7 (decimal 7)
   - B (decimal 11)
   - D (decimal 13)

3. **Plan the Function**:
   - The function will take a string `num` as input.
   - We will iterate over each character in the string.
   - For each character, we will check if it is one of the prime hexadecimal digits.
   - We will maintain a count of how many prime digits we encounter.
   - Finally, we will return this count.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the input string is empty, the function should return 0 since there are no digits to check.

5. **Implementation**:
   - We will use a set to store the prime hexadecimal digits for quick lookup.
   - We will iterate over the string, checking each character against the set.
   - We will increment a counter for each prime digit found.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def hex_key(num):
    """Counts the number of prime hexadecimal digits in the input string."""
    # Set of prime hexadecimal digits
    prime_hex_digits = {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}
    
    # Initialize a counter for prime digits
    prime_count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in num:
        # Check if the character is a prime hexadecimal digit
        if char in prime_hex_digits:
            prime_count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of prime digits
    return prime_count

# Test cases
print(hex_key("AB"))        # Output: 1
print(hex_key("1077E"))     # Output: 2
print(hex_key("ABED1A33"))  # Output: 4
print(hex_key("123456789ABCDEF0"))  # Output: 6
print(hex_key("2020"))      # Output: 2
```

This function efficiently counts the number of prime hexadecimal digits by leveraging a set for constant-time membership checks. It handles the input as specified, including the case of an empty string, and returns the correct count of prime digits.
