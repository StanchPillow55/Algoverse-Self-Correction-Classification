==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to map a list of GPA scores to their corresponding letter grades based on the given grading scale. The task involves iterating over each GPA in the input list and determining the appropriate letter grade using the provided criteria.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Grading Scale**: 
   - We have a mapping from GPA scores to letter grades. The mapping is defined by specific thresholds. For example, a GPA of 4.0 maps to 'A+', a GPA greater than 3.7 maps to 'A', and so on.

2. **Iterate Over the GPA List**:
   - We need to process each GPA in the input list and determine its corresponding letter grade.

3. **Determine the Letter Grade**:
   - For each GPA, we will compare it against the thresholds in descending order. This ensures that we find the highest applicable grade.
   - Start by checking if the GPA is exactly 4.0, which corresponds to 'A+'.
   - Then, check if the GPA is greater than 3.7 for 'A', greater than 3.3 for 'A-', and so on, down to checking if the GPA is exactly 0.0 for 'E'.

4. **Store the Results**:
   - For each GPA, once the corresponding letter grade is determined, store it in a result list.

5. **Return the Result List**:
   - After processing all GPAs, return the list of letter grades.

### Implementation:

Let's implement the function `numerical_letter_grade` based on the above reasoning:

```python
def numerical_letter_grade(grades):
    """Convert a list of GPAs to their corresponding letter grades."""
    # Define the mapping from GPA to letter grades
    grade_mapping = [
        (4.0, 'A+'),
        (3.7, 'A'),
        (3.3, 'A-'),
        (3.0, 'B+'),
        (2.7, 'B'),
        (2.3, 'B-'),
        (2.0, 'C+'),
        (1.7, 'C'),
        (1.3, 'C-'),
        (1.0, 'D+'),
        (0.7, 'D'),
        (0.0, 'E')
    ]
    
    # Result list to store the letter grades
    letter_grades = []
    
    # Iterate over each GPA in the input list
    for gpa in grades:
        # Determine the letter grade for the current GPA
        for threshold, letter in grade_mapping:
            if gpa >= threshold:
                letter_grades.append(letter)
                break
    
    return letter_grades

# Example usage:
print(numerical_letter_grade([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]))  # Output: ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']
```

### Explanation:

- We define a list `grade_mapping` that contains tuples of GPA thresholds and their corresponding letter grades, ordered from highest to lowest.
- For each GPA in the input list, we iterate over the `grade_mapping` and find the first threshold that the GPA meets or exceeds. This gives us the correct letter grade.
- We append the determined letter grade to the `letter_grades` list.
- Finally, we return the `letter_grades` list containing the letter grades for all input GPAs.
