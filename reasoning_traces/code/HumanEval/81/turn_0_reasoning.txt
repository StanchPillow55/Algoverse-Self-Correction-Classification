To solve the problem of converting GPAs to letter grades based on the provided grading scale, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here's how we can think through the problem step by step:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Input and Output:**
   - **Input:** A list of GPAs (floating-point numbers).
   - **Output:** A list of corresponding letter grades (strings).

2. **Analyze the Grading Scale:**
   - The grading scale is defined by specific GPA thresholds that map to letter grades.
   - The scale is hierarchical, meaning that a GPA is compared against thresholds in descending order to determine the appropriate letter grade.

3. **Approach to Solution:**
   - For each GPA in the input list, we need to determine the corresponding letter grade.
   - We will iterate over the list of GPAs and for each GPA, compare it against the thresholds in descending order.
   - Once a GPA meets a condition (i.e., is greater than a threshold), we assign the corresponding letter grade and move to the next GPA.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - We can use a list of tuples to store the GPA thresholds and their corresponding letter grades. This allows us to iterate over them easily.
   - We will iterate through the list of GPAs and for each GPA, iterate through the list of thresholds to find the correct letter grade.
   - We will append the determined letter grade to the result list.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure that the function handles edge cases such as the minimum GPA (0.0) and maximum GPA (4.0) correctly.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def numerical_letter_grade(grades):
    # Define the GPA thresholds and corresponding letter grades
    gpa_to_letter = [
        (4.0, 'A+'),
        (3.7, 'A'),
        (3.3, 'A-'),
        (3.0, 'B+'),
        (2.7, 'B'),
        (2.3, 'B-'),
        (2.0, 'C+'),
        (1.7, 'C'),
        (1.3, 'C-'),
        (1.0, 'D+'),
        (0.7, 'D'),
        (0.0, 'D-'),
    ]
    
    # List to store the resulting letter grades
    letter_grades = []
    
    # Iterate over each GPA in the input list
    for gpa in grades:
        # Determine the letter grade for each GPA
        for threshold, letter in gpa_to_letter:
            if gpa >= threshold:
                letter_grades.append(letter)
                break
    
    return letter_grades

# Example usage:
print(numerical_letter_grade([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]))  # Output: ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']
```

### Explanation:

- We defined a list `gpa_to_letter` containing tuples of GPA thresholds and their corresponding letter grades.
- For each GPA in the input list, we iterate through `gpa_to_letter` and check if the GPA is greater than or equal to the threshold.
- Once a matching threshold is found, we append the corresponding letter grade to `letter_grades` and break out of the inner loop.
- Finally, we return the list of letter grades. 

This approach ensures that each GPA is correctly mapped to its respective letter grade according to the specified grading scale.
