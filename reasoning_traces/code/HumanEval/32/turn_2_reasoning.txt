To solve the problem of finding a zero of a polynomial given its coefficients, we need to understand the nature of polynomials and how their roots can be found. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Problem Understanding

1. **Polynomial Representation**: 
   - A polynomial can be represented as \( f(x) = a_0 + a_1 \cdot x + a_2 \cdot x^2 + \ldots + a_n \cdot x^n \).
   - The coefficients of the polynomial are given in a list `xs`, where `xs[i]` is the coefficient for \( x^i \).

2. **Objective**:
   - We need to find a value of \( x \) such that the polynomial evaluates to zero, i.e., \( f(x) = 0 \).

3. **Constraints**:
   - The list `xs` has an even number of coefficients.
   - The largest non-zero coefficient guarantees a solution.

### Approach

1. **Polynomial Evaluation**:
   - We already have a function `poly(xs, x)` that evaluates the polynomial at a given \( x \).

2. **Finding a Root**:
   - For polynomials of degree 1 (linear), the root can be found directly using algebra.
   - For higher-degree polynomials, numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or the bisection method can be used.
   - Given the constraints, we can assume that the polynomial has at least one real root.

3. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Use the Newton-Raphson method, which is an iterative method to find successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.
   - The method requires the derivative of the polynomial, which can be computed from the coefficients.

### Implementation

1. **Derivative Calculation**:
   - The derivative of the polynomial \( f(x) = a_0 + a_1 \cdot x + a_2 \cdot x^2 + \ldots + a_n \cdot x^n \) is \( f'(x) = a_1 + 2 \cdot a_2 \cdot x + \ldots + n \cdot a_n \cdot x^{n-1} \).

2. **Newton-Raphson Method**:
   - Start with an initial guess \( x_0 \).
   - Iterate using the formula: \( x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \).
   - Stop when the change is smaller than a tolerance level or after a maximum number of iterations.

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def poly_derivative(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates the derivative of the polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    """
    return sum([i * coeff * math.pow(x, i - 1) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs) if i > 0])

def find_zero(xs: list, tolerance=1e-7, max_iterations=1000):
    """
    Finds a zero of the polynomial with coefficients xs.
    """
    x = 0.0  # Initial guess
    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        fx = poly(xs, x)
        f_prime_x = poly_derivative(xs, x)
        if abs(f_prime_x) < tolerance:  # Avoid division by zero
            break
        x_new = x - fx / f_prime_x
        if abs(x_new - x) < tolerance:
            return x_new
        x = x_new
    return x

# Example usage:
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # Should output -0.5
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # Should output 1.0
```

### Explanation

- **poly**: Evaluates the polynomial at a given \( x \).
- **poly_derivative**: Computes the derivative of the polynomial at a given \( x \).
- **find_zero**: Uses the Newton-Raphson method to find a root of the polynomial. It iteratively updates the guess for the root until the change is smaller than a specified tolerance or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

This approach should efficiently find a zero of the polynomial given the constraints and assumptions.
