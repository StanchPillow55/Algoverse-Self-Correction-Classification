==================================================

To solve the problem of finding a zero of a polynomial given its coefficients, we need to understand the nature of polynomials and how to find their roots. The problem specifies that the list of coefficients will have an even number of elements and the largest non-zero coefficient, which guarantees a solution. This suggests that the polynomial is non-trivial and has at least one real root.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Understanding the Polynomial**: 
   - The polynomial is represented by its coefficients in a list `xs`. The polynomial is evaluated as:
     \[
     f(x) = xs[0] + xs[1] \cdot x + xs[2] \cdot x^2 + \ldots + xs[n] \cdot x^n
     \]
   - The function `poly(xs, x)` evaluates this polynomial at a given point `x`.

2. **Finding a Zero**:
   - We need to find a value of `x` such that `f(x) = 0`.
   - The problem constraints ensure that there is at least one real root.

3. **Constraints**:
   - The list `xs` has an even number of coefficients.
   - The largest coefficient is non-zero, ensuring the polynomial is not trivial.

### Approach

To find a root of the polynomial, we can use numerical methods. A common method for finding roots of continuous functions is the **Bisection Method** or **Newton's Method**. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, we'll use the **Newton-Raphson method** for its efficiency and simplicity in implementation.

#### Newton-Raphson Method

- **Initial Guess**: Start with an initial guess `x0`. A simple choice is `x0 = 0`.
- **Iterative Formula**: 
  \[
  x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
  \]
  where \( f'(x) \) is the derivative of the polynomial.
- **Stopping Criteria**: Stop when the change in `x` is smaller than a tolerance level or after a maximum number of iterations.

#### Derivative Calculation

The derivative of the polynomial \( f(x) \) is:
\[
f'(x) = xs[1] + 2 \cdot xs[2] \cdot x + 3 \cdot xs[3] \cdot x^2 + \ldots + n \cdot xs[n] \cdot x^{n-1}
\]

### Implementation

Let's implement the `find_zero` function using the Newton-Raphson method:

```python
def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def poly_derivative(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates the derivative of the polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    """
    return sum([i * coeff * math.pow(x, i - 1) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs) if i > 0])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    Finds a zero of the polynomial with coefficients xs.
    """
    # Initial guess
    x0 = 0.0
    tolerance = 1e-7
    max_iterations = 1000
    
    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        f_x0 = poly(xs, x0)
        f_prime_x0 = poly_derivative(xs, x0)
        
        if f_prime_x0 == 0:
            raise ValueError("Derivative is zero. Newton-Raphson method fails.")
        
        # Newton-Raphson iteration
        x1 = x0 - f_x0 / f_prime_x0
        
        # Check for convergence
        if abs(x1 - x0) < tolerance:
            return x1
        
        x0 = x1
    
    raise ValueError("Failed to converge to a root within the maximum number of iterations.")

# Example usage:
# print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # Should output -0.5
# print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # Should output 1.0
```

### Explanation

- **poly**: Evaluates the polynomial at a given `x`.
- **poly_derivative**: Computes the derivative of the polynomial.
- **find_zero**: Uses the Newton-Raphson method to find a root, iterating until the change in `x` is less than a specified tolerance or a maximum number of iterations is reached. If the derivative is zero, it raises an error as the method cannot proceed.
