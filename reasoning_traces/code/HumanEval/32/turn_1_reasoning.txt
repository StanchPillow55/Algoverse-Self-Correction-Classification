To solve the problem of finding a zero of a polynomial given its coefficients, we need to implement the `find_zero` function. The function `poly` is already provided, which evaluates a polynomial at a given point. Our task is to find a root of the polynomial, i.e., a value of \( x \) such that the polynomial evaluates to zero.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Polynomial Representation**: The polynomial is represented by its coefficients in a list `xs`. For example, the polynomial \( f(x) = 1 + 2x \) is represented as `[1, 2]`.

2. **Root Finding**: We need to find a value of \( x \) such that the polynomial evaluates to zero. This is a root-finding problem.

3. **Constraints**: The problem states that the list of coefficients `xs` will have an even number of coefficients and the largest non-zero coefficient, which guarantees a solution. This implies that the polynomial is of even degree, which means it has at least one real root.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the polynomial \( f(x) = 1 + 2x \), the root is \( x = -0.5 \).
   - For the polynomial \( f(x) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3 \), the root is \( x = 1.0 \).

### Approach

1. **Use Numerical Methods**: Since the polynomial can be of any degree, analytical solutions (like the quadratic formula) are not feasible for higher degrees. We will use a numerical method to find the root.

2. **Newton's Method**: A common numerical method for finding roots is Newton's method, which uses the derivative of the function to iteratively converge to a root. However, implementing the derivative might be cumbersome.

3. **Scipy's Root Finding**: Python's `scipy` library provides robust root-finding algorithms. We can use `scipy.optimize.newton` or `scipy.optimize.root_scalar` to find the root of the polynomial.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Define the polynomial function using the `poly` function.
   - Use `scipy.optimize.root_scalar` with a method like 'brentq' or 'bisect' to find the root. These methods require an interval where the function changes sign, which we can estimate or assume based on the problem constraints.

### Implementation

Let's implement the `find_zero` function using `scipy.optimize.root_scalar`.

```python
import math
from scipy.optimize import root_scalar

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero finds x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only one zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non-zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.
    """
    # Define the polynomial function
    def f(x):
        return poly(xs, x)
    
    # Use root_scalar to find a root
    # We need to provide an interval where the function changes sign
    # For simplicity, let's assume the interval [-10, 10] for finding the root
    result = root_scalar(f, bracket=[-10, 10], method='brentq')
    
    if result.converged:
        return result.root
    else:
        raise ValueError("Root finding did not converge")

# Test cases
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # Expected: -0.5
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # Expected: 1.0
```

### Explanation

- We define the polynomial function `f(x)` using the provided `poly` function.
- We use `root_scalar` with the 'brentq' method, which is a robust method for finding roots in a given interval.
- We assume an interval `[-10, 10]` for simplicity, but this can be adjusted based on specific problem requirements or additional information.
- The function returns the root if the method converges; otherwise, it raises an error.

This approach leverages existing numerical methods to efficiently find a root of the polynomial.
