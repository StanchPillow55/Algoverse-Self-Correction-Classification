To solve the problem of generating all prefixes of a given string, we need to understand what a prefix is. A prefix of a string is any leading contiguous substring of the string. For example, given the string "abc", its prefixes are "a", "ab", and "abc".

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Input and Output:**
   - Input: A single string `string`.
   - Output: A list of strings, where each string is a prefix of the input string, ordered from the shortest to the longest.

2. **Identify the Prefixes:**
   - For a string of length `n`, the prefixes are the substrings from the start of the string up to each character. Specifically, for a string `s`, the prefixes are:
     - `s[0:1]` (first character)
     - `s[0:2]` (first two characters)
     - ...
     - `s[0:n]` (the entire string)

3. **Iterate and Collect Prefixes:**
   - We can use a loop to iterate over the indices of the string and collect these prefixes. For each index `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive), we take the substring `string[0:i]` and add it to our list of prefixes.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - Once we have collected all prefixes, we return the list.

### Implementation:

Let's implement the function `all_prefixes` based on the above reasoning.

```python
from typing import List

def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string """
    prefixes = []
    for i in range(1, len(string) + 1):
        prefixes.append(string[:i])
    return prefixes

# Example usage:
# print(all_prefixes('abc'))  # Output: ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We initialize an empty list `prefixes` to store the prefixes.
- We use a `for` loop to iterate over the range from 1 to `len(string) + 1`. This ensures that we include all possible prefix lengths from 1 to the full length of the string.
- In each iteration, we use slicing `string[:i]` to get the prefix of length `i` and append it to the `prefixes` list.
- Finally, we return the `prefixes` list.

This solution efficiently constructs the list of prefixes in O(n^2) time complexity, where `n` is the length of the input string, due to the slicing operation inside the loop. However, this is optimal for this problem as we need to generate each prefix explicitly.
