To solve the problem, we need to find the largest index `i` in the array `arr` such that the element at index `i` is not greater than or equal to the element at index `i-1`. If no such index exists, we should return `-1`.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given an array `arr` with no duplicate values.
   - We need to find the largest index `i` where `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`.
   - If the array is strictly increasing, we should return `-1`.

2. **Approach**:
   - We will iterate through the array starting from the second element (index 1) to the end.
   - For each element at index `i`, we will compare it with the element at index `i-1`.
   - If `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`, we will update our result to the current index `i`.
   - We continue this process until we reach the end of the array.
   - If we find such an index, we return it. If we complete the loop without finding any such index, we return `-1`.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - We start iterating from index 1 because we need to compare each element with its previous element.
   - We keep track of the largest index where the condition `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` holds.
   - We initialize a variable `result` to `-1` to handle the case where no such index is found.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array has less than 2 elements, it cannot have any such index, so we should return `-1`.
   - If the array is strictly increasing, we should return `-1`.

Now, let's implement the solution:

```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    # Initialize the result to -1, assuming no such index is found
    result = -1
    
    # Iterate through the array starting from the second element
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        # Check if the current element is less than the previous element
        if arr[i] < arr[i-1]:
            # Update the result to the current index
            result = i
    
    # Return the result, which will be -1 if no such index was found
    return result

# Test cases
print(can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5]))  # Output: 3
print(can_arrange([1, 2, 3]))        # Output: -1
```

This implementation efficiently finds the largest index where the condition is met by iterating through the array once, making it an O(n) solution, where n is the length of the array.
