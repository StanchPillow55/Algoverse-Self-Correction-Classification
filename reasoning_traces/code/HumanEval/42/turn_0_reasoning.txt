To solve the problem of incrementing each element in a list by 1, let's break down the steps and reasoning:

### Problem Understanding

We need to create a function `incr_list` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1. The function should work for any list of integers, including an empty list.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Input and Output**: 
   - Input: A list of integers, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - Output: A new list of integers where each element is incremented by 1, e.g., `[2, 3, 4]`.

2. **Iterate Over the List**:
   - We need to iterate over each element in the input list.
   - For each element, add 1 to it.

3. **Create a New List**:
   - As we iterate and increment each element, we should store the result in a new list.
   - This ensures that the original list remains unchanged, which is a good practice unless explicitly required to modify the input.

4. **Return the New List**:
   - After processing all elements, return the new list with incremented values.

### Implementation Approach

- We can use a list comprehension in Python to achieve this in a concise and efficient manner.
- List comprehensions are ideal for transforming lists because they are both readable and performant.

### Implementation

Here's how we can implement the `incr_list` function:

```python
def incr_list(l: list) -> list:
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1.
    
    >>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 3, 4]
    >>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
    """
    # Use a list comprehension to create a new list with each element incremented by 1
    return [x + 1 for x in l]

# Test cases
print(incr_list([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
print(incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]))  # Output: [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
```

### Explanation

- **List Comprehension**: `[x + 1 for x in l]` iterates over each element `x` in the list `l`, adds 1 to it, and collects the result in a new list.
- **Return Statement**: The function returns the newly created list with incremented values.

This solution is efficient and leverages Python's powerful list comprehensions to achieve the desired transformation in a single, readable line of code.
