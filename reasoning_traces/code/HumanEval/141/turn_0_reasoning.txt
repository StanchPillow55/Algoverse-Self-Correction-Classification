To solve the problem of checking if a file name is valid, we need to ensure that the file name meets several specific conditions. Let's break down the problem and think through the solution step by step:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Check for Exactly One Dot:**
   - A valid file name must contain exactly one dot (`.`). This dot separates the file name from its extension.
   - We can use the `str.count()` method to count the number of dots in the file name. If the count is not equal to 1, the file name is invalid.

2. **Split the File Name:**
   - If there is exactly one dot, we can split the file name into two parts: the name and the extension.
   - We can use the `str.split('.')` method to achieve this. It will return a list with two elements if there is exactly one dot.

3. **Check the Substring Before the Dot:**
   - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it must start with a letter from the Latin alphabet (`a-z` or `A-Z`).
   - We can check if the first character of this substring is an alphabet letter using the `str.isalpha()` method.

4. **Check the Substring After the Dot:**
   - The substring after the dot should be one of the following extensions: `txt`, `exe`, or `dll`.
   - We can check if the extension is in a predefined list of valid extensions.

5. **Check for Digits in the File Name:**
   - The file name should not contain more than three digits (`0-9`).
   - We can iterate over the characters in the file name and count the digits using `str.isdigit()`.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function `file_name_check` based on the above reasoning:

```python
def file_name_check(file_name):
    # Check for exactly one dot
    if file_name.count('.') != 1:
        return 'No'
    
    # Split the file name into name and extension
    name, extension = file_name.split('.')
    
    # Check if the name is not empty and starts with a letter
    if not name or not name[0].isalpha():
        return 'No'
    
    # Check if the extension is valid
    valid_extensions = ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    if extension not in valid_extensions:
        return 'No'
    
    # Count the number of digits in the file name
    digit_count = sum(1 for char in file_name if char.isdigit())
    if digit_count > 3:
        return 'No'
    
    # If all checks pass, the file name is valid
    return 'Yes'

# Test cases
print(file_name_check("example.txt"))  # => 'Yes'
print(file_name_check("1example.dll"))  # => 'No'
```

### Explanation of the Implementation

- **Dot Check:** We use `file_name.count('.')` to ensure there is exactly one dot.
- **Splitting:** We split the file name using `file_name.split('.')` to separate the name and extension.
- **Name Validation:** We check if the name is non-empty and starts with a letter using `name[0].isalpha()`.
- **Extension Validation:** We verify if the extension is in the list of valid extensions.
- **Digit Count:** We count the digits using a generator expression and `sum()`. If the count exceeds three, the file name is invalid.
- **Return Result:** If all conditions are satisfied, we return 'Yes'; otherwise, 'No'.

This implementation efficiently checks all the conditions required for a valid file name.
