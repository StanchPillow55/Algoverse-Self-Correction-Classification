To solve the problem of flipping the case of each character in a given string, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert each lowercase letter in the string to its corresponding uppercase letter and each uppercase letter to its corresponding lowercase letter. Non-alphabetic characters should remain unchanged.

2. **Plan the Solution**:
   - We will iterate over each character in the input string.
   - For each character, we will check if it is lowercase or uppercase.
   - If the character is lowercase, we will convert it to uppercase.
   - If the character is uppercase, we will convert it to lowercase.
   - If the character is neither (i.e., a digit, punctuation, or any other non-alphabetic character), we will leave it unchanged.
   - We will accumulate the transformed characters into a new string.

3. **Choose the Right Tools**:
   - Python provides the `str.islower()` and `str.isupper()` methods to check if a character is lowercase or uppercase, respectively.
   - The `str.lower()` and `str.upper()` methods can be used to convert characters to lowercase or uppercase.
   - We can use a list to accumulate the transformed characters and then join them into a single string at the end for efficiency.

4. **Implement the Solution**:
   - We will define a function `flip_case` that takes a string as input.
   - We will iterate over each character in the string, apply the necessary transformations, and accumulate the results.
   - Finally, we will return the transformed string.

Let's implement the solution:

```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    """ For a given string, flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase. """
    # Initialize an empty list to store the transformed characters
    flipped_chars = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in string:
        # Check if the character is lowercase
        if char.islower():
            # Convert to uppercase and add to the list
            flipped_chars.append(char.upper())
        # Check if the character is uppercase
        elif char.isupper():
            # Convert to lowercase and add to the list
            flipped_chars.append(char.lower())
        else:
            # If it's neither, just add the character as is
            flipped_chars.append(char)
    
    # Join the list into a single string and return
    return ''.join(flipped_chars)

# Example usage
print(flip_case('Hello'))  # Output: 'hELLO'
```

**Explanation**:
- We iterate over each character in the input string.
- We use `char.islower()` to check if a character is lowercase and convert it to uppercase using `char.upper()`.
- We use `char.isupper()` to check if a character is uppercase and convert it to lowercase using `char.lower()`.
- Non-alphabetic characters are directly appended to the list without any change.
- Finally, we join the list of characters into a single string and return it.
