To solve the problem of returning sorted unique elements from a list, let's break down the steps and reasoning involved:

### Problem Understanding

We need to create a function `unique(l: list)` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a list of unique elements from `l`, sorted in ascending order. The function should remove duplicates and sort the remaining elements.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Identify Unique Elements**: 
   - We need to remove duplicates from the list. In Python, a straightforward way to get unique elements from a list is to convert the list to a set, as sets inherently do not allow duplicate values.

2. **Sort the Unique Elements**:
   - Once we have a set of unique elements, we need to sort them. Python provides a built-in `sorted()` function that can sort any iterable and return a new sorted list.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, we return the sorted list of unique elements.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function based on the above steps:

```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list
    >>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
    """
    # Step 1: Convert the list to a set to get unique elements
    unique_elements = set(l)
    
    # Step 2: Sort the unique elements
    sorted_unique_elements = sorted(unique_elements)
    
    # Step 3: Return the sorted list of unique elements
    return sorted_unique_elements

# Example usage
print(unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]))  # Output: [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
```

### Explanation

- **Conversion to Set**: `set(l)` takes the list `l` and removes any duplicate elements, resulting in a set of unique elements.
- **Sorting**: `sorted(unique_elements)` takes the set of unique elements and returns a new list that is sorted in ascending order.
- **Return**: The sorted list of unique elements is returned as the final result.

This approach is efficient and leverages Python's built-in data structures and functions to achieve the desired outcome.
