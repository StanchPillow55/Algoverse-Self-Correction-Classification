To solve the problem of finding numbers in a list that do not contain any even digits, we need to break down the task into several steps. Let's go through the thought process step by step:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a list of positive integers.
   - We need to identify numbers that do not contain any even digits (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).
   - The result should be a sorted list of these numbers in increasing order.

2. **Identify Even Digits:**
   - Even digits are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.

3. **Approach:**
   - Iterate through each number in the list.
   - Convert each number to a string to easily access each digit.
   - Check each digit to see if it is an even digit.
   - If a number contains any even digit, it should be excluded from the result.
   - Collect numbers that do not contain any even digits.
   - Sort the resulting list of numbers in increasing order.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - Use a list comprehension to filter out numbers with even digits.
   - Convert each number to a string and check if any digit is in the set of even digits.
   - Use the `sorted()` function to sort the final list of numbers.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the input list is empty, the output should also be an empty list.
   - If all numbers contain even digits, the output should be an empty list.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def unique_digits(x):
    """Given a list of positive integers x, return a sorted list of all 
    elements that haven't any even digit.
    """
    # Define a set of even digits for quick lookup
    even_digits = {'0', '2', '4', '6', '8'}
    
    # Filter numbers that do not contain any even digit
    result = [num for num in x if not any(digit in even_digits for digit in str(num))]
    
    # Return the sorted result
    return sorted(result)

# Example usage:
# print(unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1]))  # Output: [1, 15, 33]
# print(unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10]))  # Output: []
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We define a set `even_digits` containing the characters of even digits for quick membership testing.
- We use a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `x`.
- For each number, we convert it to a string and check each digit to see if it is in `even_digits`.
- If none of the digits are even, the number is included in the `result` list.
- Finally, we sort the `result` list using `sorted()` and return it.

This solution efficiently filters and sorts the numbers as required by the problem statement.
