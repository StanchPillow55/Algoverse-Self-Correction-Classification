To solve the problem of encoding a message by swapping the case of all letters and replacing vowels with the letter that appears two places ahead in the English alphabet, we can break down the task into a series of steps. Let's go through the thought process step by step:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Identify the Vowels**: The vowels in the English alphabet are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (and their uppercase counterparts 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'). We need to replace each of these vowels with the letter that appears two places ahead in the alphabet.

2. **Mapping Vowels to New Characters**: 
   - 'a' -> 'c'
   - 'e' -> 'g'
   - 'i' -> 'k'
   - 'o' -> 'q'
   - 'u' -> 'w'
   - Similarly, for uppercase vowels:
     - 'A' -> 'C'
     - 'E' -> 'G'
     - 'I' -> 'K'
     - 'O' -> 'Q'
     - 'U' -> 'W'

3. **Swap Case**: For each character in the string, if it's a letter, we need to swap its case. This means converting lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa.

4. **Iterate Over the Message**: We need to iterate through each character in the input message, apply the vowel transformation if it's a vowel, and swap its case.

5. **Construct the Result**: As we process each character, we build the resulting encoded message.

### Implementation

With the above steps in mind, we can now implement the function `encode`. Here's how we can do it:

```python
def encode(message):
    # Define the vowel transformation mapping
    vowel_map = {
        'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',
        'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'
    }
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store the transformed characters
    encoded_message = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the message
    for char in message:
        # Check if the character is a vowel and needs transformation
        if char in vowel_map:
            # Replace the vowel with its mapped character
            transformed_char = vowel_map[char]
        else:
            # If not a vowel, just swap the case
            transformed_char = char.swapcase()
        
        # Append the transformed character to the result list
        encoded_message.append(transformed_char)
    
    # Join the list into a string and return the encoded message
    return ''.join(encoded_message)

# Test cases
print(encode('test'))  # Output: 'TGST'
print(encode('This is a message'))  # Output: 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'
```

### Explanation

- We use a dictionary `vowel_map` to store the mapping of vowels to their respective transformed characters.
- We iterate over each character in the input `message`. For each character, we check if it is a vowel using the `vowel_map`. If it is, we replace it with the corresponding character from the map.
- If the character is not a vowel, we simply swap its case using the `swapcase()` method.
- We collect all transformed characters in a list `encoded_message` and finally join them into a single string to return the result.

This approach ensures that we correctly transform vowels and swap the case of all letters in the message.
