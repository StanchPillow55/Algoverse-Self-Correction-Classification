To solve the problem of encoding a message by swapping the case of all letters and replacing vowels with the letter that appears two places ahead in the English alphabet, we can break down the task into a series of steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Vowels and Their Replacements:**
   - The vowels in the English alphabet are: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'.
   - We need to replace each vowel with the letter that appears two places ahead:
     - 'a' -> 'c'
     - 'e' -> 'g'
     - 'i' -> 'k'
     - 'o' -> 'q'
     - 'u' -> 'w'
   - We should consider both lowercase and uppercase vowels:
     - 'A' -> 'C'
     - 'E' -> 'G'
     - 'I' -> 'K'
     - 'O' -> 'Q'
     - 'U' -> 'W'

2. **Swap Case:**
   - For each character in the message, swap its case. This means converting lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa.

3. **Iterate Through the Message:**
   - For each character in the message:
     - If it is a vowel, replace it with the corresponding letter that is two places ahead.
     - Swap the case of the character.

4. **Construct the Encoded Message:**
   - As we process each character, build the encoded message by appending the transformed characters.

5. **Return the Encoded Message:**
   - After processing all characters, return the final encoded message.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function `encode` based on the above reasoning:

```python
def encode(message):
    # Define the vowel replacements
    vowel_replacements = {
        'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',
        'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'
    }
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store the encoded characters
    encoded_message = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the message
    for char in message:
        # Check if the character is a vowel that needs replacement
        if char in vowel_replacements:
            # Replace the vowel and swap its case
            encoded_char = vowel_replacements[char]
        else:
            # If not a vowel, just swap the case
            encoded_char = char.swapcase()
        
        # Append the encoded character to the list
        encoded_message.append(encoded_char)
    
    # Join the list into a string and return it
    return ''.join(encoded_message)

# Test cases
print(encode('test'))  # Expected output: 'TGST'
print(encode('This is a message'))  # Expected output: 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'
```

### Explanation:

- We use a dictionary `vowel_replacements` to map each vowel to its corresponding replacement.
- We iterate through each character in the message, checking if it is a vowel that needs replacement.
- If it is a vowel, we replace it using the dictionary and append the result to `encoded_message`.
- If it is not a vowel, we simply swap its case using the `swapcase()` method and append it.
- Finally, we join the list of characters into a single string and return it as the encoded message.
