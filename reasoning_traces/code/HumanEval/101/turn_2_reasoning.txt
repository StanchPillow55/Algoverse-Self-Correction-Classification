To solve the problem of splitting a string into words, we need to consider the delimiters that separate the words. According to the problem statement, the words in the string are separated by either commas or spaces. Our task is to split the string based on these delimiters and return a list of words.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Input and Output:**
   - Input: A string `s` containing words separated by commas or spaces.
   - Output: A list of words extracted from the string.

2. **Identify Delimiters:**
   - The delimiters in the string are commas (`,`) and spaces (` `).

3. **Splitting Strategy:**
   - We need to split the string based on both commas and spaces. 
   - One approach is to replace commas with spaces and then split the string by spaces. This way, we handle both delimiters in one go.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - Use the `replace()` method to replace all commas in the string with spaces.
   - Use the `split()` method to split the string by spaces. The `split()` method without any arguments will automatically handle multiple spaces and trim leading/trailing spaces.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Strings with multiple consecutive spaces or commas.
   - Strings with leading or trailing spaces or commas.
   - Empty strings or strings with only delimiters.

By following this approach, we can ensure that the function handles various cases of input strings correctly.

### Implementation:

Here is the implementation of the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def words_string(s):
    """
    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
    
    For example:
    words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
    """
    # Replace commas with spaces
    s = s.replace(',', ' ')
    # Split the string by spaces
    words = s.split()
    return words

# Example usage:
print(words_string("Hi, my name is John"))  # Output: ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
print(words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six"))  # Output: ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
```

This implementation should correctly handle the input strings as described in the problem statement.
