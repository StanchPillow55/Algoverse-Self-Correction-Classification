==================================================

To solve the problem of splitting a string into words separated by commas or spaces, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the Input and Output**:
   - Input: A string `s` that contains words separated by commas or spaces.
   - Output: A list of words extracted from the string.

2. **Identify the Delimiters**:
   - The string can be split by two types of delimiters: commas (`,`) and spaces (` `).
   - We need to handle cases where there might be multiple spaces or commas, or a combination of both.

3. **Plan the Approach**:
   - We can use Python's `re` module (regular expressions) to handle multiple delimiters.
   - The `re.split()` function allows us to split a string by a regular expression pattern.
   - The pattern `r'[,\s]+'` will match one or more occurrences of either a comma or any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, etc.).

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Import the `re` module.
   - Use `re.split()` with the pattern `r'[,\s]+'` to split the input string into words.
   - This will handle any combination of spaces and commas, including multiple consecutive delimiters.
   - Return the resulting list of words.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider strings with leading or trailing delimiters.
   - Handle empty strings or strings with only delimiters.

Now, let's implement the function based on this plan:

```python
import re

def words_string(s):
    """
    Splits a string into words separated by commas or spaces and returns a list of words.
    
    Args:
    s (str): The input string containing words separated by commas or spaces.
    
    Returns:
    list: A list of words extracted from the string.
    """
    # Use regular expression to split the string by commas or spaces
    words = re.split(r'[,\s]+', s.strip())
    
    # Filter out any empty strings that may result from leading/trailing delimiters
    return [word for word in words if word]

# Example usage:
print(words_string("Hi, my name is John"))  # Output: ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
print(words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six"))  # Output: ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
```

### Explanation:
- We use `re.split(r'[,\s]+', s.strip())` to split the string `s` into words. The pattern `[,\s]+` matches one or more commas or whitespace characters.
- `s.strip()` is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the string before splitting.
- The list comprehension `[word for word in words if word]` filters out any empty strings that might occur due to leading or trailing delimiters.
- This approach efficiently handles various cases of delimiters and ensures that we get a clean list of words.
