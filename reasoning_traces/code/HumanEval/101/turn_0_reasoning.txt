To solve the problem of splitting a string of words separated by commas or spaces into an array of words, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the Input and Output**:
   - Input: A string `s` containing words separated by commas or spaces.
   - Output: A list of words extracted from the string.

2. **Identify the Delimiters**:
   - The words in the string are separated by either commas or spaces. We need to handle both delimiters.

3. **Splitting Strategy**:
   - Python's `str.split()` method can be used to split a string based on a delimiter. However, it can only handle one delimiter at a time.
   - To handle multiple delimiters, we can use the `re.split()` function from the `re` (regular expressions) module, which allows us to specify a pattern that includes multiple delimiters.

4. **Regular Expression Pattern**:
   - We need a pattern that matches both commas and spaces. The pattern `[,\s]+` can be used:
     - `,` matches a comma.
     - `\s` matches any whitespace character (including spaces, tabs, etc.).
     - The `+` quantifier ensures that one or more occurrences of the delimiters are considered as a single split point.

5. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Import the `re` module.
   - Use `re.split()` with the pattern `[,\s]+` to split the input string into words.
   - Return the resulting list of words.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider strings with leading or trailing delimiters.
   - Handle multiple consecutive delimiters.

Now, let's implement the function:

```python
import re

def words_string(s):
    """
    Splits a string into words based on commas or spaces and returns a list of words.
    
    Parameters:
    s (str): The input string containing words separated by commas or spaces.
    
    Returns:
    list: A list of words extracted from the input string.
    """
    # Use regular expression to split the string by commas or spaces
    words = re.split(r'[,\s]+', s.strip())
    
    # Return the list of words
    return words

# Example usage:
print(words_string("Hi, my name is John"))  # Output: ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
print(words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six"))  # Output: ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
```

### Explanation:
- We use `re.split(r'[,\s]+', s.strip())` to split the string `s`:
  - `r'[,\s]+'` is the regular expression pattern that matches one or more commas or whitespace characters.
  - `s.strip()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the string, ensuring that we don't get empty strings at the start or end of the list if the string starts or ends with delimiters.
- The function returns the list of words obtained from the split operation.
