To solve the problem of finding all prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer `n`, we need to understand what a prime number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Understand the Input and Output:**
   - Input: A non-negative integer `n`.
   - Output: A list of prime numbers less than `n`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n` is 0 or 1, the output should be an empty list because there are no prime numbers less than 2.
   - If `n` is 2, the output should also be an empty list because the only prime number less than 2 is 2 itself, which is not less than 2.

3. **Algorithm to Find Prime Numbers:**
   - We need to check each number less than `n` to see if it is prime.
   - A number `p` is prime if it is greater than 1 and not divisible by any number other than 1 and `p`.
   - To check if a number `p` is prime, we can check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `p`. If `p` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - Initialize an empty list to store prime numbers.
   - Iterate over each number from 2 to `n-1`.
   - For each number, check if it is prime by testing divisibility.
   - If a number is prime, add it to the list.
   - Return the list of prime numbers.

5. **Optimization Considerations:**
   - Checking divisibility up to the square root of a number reduces the number of checks needed, making the algorithm more efficient.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes a non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n."""
    
    def is_prime(num):
        """Helper function to determine if a number is prime."""
        if num <= 1:
            return False
        if num <= 3:
            return True
        if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
            return False
        i = 5
        while i * i <= num:
            if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
                return False
            i += 6
        return True
    
    primes = []
    for number in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(number):
            primes.append(number)
    
    return primes

# Example usage:
print(count_up_to(5))    # Output: [2, 3]
print(count_up_to(11))   # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7]
print(count_up_to(0))    # Output: []
print(count_up_to(20))   # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
print(count_up_to(1))    # Output: []
print(count_up_to(18))   # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
```

### Explanation:
- The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number.
- The main function `count_up_to` iterates through numbers from 2 to `n-1` and collects the primes in a list.
- The function returns the list of prime numbers less than `n`.
