To solve this problem, we need to find the largest even integer within a given range \([x, y]\), inclusive. If no such even integer exists, the function should return \(-1\).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can approach this problem:

1. **Understand the Range**: 
   - The range is defined by two numbers \(x\) and \(y\).
   - The range is inclusive, meaning both \(x\) and \(y\) are part of the range.
   - The range can be in increasing order (e.g., \(x < y\)) or decreasing order (e.g., \(x > y\)).

2. **Identify the Largest Even Number**:
   - If \(x \leq y\), we need to find the largest even number starting from \(y\) down to \(x\).
   - If \(x > y\), the range is invalid for our purpose since we are looking for numbers in increasing order, and we should return \(-1\).

3. **Check for Even Numbers**:
   - An even number is divisible by 2 (i.e., `number % 2 == 0`).
   - Start checking from the largest number in the range (which is \(y\) if \(x \leq y\)) and move downwards.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - If an even number is found, return it.
   - If no even number is found by the time we reach \(x\), return \(-1\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \(x = y\) and both are even, return that number.
   - If \(x = y\) and both are odd, return \(-1\).

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    """This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the
    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If 
    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.
    """
    # Ensure x is the smaller and y is the larger number
    if x > y:
        return -1
    
    # Start from the largest number in the range and move downwards
    for num in range(y, x - 1, -1):
        if num % 2 == 0:
            return num
    
    # If no even number is found, return -1
    return -1

# Example usage:
# choose_num(12, 15) should return 14
# choose_num(13, 12) should return -1
```

This function iterates from \(y\) down to \(x\), checking each number to see if it is even. The first even number found is returned immediately, ensuring it is the largest even number in the range. If no even number is found, the function returns \(-1\).
