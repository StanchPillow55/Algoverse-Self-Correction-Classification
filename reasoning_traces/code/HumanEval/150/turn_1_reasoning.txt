==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine whether a given number `n` is a prime number. Based on this determination, we will return either `x` or `y`. Let's break down the steps needed to implement this solution:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding Prime Numbers**:
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - Examples of prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.
   - Non-prime numbers (composite numbers) have divisors other than 1 and themselves.

2. **Determine if `n` is Prime**:
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not a prime number.
   - If `n` is 2, it is the smallest and only even prime number.
   - For numbers greater than 2, check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.

3. **Return the Appropriate Value**:
   - If `n` is determined to be prime, return `x`.
   - Otherwise, return `y`.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function `x_or_y` using the above logic:

```python
def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    """A simple program which should return the value of x if n is 
    a prime number and should return the value of y otherwise.
    """
    def is_prime(num):
        if num <= 1:
            return False
        if num == 2:
            return True
        if num % 2 == 0:
            return False
        for i in range(3, int(num**0.5) + 1, 2):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    if is_prime(n):
        return x
    else:
        return y

# Example usage:
print(x_or_y(7, 34, 12))  # Output: 34
print(x_or_y(15, 8, 5))   # Output: 5
```

### Explanation

- **`is_prime` Function**: This helper function checks if a number is prime. It handles edge cases like numbers less than or equal to 1 and the special case of 2. For other numbers, it checks divisibility from 3 up to the square root of the number, skipping even numbers.
- **Main Function Logic**: The main function `x_or_y` uses the `is_prime` function to determine if `n` is prime and returns `x` if true, otherwise `y`.

This solution efficiently determines the primality of `n` and returns the correct value based on the problem's requirements.
