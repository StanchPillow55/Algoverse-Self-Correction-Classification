To solve the problem of counting vowels in a given string, we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Vowels**: The vowels we need to count are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. Additionally, 'y' is considered a vowel only if it appears at the end of the word.

2. **Case Insensitivity**: The function should be case-insensitive, meaning it should count both uppercase and lowercase vowels.

3. **Iterate Through the String**: We need to iterate through each character in the string to check if it is a vowel.

4. **Special Case for 'y'**: We need to check if 'y' is at the end of the string and count it as a vowel only in that case.

5. **Return the Count**: Finally, return the total count of vowels found in the string.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Convert the String to Lowercase**: This will simplify the comparison since we won't need to check for both uppercase and lowercase vowels separately.

2. **Initialize a Vowel Set**: Create a set of vowels `{'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}` for quick lookup.

3. **Initialize a Counter**: Start a counter at zero to keep track of the number of vowels.

4. **Iterate Over the String**: For each character in the string:
   - Check if the character is in the vowel set and increment the counter if it is.
   - If the character is 'y', check if it is the last character in the string. If so, increment the counter.

5. **Return the Counter**: After iterating through the string, return the counter value.

### Implementation:

Let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def vowels_count(s):
    """Write a function vowels_count which takes a string representing
    a word as input and returns the number of vowels in the string.
    Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. Here, 'y' is also a
    vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.
    """
    # Convert the string to lowercase to handle case insensitivity
    s = s.lower()
    
    # Define the set of vowels
    vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
    
    # Initialize the vowel count
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        # Check if the character is a vowel
        if char in vowels:
            count += 1
        # Check if 'y' is at the end of the string
        elif char == 'y' and i == len(s) - 1:
            count += 1
    
    return count

# Test cases
print(vowels_count("abcde"))  # Expected output: 2
print(vowels_count("ACEDY"))  # Expected output: 3
print(vowels_count("sky"))    # Expected output: 1
print(vowels_count("rhythm")) # Expected output: 0
print(vowels_count("Y"))      # Expected output: 1
print(vowels_count("AEIOUY")) # Expected output: 6
```

### Additional Test Cases:

1. **"sky"**: The word "sky" should return 1 because 'y' is at the end.
2. **"rhythm"**: The word "rhythm" should return 0 because 'y' is not at the end.
3. **"Y"**: A single 'Y' should return 1 because it is at the end.
4. **"AEIOUY"**: All vowels including 'y' at the end should return 6.

These test cases ensure that the function handles various scenarios, including the special case for 'y'.
