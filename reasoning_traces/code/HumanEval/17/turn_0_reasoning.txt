==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to parse a string representing musical notes and convert it into a list of integers that represent the duration of each note in beats. The string uses a specific ASCII format to denote different types of notes, and each type of note corresponds to a specific number of beats:

1. `'o'` represents a whole note, which lasts 4 beats.
2. `'o|'` represents a half note, which lasts 2 beats.
3. `'.|'` represents a quarter note, which lasts 1 beat.

### Approach:

1. **Split the Input String**: The input string contains notes separated by spaces. We will split the string by spaces to get a list of note representations.

2. **Map Note Representations to Beats**: We will create a mapping from note representations to their corresponding beat values:
   - `'o'` maps to 4
   - `'o|'` maps to 2
   - `'.|'` maps to 1

3. **Parse the Notes**: Iterate over the list of note representations obtained from the split operation. For each note, use the mapping to determine the number of beats it represents.

4. **Collect the Results**: Store the beat values in a list and return this list as the final result.

### Implementation:

Let's implement the function `parse_music` based on the above approach.

```python
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """ Input to this function is a string representing musical notes in a special ASCII format.
    Your task is to parse this string and return list of integers corresponding to how many beats does each
    note last.

    Here is a legend:
    'o' - whole note, lasts four beats
    'o|' - half note, lasts two beats
    '.|' - quarter note, lasts one beat

    >>> parse_music('o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o')
    [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]
    """
    # Split the input string by spaces to get individual note representations
    notes = music_string.split()
    
    # Define a mapping from note representations to their beat values
    note_to_beats = {
        'o': 4,
        'o|': 2,
        '.|': 1
    }
    
    # Parse the notes and convert them to their corresponding beat values
    beats = [note_to_beats[note] for note in notes]
    
    return beats

# Example usage
print(parse_music('o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o'))  # Output: [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]
```

### Explanation:

- **Splitting the String**: We use `split()` to break the input string into a list of note representations.
- **Mapping Notes to Beats**: We use a dictionary `note_to_beats` to map each note representation to its corresponding beat value.
- **List Comprehension**: We use a list comprehension to iterate over each note in the list, look up its beat value using the dictionary, and collect these values into a new list.
- **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the list of beat values.
