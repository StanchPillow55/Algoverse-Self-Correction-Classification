To solve the problem of generating a sorted list of odd numbers from the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer \( n \), let's break down the task step by step:

### Understanding the Collatz Sequence

1. **Definition**: 
   - Start with any positive integer \( n \).
   - If the number is even, divide it by 2.
   - If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
   - Repeat the process with the new number.
   - The sequence ends when it reaches 1.

2. **Objective**:
   - Generate the Collatz sequence for the given \( n \).
   - Extract only the odd numbers from this sequence.
   - Return these odd numbers in a sorted list.

### Approach

1. **Initialize**:
   - Start with the given number \( n \).
   - Create an empty list to store odd numbers.

2. **Generate the Collatz Sequence**:
   - Use a loop to generate the sequence until \( n \) becomes 1.
   - In each iteration:
     - Check if the current number \( n \) is odd.
     - If it is odd, add it to the list of odd numbers.
     - Update \( n \) according to the Collatz rules:
       - If \( n \) is even, divide it by 2.
       - If \( n \) is odd, calculate \( 3n + 1 \).

3. **Sorting**:
   - Once the sequence reaches 1, ensure that 1 is included in the list of odd numbers.
   - Sort the list of odd numbers.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the sorted list of odd numbers.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above plan:

```python
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence.
    """
    # List to store odd numbers in the Collatz sequence
    odd_numbers = []
    
    # Generate the Collatz sequence
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 1:  # Check if n is odd
            odd_numbers.append(n)
        # Update n according to the Collatz rules
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 1
    
    # Add 1 to the list since the sequence always ends at 1
    odd_numbers.append(1)
    
    # Return the sorted list of odd numbers
    return sorted(odd_numbers)

# Example usage:
print(get_odd_collatz(5))  # Output should be [1, 5]
```

### Explanation

- **Loop**: The loop continues until \( n \) becomes 1. This ensures that we cover the entire sequence.
- **Odd Check**: We check if \( n \) is odd using `n % 2 == 1` and append it to the list if true.
- **Collatz Update**: Depending on whether \( n \) is even or odd, we update \( n \) using the appropriate rule.
- **Final Step**: Since the sequence always ends at 1, we append 1 to the list of odd numbers before sorting and returning it.

This implementation efficiently generates the required list of odd numbers in the Collatz sequence and returns them sorted.
