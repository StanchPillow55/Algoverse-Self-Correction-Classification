To solve the problem of determining if a string of square brackets contains a valid subsequence where at least one bracket is nested, we need to understand the concept of nested brackets. A bracket is considered nested if it is enclosed within another pair of brackets. For example, in the string `[[]]`, the inner `[]` is nested within the outer `[]`.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understanding Valid Subsequences**:
   - A valid subsequence of brackets is one where every opening bracket `[` has a corresponding closing bracket `]` that comes after it.
   - A nested bracket implies that there is at least one pair of brackets within another pair.

2. **Using a Stack for Validation**:
   - A common approach to check for valid bracket sequences is to use a stack data structure.
   - As we iterate through the string, we push an opening bracket `[` onto the stack.
   - When we encounter a closing bracket `]`, we check if there is a corresponding opening bracket `[` on the stack. If there is, we pop the stack, indicating a matched pair.

3. **Checking for Nested Brackets**:
   - To determine if there is nesting, we need to check if there is a point where the stack has more than one opening bracket `[` before encountering a closing bracket `]`.
   - This would indicate that there is an inner bracket sequence that is nested within an outer one.

4. **Implementation**:
   - We will iterate over the string and use a stack to track opening brackets.
   - We will maintain a flag `nested` to indicate if we have encountered a nested structure.
   - If at any point the stack size is greater than 1 when we encounter a closing bracket `]`, we set the `nested` flag to `True`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Strings with no brackets or only closing brackets should return `False`.
   - Strings with only opening brackets should also return `False`.

Here's the implementation based on the above reasoning:

```python
def is_nested(string):
    stack = []
    nested = False
    
    for char in string:
        if char == '[':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ']':
            if stack:
                stack.pop()
                # Check if there was nesting
                if len(stack) > 0:
                    nested = True
            else:
                # More closing brackets than opening ones
                return False
    
    # If stack is empty and we found nesting, return True
    return nested

# Test cases
print(is_nested('[[]]'))          # ➞ True
print(is_nested('[]]]]]]][[[[[]')) # ➞ False
print(is_nested('[][]'))          # ➞ False
print(is_nested('[]'))            # ➞ False
print(is_nested('[[][]]'))        # ➞ True
print(is_nested('[[]][['))        # ➞ True
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We use a stack to keep track of unmatched opening brackets.
- We iterate through each character in the string:
  - If it's an opening bracket `[`, we push it onto the stack.
  - If it's a closing bracket `]`, we check if there is a corresponding opening bracket in the stack:
    - If the stack is not empty, we pop the stack (indicating a matched pair).
    - If the stack size was greater than 1 before popping, it means we have a nested structure, so we set `nested` to `True`.
- After processing the string, if the stack is empty and `nested` is `True`, it means we have a valid nested structure, so we return `True`.
- If the stack is not empty or `nested` is `False`, we return `False`.
