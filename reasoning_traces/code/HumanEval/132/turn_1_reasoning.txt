==================================================

To solve the problem of determining if a string of square brackets contains a valid nested subsequence, we need to understand what "nested" means in this context. A nested subsequence is one where at least one pair of brackets is properly enclosed within another pair. For example, in the string "[[]]", the inner "[]" is nested within the outer "[]".

### Approach:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a string consisting only of square brackets: '[' and ']'.
   - We need to determine if there is at least one nested pair of brackets.

2. **Valid Nested Sequence:**
   - A valid nested sequence means that there is at least one pair of brackets that is enclosed within another pair.
   - For example, in "[[]]", the inner "[]" is nested within the outer "[]".

3. **Using a Stack:**
   - A common approach to solving problems involving nested structures is to use a stack.
   - We can traverse the string and use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets '['.
   - When we encounter a closing bracket ']', we check if there is a corresponding opening bracket '[' in the stack.
   - If there is, we pop the stack, indicating that we have found a matching pair.
   - If the stack is not empty after popping, it means there was an opening bracket before this pair, indicating a nested structure.

4. **Algorithm:**
   - Initialize an empty stack.
   - Traverse each character in the string:
     - If the character is '[', push it onto the stack.
     - If the character is ']', check if the stack is not empty:
       - If the stack is not empty, pop the stack.
       - After popping, if the stack is still not empty, return `True` (indicating a nested structure).
   - If we finish traversing the string without finding a nested structure, return `False`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Strings with no brackets or only one type of bracket (e.g., "]]]]") should return `False`.
   - Strings with no nesting, like "[][]", should also return `False`.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
def is_nested(string):
    stack = []
    
    for char in string:
        if char == '[':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ']':
            if stack:
                stack.pop()
                # After popping, if the stack is not empty, it means there was an opening bracket
                # before this pair, indicating a nested structure.
                if stack:
                    return True
    
    return False

# Test cases
print(is_nested('[[]]'))        # ➞ True
print(is_nested('[]]]]]]][[[[[]'))  # ➞ False
print(is_nested('[][]'))        # ➞ False
print(is_nested('[]'))          # ➞ False
print(is_nested('[[][]]'))      # ➞ True
print(is_nested('[[]][['))      # ➞ True
```

This implementation uses a stack to track the opening brackets and checks for nested structures by ensuring that after finding a matching pair, there is still an unmatched opening bracket left in the stack. This indicates that the matched pair was nested within another pair.
