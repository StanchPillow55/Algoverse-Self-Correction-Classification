==================================================

To solve the problem of determining if a string of square brackets contains a valid subsequence where at least one bracket is nested, we need to understand the concept of nested brackets. A bracket is considered nested if it is enclosed within another pair of brackets. For example, in the string "[[]]", the inner brackets "[]" are nested within the outer brackets.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to approach this problem:

1. **Understanding Nested Brackets**: 
   - A nested bracket sequence requires at least one opening bracket '[' to be followed by another opening bracket '[' before encountering a closing bracket ']'. This ensures that there is a nested structure.
   - For example, in "[[]]", the first '[' is followed by another '[', indicating a nested structure.

2. **Using a Stack for Validation**:
   - A common approach to validate nested structures is using a stack. The stack helps keep track of opening brackets and ensures they are properly closed.
   - As we iterate through the string, we push each opening bracket '[' onto the stack.
   - When we encounter a closing bracket ']', we check if there is a corresponding opening bracket '[' on the stack to match it.

3. **Checking for Nested Structure**:
   - While iterating through the string, if we encounter a closing bracket ']' and the stack is not empty, it indicates that there is at least one opening bracket '[' that has not been closed yet, which means a nested structure exists.
   - We can immediately return `True` upon finding such a nested structure.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is empty or contains only closing brackets, it cannot have a nested structure.
   - If the string contains only opening brackets, it also cannot have a nested structure.

5. **Implementation**:
   - We will iterate through the string, use a stack to track opening brackets, and check for nested structures as described.

Here's the implementation of the `is_nested` function:

```python
def is_nested(string):
    stack = []
    
    for char in string:
        if char == '[':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ']':
            if stack:
                # Found a closing bracket with an unmatched opening bracket
                return True
            else:
                # No opening bracket to match with
                continue
    
    # If we finish the loop without finding a nested structure
    return False

# Test cases
print(is_nested('[[]]'))        # ➞ True
print(is_nested('[]]]]]]][[[[[]'))  # ➞ False
print(is_nested('[][]'))        # ➞ False
print(is_nested('[]'))          # ➞ False
print(is_nested('[[][]]'))      # ➞ True
print(is_nested('[[]][['))      # ➞ True
```

This function uses a stack to track opening brackets and checks for the presence of a nested structure by ensuring that there is at least one unmatched opening bracket when a closing bracket is encountered. If such a condition is met, it returns `True`, indicating a nested structure. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
