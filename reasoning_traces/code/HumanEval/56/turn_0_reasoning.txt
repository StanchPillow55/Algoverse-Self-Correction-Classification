==================================================

To solve the problem of determining if a string of brackets is correctly bracketed, we need to ensure that every opening bracket `<` has a corresponding closing bracket `>`. This is a common problem related to checking balanced parentheses, and we can solve it using a simple counter approach.

### Thought Process

1. **Initialization**: 
   - We will use a counter to keep track of the number of unmatched opening brackets `<`.
   - Initialize the counter to zero.

2. **Iterate through the string**:
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is an opening bracket `<`, increment the counter.
     - If the character is a closing bracket `>`:
       - Check if the counter is greater than zero (indicating there is an unmatched opening bracket available to match with this closing bracket). If so, decrement the counter.
       - If the counter is zero, it means there is a closing bracket without a preceding unmatched opening bracket, so the string is incorrectly bracketed, and we should return `False`.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After processing all characters, check if the counter is zero.
   - If the counter is zero, it means all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets, so return `True`.
   - If the counter is not zero, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so return `False`.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function `correct_bracketing` based on the above reasoning:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """ brackets is a string of "<" and ">".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
    """
    counter = 0
    
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            counter += 1
        elif char == '>':
            if counter > 0:
                counter -= 1
            else:
                return False
    
    return counter == 0

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing("<"))        # Expected: False
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))       # Expected: True
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))   # Expected: True
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))     # Expected: False
```

### Explanation

- The function initializes a counter to zero.
- It iterates over each character in the input string.
- It adjusts the counter based on whether the character is an opening or closing bracket.
- If a closing bracket is encountered without a matching opening bracket (i.e., the counter is zero), the function returns `False`.
- After the loop, if the counter is zero, it returns `True`, indicating all brackets are correctly matched. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
