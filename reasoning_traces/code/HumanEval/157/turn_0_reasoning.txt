To determine if three given sides form a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. According to the theorem, in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

1. **Identify the Hypotenuse**: 
   - The hypotenuse is the longest side of the triangle. Given three sides `a`, `b`, and `c`, we need to identify which one is the largest. Let's assume `c` is the largest side. If `c` is indeed the largest, then `c` should be the hypotenuse.

2. **Check the Pythagorean Theorem**:
   - For the sides to form a right-angled triangle, the Pythagorean theorem must hold true: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
   - However, since any of the three sides could potentially be the hypotenuse, we need to check all permutations:
     - Check if \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \)
     - Check if \( a^2 + c^2 = b^2 \)
     - Check if \( b^2 + c^2 = a^2 \)

3. **Return the Result**:
   - If any of the above conditions hold true, return `True`, indicating that the sides form a right-angled triangle.
   - If none of the conditions are satisfied, return `False`.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Sort the sides to easily identify the largest side
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    # The largest side should be the hypotenuse
    hypotenuse = sides[2]
    # The other two sides
    side1 = sides[0]
    side2 = sides[1]
    
    # Check the Pythagorean theorem
    return side1**2 + side2**2 == hypotenuse**2

# Example usage:
print(right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5))  # True
print(right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3))  # False
```

### Explanation:
- We first sort the sides to easily identify the largest side, which we assume to be the hypotenuse.
- We then check if the sum of the squares of the two smaller sides equals the square of the largest side.
- If the condition holds true, the sides form a right-angled triangle, and we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.
