==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine if an object `q` will fly based on two conditions:

1. The list `q` must be balanced, meaning it is a palindromic list. A list is palindromic if it reads the same forwards and backwards.
2. The sum of the elements in `q` must be less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`.

Let's break down the steps needed to implement the function `will_it_fly(q, w)`:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Check if the list is palindromic:**
   - A list is palindromic if reversing it results in the same list. In Python, we can reverse a list using slicing: `q[::-1]`.
   - Compare the original list `q` with its reversed version `q[::-1]`. If they are equal, the list is palindromic.

2. **Calculate the sum of the list:**
   - Use the built-in `sum()` function to calculate the sum of all elements in the list `q`.

3. **Compare the sum with the maximum weight:**
   - Check if the sum of the elements is less than or equal to `w`.

4. **Return the result:**
   - The object will fly if both conditions are met: the list is palindromic and the sum is less than or equal to `w`.
   - Return `True` if both conditions are satisfied, otherwise return `False`.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    # Check if the list is palindromic
    is_palindromic = (q == q[::-1])
    
    # Calculate the sum of the list
    total_weight = sum(q)
    
    # Check if the sum is less than or equal to the maximum weight
    is_within_weight_limit = (total_weight <= w)
    
    # The object will fly if both conditions are met
    return is_palindromic and is_within_weight_limit

# Test cases
print(will_it_fly([1, 2], 5))  # ➞ False
print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1))  # ➞ False
print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9))  # ➞ True
print(will_it_fly([3], 5))  # ➞ True
```

### Explanation of the Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1:** `[1, 2]` is not palindromic, so it returns `False`.
- **Test Case 2:** `[3, 2, 3]` is palindromic, but the sum `8` is greater than `1`, so it returns `False`.
- **Test Case 3:** `[3, 2, 3]` is palindromic and the sum `8` is less than `9`, so it returns `True`.
- **Test Case 4:** `[3]` is trivially palindromic and the sum `3` is less than `5`, so it returns `True`.

This implementation correctly checks both conditions and returns the expected results.
