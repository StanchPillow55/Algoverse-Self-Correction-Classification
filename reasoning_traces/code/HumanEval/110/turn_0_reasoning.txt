To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to exchange elements between two lists, `lst1` and `lst2`, such that all elements in `lst1` become even numbers. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can approach this problem:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Identify the Problem Requirements:**
   - We need to make all elements in `lst1` even by potentially exchanging elements with `lst2`.
   - An even number is any integer that is divisible by 2 (i.e., `number % 2 == 0`).

2. **Analyze the Input:**
   - We have two lists of numbers, `lst1` and `lst2`.
   - Both lists are non-empty.

3. **Determine the Conditions for Success:**
   - If `lst1` already contains only even numbers, we can immediately return "YES".
   - If `lst1` contains any odd numbers, we need to check if `lst2` has enough even numbers to replace all odd numbers in `lst1`.

4. **Plan the Solution:**
   - Count the number of odd numbers in `lst1`.
   - Count the number of even numbers in `lst2`.
   - If the number of even numbers in `lst2` is greater than or equal to the number of odd numbers in `lst1`, then it is possible to make all elements in `lst1` even by exchanging elements. Otherwise, it is not possible.

5. **Implement the Solution:**
   - Iterate through `lst1` to count the odd numbers.
   - Iterate through `lst2` to count the even numbers.
   - Compare the counts and return "YES" or "NO" based on the comparison.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the solution based on the above plan:

```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    # Count the number of odd numbers in lst1
    odd_count_lst1 = sum(1 for x in lst1 if x % 2 != 0)
    
    # Count the number of even numbers in lst2
    even_count_lst2 = sum(1 for x in lst2 if x % 2 == 0)
    
    # Check if we can replace all odd numbers in lst1 with even numbers from lst2
    if even_count_lst2 >= odd_count_lst1:
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"

# Example test cases
print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: "YES"
print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]))  # Output: "NO"
```

### Explanation of the Implementation

- We use list comprehensions to count the odd numbers in `lst1` and the even numbers in `lst2`.
- We then compare the count of even numbers in `lst2` with the count of odd numbers in `lst1`.
- If `lst2` has enough even numbers to replace all odd numbers in `lst1`, we return "YES". Otherwise, we return "NO".
