==================================================

To solve the problem of removing elements that occur more than once from a list of integers while maintaining the order of the remaining elements, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the problem and devise a solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input**: A list of integers, e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4]`.
2. **Output**: A list of integers where all elements that occur more than once are removed, e.g., `[1, 3, 4]`.
3. **Constraints**: 
   - The order of the remaining elements should be the same as in the input list.
   - Elements that appear more than once should be completely removed.

### Approach

To achieve the desired output, we can use the following approach:

1. **Count Occurrences**: First, we need to determine how many times each element appears in the list. This can be efficiently done using a dictionary where the keys are the elements from the list and the values are their respective counts.

2. **Filter Elements**: Once we have the counts, we can iterate through the original list and construct a new list by including only those elements that have a count of exactly one.

3. **Maintain Order**: Since we iterate through the original list to construct the new list, the order of elements that appear exactly once will be preserved.

### Implementation

Let's implement the solution based on the above approach:

```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.
    """
    # Step 1: Count occurrences of each number
    counts = Counter(numbers)
    
    # Step 2: Filter numbers that occur exactly once
    result = [num for num in numbers if counts[num] == 1]
    
    return result

# Example usage:
# print(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]))  # Output should be [1, 3, 4]
```

### Explanation

- **Counter**: We use `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the list. This gives us a dictionary-like object where each key is a number from the list, and its value is the count of that number.

- **List Comprehension**: We use a list comprehension to iterate over the original list and construct a new list containing only those elements that have a count of exactly one (`counts[num] == 1`).

- **Order Preservation**: Since we iterate over the original list to construct the new list, the order of elements that appear exactly once is preserved.

This solution efficiently removes duplicates and maintains the order of the remaining elements, satisfying the problem's requirements.
