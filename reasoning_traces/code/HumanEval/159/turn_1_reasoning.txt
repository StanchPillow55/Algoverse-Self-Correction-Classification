==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many carrots the rabbit will have eaten after attempting to satisfy its hunger, and how many carrots will be left after the rabbit eats.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Inputs and Outputs**:
   - We have three inputs:
     - `number`: The number of carrots the rabbit has already eaten.
     - `need`: The number of additional carrots the rabbit needs to eat to satisfy its hunger.
     - `remaining`: The number of carrots available to eat.
   - We need to return a list with two elements:
     - The total number of carrots eaten after the rabbit attempts to satisfy its hunger.
     - The number of carrots left after the rabbit eats.

2. **Determine the Logic**:
   - First, calculate how many carrots the rabbit can actually eat. This is the minimum of `need` and `remaining` because the rabbit can't eat more than what is available.
   - Update the total number of carrots eaten by adding the number of carrots the rabbit can eat to the `number` of carrots already eaten.
   - Calculate the remaining carrots by subtracting the number of carrots the rabbit can eat from `remaining`.

3. **Consider Edge Cases**:
   - If `remaining` is 0, the rabbit can't eat any more carrots, so the total eaten remains as `number`, and remaining is 0.
   - If `need` is 0, the rabbit doesn't need to eat more, so the total eaten remains as `number`, and remaining is unchanged.

4. **Implement the Solution**:
   - Use the `min` function to determine how many carrots the rabbit can eat.
   - Update the total eaten and remaining carrots accordingly.

Let's implement the function:

```python
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    # Determine how many carrots the rabbit can actually eat
    can_eat = min(need, remaining)
    
    # Calculate the total number of carrots eaten
    total_eaten = number + can_eat
    
    # Calculate the remaining carrots after eating
    remaining_after_eating = remaining - can_eat
    
    # Return the result as a list
    return [total_eaten, remaining_after_eating]

# Example test cases
print(eat(5, 6, 10))  # Output: [11, 4]
print(eat(4, 8, 9))   # Output: [12, 1]
print(eat(1, 10, 10)) # Output: [11, 0]
print(eat(2, 11, 5))  # Output: [7, 0]
```

This function follows the outlined logic and handles the given examples correctly. It calculates the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining carrots after the rabbit attempts to satisfy its hunger.
