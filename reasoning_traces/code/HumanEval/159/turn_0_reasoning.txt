==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate two things:

1. The total number of carrots eaten after the rabbit attempts to fulfill its need.
2. The number of carrots remaining after the rabbit eats.

Here's how we can approach the problem step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Inputs:**
   - `number`: The number of carrots already eaten.
   - `need`: The number of additional carrots the rabbit needs to eat.
   - `remaining`: The number of carrots available to eat.

2. **Calculate the Total Carrots Eaten:**
   - The rabbit has already eaten `number` carrots.
   - The rabbit needs to eat `need` more carrots.
   - The rabbit can only eat up to `remaining` carrots if there aren't enough to meet the `need`.
   - Therefore, the rabbit will eat the minimum of `need` and `remaining` carrots.

3. **Calculate the Remaining Carrots:**
   - After the rabbit eats, the remaining carrots will be reduced by the number of carrots the rabbit actually eats.
   - This can be calculated as `remaining - min(need, remaining)`.

4. **Return the Results:**
   - The total number of carrots eaten will be the sum of `number` and the carrots the rabbit eats in this session.
   - The remaining carrots will be as calculated in the previous step.

### Implementation:

Let's implement the function based on the above logic:

```python
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    """
    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,
    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,
                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]
    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
    
    Example:
    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
    * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]
    
    Variables:
    @number : integer
        the number of carrots that you have eaten.
    @need : integer
        the number of carrots that you need to eat.
    @remaining : integer
        the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock
    
    Constrain:
    * 0 <= number <= 1000
    * 0 <= need <= 1000
    * 0 <= remaining <= 1000

    Have fun :)
    """
    # Calculate how many carrots the rabbit can actually eat
    can_eat = min(need, remaining)
    
    # Calculate the total number of carrots eaten
    total_eaten = number + can_eat
    
    # Calculate the remaining carrots after eating
    remaining_carrots = remaining - can_eat
    
    return [total_eaten, remaining_carrots]

# Test cases
print(eat(5, 6, 10))  # Expected output: [11, 4]
print(eat(4, 8, 9))   # Expected output: [12, 1]
print(eat(1, 10, 10)) # Expected output: [11, 0]
print(eat(2, 11, 5))  # Expected output: [7, 0]
```

This function should correctly calculate the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots remaining based on the given inputs.
