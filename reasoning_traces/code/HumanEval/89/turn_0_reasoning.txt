==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to create a function `encrypt` that takes a string `s` and returns a new string where each letter is shifted down the alphabet by a certain number of places. The problem specifies that the shift should be "two multiplied to two places," which I interpret as shifting each letter by 4 positions forward in the alphabet (since 2 * 2 = 4).

Let's break down the steps to implement this function:

1. **Understand the Alphabet Rotation**: 
   - We are given that each letter should be shifted by 4 positions forward. For example, 'a' becomes 'e', 'b' becomes 'f', and so on.
   - If the shift goes past 'z', it should wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet. For example, 'y' shifted by 4 becomes 'c', and 'z' becomes 'd'.

2. **Handling the Wrap Around**:
   - The alphabet has 26 letters, so if a letter's shift goes beyond 'z', we can use modulo arithmetic to wrap around. Specifically, if the position of a letter after shifting exceeds 25 (since 'a' is at position 0), we take the result modulo 26.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Iterate over each character in the input string.
   - For each character, calculate its new position by adding 4 to its current position in the alphabet.
   - Use modulo 26 to handle wrap-around cases.
   - Convert the new position back to a character and append it to the result string.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function should only shift lowercase alphabetic characters. If the input contains non-alphabetic characters, we should decide whether to ignore them or raise an error. Based on the examples, it seems the input will only contain lowercase letters.

Now, let's implement the function:

```python
def encrypt(s):
    """Encrypts the string by shifting each letter by 4 positions in the alphabet."""
    result = []
    
    for char in s:
        # Find the original position of the character in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z')
        original_position = ord(char) - ord('a')
        
        # Calculate the new position with a shift of 4
        new_position = (original_position + 4) % 26
        
        # Convert the new position back to a character
        new_char = chr(new_position + ord('a'))
        
        # Append the new character to the result
        result.append(new_char)
    
    # Join the list of characters into a single string and return
    return ''.join(result)

# Test cases
print(encrypt('hi'))        # Expected output: 'lm'
print(encrypt('asdfghjkl')) # Expected output: 'ewhjklnop'
print(encrypt('gf'))        # Expected output: 'kj'
print(encrypt('et'))        # Expected output: 'ix'
```

This implementation correctly shifts each letter by 4 positions, handles wrap-around using modulo arithmetic, and constructs the encrypted string by joining the list of shifted characters.
