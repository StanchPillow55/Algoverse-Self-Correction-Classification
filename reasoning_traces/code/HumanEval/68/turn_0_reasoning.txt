To solve the problem of finding the smallest even value in an array and returning it along with its index, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the problem and devise a plan to implement the solution.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input**: An array of non-negative integers.
2. **Output**: A list containing the smallest even value and its index, or an empty list if no even values exist or the array is empty.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Check for Empty Array**: If the input array is empty, we should immediately return an empty list `[]`.

2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `smallest_even`: To keep track of the smallest even number found. Initialize it to a very large number (e.g., `float('inf')`).
   - `smallest_index`: To keep track of the index of the smallest even number. Initialize it to `-1`.

3. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - For each element in the array, check if it is even (i.e., `element % 2 == 0`).
   - If it is even, compare it with `smallest_even`.
     - If it is smaller than `smallest_even`, update `smallest_even` and `smallest_index` with the current element and its index.
     - If it is equal to `smallest_even`, do nothing since we want the first occurrence (smallest index).

4. **Return the Result**:
   - After iterating through the array, check if `smallest_index` is still `-1`. If so, it means no even numbers were found, and we should return an empty list `[]`.
   - Otherwise, return a list containing `smallest_even` and `smallest_index`.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above plan:

```python
def pluck(arr):
    """
    Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes,
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.
    If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found, return the node that has the smallest index.

    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [smallest_value, its index].
    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].
    """
    if not arr:
        return []
    
    smallest_even = float('inf')
    smallest_index = -1
    
    for index, value in enumerate(arr):
        if value % 2 == 0:
            if value < smallest_even:
                smallest_even = value
                smallest_index = index
    
    if smallest_index == -1:
        return []
    
    return [smallest_even, smallest_index]

# Example usage:
print(pluck([4, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 1]
print(pluck([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 1]
print(pluck([]))         # Output: []
print(pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

### Explanation

- The function first checks if the array is empty and returns an empty list if true.
- It then iterates over the array, checking for even numbers and updating the smallest even number and its index when a smaller even number is found.
- Finally, it returns the smallest even number and its index, or an empty list if no even numbers were found. 

This solution efficiently finds the smallest even number and its index in a single pass through the array, making it optimal for the given constraints.
