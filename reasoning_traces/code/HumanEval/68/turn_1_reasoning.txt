==================================================

To solve the problem of finding the smallest even value in an array and returning it along with its index, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem Requirements:**
   - We are given an array of non-negative integers.
   - We need to find the smallest even number in the array.
   - If there are multiple occurrences of the smallest even number, we should return the one with the smallest index.
   - If there are no even numbers or the array is empty, we should return an empty list.

2. **Plan the Solution:**
   - Initialize variables to keep track of the smallest even number and its index. We can start with `None` for the smallest even number and `-1` for the index.
   - Iterate through the array:
     - Check if the current number is even.
     - If it is even and either the smallest even number is `None` (i.e., we haven't found any even number yet) or the current number is smaller than the smallest even number found so far, update the smallest even number and its index.
   - After iterating through the array, check if we found an even number. If we did, return it along with its index in a list. If not, return an empty list.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - An empty array should return an empty list.
   - An array with no even numbers should return an empty list.
   - Arrays with multiple occurrences of the smallest even number should return the first occurrence.

4. **Implement the Solution:**

```python
def pluck(arr):
    # Initialize variables to track the smallest even number and its index
    smallest_even = None
    smallest_index = -1
    
    # Iterate through the array
    for index, value in enumerate(arr):
        # Check if the current value is even
        if value % 2 == 0:
            # If it's the first even number or smaller than the current smallest even
            if smallest_even is None or value < smallest_even:
                smallest_even = value
                smallest_index = index
    
    # Check if we found an even number
    if smallest_even is not None:
        return [smallest_even, smallest_index]
    else:
        return []

# Test cases
print(pluck([4, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 1]
print(pluck([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 1]
print(pluck([]))         # Output: []
print(pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

This implementation efficiently finds the smallest even number and its index by iterating through the array once, making it O(n) in time complexity, where n is the length of the array. This is optimal given the constraints.
