To solve the problem of finding the prime factors of a given integer \( n \), we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Understanding Prime Factorization**: Prime factorization of a number is the process of breaking down the number into the set of prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number. For example, the prime factorization of 70 is \( 2 \times 5 \times 7 \).

2. **Approach**:
   - Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.
   - Divide the number \( n \) by 2 as long as it is divisible by 2. Each time it is divisible, 2 is a prime factor.
   - Once \( n \) is no longer divisible by 2, move to the next possible factor, which is 3, and repeat the process.
   - Continue this process with subsequent odd numbers (since even numbers greater than 2 cannot be prime) until the square root of \( n \).
   - If after checking all possible factors up to the square root of \( n \), the remaining \( n \) is greater than 1, then \( n \) itself is a prime factor.
   - Collect all these prime factors in a list.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Use a list to store the prime factors.
   - Use a loop to iterate over potential factors starting from 2.
   - Use a while loop to divide \( n \) by the current factor as long as it is divisible.
   - Increment the factor and continue until the factor exceeds the square root of \( n \).
   - If \( n \) is still greater than 1 after the loop, add it to the list of factors as it is a prime number.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider the case when \( n \) is 1. The prime factorization of 1 is an empty list since 1 has no prime factors.
   - Consider negative numbers or zero, though the problem does not specify handling these, typically prime factorization is defined for positive integers.

Now, let's implement the function:

```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return []
    
    factors = []
    # Start with the smallest prime number
    factor = 2
    
    # Check for factors up to the square root of n
    while factor * factor <= n:
        while n % factor == 0:
            factors.append(factor)
            n //= factor
        factor += 1
    
    # If n is still greater than 1, then it is a prime number
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    
    return factors

# Example usage:
print(factorize(8))   # Output: [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25))  # Output: [5, 5]
print(factorize(70))  # Output: [2, 5, 7]
```

This implementation efficiently finds and returns the list of prime factors for a given integer \( n \).
