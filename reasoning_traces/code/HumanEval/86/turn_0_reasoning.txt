To solve the problem of creating an "ordered version" of a string, we need to focus on sorting the characters within each word while maintaining the original order of words and spaces in the sentence. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Input and Output:**
   - Input: A string `s` that may contain multiple words separated by spaces.
   - Output: A string where each word's characters are sorted in ascending order based on their ASCII values. The order of words and spaces should remain unchanged.

2. **Identify the Components:**
   - Words are sequences of characters separated by spaces.
   - Spaces should be preserved as they are in the input string.

3. **Approach:**
   - Split the input string into words and spaces. We can use regular expressions to split the string while keeping the delimiters (spaces).
   - For each word, sort the characters.
   - Reconstruct the string by combining the sorted words and spaces in their original order.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - Use Python's `re` module to split the string while keeping the spaces.
   - Use the `sorted()` function to sort the characters of each word.
   - Join the sorted characters back into a word.
   - Concatenate the sorted words and spaces to form the final result.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Single word with no spaces.
   - Multiple spaces between words.
   - Special characters and punctuation within words.

### Implementation:

Let's implement the function `anti_shuffle` based on the above reasoning:

```python
import re

def anti_shuffle(s):
    # Use regex to split the string into words and spaces
    parts = re.split(r'(\s+)', s)
    
    # Sort characters in each word, leave spaces unchanged
    sorted_parts = [''.join(sorted(part)) if not part.isspace() else part for part in parts]
    
    # Join the sorted parts back into a single string
    return ''.join(sorted_parts)

# Test cases
print(anti_shuffle('Hi'))  # Expected: 'Hi'
print(anti_shuffle('hello'))  # Expected: 'ehllo'
print(anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!'))  # Expected: 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
```

### Explanation:

- **Regex Splitting:** We use `re.split(r'(\s+)', s)` to split the string into parts, where each part is either a sequence of non-space characters (a word) or a sequence of spaces. The parentheses in the regex ensure that the spaces are included in the result.
  
- **Sorting Words:** We iterate over each part. If the part is not a space (`not part.isspace()`), we sort its characters using `sorted(part)` and join them back into a string using `''.join()`. If the part is a space, we leave it unchanged.

- **Reconstruction:** Finally, we join all the sorted parts back together to form the final string.

This approach ensures that the order of words and spaces is preserved while sorting the characters within each word.
