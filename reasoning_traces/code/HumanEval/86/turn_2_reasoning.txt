To solve the problem of creating an "ordered version" of a string, we need to focus on sorting the characters within each word while maintaining the original order of the words and spaces in the sentence. Let's break down the problem and develop a solution step by step.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Understanding the Input and Output:**
   - Input: A string `s` that may contain multiple words and spaces.
   - Output: A string where each word's characters are sorted in ascending order based on their ASCII values. The order of words and spaces in the input string should remain unchanged.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Words are sequences of characters separated by spaces.
   - Spaces should be preserved in their original positions.
   - Each word should be sorted individually.

3. **Approach:**
   - Split the input string into words and spaces. We can use regular expressions to achieve this, as it allows us to split while keeping the delimiters (spaces) intact.
   - For each segment obtained from the split:
     - If it's a word (i.e., not just spaces), sort the characters.
     - If it's spaces, leave it unchanged.
   - Join the processed segments back together to form the final string.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - Use Python's `re.split()` function to split the string while keeping spaces.
   - Use `sorted()` to sort the characters of each word.
   - Use `str.join()` to concatenate the sorted words and spaces back into a single string.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function `anti_shuffle` based on the above approach.

```python
import re

def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.
    """
    # Use regular expression to split the string into words and spaces
    parts = re.split(r'(\s+)', s)
    
    # Process each part
    for i, part in enumerate(parts):
        # If the part is not just spaces, sort it
        if not part.isspace():
            parts[i] = ''.join(sorted(part))
    
    # Join the parts back together
    return ''.join(parts)

# Test cases
print(anti_shuffle('Hi'))  # Expected: 'Hi'
print(anti_shuffle('hello'))  # Expected: 'ehllo'
print(anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!'))  # Expected: 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
```

### Explanation

- **Regular Expression Splitting:** `re.split(r'(\s+)', s)` splits the string `s` into parts, where each part is either a sequence of non-space characters (a word) or a sequence of spaces. The parentheses in the regex ensure that the spaces are included in the result.
- **Sorting Words:** For each part that is not purely spaces, we sort the characters using `sorted(part)`, which returns a list of sorted characters. We then join these characters back into a string with `''.join(sorted(part))`.
- **Reconstruction:** Finally, we join all parts back together using `''.join(parts)` to form the final ordered string.

This solution efficiently handles the problem requirements while maintaining the original structure of the input string.
