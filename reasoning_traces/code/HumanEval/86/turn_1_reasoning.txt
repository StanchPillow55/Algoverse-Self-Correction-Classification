To solve the problem of creating an "ordered version" of a string, we need to focus on sorting the characters of each word in the string while preserving the order of the words and spaces. Let's break down the problem and devise a solution step by step:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Understanding the Input and Output:**
   - Input: A string `s` that may contain multiple words separated by spaces.
   - Output: A string where each word has its characters sorted in ascending order based on their ASCII values. The order of words and spaces should remain unchanged.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Words are sequences of non-space characters.
   - Spaces between words should be preserved.
   - Each word should be sorted individually.

3. **Examples:**
   - `'Hi'` remains `'Hi'` because it's a single word and already sorted.
   - `'hello'` becomes `'ehllo'` after sorting the characters.
   - `'Hello World!!!'` becomes `'Hello !!!Wdlor'`:
     - `'Hello'` remains `'Hello'` because sorting doesn't change its order.
     - `'World!!!'` becomes `'!!!Wdlor'` after sorting.

### Approach

1. **Split the String:**
   - Use regular expressions to split the string into words and spaces. This allows us to handle multiple spaces and punctuation correctly.

2. **Sort Each Word:**
   - For each word (sequence of non-space characters), sort the characters using Python's built-in `sorted()` function.

3. **Reconstruct the String:**
   - Combine the sorted words and spaces back into a single string.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle strings with only spaces.
   - Handle empty strings.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function based on the above approach:

```python
import re

def anti_shuffle(s):
    # Use regex to split the string into words and spaces
    parts = re.split(r'(\s+)', s)
    
    # Sort characters in each word
    sorted_parts = []
    for part in parts:
        if part.strip():  # If part is a word (non-space characters)
            sorted_part = ''.join(sorted(part))
            sorted_parts.append(sorted_part)
        else:
            sorted_parts.append(part)  # Preserve spaces as they are
    
    # Join the sorted parts back into a single string
    return ''.join(sorted_parts)

# Test cases
print(anti_shuffle('Hi'))  # Output: 'Hi'
print(anti_shuffle('hello'))  # Output: 'ehllo'
print(anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!'))  # Output: 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
```

### Explanation

- **Regex Splitting:** We use `re.split(r'(\s+)', s)` to split the string into words and spaces. The parentheses in the regex ensure that the spaces are captured as separate elements in the list.
- **Sorting Words:** For each word, we sort the characters using `sorted(part)` and join them back into a string.
- **Preserving Spaces:** Spaces are added back to the list without modification.
- **Reconstruction:** Finally, we join all parts to form the final ordered string.

This solution efficiently handles the problem requirements and edge cases, providing the desired output for various input scenarios.
