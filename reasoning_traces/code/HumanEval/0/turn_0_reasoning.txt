To solve the problem of determining if any two numbers in a list are closer to each other than a given threshold, we need to consider the following steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a list of floating-point numbers and a threshold value.
   - We need to check if there exists any pair of numbers in the list such that the absolute difference between them is less than the threshold.

2. **Constraints and Edge Cases:**
   - If the list has fewer than two elements, it's impossible to have a pair, so the function should return `False`.
   - The threshold is a positive floating-point number.
   - We need to consider all possible pairs of numbers in the list.

3. **Approach:**
   - A straightforward approach is to use a nested loop to compare each pair of numbers in the list.
   - For each pair, calculate the absolute difference and check if it is less than the threshold.
   - If such a pair is found, return `True`.
   - If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, return `False`.

4. **Complexity Consideration:**
   - The naive approach involves checking all pairs, which results in a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the list.
   - For large lists, this might not be efficient, but given the problem constraints, this approach is simple and straightforward.

5. **Implementation:**
   - We will implement the function using the described approach.

Here is the implementation of the function:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    n = len(numbers)
    # If there are fewer than 2 elements, no pairs exist
    if n < 2:
        return False
    
    # Check all pairs
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:
                return True
    
    return False

# Example usage:
# print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # Should return False
# print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # Should return True
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first check if the list has fewer than two elements, in which case we immediately return `False`.
- We then use two nested loops to iterate over all pairs of numbers in the list.
- For each pair, we calculate the absolute difference and check if it is less than the threshold.
- If we find such a pair, we return `True`.
- If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, we return `False`.

This solution effectively checks all possible pairs and determines if any two numbers are closer than the specified threshold.
