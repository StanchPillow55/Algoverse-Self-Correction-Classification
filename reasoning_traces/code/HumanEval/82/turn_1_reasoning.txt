To solve the problem of determining if the length of a given string is a prime number, we need to break down the task into a few clear steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to write a function `prime_length` that takes a string as input and returns `True` if the length of the string is a prime number, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Define a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc., are prime numbers.

3. **Plan the Solution**:
   - First, calculate the length of the input string.
   - Check if this length is a prime number.
   - To check if a number `n` is prime:
     - If `n` is less than 2, it is not prime.
     - If `n` is 2, it is prime.
     - For numbers greater than 2, check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.

4. **Implement the Solution**:
   - Write a helper function `is_prime` to determine if a number is prime.
   - Use this helper function within `prime_length` to check the primality of the string length.

5. **Test the Solution**: Verify the function with the provided examples and additional test cases to ensure correctness.

Let's implement this step-by-step:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to determine if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def prime_length(string):
    """Returns True if the length of the string is a prime number, False otherwise."""
    length = len(string)
    return is_prime(length)

# Testing the function with the provided examples
print(prime_length('Hello'))    # True, length is 5, which is prime
print(prime_length('abcdcba'))  # True, length is 7, which is prime
print(prime_length('kittens'))  # True, length is 7, which is prime
print(prime_length('orange'))   # False, length is 6, which is not prime
```

### Explanation:

- **`is_prime` Function**: This function checks if a number is prime by:
  - Returning `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1.
  - Returning `True` for the number 2.
  - Checking divisibility by numbers from 3 up to the square root of `n`, skipping even numbers (since even numbers greater than 2 are not prime).

- **`prime_length` Function**: This function calculates the length of the input string and uses the `is_prime` function to determine if this length is a prime number.

This solution efficiently checks for prime numbers and correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem.
