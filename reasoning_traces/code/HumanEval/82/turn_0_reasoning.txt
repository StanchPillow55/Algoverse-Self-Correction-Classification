To solve the problem of determining if the length of a string is a prime number, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Understanding Prime Numbers**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc., are prime numbers.

2. **Determine the Length of the String**: First, we need to calculate the length of the input string using Python's built-in `len()` function.

3. **Check if the Length is a Prime Number**:
   - If the length is less than 2, it cannot be a prime number.
   - For numbers 2 and 3, they are prime numbers.
   - For numbers greater than 3, we need to check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these, it is not a prime number.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Define a helper function `is_prime(n)` that checks if a number `n` is prime.
   - In the `prime_length` function, calculate the length of the string.
   - Use the `is_prime` function to determine if the length is a prime number and return the result.

Let's implement this logic in Python:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to determine if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def prime_length(string):
    """Returns True if the length of the string is a prime number, False otherwise."""
    length = len(string)
    return is_prime(length)

# Test cases
print(prime_length('Hello'))    # True, length is 5 (prime)
print(prime_length('abcdcba'))  # True, length is 7 (prime)
print(prime_length('kittens'))  # True, length is 7 (prime)
print(prime_length('orange'))   # False, length is 6 (not prime)
```

### Explanation:
- **`is_prime(n)` Function**: This function checks if `n` is a prime number. It handles small numbers directly and uses a loop to check divisibility for larger numbers, optimizing by checking up to the square root of `n`.
- **`prime_length(string)` Function**: This function calculates the length of the input string and uses the `is_prime` function to determine if the length is prime, returning the result.

This solution efficiently checks for prime numbers and handles the problem requirements as specified.
