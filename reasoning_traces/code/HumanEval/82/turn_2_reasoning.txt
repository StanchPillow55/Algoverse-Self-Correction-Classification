==================================================

To solve the problem of determining if the length of a string is a prime number, we need to break down the task into a few logical steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to check if the length of a given string is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Plan the Solution**:
   - Calculate the length of the input string.
   - Determine if this length is a prime number.
   - Return `True` if it is a prime number, otherwise return `False`.

3. **Check for Prime Number**:
   - A number less than 2 is not prime.
   - For numbers 2 and 3, they are prime.
   - For numbers greater than 3, check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these, it is not prime.

4. **Implement the Solution**:
   - Write a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime.
   - Use this helper function within `prime_length` to check if the length of the string is prime.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider strings of length 0 or 1, which are not prime.
   - Consider strings of length 2 or 3, which are prime.

Let's implement this step-by-step:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def prime_length(string):
    """Check if the length of the string is a prime number."""
    length = len(string)
    return is_prime(length)

# Test cases
print(prime_length('Hello'))    # True, length is 5
print(prime_length('abcdcba'))  # True, length is 7
print(prime_length('kittens'))  # True, length is 7
print(prime_length('orange'))   # False, length is 6
```

### Explanation:

- **`is_prime` Function**: This function checks if a number `n` is prime. It handles small numbers directly and uses a loop to check divisibility for larger numbers, optimizing by checking up to the square root of `n`.

- **`prime_length` Function**: This function calculates the length of the input string and uses `is_prime` to determine if this length is a prime number.

This solution efficiently checks for prime numbers and correctly determines if the string length is prime, as demonstrated by the test cases.
