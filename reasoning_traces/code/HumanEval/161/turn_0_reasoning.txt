To solve the problem, we need to handle two main cases based on the content of the string `s`:

1. **Case 1: The string contains letters.**
   - For each character in the string, if it is a letter, we need to reverse its case. This means converting lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa.
   - If the character is not a letter, we leave it unchanged.

2. **Case 2: The string contains no letters.**
   - If there are no letters in the string, we simply reverse the entire string.

Let's break down the steps to implement this:

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Check for Letters:**
   - Iterate through the string to check if there is at least one letter. We can use the `isalpha()` method to determine if a character is a letter.

2. **Process the String:**
   - If there is at least one letter:
     - Create a new string by iterating over each character in the original string.
     - For each character, check if it is a letter using `isalpha()`.
     - If it is a letter, change its case using the `swapcase()` method.
     - If it is not a letter, keep it unchanged.
   - If there are no letters:
     - Reverse the string using slicing.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - Return the processed string based on the above conditions.

Now, let's implement the function:

```python
def solve(s):
    # Check if there is at least one letter in the string
    contains_letter = any(char.isalpha() for char in s)
    
    if contains_letter:
        # If there is at least one letter, swap the case of each letter
        result = ''.join(char.swapcase() if char.isalpha() else char for char in s)
    else:
        # If there are no letters, reverse the string
        result = s[::-1]
    
    return result

# Test cases
print(solve("1234"))  # Expected output: "4321"
print(solve("ab"))    # Expected output: "AB"
print(solve("#a@C"))  # Expected output: "#A@c"
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We first determine if the string contains any letters using a generator expression with `any()`. This checks each character with `isalpha()`.
- If the string contains letters, we use a list comprehension to iterate over each character. We use `swapcase()` to change the case of letters and leave non-letters unchanged.
- If the string contains no letters, we reverse it using slicing (`s[::-1]`).
- Finally, we return the processed string.

This solution efficiently handles both cases and provides the correct output for the given examples.
