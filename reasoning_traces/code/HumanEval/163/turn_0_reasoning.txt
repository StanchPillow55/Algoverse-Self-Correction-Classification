==================================================

To solve the problem of generating even digits between two given integers `a` and `b`, we need to follow a structured approach. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Problem Understanding

1. **Input**: Two positive integers `a` and `b`.
2. **Output**: A list of even digits between `a` and `b`, inclusive, sorted in ascending order.

### Key Observations

- **Even Digits**: The even digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. However, since we are dealing with positive integers and the context of the problem, we will consider only 2, 4, 6, and 8.
- **Range Handling**: The order of `a` and `b` doesn't matter. We need to consider the range from the minimum of `a` and `b` to the maximum of `a` and `b`.
- **Digit Extraction**: We are interested in the digits themselves, not the numbers in the range.

### Approach

1. **Determine the Range**: Calculate the minimum and maximum of `a` and `b` to establish the range.
2. **Identify Even Digits**: We need to check each digit from 2 to 8 to see if it falls within the range.
3. **Collect Even Digits**: Create a list of even digits that are within the range.
4. **Return the Result**: Return the list of even digits.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def generate_integers(a, b):
    """
    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a
    and b, in ascending order.
    """
    # Determine the range boundaries
    start = min(a, b)
    end = max(a, b)
    
    # List of even digits
    even_digits = [2, 4, 6, 8]
    
    # Filter even digits within the range
    result = [digit for digit in even_digits if start <= digit <= end]
    
    return result

# Example usage:
print(generate_integers(2, 8))  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
print(generate_integers(8, 2))  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
print(generate_integers(10, 14))  # Output: []
```

### Explanation

- **Range Calculation**: We use `min(a, b)` and `max(a, b)` to determine the correct range irrespective of the order of `a` and `b`.
- **Even Digits List**: We define a list of even digits `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.
- **List Comprehension**: We use a list comprehension to filter out the even digits that fall within the specified range.
- **Return**: The filtered list is returned as the result.

This solution efficiently checks for even digits within the specified range and returns them in ascending order.
