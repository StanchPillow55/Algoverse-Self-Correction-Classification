To solve the problem of finding the maximum `k` numbers from an array `arr` and returning them in sorted order, we can break down the task into a few clear steps. Let's go through the thought process step by step:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understand the Problem Requirements:**
   - We are given an array `arr` of integers.
   - We are given a positive integer `k`.
   - We need to return a sorted list of the `k` largest numbers from `arr`.

2. **Consider Edge Cases:**
   - If `k` is 0, the result should be an empty list because we are asked to return `k` numbers.
   - If `k` is equal to the length of the array, the result should be the sorted version of the entire array.
   - If `arr` contains duplicate values, the result should still include duplicates if they are among the `k` largest.

3. **Approach to Solve the Problem:**
   - **Sorting Approach:** 
     - Sort the array in descending order to bring the largest elements to the front.
     - Select the first `k` elements from this sorted array.
     - Sort these `k` elements in ascending order before returning them, as the problem requires the result to be sorted.

4. **Complexity Consideration:**
   - Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)` time complexity, where `n` is the length of the array.
   - Selecting the first `k` elements and sorting them takes `O(k log k)`.
   - Overall, the approach is efficient given the constraints.

5. **Implementation:**
   - We will implement the function `maximum(arr, k)` following the above approach.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list 
    of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.
    """
    # Sort the array in descending order
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    
    # Take the first k elements
    max_k_elements = sorted_arr[:k]
    
    # Sort these k elements in ascending order
    return sorted(max_k_elements)

# Example usage:
# print(maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3))  # Output: [-4, -3, 5]
# print(maximum([4, -4, 4], 2))   # Output: [4, 4]
# print(maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1))  # Output: [2]
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:
- We first sort the entire array in descending order using `sorted(arr, reverse=True)`.
- We then slice the first `k` elements from this sorted array.
- Finally, we sort these `k` elements in ascending order to meet the requirement of returning a sorted list.

This solution efficiently finds and returns the `k` largest elements from the array in sorted order.
