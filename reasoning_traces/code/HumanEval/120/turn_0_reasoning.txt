To solve the problem of finding the maximum `k` numbers in an array and returning them in sorted order, we can break down the solution into a series of logical steps:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Input Validation**: 
   - Ensure that `k` is a non-negative integer and does not exceed the length of the array `arr`. If `k` is 0, return an empty list immediately since no elements are needed.

2. **Extract Maximum Elements**:
   - Use a method to extract the `k` largest elements from the array. Python provides a convenient function `heapq.nlargest` which can be used to efficiently find the `k` largest elements in an array. This function internally uses a heap data structure to maintain the largest elements, making it efficient with a time complexity of `O(n log k)`.

3. **Sort the Result**:
   - Once we have the `k` largest elements, we need to sort them in ascending order before returning. This can be done using Python's built-in `sorted()` function.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the sorted list of the `k` largest elements.

### Implementation:

Here's how we can implement the above logic in Python:

```python
import heapq

def maximum(arr, k):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list 
    of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.
    """
    # Edge case: if k is 0, return an empty list
    if k == 0:
        return []
    
    # Use heapq.nlargest to get the k largest elements
    k_largest = heapq.nlargest(k, arr)
    
    # Sort the k largest elements
    k_largest_sorted = sorted(k_largest)
    
    return k_largest_sorted

# Example usage:
# print(maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3))  # Output: [-4, -3, 5]
# print(maximum([4, -4, 4], 2))   # Output: [4, 4]
# print(maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1))  # Output: [2]
```

### Explanation:

- **heapq.nlargest(k, arr)**: This function efficiently finds the `k` largest elements in `arr`. It uses a min-heap of size `k` to keep track of the largest elements seen so far.
  
- **sorted(k_largest)**: This sorts the list of `k` largest elements in ascending order, which is required by the problem statement.

This solution is efficient and leverages Python's standard library functions to achieve the desired result with minimal code.
