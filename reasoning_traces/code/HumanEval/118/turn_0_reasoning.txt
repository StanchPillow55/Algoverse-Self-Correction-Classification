To solve the problem of finding the closest vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of a given word, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the problem and devise a solution step-by-step.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Identify Vowels and Consonants**:
   - Vowels are the letters: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (both uppercase and lowercase).
   - Consonants are any other letters in the English alphabet that are not vowels.

2. **Constraints**:
   - We need to find a vowel that is sandwiched between two consonants.
   - The search should be from the right side of the word.
   - Vowels at the beginning or end of the word do not count.
   - If no such vowel exists, return an empty string.

3. **Approach**:
   - Traverse the word from right to left.
   - Keep track of the last consonant encountered.
   - When a vowel is found, check if it is followed by a consonant (to its left in the word).
   - If a vowel is found between two consonants, return it immediately.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a vowel, return an empty string.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - A set of vowels for quick lookup.
   - A variable to track the last consonant found.

2. **Traverse the Word**:
   - Start from the end of the word and move towards the beginning.
   - Check each character:
     - If it's a consonant, update the last consonant tracker.
     - If it's a vowel, check if the last consonant tracker is set (indicating a consonant was found before it).
     - If a vowel is found between two consonants, return it.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Words with no vowels or no consonants.
   - Words where vowels are at the start or end.

### Implementation

Here's the Python function implementing the above logic:

```python
def get_closest_vowel(word):
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    last_consonant = None
    
    # Traverse the word from right to left
    for i in range(len(word) - 1, -1, -1):
        char = word[i]
        
        if char not in vowels:
            # It's a consonant
            last_consonant = char
        else:
            # It's a vowel
            if last_consonant is not None:
                # Check if there's a consonant before this vowel
                if i > 0 and word[i - 1] not in vowels:
                    return char
    
    return ""

# Test cases
print(get_closest_vowel("yogurt"))  # Expected output: "u"
print(get_closest_vowel("FULL"))    # Expected output: "U"
print(get_closest_vowel("quick"))   # Expected output: ""
print(get_closest_vowel("ab"))      # Expected output: ""
```

### Explanation

- We use a set for vowels to allow O(1) average time complexity for membership checks.
- We traverse the word from right to left to ensure we find the closest vowel from the right.
- We maintain a `last_consonant` variable to track the last consonant encountered.
- When a vowel is found, we check if it is sandwiched between two consonants and return it if true.
- If no such vowel is found, we return an empty string.
