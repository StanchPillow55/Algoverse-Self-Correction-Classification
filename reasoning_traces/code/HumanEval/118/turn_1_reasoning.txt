==================================================

To solve the problem of finding the closest vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of a given word, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the problem and devise a solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Identify Vowels and Consonants:**
   - Vowels are the letters: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (both lowercase and uppercase).
   - Consonants are all other alphabetic characters that are not vowels.

2. **Constraints:**
   - We need to find a vowel that is surrounded by consonants on both sides.
   - The search should be from the right side of the word.
   - Vowels at the beginning or end of the word do not count.
   - If no such vowel exists, return an empty string.

3. **Examples:**
   - For "yogurt", the closest vowel from the right between consonants is 'u'.
   - For "FULL", the closest vowel from the right between consonants is 'U'.
   - For "quick", there is no vowel between consonants, so return "".
   - For "ab", there are no vowels between consonants, so return "".

### Approach

1. **Iterate from the Right:**
   - Start iterating from the end of the string towards the beginning.

2. **Check for Vowel Between Consonants:**
   - As we iterate, keep track of the last seen consonant.
   - When a vowel is encountered, check if it is preceded and followed by consonants.
   - If such a vowel is found, return it immediately.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the word is too short (less than 3 characters), it's impossible to have a vowel between two consonants.
   - If the word starts or ends with a vowel, ensure it is not considered.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function based on the above approach:

```python
def get_closest_vowel(word):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    length = len(word)
    
    # If the word is too short, return an empty string
    if length < 3:
        return ""
    
    # Start from the second last character and move leftwards
    for i in range(length - 2, 0, -1):
        if word[i] in vowels:
            # Check if the current vowel is between two consonants
            if word[i - 1] not in vowels and word[i + 1] not in vowels:
                return word[i]
    
    # If no such vowel is found, return an empty string
    return ""

# Test cases
print(get_closest_vowel("yogurt"))  # Should return "u"
print(get_closest_vowel("FULL"))    # Should return "U"
print(get_closest_vowel("quick"))   # Should return ""
print(get_closest_vowel("ab"))      # Should return ""
```

### Explanation

- We iterate from the second last character to the second character (inclusive) because we need to check for a vowel that has both a preceding and a following consonant.
- For each character, if it's a vowel, we check the characters immediately before and after it to ensure they are consonants.
- If such a vowel is found, it's returned immediately.
- If the loop completes without finding a suitable vowel, an empty string is returned.
