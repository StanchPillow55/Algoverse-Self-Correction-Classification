To solve the problem of extracting the decimal part of a positive floating-point number, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the problem and think through the solution step by step.

### Problem Understanding

Given a positive floating-point number, we need to decompose it into two parts:
1. **Integer Part**: This is the largest integer that is smaller than or equal to the given number. In Python, this can be obtained using the `int()` function or the `math.floor()` function.
2. **Decimal Part**: This is the leftover part of the number after removing the integer part. It is always smaller than 1.

The task is to return the decimal part of the number.

### Approach

1. **Extract the Integer Part**: 
   - Use the `int()` function to get the integer part of the number. This function truncates the decimal part and returns the integer portion of the number.

2. **Calculate the Decimal Part**:
   - Subtract the integer part from the original number to get the decimal part.
   - Since the number is positive, this subtraction will yield a positive decimal value less than 1.

3. **Return the Decimal Part**:
   - The result of the subtraction is the decimal part, which we will return.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function `truncate_number` based on the above approach.

```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    an integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    """
    # Step 1: Extract the integer part
    integer_part = int(number)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the decimal part
    decimal_part = number - integer_part
    
    # Step 3: Return the decimal part
    return decimal_part

# Example usage:
# print(truncate_number(3.5))  # Output should be 0.5
```

### Explanation

- **int(number)**: This function call truncates the decimal portion of the number and returns the integer part.
- **number - integer_part**: This subtraction gives us the decimal part of the number, which is what we need to return.

This solution is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's built-in capabilities to handle floating-point arithmetic and integer conversion. The function will correctly return the decimal part for any positive floating-point number.
