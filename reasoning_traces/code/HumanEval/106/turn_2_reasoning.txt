==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to create a function `f(n)` that returns a list of size `n`. Each element in the list is determined by the index `i` (starting from 1) and follows these rules:

1. If `i` is even, the element is the factorial of `i`.
2. If `i` is odd, the element is the sum of numbers from 1 to `i`.

Let's break down the steps needed to implement this function:

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Initialize an Empty List**: Start by creating an empty list that will eventually hold the results.

2. **Iterate Over the Range**: Use a loop to iterate over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). This is because the problem specifies that `i` starts from 1.

3. **Determine Even or Odd**: For each `i` in the loop:
   - Check if `i` is even or odd.
   - If `i` is even, calculate the factorial of `i`.
   - If `i` is odd, calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `i`.

4. **Calculate Factorial**: For even `i`, compute the factorial using a helper function or a loop. The factorial of a number `i` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `i`.

5. **Calculate Sum**: For odd `i`, compute the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` using the formula for the sum of the first `i` natural numbers: `i * (i + 1) / 2`.

6. **Append to List**: Append the calculated value (either factorial or sum) to the list.

7. **Return the List**: After the loop completes, return the list.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above plan:

```python
def f(n):
    def factorial(x):
        result = 1
        for i in range(1, x + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
    
    result_list = []
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # i is even, calculate factorial
            result_list.append(factorial(i))
        else:
            # i is odd, calculate sum from 1 to i
            result_list.append(i * (i + 1) // 2)
    
    return result_list

# Example usage:
# f(5) should return [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
```

### Explanation

- **Factorial Calculation**: We use a helper function `factorial(x)` to compute the factorial of a number `x`. This function iterates from 1 to `x` and multiplies the numbers together.

- **Sum Calculation**: For odd indices, we use the formula `i * (i + 1) // 2` to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `i`. This formula is derived from the arithmetic series sum formula.

- **Efficiency**: The function efficiently computes the required values using simple loops and arithmetic operations, making it suitable for moderate values of `n`.

This solution should correctly implement the function `f` as described in the problem statement.
