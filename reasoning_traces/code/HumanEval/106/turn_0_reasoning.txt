==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to create a function `f(n)` that returns a list of size `n`. Each element in the list is determined by the index `i` (starting from 1) as follows:

1. If `i` is even, the element should be the factorial of `i`.
2. If `i` is odd, the element should be the sum of numbers from 1 to `i`.

Let's break down the steps needed to implement this function:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Initialize an empty list**: We'll start by creating an empty list that will store the results.

2. **Iterate over a range**: We'll iterate over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) using a loop. This is because the problem specifies that `i` starts from 1.

3. **Determine if `i` is even or odd**:
   - If `i` is even, calculate the factorial of `i`.
   - If `i` is odd, calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `i`.

4. **Calculate Factorial**:
   - The factorial of a number `i` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `i`.
   - We can calculate this using a loop or by using Python's `math.factorial` function for simplicity.

5. **Calculate Sum**:
   - The sum of numbers from 1 to `i` can be calculated using the formula: \( \text{sum} = \frac{i \times (i + 1)}{2} \).
   - Alternatively, we can use a loop to sum the numbers.

6. **Append the result**: Append the calculated value (either factorial or sum) to the list.

7. **Return the list**: After the loop completes, return the list containing the results.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
import math

def f(n):
    """ Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,
    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
    i starts from 1.
    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
    Example:
    f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
    """
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # i is even, calculate factorial
            result.append(math.factorial(i))
        else:
            # i is odd, calculate sum from 1 to i
            result.append(sum(range(1, i + 1)))
    return result

# Example usage:
print(f(5))  # Output should be [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We import the `math` module to use the `math.factorial` function for calculating factorials.
- We initialize an empty list `result` to store the results.
- We loop over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- For each `i`, we check if it is even or odd using the modulus operator `%`.
- Depending on whether `i` is even or odd, we calculate the factorial or the sum, respectively, and append it to the `result` list.
- Finally, we return the `result` list. 

This implementation efficiently calculates the desired list based on the conditions provided in the problem statement.
