==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to create a function `f(n)` that returns a list of size `n`. Each element in the list is determined by the index `i` (starting from 1):

1. If `i` is even, the element should be the factorial of `i`.
2. If `i` is odd, the element should be the sum of numbers from 1 to `i`.

Let's break down the steps to implement this:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Initialize an empty list**: We'll store the results in this list and return it at the end.

2. **Iterate over a range from 1 to n (inclusive)**: Since the problem specifies that `i` starts from 1, we'll iterate over this range.

3. **Determine if `i` is even or odd**:
   - If `i` is even, calculate the factorial of `i`.
   - If `i` is odd, calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `i`.

4. **Calculate the factorial**:
   - The factorial of a number `i` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `i`.
   - We can use a loop or Python's built-in `math.factorial` function to calculate this.

5. **Calculate the sum**:
   - The sum of numbers from 1 to `i` can be calculated using the formula: `i * (i + 1) // 2`.

6. **Append the result to the list**: Depending on whether `i` is even or odd, append the calculated value to the list.

7. **Return the list**: After the loop completes, return the list containing the calculated values.

### Implementation:

Let's implement the function based on the above steps:

```python
import math

def f(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # i is even, calculate factorial
            result.append(math.factorial(i))
        else:
            # i is odd, calculate sum from 1 to i
            result.append(i * (i + 1) // 2)
    return result

# Example usage:
# f(5) should return [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
```

### Explanation:

- We use `range(1, n + 1)` to iterate from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- For even `i`, we use `math.factorial(i)` to calculate the factorial.
- For odd `i`, we use the formula `i * (i + 1) // 2` to calculate the sum.
- We append each calculated value to the `result` list.
- Finally, we return the `result` list.

This implementation efficiently calculates the desired list based on the given conditions.
