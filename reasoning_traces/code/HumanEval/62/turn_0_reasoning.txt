To solve this problem, we need to compute the derivative of a polynomial given its coefficients. The polynomial is represented as a list of coefficients, where each element corresponds to the coefficient of a term in the polynomial. The index of each element in the list represents the power of \(x\) for that term.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Polynomial Representation:**
   - The list `xs` represents the polynomial:
     \[
     xs[0] + xs[1] \cdot x + xs[2] \cdot x^2 + \ldots + xs[n] \cdot x^n
     \]
   - For example, the list `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]` represents the polynomial:
     \[
     3 + 1 \cdot x + 2 \cdot x^2 + 4 \cdot x^3 + 5 \cdot x^4
     \]

2. **Derivative of a Polynomial:**
   - The derivative of a polynomial term \(a \cdot x^n\) is \(n \cdot a \cdot x^{n-1}\).
   - Therefore, the derivative of the polynomial is:
     \[
     xs[1] + 2 \cdot xs[2] \cdot x + 3 \cdot xs[3] \cdot x^2 + \ldots + n \cdot xs[n] \cdot x^{n-1}
     \]
   - Notice that the constant term \(xs[0]\) disappears because its derivative is zero.

3. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Initialize an empty list to store the coefficients of the derivative.
   - Iterate over the list `xs` starting from the first power term (index 1) to the last term.
   - For each term, multiply the coefficient by its index (which represents the power of \(x\)).
   - Append the result to the derivative list.
   - Return the derivative list.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the list is empty or contains only one element, the derivative is an empty list because there are no terms with \(x\).

Now, let's implement the function:

```python
def derivative(xs: list):
    """ xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
    xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
    Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.
    """
    # Initialize the list for the derivative coefficients
    derivative_coeffs = []
    
    # Iterate over the coefficients starting from index 1
    for i in range(1, len(xs)):
        # Calculate the derivative coefficient for the current term
        derivative_coeff = i * xs[i]
        # Append the calculated coefficient to the derivative list
        derivative_coeffs.append(derivative_coeff)
    
    return derivative_coeffs

# Test cases
print(derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]))  # Expected output: [1, 4, 12, 20]
print(derivative([1, 2, 3]))        # Expected output: [2, 6]
```

This implementation correctly calculates the derivative of the polynomial represented by the list of coefficients. The function iterates over the coefficients, computes the derivative for each term, and returns the resulting list of coefficients for the derivative polynomial.
