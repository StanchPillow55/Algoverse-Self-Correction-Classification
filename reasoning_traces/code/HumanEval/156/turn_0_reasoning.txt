To solve the problem of converting an integer to its Roman numeral equivalent in lowercase, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the problem and then implement the solution.

### Understanding Roman Numerals

Roman numerals are a numeral system originating from ancient Rome, employing combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M. Each letter represents a specific value:

- I = 1
- V = 5
- X = 10
- L = 50
- C = 100
- D = 500
- M = 1000

Roman numerals are typically written from largest to smallest from left to right. However, when a smaller numeral appears before a larger one, it is subtracted. For example, IV is 4 (5 - 1), and IX is 9 (10 - 1).

### Approach

1. **Mapping Values**: Create a list of tuples that maps Roman numeral symbols to their respective integer values, sorted from largest to smallest. This will help in constructing the Roman numeral by iterating through the list and subtracting values from the number.

2. **Iterate and Construct**: Start with the given number and iterate over the list of Roman numeral mappings. For each symbol, determine how many times it fits into the number, append that symbol to the result, and reduce the number accordingly.

3. **Lowercase Conversion**: Since the problem requires the Roman numeral to be in lowercase, ensure the final result is converted to lowercase before returning.

4. **Edge Cases**: Consider the smallest and largest possible values (1 and 1000) to ensure the function handles these correctly.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function `int_to_mini_roman` based on the above approach:

```python
def int_to_mini_roman(number):
    """
    Given a positive integer, obtain its roman numeral equivalent as a string,
    and return it in lowercase.
    Restrictions: 1 <= num <= 1000
    """
    # Mapping of Roman numerals to their integer values
    roman_numerals = [
        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),
        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),
        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),
        (1, 'I')
    ]
    
    # Resultant Roman numeral string
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the Roman numeral mappings
    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:
        # Determine how many times the symbol fits into the number
        while number >= value:
            result.append(symbol)
            number -= value
    
    # Join the list into a string and convert to lowercase
    return ''.join(result).lower()

# Example usage
print(int_to_mini_roman(19))   # Output: 'xix'
print(int_to_mini_roman(152))  # Output: 'clii'
print(int_to_mini_roman(426))  # Output: 'cdxxvi'
```

### Explanation

- We use a list of tuples `roman_numerals` to map each Roman numeral to its integer value, sorted from largest to smallest.
- We iterate over this list, checking how many times each numeral can fit into the remaining number.
- For each fit, we append the corresponding Roman numeral to our result list and decrease the number by the numeral's value.
- Finally, we join the list of symbols into a string and convert it to lowercase before returning it.

This approach ensures that the function correctly converts any integer within the specified range to its Roman numeral equivalent in lowercase.
