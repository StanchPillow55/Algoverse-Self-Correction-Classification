To solve the problem of finding the largest prime number in a list and returning the sum of its digits, let's break down the steps needed:

1. **Understand the Problem**: 
   - We are given a list of integers.
   - We need to identify the largest prime number in this list.
   - Once we have the largest prime number, we need to calculate the sum of its digits.
   - Return this sum as the output.

2. **Plan the Solution**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify prime numbers in the list.
     - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
     - We need a helper function to check if a number is prime.
   - **Step 2**: Find the largest prime number in the list.
   - **Step 3**: Calculate the sum of the digits of this largest prime number.
   - **Step 4**: Return the sum of the digits.

3. **Implement the Solution**:
   - **Helper Function**: Create a function `is_prime(n)` that returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise.
   - **Main Function**: Iterate through the list, use the helper function to filter out prime numbers, find the largest prime, and then calculate the sum of its digits.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the list contains no prime numbers, the function should handle this gracefully. However, based on the problem statement, we assume there is at least one prime number in the list.

Let's implement the solution:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is a prime number."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def skjkasdkd(lst):
    """Find the largest prime in the list and return the sum of its digits."""
    # Step 1: Filter out prime numbers from the list
    primes = [num for num in lst if is_prime(num)]
    
    # Step 2: Find the largest prime number
    if not primes:
        return 0  # In case there are no primes, though the problem assumes there is at least one.
    largest_prime = max(primes)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the sum of the digits of the largest prime
    digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(largest_prime))
    
    # Step 4: Return the sum of the digits
    return digit_sum

# Example usage:
# print(skjkasdkd([0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3]))  # Output should be 10
```

### Explanation:
- **`is_prime` function**: This function checks if a number is prime by first handling small numbers and then using trial division up to the square root of the number.
- **`skjkasdkd` function**: 
  - Filters the list to get only prime numbers.
  - Finds the maximum of these prime numbers.
  - Converts the largest prime number to a string to iterate over its digits and calculate their sum.
  - Returns the sum of the digits.
