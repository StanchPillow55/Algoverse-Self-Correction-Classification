To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify Prime Numbers**: First, we need to identify which numbers in the list are prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Find the Largest Prime**: Once we have identified all the prime numbers in the list, we need to find the largest one.

3. **Sum the Digits of the Largest Prime**: After finding the largest prime number, we need to calculate the sum of its digits.

4. **Return the Sum**: Finally, we return the sum of the digits of the largest prime number.

Let's break down each step in detail:

### Step 1: Identify Prime Numbers

To check if a number is prime:
- If the number is less than 2, it is not prime.
- For numbers 2 and above, check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these, it is not prime.

### Step 2: Find the Largest Prime

Once we have a list of prime numbers, we can use Python's built-in `max()` function to find the largest prime number.

### Step 3: Sum the Digits of the Largest Prime

To sum the digits of a number:
- Convert the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
- Convert each character back to an integer and sum them up.

### Step 4: Return the Sum

Finally, return the calculated sum.

Now, let's implement the function:

```python
def skjkasdkd(lst):
    def is_prime(n):
        """Check if a number is prime."""
        if n < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    # Filter out the prime numbers from the list
    primes = [num for num in lst if is_prime(num)]
    
    if not primes:
        return 0  # In case there are no prime numbers

    # Find the largest prime number
    largest_prime = max(primes)

    # Calculate the sum of the digits of the largest prime
    digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(largest_prime))

    return digit_sum

# Test cases
print(skjkasdkd([0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3]))  # Output: 10
print(skjkasdkd([1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1]))  # Output: 25
print(skjkasdkd([1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3]))  # Output: 13
print(skjkasdkd([0,724,32,71,99,32,6,0,5,91,83,0,5,6]))  # Output: 11
print(skjkasdkd([0,81,12,3,1,21]))  # Output: 3
print(skjkasdkd([0,8,1,2,1,7]))  # Output: 7
```

This implementation follows the outlined steps and should work correctly for the given problem.
