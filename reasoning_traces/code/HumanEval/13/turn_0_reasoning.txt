To solve the problem of finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm and how we can implement it in Python:

### Understanding the Euclidean Algorithm

1. **Definition**: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

2. **Euclidean Algorithm**:
   - If `b` is 0, then the GCD is `a`. This is because any number is divisible by itself, and 0 is divisible by any number.
   - Otherwise, the GCD of `a` and `b` is the same as the GCD of `b` and `a % b` (where `%` is the modulus operator, which gives the remainder of the division of `a` by `b`).
   - This process is repeated until `b` becomes 0.

3. **Example**:
   - To find the GCD of 25 and 15:
     - Compute `25 % 15`, which is 10.
     - Now, find the GCD of 15 and 10.
     - Compute `15 % 10`, which is 5.
     - Now, find the GCD of 10 and 5.
     - Compute `10 % 5`, which is 0.
     - Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is 5.

### Implementation

With this understanding, we can implement the Euclidean algorithm in Python. The function will take two integers `a` and `b` as input and return their GCD.

```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """ Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b """
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We use a `while` loop that continues as long as `b` is not zero.
- Inside the loop, we update `a` to be `b`, and `b` to be `a % b`.
- When `b` becomes zero, `a` contains the GCD of the original two numbers.
- Finally, we return `a` as the result.

### Testing the Function

Let's verify the function with the provided examples:

- `greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)` should return `1` because 3 and 5 are coprime (no common divisors other than 1).
- `greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)` should return `5` because 5 is the largest number that divides both 25 and 15.

This implementation is efficient and works for any pair of non-negative integers.
