To solve the problem, we need to create a function `double_the_difference` that processes a list of numbers and returns the sum of the squares of the odd numbers, while ignoring negative numbers and non-integers.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to approach this problem:

1. **Input Validation**: 
   - The function should handle an empty list by returning 0 immediately.
   - We need to ensure that we only process integers, so we should filter out any non-integer values.

2. **Filter Valid Numbers**:
   - We need to ignore negative numbers, so we should filter out any numbers less than zero.
   - We should also filter out non-integer numbers, but since the problem statement doesn't specify handling non-integers, we'll assume the input list contains only integers.

3. **Identify Odd Numbers**:
   - We need to identify numbers that are odd. An integer is odd if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., `number % 2 != 0`).

4. **Calculate the Sum of Squares**:
   - For each odd number, calculate its square and accumulate the sum.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the accumulated sum of squares of the odd numbers.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    '''
    Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
    in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
    
    double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10
    double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
    double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
    double_the_difference([0]) == 0  
   
    If the input list is empty, return 0.
    '''
    # Initialize the sum of squares
    sum_of_squares = 0
    
    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for number in lst:
        # Check if the number is a non-negative integer and odd
        if isinstance(number, int) and number >= 0 and number % 2 != 0:
            # Add the square of the number to the sum
            sum_of_squares += number ** 2
    
    # Return the total sum of squares
    return sum_of_squares

# Test cases
print(double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]))  # Output: 10
print(double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]))  # Output: 0
print(double_the_difference([9, -2]))      # Output: 81
print(double_the_difference([0]))          # Output: 0
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:
- We initialize `sum_of_squares` to 0 to keep track of the accumulated sum.
- We iterate over each element in the list `lst`.
- For each element, we check if it is a non-negative integer and odd. If it is, we compute its square and add it to `sum_of_squares`.
- Finally, we return the accumulated `sum_of_squares`. 

This solution efficiently handles the requirements and edge cases as specified in the problem statement.
