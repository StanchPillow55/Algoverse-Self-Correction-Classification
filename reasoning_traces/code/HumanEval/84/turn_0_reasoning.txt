==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: 
   - We are given a positive integer `N`.
   - We need to calculate the sum of its digits.
   - Convert the sum into a binary representation.
   - Return the binary representation as a string.

2. **Break Down the Problem**:
   - **Extract Digits**: We need to extract each digit of the number `N`. This can be done by converting the number to a string and iterating over each character, converting it back to an integer.
   - **Sum the Digits**: Once we have the digits, we sum them up.
   - **Convert to Binary**: Convert the resulting sum to a binary string. Python provides a built-in function `bin()` that can be used for this purpose. The `bin()` function returns a string prefixed with '0b', so we need to remove this prefix.
   - **Return the Result**: Finally, return the binary string representation of the sum.

3. **Consider Edge Cases**:
   - If `N` is 0, the sum of its digits is 0, and its binary representation is also "0".
   - The maximum value for `N` is 10000. The sum of its digits (1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0) is 1, which in binary is "1".

4. **Implementation**:
   - Convert `N` to a string to iterate over each digit.
   - Convert each character back to an integer and calculate the sum.
   - Use `bin()` to convert the sum to a binary string and strip the '0b' prefix.
   - Return the binary string.

Let's implement the solution:

```python
def solve(N):
    # Convert the number to a string to iterate over each digit
    digits = str(N)
    
    # Calculate the sum of the digits
    digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in digits)
    
    # Convert the sum to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
    binary_representation = bin(digit_sum)[2:]
    
    # Return the binary representation as a string
    return binary_representation

# Example usage:
print(solve(1000))  # Output: "1"
print(solve(150))   # Output: "110"
print(solve(147))   # Output: "1100"
```

This function should correctly solve the problem by following the steps outlined above.
