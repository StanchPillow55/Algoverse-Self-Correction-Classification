To solve the problem of determining if a bank account balance falls below zero at any point given a list of operations, we need to simulate the account balance as we process each operation. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialize the Balance**: Start with a balance of zero since the account begins with no money.

2. **Iterate Through Operations**: Go through each operation in the list. Each operation represents either a deposit (positive number) or a withdrawal (negative number).

3. **Update the Balance**: For each operation, update the balance by adding the operation value to the current balance.

4. **Check for Negative Balance**: After updating the balance with each operation, check if the balance has fallen below zero. If it has, immediately return `True` because the problem states that we should return `True` as soon as the balance goes below zero.

5. **Return Result**: If we finish processing all operations and the balance never goes below zero, return `False`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine if the balance ever falls below zero by checking after each operation. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of operations, because we process each operation exactly once.

Now, let's implement the function:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account falls below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.
    """
    balance = 0  # Start with a zero balance
    
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation  # Update the balance with the current operation
        
        if balance < 0:  # Check if the balance is below zero
            return True  # Return True immediately if balance is below zero
    
    return False  # If we finish all operations and balance never went below zero, return False

# Example usage:
# print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # Should return False
# print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Should return True
```

This function will correctly determine if the account balance ever falls below zero during the sequence of operations.
