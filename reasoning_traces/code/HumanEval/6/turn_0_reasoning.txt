To solve the problem of determining the deepest level of nested parentheses for each group in a given string, we need to break down the task into manageable steps. Here's the thought process and approach to solving this problem:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Input Understanding**: 
   - We are given a string that contains multiple groups of parentheses, separated by spaces.
   - Each group is a valid sequence of parentheses.

2. **Output Requirement**:
   - For each group, we need to determine the deepest level of nested parentheses.
   - The output should be a list of integers, where each integer represents the maximum depth of nesting for the corresponding group.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `(()()) ((())) () ((())()())`, the output should be `[2, 3, 1, 3]`.
     - `(()())` has a maximum depth of 2.
     - `((()))` has a maximum depth of 3.
     - `()` has a maximum depth of 1.
     - `((())()())` has a maximum depth of 3.

### Approach

1. **Split the Input**:
   - Use the `split()` method to divide the input string into individual groups based on spaces.

2. **Calculate Depth for Each Group**:
   - Initialize a variable `current_depth` to track the current level of nesting as we iterate through each character in a group.
   - Initialize a variable `max_depth` to keep track of the maximum depth encountered in the current group.
   - Iterate through each character in the group:
     - If the character is `'('`, increment `current_depth`.
     - If the character is `')'`, decrement `current_depth`.
     - Update `max_depth` to be the maximum of `max_depth` and `current_depth`.
   - After processing a group, append `max_depth` to the results list.

3. **Return the Results**:
   - Return the list of maximum depths for each group.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above approach:

```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    # Split the input string into groups based on spaces
    groups = paren_string.split()
    
    # List to store the maximum depth for each group
    max_depths = []
    
    # Iterate over each group
    for group in groups:
        current_depth = 0
        max_depth = 0
        
        # Iterate over each character in the group
        for char in group:
            if char == '(':
                current_depth += 1
                max_depth = max(max_depth, current_depth)
            elif char == ')':
                current_depth -= 1
        
        # Append the maximum depth of this group to the result list
        max_depths.append(max_depth)
    
    return max_depths

# Example usage:
# print(parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'))  # Output: [2, 3, 1, 3]
```

### Explanation

- **Splitting**: We use `split()` to divide the input string into groups.
- **Depth Calculation**: For each group, we maintain a `current_depth` to track the nesting level and update `max_depth` whenever `current_depth` exceeds it.
- **Result Compilation**: After processing each group, we append the `max_depth` to our results list.
- **Output**: Finally, we return the list of maximum depths for all groups.

This solution efficiently calculates the required depths by iterating through each character of each group only once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of characters in the input string.
