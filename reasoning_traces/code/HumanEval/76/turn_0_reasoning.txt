To solve the problem of determining if a number \( x \) is a simple power of \( n \), we need to check if there exists an integer \( k \) such that \( n^k = x \).

### Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if \( x \) can be expressed as \( n^k \) for some integer \( k \).
   - If \( x = n^k \), then \( x \) is a simple power of \( n \).

2. **Special Cases:**
   - If \( x = 1 \), then \( n^0 = 1 \) for any \( n \neq 0 \). Thus, \( x = 1 \) is always a simple power of any \( n \).
   - If \( n = 1 \), then \( n^k = 1 \) for any \( k \). Thus, \( x \) must be 1 to be a simple power of 1.
   - If \( n = 0 \), then \( n^k = 0 \) for any \( k > 0 \). Thus, \( x \) must be 0 to be a simple power of 0.

3. **General Case:**
   - For \( n > 1 \), we need to check if \( x \) can be expressed as \( n^k \).
   - We can do this by iteratively dividing \( x \) by \( n \) and checking if the remainder is zero. If at any point the remainder is not zero, \( x \) is not a simple power of \( n \).
   - If we can reduce \( x \) to 1 by repeatedly dividing by \( n \), then \( x \) is a simple power of \( n \).

4. **Implementation:**
   - We will handle the special cases first.
   - Then, for the general case, we will use a loop to divide \( x \) by \( n \) until \( x \) becomes 1 or a non-zero remainder is encountered.

Here is the implementation of the function:

```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    # Handle special cases
    if x == 1:
        return True  # 1 is a power of any number (n^0)
    if n == 0:
        return x == 0  # 0 is a power of 0 (0^k for k > 0)
    if n == 1:
        return x == 1  # 1 is a power of 1 (1^k for any k)

    # General case for n > 1
    while x > 1:
        if x % n != 0:
            return False
        x //= n

    return x == 1

# Test cases
print(is_simple_power(1, 4))  # True
print(is_simple_power(2, 2))  # True
print(is_simple_power(8, 2))  # True
print(is_simple_power(3, 2))  # False
print(is_simple_power(3, 1))  # False
print(is_simple_power(5, 3))  # False
```

### Explanation:
- The function first checks for special cases where \( x = 1 \), \( n = 0 \), or \( n = 1 \).
- For the general case, it uses a loop to divide \( x \) by \( n \) as long as \( x \) is greater than 1 and the division is exact (i.e., no remainder).
- If \( x \) is reduced to 1, it means \( x \) was a simple power of \( n \). Otherwise, if a non-zero remainder is encountered, \( x \) is not a simple power of \( n \).
