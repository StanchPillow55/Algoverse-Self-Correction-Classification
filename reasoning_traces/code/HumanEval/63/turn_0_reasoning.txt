To solve the problem of computing the n-th element of the FibFib sequence, we need to understand the sequence's definition and then devise an efficient way to compute it.

### Understanding the Problem

The FibFib sequence is defined as follows:
- `fibfib(0) = 0`
- `fibfib(1) = 0`
- `fibfib(2) = 1`
- For `n >= 3`, `fibfib(n) = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3)`

This sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but involves the sum of the three preceding numbers instead of two.

### Approach

1. **Base Cases**: Directly return the pre-defined values for `n = 0`, `n = 1`, and `n = 2`.
2. **Recursive Relation**: For `n >= 3`, use the relation `fibfib(n) = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3)`.
3. **Efficiency Considerations**: 
   - A naive recursive approach would be inefficient due to repeated calculations, leading to exponential time complexity.
   - Instead, use an iterative approach with a list or three variables to store the last three computed values, updating them as we progress through the sequence.
   - This reduces the time complexity to O(n) and space complexity to O(1) if we use three variables.

### Implementation

We'll implement the function using an iterative approach with three variables to keep track of the last three values in the sequence. This will allow us to compute the sequence efficiently.

```python
def fibfib(n: int) -> int:
    """Compute the n-th element of the FibFib number sequence."""
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize the first three values
    a, b, c = 0, 0, 1
    
    # Compute the sequence iteratively
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        next_value = a + b + c
        a, b, c = b, c, next_value
    
    return c

# Test cases
print(fibfib(1))  # Expected output: 0
print(fibfib(5))  # Expected output: 4
print(fibfib(8))  # Expected output: 24
```

### Explanation

- We handle the base cases directly.
- For `n >= 3`, we initialize `a`, `b`, and `c` to represent `fibfib(n-3)`, `fibfib(n-2)`, and `fibfib(n-1)` respectively.
- We iterate from 3 to `n`, updating these variables to compute the next value in the sequence.
- Finally, we return `c`, which holds the value of `fibfib(n)` after the loop completes.

This approach efficiently computes the n-th FibFib number with minimal space and time complexity.
