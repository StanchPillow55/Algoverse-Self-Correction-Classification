To solve the problem of separating groups of nested parentheses from a given string, we need to follow a structured approach. Let's break down the problem and devise a solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input**: A string containing multiple groups of parentheses. These groups are balanced and not nested within each other. The string may contain spaces which should be ignored.

2. **Output**: A list of strings, where each string is a separate group of balanced parentheses.

3. **Constraints**:
   - Each group of parentheses is balanced.
   - Groups are not nested within each other.
   - Spaces in the input string should be ignored.

### Approach

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use a list `result` to store the separate groups of parentheses.
   - Use a counter `balance` to keep track of the balance of parentheses.
   - Use a list `current_group` to build the current group of parentheses.

2. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is a space, skip it.
     - If the character is an opening parenthesis `'('`:
       - Increment the `balance` counter.
       - Append the character to `current_group`.
     - If the character is a closing parenthesis `')'`:
       - Decrement the `balance` counter.
       - Append the character to `current_group`.
     - After updating the `balance`, check if it is zero:
       - If `balance` is zero, it means we have a complete group of balanced parentheses.
       - Convert `current_group` to a string and append it to `result`.
       - Reset `current_group` to an empty list for the next group.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - After iterating through the string, return the `result` list containing all the separate groups.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above approach:

```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    result = []
    balance = 0
    current_group = []
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == ' ':
            continue
        current_group.append(char)
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        elif char == ')':
            balance -= 1
        
        if balance == 0 and current_group:
            result.append(''.join(current_group))
            current_group = []
    
    return result

# Example usage:
# print(separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))'))  # Output: ['()', '(())', '(()())']
```

### Explanation

- We iterate over each character in the input string.
- We ignore spaces and focus on parentheses.
- We maintain a balance counter to track the opening and closing of parentheses.
- When the balance counter returns to zero, it indicates a complete group of balanced parentheses, which we then add to our result list.
- We reset the `current_group` to start collecting the next group of parentheses.

This solution efficiently separates the groups of parentheses while ignoring spaces, and ensures that each group is balanced and correctly extracted.
