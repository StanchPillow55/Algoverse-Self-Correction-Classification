==================================================

To solve the problem of calculating the sum and product of a list of integers, we need to consider a few key points:

1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**:
   - We are given a list of integers.
   - We need to return a tuple where:
     - The first element is the sum of all integers in the list.
     - The second element is the product of all integers in the list.
   - If the list is empty, the sum should be 0 and the product should be 1.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - An empty list should return (0, 1) because:
     - The sum of an empty list is conventionally 0.
     - The product of an empty list is conventionally 1 (since multiplying by 1 is the identity operation for multiplication).

3. **Approach**:
   - Initialize two variables: `total_sum` to 0 and `total_product` to 1.
   - Iterate over each number in the list:
     - Add the number to `total_sum`.
     - Multiply the number with `total_product`.
   - Return the tuple `(total_sum, total_product)`.

4. **Implementation**:
   - We will use a loop to iterate through the list and update our sum and product variables accordingly.
   - We will handle the empty list case by initializing our variables to the correct values (0 for sum and 1 for product) and directly returning them if the list is empty.

Now, let's implement the function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    """
    # Initialize sum and product
    total_sum = 0
    total_product = 1
    
    # Iterate over the list to calculate sum and product
    for number in numbers:
        total_sum += number
        total_product *= number
    
    # Return the result as a tuple
    return (total_sum, total_product)

# Example usage:
# print(sum_product([]))  # Output: (0, 1)
# print(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: (10, 24)
```

This function will correctly compute the sum and product of the list of integers, handling both non-empty and empty lists as specified.
