==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to perform the following steps:

1. **Remove Characters**: First, we need to remove all characters from string `s` that are present in string `c`. This can be efficiently done using a list comprehension or a filter function.

2. **Check for Palindrome**: After obtaining the modified string, we need to check if this string is a palindrome. A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards. We can check this by comparing the string to its reverse.

3. **Return Result**: Finally, we need to return a tuple containing the modified string and a boolean indicating whether the string is a palindrome.

Let's break down the steps with an example:

- Suppose `s = "abcde"` and `c = "ae"`.
  - Remove characters: We remove 'a' and 'e' from "abcde", resulting in "bcd".
  - Check palindrome: "bcd" is not the same as "dcb", so it is not a palindrome.
  - Return result: The result is `('bcd', False)`.

- Suppose `s = "abcdedcba"` and `c = "ab"`.
  - Remove characters: We remove 'a' and 'b', resulting in "cdedc".
  - Check palindrome: "cdedc" is the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.
  - Return result: The result is `('cdedc', True)`.

Now, let's implement the function:

```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    # Step 1: Remove characters from s that are in c
    result_string = ''.join(char for char in s if char not in c)
    
    # Step 2: Check if the result string is a palindrome
    is_palindrome = result_string == result_string[::-1]
    
    # Step 3: Return the result as a tuple
    return (result_string, is_palindrome)

# Example usage:
print(reverse_delete("abcde", "ae"))       # Output: ('bcd', False)
print(reverse_delete("abcdef", "b"))       # Output: ('acdef', False)
print(reverse_delete("abcdedcba", "ab"))   # Output: ('cdedc', True)
```

### Explanation:

- **Removing Characters**: We use a generator expression within `join` to iterate over each character in `s` and include it in the result only if it is not in `c`. This effectively filters out all unwanted characters.

- **Checking Palindrome**: We check if the resulting string is equal to its reverse. The slicing operation `[::-1]` creates a reversed copy of the string.

- **Returning the Result**: We return a tuple containing the filtered string and the boolean result of the palindrome check.

This solution is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities to achieve the desired result.
