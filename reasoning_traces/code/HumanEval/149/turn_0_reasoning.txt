==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to create a function `sorted_list_sum` that processes a list of strings according to specific rules. Let's break down the requirements and the steps needed to implement the solution:

### Problem Requirements

1. **Input**: A list of strings.
2. **Remove Strings with Odd Lengths**: We need to filter out strings whose lengths are odd.
3. **Sort the Remaining Strings**:
   - First, by the length of the strings in ascending order.
   - If two strings have the same length, sort them alphabetically.
4. **Output**: A list of strings sorted according to the above rules.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Filter Strings**: Use a list comprehension to filter out strings with odd lengths. We can use the `len()` function to determine the length of each string and check if it's even.
2. **Sort the Strings**: Use Python's built-in `sorted()` function to sort the filtered list. We need to provide a custom key to the `sorted()` function:
   - The primary key should be the length of the string (`len(s)`).
   - The secondary key should be the string itself for alphabetical sorting.
3. **Return the Result**: Return the sorted list.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    """Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,
    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,
    and returns the resulted list with a sorted order,
    The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,
    and it may contain duplicates.
    The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you
    should return the list sorted by that rule.
    If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.
    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.
    You may assume that all words will have the same length.
    For example:
    assert list_sort(["aa", "a", "aaa"]) => ["aa"]
    assert list_sort(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) => ["ab", "cd"]
    """
    # Step 1: Filter out strings with odd lengths
    filtered_lst = [s for s in lst if len(s) % 2 == 0]
    
    # Step 2: Sort the filtered list by length and then alphabetically
    sorted_lst = sorted(filtered_lst, key=lambda s: (len(s), s))
    
    # Step 3: Return the sorted list
    return sorted_lst

# Example usage and test cases
assert sorted_list_sum(["aa", "a", "aaa"]) == ["aa"]
assert sorted_list_sum(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) == ["ab", "cd"]
```

### Explanation

- **Filtering**: We use a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the input list `lst` and include it in `filtered_lst` only if its length is even (`len(s) % 2 == 0`).
- **Sorting**: The `sorted()` function is used with a custom key that first sorts by the length of the string and then by the string itself for alphabetical order.
- **Return**: The function returns the sorted list `sorted_lst`.

This solution efficiently handles the problem requirements and provides the correct output for the given examples.
