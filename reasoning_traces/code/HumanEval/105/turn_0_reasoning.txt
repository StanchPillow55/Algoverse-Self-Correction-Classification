==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to follow a series of steps to transform the input array according to the given requirements. Let's break down the problem and devise a solution step-by-step.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Filter Valid Numbers**: We need to filter the array to include only integers between 1 and 9 inclusive. This is because only these numbers have corresponding names that we need to map to.

2. **Sort the Filtered Array**: Once we have the valid numbers, we need to sort them in ascending order.

3. **Reverse the Sorted Array**: After sorting, we reverse the array to get the numbers in descending order.

4. **Map Numbers to Names**: Finally, we replace each number with its corresponding name. We can use a dictionary to map numbers to their names.

5. **Handle Edge Cases**: If the input array is empty or contains no valid numbers, we should return an empty array.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Filter the Array**: Use a list comprehension to filter out numbers that are not between 1 and 9.

2. **Sort and Reverse**: Use Python's built-in `sorted()` function to sort the filtered list and then reverse it using slicing.

3. **Mapping Numbers to Names**: Create a dictionary that maps numbers to their corresponding names. Use a list comprehension to transform the reversed list of numbers to their names.

4. **Return the Result**: Return the final list of names.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function based on the above plan:

```python
def by_length(arr):
    # Step 1: Filter the array to include only numbers between 1 and 9
    valid_numbers = [num for num in arr if 1 <= num <= 9]
    
    # Step 2: Sort the filtered numbers
    sorted_numbers = sorted(valid_numbers)
    
    # Step 3: Reverse the sorted numbers
    reversed_numbers = sorted_numbers[::-1]
    
    # Step 4: Map numbers to their corresponding names
    number_to_name = {
        1: "One",
        2: "Two",
        3: "Three",
        4: "Four",
        5: "Five",
        6: "Six",
        7: "Seven",
        8: "Eight",
        9: "Nine"
    }
    
    # Transform the reversed numbers to their names
    result = [number_to_name[num] for num in reversed_numbers]
    
    # Step 5: Return the result
    return result

# Example usage:
# arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]
# print(by_length(arr))  # Output: ["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One"]
```

### Explanation

- **Filtering**: We use a list comprehension to filter out numbers that are not between 1 and 9.
- **Sorting and Reversing**: We sort the filtered list and then reverse it using slicing (`[::-1]`).
- **Mapping**: We use a dictionary to map each number to its corresponding name and transform the list of numbers to a list of names.
- **Edge Cases**: The function naturally handles empty arrays and arrays with no valid numbers by returning an empty list.
