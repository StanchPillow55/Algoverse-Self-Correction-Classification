To solve the problem of calculating the area of a triangle given its three sides, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Check Triangle Validity**: 
   - A set of three sides can form a triangle if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. This is known as the triangle inequality theorem.
   - Specifically, for sides `a`, `b`, and `c`, the conditions are:
     - \( a + b > c \)
     - \( a + c > b \)
     - \( b + c > a \)
   - If any of these conditions are not met, the sides do not form a valid triangle, and we should return `-1`.

2. **Calculate the Area**:
   - If the sides form a valid triangle, we can use Heron's formula to calculate the area. Heron's formula states:
     - First, calculate the semi-perimeter \( s \) of the triangle:
       \[
       s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
       \]
     - Then, the area \( A \) of the triangle is given by:
       \[
       A = \sqrt{s \cdot (s - a) \cdot (s - b) \cdot (s - c)}
       \]
   - This formula is derived from the properties of triangles and allows us to compute the area using only the side lengths.

3. **Round the Result**:
   - The problem specifies that the area should be rounded to two decimal places. We can use Python's built-in `round()` function to achieve this.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Implement the function `triangle_area(a, b, c)` that follows the above logic.

Now, let's implement the solution:

```python
import math

def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    # Check if the sides form a valid triangle
    if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:
        # Calculate the semi-perimeter
        s = (a + b + c) / 2
        # Calculate the area using Heron's formula
        area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
        # Return the area rounded to 2 decimal places
        return round(area, 2)
    else:
        # If not a valid triangle, return -1
        return -1

# Example usage:
# print(triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # Should return 6.00
# print(triangle_area(1, 2, 10)) # Should return -1
```

This function first checks if the given sides can form a valid triangle using the triangle inequality theorem. If they do, it calculates the area using Heron's formula and returns the result rounded to two decimal places. If the sides do not form a valid triangle, it returns `-1`.
