To solve the problem of calculating the area of a triangle given its three sides, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Check for Triangle Validity**: 
   - A set of three sides can form a triangle if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. This is known as the triangle inequality theorem. Specifically, for sides `a`, `b`, and `c`, the conditions are:
     - \( a + b > c \)
     - \( a + c > b \)
     - \( b + c > a \)
   - If any of these conditions are not met, the sides do not form a valid triangle, and we should return `-1`.

2. **Calculate the Area Using Heron's Formula**:
   - If the sides form a valid triangle, we can calculate the area using Heron's formula. The steps are:
     - Compute the semi-perimeter \( s \) of the triangle: 
       \[
       s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
       \]
     - Calculate the area \( A \) using the formula:
       \[
       A = \sqrt{s \times (s - a) \times (s - b) \times (s - c)}
       \]
   - This formula is derived from the properties of triangles and allows us to calculate the area using only the side lengths.

3. **Round the Result**:
   - The problem specifies that the area should be rounded to two decimal places. We can use Python's built-in `round()` function to achieve this.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - If the triangle is valid, return the rounded area. If not, return `-1`.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
import math

def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    # Check if the sides form a valid triangle
    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate the semi-perimeter
    s = (a + b + c) / 2
    
    # Calculate the area using Heron's formula
    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
    
    # Return the area rounded to 2 decimal places
    return round(area, 2)

# Example usage:
# print(triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # Should return 6.00
# print(triangle_area(1, 2, 10)) # Should return -1
```

This function first checks if the given sides can form a valid triangle. If they do, it calculates the area using Heron's formula and returns the result rounded to two decimal places. If the sides do not form a valid triangle, it returns `-1`.
