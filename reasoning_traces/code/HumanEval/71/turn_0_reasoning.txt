==================================================

To solve the problem of calculating the area of a triangle given its three sides, we need to follow a structured approach. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Validate the Triangle

Before calculating the area, we need to ensure that the given sides can form a valid triangle. According to the triangle inequality theorem, for three sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to form a triangle, the following conditions must be met:

1. \(a + b > c\)
2. \(a + c > b\)
3. \(b + c > a\)

If any of these conditions fail, the sides do not form a valid triangle, and we should return -1.

### Step 2: Calculate the Area Using Heron's Formula

If the sides form a valid triangle, we can calculate the area using Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that the area \(A\) of a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is:

\[ s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \]

\[ A = \sqrt{s \cdot (s - a) \cdot (s - b) \cdot (s - c)} \]

Where \(s\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.

### Step 3: Round the Result

Finally, we need to round the computed area to two decimal places before returning it.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function `triangle_area` based on the above reasoning:

```python
import math

def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Validate the triangle
    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return -1
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the area using Heron's formula
    s = (a + b + c) / 2
    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
    
    # Step 3: Round the result to 2 decimal places
    return round(area, 2)

# Example usage:
# print(triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # Output: 6.00
# print(triangle_area(1, 2, 10)) # Output: -1
```

### Explanation

- **Validation**: We first check if the sides satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. If not, we return -1.
- **Heron's Formula**: We calculate the semi-perimeter \(s\) and then use it to compute the area.
- **Rounding**: The area is rounded to two decimal places using Python's built-in `round` function.

This implementation efficiently checks for a valid triangle and calculates the area if possible, adhering to the problem's requirements.
