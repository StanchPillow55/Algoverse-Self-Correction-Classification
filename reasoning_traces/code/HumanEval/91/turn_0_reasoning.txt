To solve the problem of counting the number of "boredoms" in a string, we need to identify sentences that start with the word "I". Sentences are delimited by '.', '?', or '!'. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Input and Output:**
   - Input: A string `S` containing sentences.
   - Output: An integer representing the number of sentences that start with the word "I".

2. **Identify Sentence Delimiters:**
   - Sentences are separated by '.', '?', or '!'. These characters indicate the end of a sentence.

3. **Split the String into Sentences:**
   - We can use Python's `re.split()` function from the `re` module to split the string into sentences based on the delimiters.

4. **Trim and Check Each Sentence:**
   - After splitting the string, each sentence might have leading or trailing whitespace. We should strip these whitespaces.
   - Check if the stripped sentence starts with the word "I". If it does, increment the boredom count.

5. **Return the Count:**
   - Finally, return the count of sentences that start with "I".

### Implementation:

Let's implement the function `is_bored` following the above approach:

```python
import re

def is_bored(S):
    """
    Count the number of sentences that start with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
    """
    # Split the string into sentences using regex to handle '.', '?', and '!' as delimiters
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]', S)
    
    # Initialize boredom count
    boredom_count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each sentence
    for sentence in sentences:
        # Strip leading and trailing whitespace
        stripped_sentence = sentence.strip()
        
        # Check if the sentence starts with "I"
        if stripped_sentence.startswith("I"):
            boredom_count += 1
    
    return boredom_count

# Test cases
print(is_bored("Hello world"))  # Output: 0
print(is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather"))  # Output: 1
```

### Explanation:

- **Regex Split:** We use `re.split(r'[.?!]', S)` to split the input string `S` into sentences. The regex pattern `[.?!]` matches any of the sentence delimiters.
- **Whitespace Stripping:** For each sentence obtained from the split, we use `strip()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
- **Sentence Check:** We check if the stripped sentence starts with "I" using `startswith("I")`. If it does, we increment the `boredom_count`.
- **Return Value:** Finally, we return the `boredom_count` which gives the number of sentences starting with "I".

This solution efficiently counts the number of "boredoms" by leveraging regular expressions and string manipulation functions.
