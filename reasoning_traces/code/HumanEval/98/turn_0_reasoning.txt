To solve the problem of counting the number of uppercase vowels at even indices in a given string, we need to break down the task into manageable steps. Here's the thought process:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Problem Requirements:**
   - We need to count uppercase vowels ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U') in the string.
   - The vowels should be located at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).

2. **Identify the Input and Output:**
   - **Input:** A string `s`.
   - **Output:** An integer representing the count of uppercase vowels at even indices.

3. **Plan the Approach:**
   - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of uppercase vowels at even indices.
   - Iterate over the string using a loop that checks each character at even indices.
   - For each character at an even index, check if it is an uppercase vowel.
   - If it is, increment the counter.
   - Return the counter after the loop completes.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - Use a loop with a step of 2 to iterate over even indices.
   - Use a set to store uppercase vowels for quick membership testing.
   - Check if the character at the current index is in the set of uppercase vowels.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - An empty string should return 0 since there are no characters to check.
   - Strings with no uppercase vowels or no characters at even indices should also return 0.

Now, let's implement the function based on this plan:

```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    
    For example:
    count_upper('aBCdEf') returns 1
    count_upper('abcdefg') returns 0
    count_upper('dBBE') returns 0
    """
    # Set of uppercase vowels
    uppercase_vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'}
    
    # Initialize counter
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over even indices
    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):
        # Check if the character at the current index is an uppercase vowel
        if s[i] in uppercase_vowels:
            count += 1
    
    return count

# Testing the function with provided examples
print(count_upper('aBCdEf'))  # Expected output: 1
print(count_upper('abcdefg'))  # Expected output: 0
print(count_upper('dBBE'))     # Expected output: 0
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:
- We define a set `uppercase_vowels` containing the uppercase vowels for quick lookup.
- We initialize a counter `count` to zero.
- We use a `for` loop with `range(0, len(s), 2)` to iterate over even indices of the string.
- Inside the loop, we check if the character at the current index is in the `uppercase_vowels` set.
- If it is, we increment the `count`.
- Finally, we return the `count` after the loop completes.

This solution efficiently counts the uppercase vowels at even indices in the string.
