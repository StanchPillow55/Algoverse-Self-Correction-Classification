==================================================

To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of changes needed to make an array palindromic, we need to understand the properties of a palindromic array. A palindromic array reads the same forwards and backwards, meaning that the first element should be equal to the last element, the second element should be equal to the second-to-last element, and so on.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Identify Pairs**: For an array of length `n`, we need to compare pairs of elements: the first with the last, the second with the second-to-last, and so on. Specifically, we compare `arr[i]` with `arr[n-1-i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n//2 - 1`.

2. **Count Mismatches**: For each pair `(arr[i], arr[n-1-i])`, if the elements are not equal, it indicates a mismatch that requires a change to make them equal. We need to count these mismatches.

3. **Calculate Minimum Changes**: The number of mismatches directly translates to the minimum number of changes needed, as each mismatch can be resolved by changing one of the elements in the pair to match the other.

4. **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases such as empty arrays or arrays with a single element, which are inherently palindromic and require zero changes.

### Implementation:

Let's implement the function `smallest_change` based on the above reasoning:

```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic.
    """
    n = len(arr)
    changes = 0
    
    # Compare elements from the start and end moving towards the center
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if arr[i] != arr[n - 1 - i]:
            changes += 1
    
    return changes

# Test cases
print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6]))  # Expected output: 4
print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]))    # Expected output: 1
print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]))          # Expected output: 0
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:

- We first determine the length of the array `n`.
- We initialize a counter `changes` to zero to keep track of the number of mismatches.
- We iterate over the first half of the array (up to `n // 2`) and compare each element with its corresponding element from the end of the array.
- If a mismatch is found (`arr[i] != arr[n - 1 - i]`), we increment the `changes` counter.
- Finally, we return the `changes` counter, which represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic.

This approach efficiently counts the necessary changes in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the array.
