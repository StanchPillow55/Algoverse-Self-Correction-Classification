To solve the problem of removing vowels from a given string, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the problem and think through the solution step by step.

### Problem Understanding

The task is to create a function `remove_vowels` that takes a string as input and returns a new string with all vowels removed. Vowels in the English alphabet are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' and their uppercase counterparts 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Identify Vowels**: We need to identify both lowercase and uppercase vowels. We can store these in a set for quick lookup.

2. **Iterate Through the String**: We will iterate through each character in the input string.

3. **Check for Vowels**: For each character, check if it is a vowel by seeing if it exists in our set of vowels.

4. **Build the Result String**: If the character is not a vowel, append it to a result list. If it is a vowel, skip it.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, join the list of characters into a string and return it.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function following the above steps:

```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    """
    remove_vowels is a function that takes a string and returns a string without vowels.
    """
    # Define a set of vowels for quick lookup
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store non-vowel characters
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input text
    for char in text:
        # If the character is not a vowel, add it to the result list
        if char not in vowels:
            result.append(char)
    
    # Join the list into a string and return it
    return ''.join(result)

# Test cases
print(remove_vowels(''))  # Output: ''
print(remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm"))  # Output: 'bcdf\nghjklm'
print(remove_vowels('abcdef'))  # Output: 'bcdf'
print(remove_vowels('aaaaa'))  # Output: ''
print(remove_vowels('aaBAA'))  # Output: 'B'
print(remove_vowels('zbcd'))  # Output: 'zbcd'
```

### Explanation

- **Vowel Set**: We use a set `vowels` containing all vowels for quick membership testing. Sets provide average O(1) time complexity for membership checks, making our solution efficient.

- **Result List**: We use a list `result` to collect non-vowel characters. Lists are mutable and allow efficient appending of elements.

- **String Join**: After filtering out vowels, we use `''.join(result)` to concatenate the list of characters into a single string.

This approach ensures that we efficiently remove vowels from the input string while maintaining the order of non-vowel characters.
