==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem Requirements:**
   - We have eight planets in our solar system, ordered by their proximity to the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
   - The function `bf` takes two planet names as input and returns a tuple of planet names that are located between the orbits of the two given planets.
   - The planets in the returned tuple should be sorted by their proximity to the Sun.
   - If either of the input planet names is incorrect (i.e., not one of the eight planets), the function should return an empty tuple.

2. **Plan the Solution:**
   - First, create a list of the planets in order of their proximity to the Sun.
   - Check if both `planet1` and `planet2` are valid planet names by verifying their presence in the list.
   - If either planet name is invalid, return an empty tuple.
   - Find the indices of `planet1` and `planet2` in the list.
   - Determine the range of indices between the two planets. Since the order matters, we need to handle the case where `planet1` is further from the Sun than `planet2`.
   - Extract the planets that lie between the two indices and return them as a tuple.

3. **Implement the Solution:**

Here is the implementation of the function based on the above plan:

```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    # List of planets in order of proximity to the Sun
    planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]
    
    # Check if both planet1 and planet2 are valid
    if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:
        return ()
    
    # Find the indices of the two planets
    index1 = planets.index(planet1)
    index2 = planets.index(planet2)
    
    # Determine the range of indices between the two planets
    if index1 < index2:
        # If planet1 is closer to the Sun than planet2
        result = planets[index1 + 1:index2]
    else:
        # If planet2 is closer to the Sun than planet1
        result = planets[index2 + 1:index1]
    
    # Return the result as a tuple
    return tuple(result)

# Example usage:
print(bf("Jupiter", "Neptune"))  # Output: ("Saturn", "Uranus")
print(bf("Earth", "Mercury"))    # Output: ("Venus")
print(bf("Mercury", "Uranus"))   # Output: ("Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn")
```

**Explanation of the Code:**
- We first define the list `planets` with the correct order of planets.
- We check if both input planets are in this list. If not, we return an empty tuple.
- We find the indices of the two planets in the list.
- Depending on which planet is closer to the Sun, we slice the list to get the planets in between.
- Finally, we convert the list of intermediate planets to a tuple and return it.
