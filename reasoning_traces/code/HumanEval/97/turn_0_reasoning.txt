==================================================

To solve the problem of multiplying the unit digits of two integers, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to extract the unit (or last) digit from each of the two integers provided as input and then multiply these two digits together. The unit digit of a number is the digit in the ones place, which can be obtained using the modulus operation with 10.

2. **Extract the Unit Digits**: 
   - For any integer `a`, the unit digit can be obtained using `a % 10`.
   - Similarly, for integer `b`, the unit digit is `b % 10`.

3. **Multiply the Unit Digits**: Once we have the unit digits of both numbers, we simply multiply them to get the result.

4. **Consider Edge Cases**: 
   - If either number is negative, the unit digit should still be considered positive. For example, the unit digit of `-15` is `5`, not `-5`.
   - If either number ends in zero, the product will be zero since any number multiplied by zero is zero.

5. **Implement the Solution**: With the above understanding, we can now implement the function.

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def multiply(a, b):
    """Complete the function that takes two integers and returns 
    the product of their unit digits.
    Assume the input is always valid.
    """
    # Extract the unit digits
    unit_digit_a = abs(a) % 10
    unit_digit_b = abs(b) % 10
    
    # Multiply the unit digits
    product = unit_digit_a * unit_digit_b
    
    return product

# Test cases
print(multiply(148, 412))  # Expected output: 16
print(multiply(19, 28))    # Expected output: 72
print(multiply(2020, 1851))# Expected output: 0
print(multiply(14, -15))   # Expected output: 20
```

### Explanation:
- We use `abs()` to ensure that we are dealing with positive unit digits, even if the original numbers are negative.
- The modulus operation `% 10` is used to extract the last digit of each number.
- The result is the product of these two unit digits, which is returned by the function.
