To solve the problem of sorting the elements at even indices of a list while keeping the elements at odd indices unchanged, we need to follow a structured approach. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to tackle this problem:

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a list `l`.
   - We need to return a new list `l'` such that:
     - Elements at odd indices in `l` remain unchanged in `l'`.
     - Elements at even indices in `l` are sorted in `l'`.

2. **Identify Even and Odd Indices:**
   - Even indices are 0, 2, 4, etc.
   - Odd indices are 1, 3, 5, etc.

3. **Extract Elements at Even Indices:**
   - Traverse the list and collect elements that are at even indices.

4. **Sort the Extracted Even Index Elements:**
   - Sort the list of elements collected from even indices.

5. **Reconstruct the List:**
   - Create a new list where:
     - Elements at even indices are replaced by the sorted elements.
     - Elements at odd indices remain the same as in the original list.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - Consider lists with very few elements (e.g., empty list, single element, two elements).
   - Ensure the function handles these gracefully without errors.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function following the above plan:

```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indices, while its values at the even indices are equal
    to the values of the even indices of l, but sorted.
    """
    # Step 1: Extract elements at even indices
    even_index_elements = [l[i] for i in range(0, len(l), 2)]
    
    # Step 2: Sort the extracted even index elements
    even_index_elements.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Reconstruct the list
    result = l[:]  # Start with a copy of the original list
    even_index = 0  # Pointer for sorted even index elements
    
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 2 == 0:  # Check if the index is even
            result[i] = even_index_elements[even_index]
            even_index += 1
    
    return result

# Example usage
print(sort_even([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]))  # Output: [3, 6, 5, 4]
```

### Explanation

- **List Comprehension:** We use a list comprehension to extract elements at even indices.
- **Sorting:** The extracted list of even-indexed elements is sorted using Python's built-in `sort()` method.
- **Reconstruction:** We iterate over the original list, replacing elements at even indices with the sorted values while keeping odd-indexed elements unchanged.
- **Efficiency:** This approach efficiently separates concerns (extraction, sorting, reconstruction) and handles edge cases naturally due to the use of list comprehensions and Python's dynamic list handling.
