To solve the problem of determining if two strings have the same characters, we need to ensure that each character present in one string is also present in the other string, regardless of the order or frequency of the characters. Essentially, we are checking if the sets of characters in both strings are identical.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Convert Strings to Sets**: 
   - Convert each string into a set of characters. This will automatically remove any duplicate characters and give us the unique characters present in each string.
   - For example, converting the string `'eabcdzzzz'` to a set will result in `{'e', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'z'}`.

2. **Compare the Sets**:
   - Once we have the sets of characters from both strings, we simply need to check if these two sets are equal.
   - If the sets are equal, it means both strings contain exactly the same unique characters.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - If the sets are equal, return `True`.
   - Otherwise, return `False`.

This approach is efficient because converting a string to a set and comparing two sets are both operations that can be performed in linear time relative to the number of unique characters in the strings.

Now, let's implement the function `same_chars` using this approach:

```python
def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str) -> bool:
    """
    Check if two words have the same characters.
    """
    # Convert both strings to sets of characters
    set_s0 = set(s0)
    set_s1 = set(s1)
    
    # Compare the sets
    return set_s0 == set_s1

# Test cases
print(same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc'))  # True
print(same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc'))               # True
print(same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd'))               # True
print(same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc'))              # False
print(same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce'))              # False
print(same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc'))   # False
```

This function will correctly determine if two strings have the same set of characters, as demonstrated by the provided test cases.
