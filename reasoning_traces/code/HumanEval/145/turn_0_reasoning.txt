To solve the problem of sorting a list of integers based on the sum of their digits, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the problem and think through the steps needed to implement the solution.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Understanding the Input and Output:**
   - Input: A list of integers, which can include positive, negative, and zero values.
   - Output: A list of integers sorted based on the sum of their digits. If two numbers have the same digit sum, they should maintain their relative order from the original list.

2. **Digit Sum Calculation:**
   - For each integer, we need to calculate the sum of its digits. This includes handling negative numbers correctly by considering only the absolute value of the number for digit sum calculation.

3. **Sorting Criteria:**
   - Primary criterion: Sort by the sum of digits.
   - Secondary criterion: Maintain the original order for numbers with the same digit sum.

4. **Implementation Strategy:**
   - Use Python's sorting capabilities with a custom key function that calculates the sum of digits.
   - Use the `enumerate` function to keep track of the original indices to maintain stability in sorting.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Define a Helper Function:**
   - Create a helper function to calculate the sum of digits of a number. This function should handle negative numbers by using the absolute value.

2. **Sort with a Custom Key:**
   - Use the `sorted` function with a custom key that returns a tuple: `(digit_sum, original_index)`. This ensures that the primary sort is by digit sum, and the secondary sort (in case of ties) is by the original index.

3. **Return the Sorted List:**
   - Extract and return the sorted numbers from the sorted list of tuples.

Let's implement the solution based on this reasoning:

```python
def order_by_points(nums):
    def digit_sum(n):
        # Calculate the sum of digits of the absolute value of n
        return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(n)))
    
    # Enumerate nums to keep track of original indices
    indexed_nums = list(enumerate(nums))
    
    # Sort by digit sum, then by original index
    sorted_indexed_nums = sorted(indexed_nums, key=lambda x: (digit_sum(x[1]), x[0]))
    
    # Extract the sorted numbers
    sorted_nums = [num for index, num in sorted_indexed_nums]
    
    return sorted_nums

# Example usage:
print(order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]))  # Output: [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
print(order_by_points([]))  # Output: []
```

### Explanation

- **digit_sum Function:** This function computes the sum of digits for a given number by converting it to a string, taking the absolute value, and summing the integer values of each character.
- **Sorting Logic:** We use `sorted` with a key that is a tuple `(digit_sum, original_index)`. This ensures that the list is primarily sorted by the digit sum and secondarily by the original index, maintaining the relative order of elements with the same digit sum.
- **Result Extraction:** After sorting, we extract the numbers from the sorted list of tuples to get the final sorted list.

This approach efficiently solves the problem while adhering to the requirements specified.
