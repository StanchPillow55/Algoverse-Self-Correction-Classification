==================================================

To solve the problem of interspersing a delimiter between every two consecutive elements of a list, we need to carefully consider the structure of the input list and how we want the output to look.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input**: 
   - A list of integers, `numbers`.
   - An integer, `delimiter`, which needs to be inserted between every two elements of the list.

2. **Output**:
   - A new list where the `delimiter` is inserted between each pair of consecutive elements from the input list.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the input list `numbers` is empty, the output should also be an empty list.
   - If the input list contains only one element, the output should be the same single-element list, as there are no pairs of elements to insert a delimiter between.

### Approach

1. **Check for Edge Cases**:
   - If the list is empty, return an empty list immediately.
   - If the list has only one element, return the list as is.

2. **Iterate Through the List**:
   - We need to iterate through the list and insert the delimiter between each pair of elements.
   - We can achieve this by iterating through the list indices and appending elements and delimiters to a new list.

3. **Construct the Result**:
   - Initialize an empty list `result`.
   - Loop through the indices of the list `numbers` up to the second-to-last element.
   - For each element at index `i`, append `numbers[i]` to `result`.
   - Append the `delimiter` after each element except the last one.
   - Finally, append the last element of `numbers` to the `result` list.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the constructed `result` list.

### Implementation

Here's how we can implement the above logic in Python:

```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Insert a number 'delimiter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers` """
    # Handle edge cases
    if not numbers:
        return []
    if len(numbers) == 1:
        return numbers
    
    # Initialize the result list
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through the list and add elements and delimiters
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        result.append(numbers[i])
        result.append(delimiter)
    
    # Append the last element of the numbers list
    result.append(numbers[-1])
    
    return result

# Example usage:
# print(intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4))  # Output: [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
```

### Explanation

- We first check if the list is empty or has only one element and handle those cases directly.
- For lists with more than one element, we iterate through the list up to the second-to-last element.
- We append each element followed by the delimiter to the `result` list.
- Finally, we append the last element of the `numbers` list to ensure the sequence ends correctly.
- This approach efficiently constructs the desired output list with the delimiter interspersed between elements.
