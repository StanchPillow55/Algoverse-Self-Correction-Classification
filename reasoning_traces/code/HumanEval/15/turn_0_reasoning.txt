To solve the problem of generating a space-delimited string of numbers from 0 up to a given number `n`, we can break down the task into a few clear steps:

1. **Understand the Input and Output**:
   - Input: A single integer `n`.
   - Output: A string containing numbers starting from 0 up to `n`, separated by spaces.

2. **Plan the Approach**:
   - We need to generate a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to `n`. This can be easily achieved using Python's `range` function, which generates a sequence of numbers.
   - Convert each number in this sequence to a string. This is necessary because we want to join these numbers into a single string, and the `join` method works with strings.
   - Use the `join` method to concatenate these string representations of numbers with a space as the delimiter.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Use `range(n + 1)` to generate numbers from 0 to `n` inclusive.
   - Convert each number to a string using a list comprehension or generator expression.
   - Use `' '.join(...)` to create the final space-delimited string.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n` is 0, the output should be just `'0'`.
   - The function should handle any non-negative integer `n`.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to n inclusive. """
    # Generate numbers from 0 to n
    numbers = range(n + 1)
    # Convert each number to a string and join them with a space
    result = ' '.join(str(num) for num in numbers)
    return result

# Example usage:
# print(string_sequence(0))  # Output: '0'
# print(string_sequence(5))  # Output: '0 1 2 3 4 5'
```

### Explanation:
- **`range(n + 1)`**: This generates numbers from 0 to `n` inclusive.
- **`str(num) for num in numbers`**: This is a generator expression that converts each number to a string.
- **`' '.join(...)`**: This joins all the string representations of numbers with a space in between, resulting in the desired output format.

This solution is efficient and concise, leveraging Python's built-in functions to handle the task effectively.
