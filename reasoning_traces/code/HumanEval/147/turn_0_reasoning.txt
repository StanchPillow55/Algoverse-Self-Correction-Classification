To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We are given a positive integer `n` and need to create an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a[i]` is calculated using the formula `a[i] = i * i - i + 1`. We then need to find the number of triples `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` such that `i < j < k` and the sum `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is a multiple of 3.

2. **Generate the Array**: First, we will generate the array `a` using the given formula. This is straightforward as we can iterate from 1 to `n` and compute each element.

3. **Check for Multiples of 3**: For each possible triple `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` where `i < j < k`, we need to check if the sum `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is divisible by 3.

4. **Optimize the Search for Triples**: Instead of checking every possible combination of triples, we can use properties of numbers modulo 3. Specifically, if we know the remainder of each `a[i]` when divided by 3, we can use these remainders to determine if their sum is divisible by 3.

5. **Count the Remainders**: We can count how many numbers in `a` have a remainder of 0, 1, and 2 when divided by 3. Let's denote these counts as `count_0`, `count_1`, and `count_2`.

6. **Calculate Valid Triples**:
   - **All three numbers have the same remainder**: We can choose any three numbers from those with the same remainder. For example, if we have `count_0` numbers with remainder 0, the number of ways to choose 3 of them is `C(count_0, 3)`.
   - **One number from each remainder**: We can choose one number with remainder 0, one with remainder 1, and one with remainder 2. The number of such triples is `count_0 * count_1 * count_2`.

7. **Implementation**: We will implement the above logic in a function.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    # Step 1: Generate the array a
    a = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    
    # Step 2: Count the remainders when divided by 3
    count_0 = count_1 = count_2 = 0
    for num in a:
        remainder = num % 3
        if remainder == 0:
            count_0 += 1
        elif remainder == 1:
            count_1 += 1
        else:
            count_2 += 1
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the number of valid triples
    # All three numbers have the same remainder
    def combinations(n, r):
        if n < r:
            return 0
        if r == 0:
            return 1
        return (n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)) // 6
    
    triples = 0
    triples += combinations(count_0, 3)
    triples += combinations(count_1, 3)
    triples += combinations(count_2, 3)
    
    # One number from each remainder
    triples += count_0 * count_1 * count_2
    
    return triples

# Example usage:
print(get_max_triples(5))  # Output: 1
```

This function first generates the array `a`, counts the occurrences of each remainder when divided by 3, and then calculates the number of valid triples using the combinations of these counts.
