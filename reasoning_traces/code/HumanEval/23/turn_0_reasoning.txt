To solve the problem of determining the length of a given string, we need to understand the task and the tools available in Python to achieve this.

### Problem Understanding

The task is to implement a function `strlen` that takes a single argument, a string, and returns the length of that string. The length of a string is defined as the number of characters it contains. This includes all characters, such as letters, numbers, spaces, and special characters.

### Approach

1. **Input and Output**: 
   - Input: A string `string`.
   - Output: An integer representing the length of the string.

2. **Python Built-in Function**:
   - Python provides a built-in function `len()` that returns the number of items in an object. When used with a string, it returns the number of characters in the string.
   - This function is efficient and handles all edge cases, such as empty strings, automatically.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Define the function `strlen` that takes a single parameter `string`.
   - Use the `len()` function to calculate the length of the string.
   - Return the result obtained from `len()`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - An empty string should return a length of 0.
   - Strings with spaces, special characters, or numbers should correctly count each character.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string
    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> strlen('abc')
    3
    """
    return len(string)
```

### Explanation

- The function `strlen` is defined to take a single argument `string`.
- Inside the function, `len(string)` is called, which computes the number of characters in the string.
- The result from `len(string)` is returned as the output of the function.

This solution is optimal and leverages Python's built-in capabilities to handle the task efficiently. The use of `len()` ensures that the function is concise and handles all edge cases correctly.
