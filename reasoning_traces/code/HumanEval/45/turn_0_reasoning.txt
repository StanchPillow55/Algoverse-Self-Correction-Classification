To solve the problem of calculating the area of a triangle given the length of a side (base) and the height, we need to understand the formula for the area of a triangle. The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:

\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

In this problem, the base of the triangle is represented by the variable `a`, and the height is represented by the variable `h`. Therefore, the formula to calculate the area of the triangle in this context is:

\[ \text{area} = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h \]

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Understand the Inputs**: We are given two inputs: `a` (the length of the base of the triangle) and `h` (the height of the triangle).

2. **Apply the Formula**: Use the formula for the area of a triangle to compute the area using the given base and height.

3. **Return the Result**: The function should return the computed area.

4. **Consider Edge Cases**: 
   - If either `a` or `h` is zero, the area should be zero because a triangle with zero base or height doesn't enclose any space.
   - If either `a` or `h` is negative, it might be considered invalid in a real-world scenario, but mathematically, the formula still holds. However, in practical applications, lengths and heights are non-negative.

5. **Implement the Function**: Write the function `triangle_area` that takes two parameters `a` and `h` and returns the calculated area.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Given length of a side and height, return area for a triangle.
    
    Parameters:
    a (float): The length of the base of the triangle.
    h (float): The height of the triangle.
    
    Returns:
    float: The area of the triangle.
    
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """
    # Calculate the area using the formula for the area of a triangle
    area = 0.5 * a * h
    return area
```

### Explanation:

- The function `triangle_area` takes two arguments, `a` and `h`.
- It calculates the area using the formula \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h \).
- It returns the calculated area.
- The docstring includes a brief description of the function, the parameters, and an example usage with expected output.
