==================================================

To solve the problem of calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) around the mean of a dataset, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation for a list of numbers. The MAD is defined as the average of the absolute differences between each number in the list and the mean of the list.

2. **Break Down the Steps**:
   - **Calculate the Mean**: First, we need to calculate the mean (average) of the list of numbers. The mean is the sum of all numbers divided by the count of numbers.
   - **Calculate Absolute Deviations**: For each number in the list, calculate the absolute difference between the number and the mean.
   - **Calculate the Average of Absolute Deviations**: Finally, compute the average of these absolute differences to get the MAD.

3. **Consider Edge Cases**:
   - An empty list: The function should handle this gracefully, possibly by returning 0 or raising an exception since the mean and MAD are undefined for an empty list.
   - A list with one element: The MAD should be 0 because the deviation of a single element from itself is 0.

4. **Implement the Solution**:
   - Use Python's built-in functions to calculate the mean and iterate over the list to compute absolute deviations.
   - Return the average of these deviations.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    """
    if not numbers:
        # Handle the edge case of an empty list
        return 0.0
    
    # Step 1: Calculate the mean of the numbers
    mean_value = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the absolute deviations from the mean
    absolute_deviations = [abs(x - mean_value) for x in numbers]
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the mean of these absolute deviations
    mad = sum(absolute_deviations) / len(numbers)
    
    return mad

# Example usage:
# print(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))  # Output should be 1.0
```

### Explanation:
- **Line 5-6**: We check if the list is empty. If it is, we return 0.0. This is a design choice to avoid division by zero and handle the edge case.
- **Line 9**: We calculate the mean of the numbers using the formula: `mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)`.
- **Line 12**: We compute the absolute deviation for each number using a list comprehension.
- **Line 15**: We calculate the mean of the absolute deviations to get the MAD.

This solution efficiently calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation by leveraging Python's list comprehensions and built-in functions.
