To solve the problem of finding the n-th number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime, we need to break down the task into several steps:

1. **Generate Fibonacci Numbers**: We need a way to generate Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
   - F(0) = 0
   - F(1) = 1
   - F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n >= 2

2. **Check for Primality**: We need a function to check if a number is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

3. **Combine Both Conditions**: As we generate Fibonacci numbers, we need to check if they are prime. We keep track of how many such numbers we have found until we reach the n-th one.

4. **Return the Result**: Once we find the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime, we return it.

Let's implement these steps:

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Primality Check Function**: We will write a helper function `is_prime` to determine if a number is prime.

2. **Fibonacci Generator**: We will write a generator function `fibonacci_generator` to yield Fibonacci numbers one by one.

3. **Main Function**: In the `prime_fib` function, we will use the Fibonacci generator and check each number for primality. We will count how many prime Fibonacci numbers we have found and return the n-th one.

Here's the complete implementation:

```python
def is_prime(num: int) -> bool:
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def fibonacci_generator():
    """Generator to yield Fibonacci numbers."""
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield b
        a, b = b, a + b

def prime_fib(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime."""
    count = 0
    for fib in fibonacci_generator():
        if is_prime(fib):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return fib

# Example usage:
print(prime_fib(1))  # Output: 2
print(prime_fib(2))  # Output: 3
print(prime_fib(3))  # Output: 5
print(prime_fib(4))  # Output: 13
print(prime_fib(5))  # Output: 89
```

### Explanation

- **`is_prime` Function**: This function checks if a number is prime. It handles small numbers directly and uses a loop to check divisibility for larger numbers, optimizing by checking up to the square root of the number.

- **`fibonacci_generator` Function**: This generator yields Fibonacci numbers indefinitely. It starts with the first two Fibonacci numbers (1 and 1) and continues to generate the next number by summing the last two.

- **`prime_fib` Function**: This function uses the Fibonacci generator to get each Fibonacci number and checks if it is prime. It keeps a count of how many prime Fibonacci numbers have been found and returns the n-th one.

This solution efficiently combines the generation of Fibonacci numbers with a primality test to solve the problem as described.
