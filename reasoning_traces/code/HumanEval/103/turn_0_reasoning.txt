To solve the problem, we need to compute the average of integers from `n` to `m` (inclusive), round the result to the nearest integer, and then convert that integer to its binary representation. If `n` is greater than `m`, we should return `-1`.

Let's break down the steps needed to implement this:

1. **Check the Order of n and m**: 
   - If `n` is greater than `m`, return `-1` immediately since the range is invalid.

2. **Calculate the Sum of the Range**:
   - Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the sum of integers from `n` to `m`. The formula is:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{(m - n + 1) \times (n + m)}{2}
     \]
   - This formula works because the sum of an arithmetic series is the number of terms times the average of the first and last term.

3. **Calculate the Average**:
   - Divide the sum by the number of terms, which is `(m - n + 1)`, to get the average.

4. **Round the Average**:
   - Use Python's built-in `round()` function to round the average to the nearest integer.

5. **Convert to Binary**:
   - Use Python's `bin()` function to convert the rounded integer to a binary string.

6. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the binary string as the result.

Now, let's implement the function:

```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    """Compute the average of integers from n to m, round it, and convert to binary."""
    # Step 1: Check if n is greater than m
    if n > m:
        return -1
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the sum of the range
    total_sum = (m - n + 1) * (n + m) // 2
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the average
    num_elements = m - n + 1
    average = total_sum / num_elements
    
    # Step 4: Round the average
    rounded_average = round(average)
    
    # Step 5: Convert to binary
    binary_representation = bin(rounded_average)
    
    # Step 6: Return the result
    return binary_representation

# Example usage:
print(rounded_avg(1, 5))  # Output: "0b11"
print(rounded_avg(7, 5))  # Output: -1
print(rounded_avg(10, 20))  # Output: "0b1111"
print(rounded_avg(20, 33))  # Output: "0b11010"
```

This function follows the outlined steps to solve the problem efficiently and correctly.
