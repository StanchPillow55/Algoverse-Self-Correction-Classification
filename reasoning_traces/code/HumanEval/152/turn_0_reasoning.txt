==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to compare two lists: `game` and `guess`. Each element in these lists represents the score of a match and the guessed score for that match, respectively. Our task is to determine how accurate each guess was compared to the actual score.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Input Validation**: 
   - Ensure that both `game` and `guess` are lists of equal length. This is a precondition given in the problem, so we can assume it holds true.

2. **Iterate Over the Lists**:
   - We need to iterate over the indices of the lists. For each index `i`, we will compare `game[i]` and `guess[i]`.

3. **Calculate the Difference**:
   - If the guess is correct (i.e., `game[i] == guess[i]`), the difference is `0`.
   - If the guess is incorrect, calculate the absolute difference between the actual score and the guessed score: `abs(game[i] - guess[i])`.

4. **Store the Results**:
   - For each comparison, store the result (either `0` or the absolute difference) in a new list.

5. **Return the Result List**:
   - After processing all elements, return the list containing the differences.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def compare(game, guess):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the indices of the lists
    for i in range(len(game)):
        # Calculate the difference
        if game[i] == guess[i]:
            result.append(0)
        else:
            result.append(abs(game[i] - guess[i]))
    
    # Return the result list
    return result

# Test cases
print(compare([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2]))  # Expected: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]
print(compare([0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4], [4, 1, 1, 0, 0, -2]))  # Expected: [4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 6]
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We initialize an empty list `result` to store the differences.
- We loop through each index of the `game` and `guess` lists.
- For each index, we check if the guess matches the actual score. If it does, we append `0` to the result list. Otherwise, we append the absolute difference.
- Finally, we return the `result` list, which contains the differences for each match.

This solution efficiently computes the required differences and handles the problem constraints effectively.
