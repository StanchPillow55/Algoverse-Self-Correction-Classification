To solve the problem of selecting words from a string that contain exactly `n` consonants, we need to break down the task into several steps. Let's go through the reasoning and approach step by step:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a string `s` and a natural number `n`.
   - We need to return a list of words from `s` that contain exactly `n` consonants.
   - If the string `s` is empty, we should return an empty list.
   - The input string contains only letters and spaces.

2. **Define Consonants:**
   - Consonants are all alphabetic characters that are not vowels.
   - Vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (both lowercase and uppercase).

3. **Approach:**
   - Split the string `s` into words using the `split()` method. This will handle multiple spaces naturally.
   - For each word, count the number of consonants.
   - If the count of consonants in a word is equal to `n`, add the word to the result list.
   - Return the result list.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - Use a helper function to count consonants in a word.
   - Iterate over each word in the split list and apply the consonant counting function.
   - Collect words that meet the criteria into a list and return it.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def select_words(s, n):
    """Given a string s and a natural number n, return a list of all words from string s
    that contain exactly n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s."""
    
    def count_consonants(word):
        vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
        consonant_count = 0
        for char in word:
            if char.isalpha() and char not in vowels:
                consonant_count += 1
        return consonant_count
    
    # Split the string into words
    words = s.split()
    
    # List to store words with exactly n consonants
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each word and check consonant count
    for word in words:
        if count_consonants(word) == n:
            result.append(word)
    
    return result

# Example usage:
print(select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4))  # Output: ["little"]
print(select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3))  # Output: ["Mary", "lamb"]
print(select_words("simple white space", 2))     # Output: []
print(select_words("Hello world", 4))            # Output: ["world"]
print(select_words("Uncle sam", 3))              # Output: ["Uncle"]
```

### Explanation

- **Helper Function `count_consonants`:** This function iterates over each character in a word and checks if it is a consonant (i.e., an alphabetic character that is not a vowel). It uses a set for vowels for efficient membership checking.
- **Main Function `select_words`:** This function splits the input string into words, counts the consonants in each word using the helper function, and collects words with exactly `n` consonants into a result list.
- **Edge Cases:** The function handles empty strings by returning an empty list since splitting an empty string results in an empty list.
