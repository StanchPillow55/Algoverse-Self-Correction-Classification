To solve the problem of filtering a list of strings based on whether they contain a given substring, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the problem and think through the solution step by step.

### Problem Understanding

We are given:
- A list of strings (`strings`).
- A substring (`substring`).

Our task is to return a new list containing only those strings from the input list that contain the specified substring.

### Approach

1. **Iterate through the List**: We need to examine each string in the input list to check if it contains the specified substring.
  
2. **Check for Substring**: For each string, we will use Python's `in` keyword to check if the substring is present in the string. The `in` keyword is efficient and straightforward for this purpose.

3. **Collect Matching Strings**: If a string contains the substring, we will add it to a new list that will store all such strings.

4. **Return the Result**: After iterating through all strings, we will return the list of strings that contain the substring.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function `filter_by_substring` based on the above approach.

```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    """Filter an input list of strings only for ones that contain the given substring."""
    # Initialize an empty list to store strings that contain the substring
    filtered_strings = []
    
    # Iterate over each string in the input list
    for string in strings:
        # Check if the substring is in the current string
        if substring in string:
            # If it is, add the string to the filtered list
            filtered_strings.append(string)
    
    # Return the list of filtered strings
    return filtered_strings

# Example usage and test cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(filter_by_substring([], 'a'))  # Expected output: []
    print(filter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a'))  # Expected output: ['abc', 'bacd', 'array']
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**: We start by initializing an empty list `filtered_strings` to store the strings that contain the substring.
- **Iteration and Condition Check**: We iterate over each string in the input list. For each string, we use the `in` keyword to check if the substring is present. If it is, we append the string to `filtered_strings`.
- **Return Statement**: Finally, we return the `filtered_strings` list, which contains all strings from the input list that include the substring.

This solution is efficient and leverages Python's built-in capabilities to check for substrings, ensuring that the function is both simple and effective.
