==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to iterate over the list of integers and apply specific transformations to the elements based on their indices. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Understand the Index Conditions**:
   - If the index is a multiple of 3, square the element at that index.
   - If the index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, cube the element at that index.
   - If the index is neither a multiple of 3 nor a multiple of 4, leave the element unchanged.

2. **Iterate Over the List**:
   - Use a loop to iterate over the list, accessing both the index and the element value.
   - For each element, check the index conditions and apply the appropriate transformation.

3. **Calculate the Sum**:
   - Maintain a running total of the transformed elements.
   - After processing all elements, return the total sum.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - An empty list should return a sum of 0.
   - Negative numbers should be handled correctly according to the transformation rules.

5. **Implementation**:
   - Use a `for` loop with `enumerate` to get both the index and the value.
   - Use conditional statements to check the index conditions and apply transformations.
   - Accumulate the results into a sum variable and return it.

Now, let's implement the function:

```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    total_sum = 0
    for index, value in enumerate(lst):
        if index % 3 == 0:
            # Index is a multiple of 3, square the value
            total_sum += value ** 2
        elif index % 4 == 0:
            # Index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, cube the value
            total_sum += value ** 3
        else:
            # Index is neither a multiple of 3 nor 4, add the value as is
            total_sum += value
    return total_sum

# Test cases
print(sum_squares([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 6
print(sum_squares([]))         # Output: 0
print(sum_squares([-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]))  # Output: -126
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:
- We initialize `total_sum` to 0 to keep track of the sum.
- We use `enumerate(lst)` to loop over the list with both index and value.
- For each element, we check:
  - If `index % 3 == 0`, we square the value and add it to `total_sum`.
  - If `index % 4 == 0`, we cube the value and add it to `total_sum`.
  - Otherwise, we add the value as is to `total_sum`.
- Finally, we return `total_sum` which contains the sum of all transformed elements.
