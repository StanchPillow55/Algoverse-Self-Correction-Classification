==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to evaluate an algebraic expression constructed from two lists: one containing operators and the other containing operands. The operators are basic arithmetic operations, and the operands are integers. The goal is to construct the expression in the order given by the lists and then evaluate it.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Input and Output:**
   - We have two lists: `operator` and `operand`.
   - The `operator` list contains strings representing arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `//`, `**`.
   - The `operand` list contains integers.
   - The length of the `operator` list is always one less than the length of the `operand` list.
   - We need to construct an expression using these operators and operands in the given order and evaluate it.

2. **Construct the Expression:**
   - Start with the first operand.
   - Iterate through the `operator` list and apply each operator to the current result and the next operand.
   - This means we will use the first operator with the first and second operands, the second operator with the result of the first operation and the third operand, and so on.

3. **Evaluate the Expression:**
   - We will use a loop to iterate through the `operator` list and apply each operation in sequence.
   - Python's arithmetic operators can be used directly to perform the operations.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Since the problem guarantees at least one operator and two operands, we don't need to handle cases with empty lists.
   - We assume all operations are valid as per the problem constraints.

5. **Implementation:**
   - Initialize a variable `result` with the first operand.
   - Loop through the `operator` list, updating `result` by applying each operator to the current `result` and the next operand.
   - Return the final `result`.

Here's the implementation of the solution:

```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    # Initialize the result with the first operand
    result = operand[0]
    
    # Iterate through the operators and operands
    for i in range(len(operator)):
        op = operator[i]
        next_operand = operand[i + 1]
        
        # Apply the operation based on the operator
        if op == '+':
            result += next_operand
        elif op == '-':
            result -= next_operand
        elif op == '*':
            result *= next_operand
        elif op == '//':
            result //= next_operand
        elif op == '**':
            result **= next_operand
    
    return result

# Example usage:
operator = ['+', '*', '-']
operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]
print(do_algebra(operator, operand))  # Output: 9
```

### Explanation:
- We start with `result = operand[0]`, which is `2` in the example.
- We then iterate over the operators:
  - Apply `+` with `3`, resulting in `5`.
  - Apply `*` with `4`, resulting in `20`.
  - Apply `-` with `5`, resulting in `15`.
- The final result is `15`, which matches the expected output.
