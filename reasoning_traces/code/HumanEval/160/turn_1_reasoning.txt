==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to evaluate an algebraic expression constructed from two lists: one containing operators and the other containing operands. The task is to build the expression using these lists and compute its result.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to approach this problem:

1. **Understand the Input and Output:**
   - We have two lists: `operator` and `operand`.
   - The `operator` list contains strings representing basic algebraic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `//`, `**`.
   - The `operand` list contains integers.
   - The length of the `operator` list is always one less than the length of the `operand` list.
   - We need to construct an expression by interleaving the operands with the operators and evaluate it.

2. **Construct the Expression:**
   - Start with the first operand.
   - Iterate through the `operator` list, and for each operator, append it and the next operand to the expression.
   - This will construct a string representation of the expression.

3. **Evaluate the Expression:**
   - Use Python's `eval()` function to evaluate the constructed expression. This function can evaluate a string as a Python expression, which is suitable for our needs since the operators are basic arithmetic operations.

4. **Consider Edge Cases:**
   - The problem guarantees that there is at least one operator and two operands, so we don't need to handle empty lists.
   - Since operands are non-negative integers, we don't need to handle negative numbers or division by zero (as floor division by zero would be undefined).

5. **Implementation:**
   - Construct the expression as a string.
   - Use `eval()` to compute the result.
   - Return the result.

Here's the implementation of the solution:

```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    # Start with the first operand
    expression = str(operand[0])
    
    # Iterate over the operators and operands to build the expression
    for i in range(len(operator)):
        expression += f" {operator[i]} {operand[i + 1]}"
    
    # Evaluate the constructed expression
    result = eval(expression)
    
    return result

# Example usage:
operator = ['+', '*', '-']
operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]
result = do_algebra(operator, operand)
print(result)  # Output should be 9
```

**Explanation of the Code:**
- We initialize the expression with the first operand.
- We loop through each operator and append it along with the next operand to the expression string.
- We use `eval()` to evaluate the final expression string and return the result.

This solution is efficient and leverages Python's built-in capabilities to handle the evaluation of arithmetic expressions.
