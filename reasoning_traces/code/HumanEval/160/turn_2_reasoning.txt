==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to evaluate an algebraic expression that is constructed from two lists: one containing operators and the other containing operands. The operators are basic arithmetic operations, and the operands are integers. The task is to construct the expression using these lists and then evaluate it.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Input:**
   - We have two lists: `operator` and `operand`.
   - The `operator` list contains strings representing arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `//`, `**`.
   - The `operand` list contains integers.
   - The length of the `operator` list is always one less than the length of the `operand` list. This makes sense because between every two operands, there is one operator.

2. **Constructing the Expression:**
   - We need to construct an expression by interleaving the operands and operators.
   - For example, if `operator = ['+', '*', '-']` and `operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]`, the expression should be `2 + 3 * 4 - 5`.

3. **Evaluating the Expression:**
   - Once the expression is constructed, we need to evaluate it.
   - Python provides the `eval()` function, which can evaluate a string expression. However, using `eval()` can be risky if the input is not controlled, as it can execute arbitrary code.
   - Since the problem guarantees that the input is controlled (only basic arithmetic operations and non-negative integers), using `eval()` is acceptable here.

4. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Initialize an empty string to build the expression.
   - Iterate over the `operator` list and append each operand and operator to the expression string.
   - After the loop, append the last operand to complete the expression.
   - Use `eval()` to evaluate the constructed expression and return the result.

Now, let's implement the solution:

```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    # Initialize an empty expression string
    expression = ""
    
    # Iterate over the operators and operands to build the expression
    for i in range(len(operator)):
        # Append the current operand and operator to the expression
        expression += str(operand[i]) + operator[i]
    
    # Append the last operand
    expression += str(operand[-1])
    
    # Evaluate the expression and return the result
    return eval(expression)

# Example usage:
operator = ['+', '*', '-']
operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]
result = do_algebra(operator, operand)
print(result)  # Output should be 9
```

This function constructs the expression by interleaving the operators and operands, evaluates it using `eval()`, and returns the result. The example usage demonstrates how the function works with the given input.
