==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to compare two inputs, which can be integers, floats, or strings representing real numbers. The goal is to return the larger of the two inputs in its original type, or `None` if they are equal.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to approach this problem:

1. **Input Types**: The inputs can be integers, floats, or strings. Strings can represent real numbers with either a dot (`.`) or a comma (`,`) as the decimal separator.

2. **Comparison Logic**:
   - If both inputs are of the same type (e.g., both are integers or both are strings), we can directly compare them.
   - If the inputs are of different types, we need to convert them to a common type for comparison. However, the return value should be in the original type of the larger input.

3. **Handling Strings**:
   - Strings representing numbers with a comma as the decimal separator need to be converted to a format that Python can understand. This involves replacing the comma with a dot.
   - After conversion, strings can be cast to floats for comparison.

4. **Return Value**:
   - If the inputs are equal after conversion, return `None`.
   - Otherwise, return the larger input in its original type.

5. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Check if both inputs are of the same type and compare them directly.
   - If they are different types, convert both to floats for comparison.
   - Use the original values to determine which one to return based on the comparison.

Here's the implementation of the solution:

```python
def compare_one(a, b):
    def convert_to_float(value):
        if isinstance(value, str):
            # Replace comma with dot for float conversion
            value = value.replace(',', '.')
            return float(value)
        return float(value)
    
    # If both are of the same type, compare directly
    if type(a) == type(b):
        if a == b:
            return None
        return a if a > b else b
    
    # Convert both to floats for comparison
    a_float = convert_to_float(a)
    b_float = convert_to_float(b)
    
    if a_float == b_float:
        return None
    
    # Return the original type of the larger value
    return a if a_float > b_float else b

# Example usage
print(compare_one(1, 2.5))     # ➞ 2.5
print(compare_one(1, "2,3"))   # ➞ "2,3"
print(compare_one("5,1", "6")) # ➞ "6"
print(compare_one("1", 1))     # ➞ None
```

### Explanation:
- The function `convert_to_float` handles the conversion of any input to a float, taking care of the comma-to-dot replacement for strings.
- We first check if both inputs are of the same type and compare them directly.
- If they are of different types, we convert both to floats and compare.
- Depending on the comparison, we return the original input that is larger, or `None` if they are equal.
