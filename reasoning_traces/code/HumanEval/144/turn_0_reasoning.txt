To solve the problem of determining whether the product of two fractions results in a whole number, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Parse the Input**: Both `x` and `n` are given as strings in the format "numerator/denominator". We need to extract the numerator and denominator from these strings.

2. **Convert to Integers**: Once we have the numerators and denominators, we convert them from strings to integers for mathematical operations.

3. **Multiply the Fractions**: The multiplication of two fractions, `a/b` and `c/d`, results in `(a * c) / (b * d)`. We need to compute both the new numerator and the new denominator.

4. **Check for Whole Number**: A fraction is a whole number if the numerator is perfectly divisible by the denominator. This means that the remainder of the division should be zero.

5. **Return the Result**: If the division results in a whole number, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

Let's implement this step-by-step approach in the function `simplify`.

```python
def simplify(x, n):
    # Step 1: Parse the input fractions
    x_numerator, x_denominator = map(int, x.split('/'))
    n_numerator, n_denominator = map(int, n.split('/'))
    
    # Step 2: Multiply the fractions
    result_numerator = x_numerator * n_numerator
    result_denominator = x_denominator * n_denominator
    
    # Step 3: Check if the result is a whole number
    if result_numerator % result_denominator == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Test cases
print(simplify("1/5", "5/1"))  # Expected output: True
print(simplify("1/6", "2/1"))  # Expected output: False
print(simplify("7/10", "10/2"))  # Expected output: False
```

### Explanation:

- **Parsing**: We use `split('/')` to separate the numerator and denominator of each fraction. `map(int, ...)` is used to convert these parts into integers.

- **Multiplication**: We multiply the numerators together and the denominators together to get the resulting fraction.

- **Whole Number Check**: We use the modulus operator `%` to check if the numerator is divisible by the denominator without a remainder. If `result_numerator % result_denominator == 0`, it means the fraction is a whole number.

- **Return**: Based on the divisibility check, we return `True` or `False`.

This approach efficiently determines if the product of two fractions is a whole number by leveraging basic arithmetic operations and string manipulation.
