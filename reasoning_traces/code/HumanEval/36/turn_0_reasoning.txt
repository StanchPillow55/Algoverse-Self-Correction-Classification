To solve this problem, we need to count how many times the digit '7' appears in numbers less than a given integer `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
   - We need to consider all integers less than `n`.
   - We are only interested in numbers that are divisible by either 11 or 13.
   - For each of these numbers, we need to count how many times the digit '7' appears.

2. **Plan the Solution**:
   - Iterate over each number from 0 to `n-1`.
   - Check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13.
   - If it is, convert the number to a string and count the occurrences of the digit '7'.
   - Accumulate this count.
   - Return the total count after checking all numbers.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Use a loop to iterate through numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - Use the modulo operator `%` to check divisibility.
   - Convert numbers to strings to easily count occurrences of '7'.
   - Use the `str.count()` method to count '7's in the string representation of the number.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is less than 11, there are no numbers to check, so the result should be 0.
   - Ensure that the function handles the smallest possible input correctly.

Now, let's implement the solution:

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    count_of_sevens = 0
    
    for number in range(n):
        if number % 11 == 0 or number % 13 == 0:
            # Convert the number to a string to count '7's
            count_of_sevens += str(number).count('7')
    
    return count_of_sevens

# Test cases
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Expected output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Expected output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Expected output: 3
```

This function iterates through each number less than `n`, checks if it is divisible by 11 or 13, and counts the occurrences of the digit '7' in its string representation. The total count is returned at the end.
