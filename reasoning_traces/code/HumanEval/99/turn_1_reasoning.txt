==================================================

To solve the problem of finding the closest integer to a given string representation of a number, with the specific requirement of rounding away from zero when the number is equidistant from two integers, we need to carefully consider how Python handles rounding and how we can implement the desired behavior.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The input is a string that represents a number. We need to convert this string into a numerical type to perform arithmetic operations. The most straightforward way to do this is by converting the string to a float.

2. **Understanding Rounding in Python**:
   - Python's built-in `round()` function rounds to the nearest integer, but it rounds to the nearest even number when the number is exactly halfway between two integers (also known as "bankers' rounding"). This is not what we want.
   - Instead, we need to implement a custom rounding logic that rounds away from zero when the number is equidistant from two integers.

3. **Implementing Rounding Away from Zero**:
   - If the fractional part of the number is exactly 0.5, we need to decide whether to round up or down based on the sign of the number.
   - For positive numbers, we should round up (e.g., 14.5 becomes 15).
   - For negative numbers, we should round down (e.g., -14.5 becomes -15).

4. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Convert the string to a float.
   - Check the fractional part of the number.
   - If the fractional part is exactly 0.5, apply the custom rounding logic based on the sign of the number.
   - Otherwise, use the standard rounding logic.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Ensure that the function handles both positive and negative numbers correctly.
   - Consider cases where the input is already an integer (e.g., "10").

### Implementation:

Let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def closest_integer(value):
    '''
    Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number
    and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant
    from two integers, round it away from zero.
    '''
    # Convert the string to a float
    num = float(value)
    
    # Get the integer part and the fractional part
    integer_part = int(num)
    fractional_part = abs(num - integer_part)
    
    # Check if the fractional part is exactly 0.5
    if fractional_part == 0.5:
        # Round away from zero
        if num > 0:
            return integer_part + 1
        else:
            return integer_part - 1
    else:
        # Use standard rounding
        return round(num)

# Test cases
print(closest_integer("10"))    # Expected output: 10
print(closest_integer("15.3"))  # Expected output: 15
print(closest_integer("14.5"))  # Expected output: 15
print(closest_integer("-14.5")) # Expected output: -15
```

### Explanation:

- The function first converts the input string to a float.
- It calculates the integer part and the fractional part of the number.
- If the fractional part is exactly 0.5, it checks the sign of the number and rounds away from zero accordingly.
- For other cases, it uses the standard `round()` function to round to the nearest integer.
- This approach ensures that the function behaves correctly for both positive and negative numbers, as well as for numbers that are already integers.
