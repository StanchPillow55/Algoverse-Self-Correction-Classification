To solve the problem of finding the closest integer to a given string representation of a number, with specific rounding rules, we need to follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The input is a string representing a number. We need to convert this string into a numerical type to perform arithmetic operations. Python's `float()` function is suitable for this purpose as it can handle both integer and floating-point representations in string form.

2. **Determine the Closest Integer**:
   - Once we have the number in a float format, we need to determine the closest integer.
   - The standard way to find the closest integer in Python is to use the `round()` function. However, Python's `round()` function rounds to the nearest even number when the number is exactly halfway between two integers (also known as "bankers' rounding"). This is not what we want.

3. **Rounding Away from Zero**:
   - The problem specifies that if the number is equidistant from two integers, we should round away from zero. This means:
     - For positive numbers, round up.
     - For negative numbers, round down.
   - To achieve this, we can use the `math.floor()` and `math.ceil()` functions:
     - If the number is positive and has a fractional part of 0.5, use `math.ceil()`.
     - If the number is negative and has a fractional part of 0.5, use `math.floor()`.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Convert the string to a float.
   - Check the fractional part of the number to determine if it's exactly 0.5.
   - Apply the appropriate rounding method based on the sign of the number and its fractional part.

### Implementation:

```python
import math

def closest_integer(value):
    # Convert the string to a float
    num = float(value)
    
    # Check if the number is exactly halfway between two integers
    if num > 0:
        # Positive numbers
        if num - math.floor(num) == 0.5:
            return math.ceil(num)
        else:
            return round(num)
    else:
        # Negative numbers
        if num - math.floor(num) == 0.5:
            return math.floor(num)
        else:
            return round(num)

# Test cases
print(closest_integer("10"))    # Expected output: 10
print(closest_integer("15.3"))  # Expected output: 15
print(closest_integer("14.5"))  # Expected output: 15
print(closest_integer("-14.5")) # Expected output: -15
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first convert the input string to a float.
- We then check if the fractional part of the number is exactly 0.5.
- Depending on whether the number is positive or negative, we use `math.ceil()` or `math.floor()` to round away from zero when the number is exactly halfway between two integers.
- For all other cases, we use the standard `round()` function to round to the nearest integer. This handles cases where the fractional part is not exactly 0.5.

This solution ensures that we correctly handle the rounding away from zero as specified in the problem statement.
