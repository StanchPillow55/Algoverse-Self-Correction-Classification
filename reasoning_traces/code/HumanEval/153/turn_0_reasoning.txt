To solve the problem of finding the strongest extension for a given class name, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: 
   - We are given a class name and a list of extensions.
   - Each extension has a "strength" calculated as the difference between the number of uppercase letters (CAP) and the number of lowercase letters (SM) in the extension's name.
   - Our task is to find the extension with the highest strength and return it in the format `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName`.
   - If multiple extensions have the same strength, we should return the one that appears first in the list.

2. **Plan the Solution**:
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the strongest extension and its strength.
   - Iterate over each extension in the list:
     - Calculate the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in the extension.
     - Compute the strength as `CAP - SM`.
     - If this strength is greater than the current strongest, update the strongest extension and its strength.
     - If the strength is the same as the current strongest, do nothing (since we want the first one in case of a tie).
   - After iterating through all extensions, format the result as `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName`.

3. **Implement the Solution**:
   - Use a loop to go through each extension.
   - Use string methods to count uppercase and lowercase letters.
   - Keep track of the maximum strength and the corresponding extension.
   - Return the result in the required format.

Here's the implementation of the solution:

```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the strongest extension and its strength
    strongest_extension = None
    max_strength = float('-inf')  # Start with the lowest possible strength

    # Iterate over each extension
    for extension in extensions:
        # Calculate the number of uppercase and lowercase letters
        cap_count = sum(1 for c in extension if c.isupper())
        sm_count = sum(1 for c in extension if c.islower())
        
        # Calculate the strength of the current extension
        strength = cap_count - sm_count
        
        # Check if this is the strongest extension so far
        if strength > max_strength:
            max_strength = strength
            strongest_extension = extension

    # Return the result in the required format
    return f"{class_name}.{strongest_extension}"

# Example usage:
print(Strongest_Extension('Slices', ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed']))  # Output: 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes'
print(Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']))  # Output: 'my_class.AA'
```

**Explanation**:
- We use list comprehensions to count uppercase and lowercase letters efficiently.
- We maintain a running maximum of the strength and update it whenever we find a stronger extension.
- The function returns the class name concatenated with the strongest extension, as required.
