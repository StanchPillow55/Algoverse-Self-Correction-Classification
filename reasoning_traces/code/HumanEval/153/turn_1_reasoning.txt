To solve the problem of finding the strongest extension for a given class name, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: 
   - We are given a class name and a list of extensions.
   - Each extension has a "strength" calculated as the difference between the number of uppercase letters (CAP) and the number of lowercase letters (SM) in the extension's name.
   - Our task is to find the extension with the highest strength.
   - If there are ties (extensions with the same strength), we should choose the one that appears first in the list.
   - The result should be formatted as `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName`.

2. **Plan the Solution**:
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the strongest extension and its strength.
   - Iterate through each extension in the list:
     - Calculate the number of uppercase and lowercase letters.
     - Compute the strength as `CAP - SM`.
     - If this strength is greater than the current strongest, update the strongest extension and its strength.
     - If the strength is the same as the current strongest, do nothing since we want the first one in case of ties.
   - After evaluating all extensions, format the result as required and return it.

3. **Implement the Solution**:
   - We will use Python's string methods to count uppercase and lowercase letters.
   - We will keep track of the maximum strength and the corresponding extension.
   - Finally, we will return the formatted result.

Here is the implementation of the solution:

```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    # Initialize variables to track the strongest extension and its strength
    strongest_extension = None
    max_strength = float('-inf')  # Start with the lowest possible strength
    
    # Iterate over each extension
    for extension in extensions:
        # Calculate the number of uppercase and lowercase letters
        cap = sum(1 for c in extension if c.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for c in extension if c.islower())
        
        # Calculate the strength of the current extension
        strength = cap - sm
        
        # Check if this extension is stronger than the current strongest
        if strength > max_strength:
            max_strength = strength
            strongest_extension = extension
    
    # Return the formatted result
    return f"{class_name}.{strongest_extension}"

# Example usage:
# print(Strongest_Extension('Slices', ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed']))  # Output: 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes'
# print(Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']))  # Output: 'my_class.AA'
```

This solution efficiently finds the strongest extension by iterating over the list once, calculating the strength for each extension, and keeping track of the maximum strength found. The use of list comprehensions for counting uppercase and lowercase letters makes the code concise and readable.
