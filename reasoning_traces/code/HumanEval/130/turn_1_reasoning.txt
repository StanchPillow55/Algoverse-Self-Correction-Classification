To solve the problem of generating the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence as defined in the problem, we need to carefully follow the rules given for calculating each term in the sequence. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Base Case**: 
   - `tri(1) = 3` is given as a base case.

2. **Even `n`**:
   - If `n` is even, the formula is `tri(n) = 1 + n / 2`.

3. **Odd `n`**:
   - If `n` is odd, the formula is `tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1)`.

4. **Output Requirement**:
   - We need to return a list of the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.

### Approach

1. **Initialize a List**:
   - Start with a list to store the Tribonacci numbers. The list should be of size `n + 1` to accommodate the first `n + 1` numbers.

2. **Iterate and Compute**:
   - Iterate from 0 to `n` and compute each term based on whether the index is even or odd.
   - For even indices, use the formula `1 + n / 2`.
   - For odd indices, use the recursive formula. However, since we are generating the sequence iteratively, we need to ensure that we have already computed the necessary previous terms.

3. **Handle Base Case**:
   - Ensure that the base case `tri(1) = 3` is correctly initialized in the list.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the list containing the first `n + 1` Tribonacci numbers.

### Implementation

Let's implement the solution based on the above approach:

```python
def tri(n):
    # Initialize the list to store the Tribonacci sequence
    tribonacci_sequence = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Handle the base case
    if n >= 1:
        tribonacci_sequence[1] = 3
    
    # Compute the Tribonacci numbers from 0 to n
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i == 0:
            # tri(0) is not defined in the problem, but we can assume it to be 1
            tribonacci_sequence[i] = 1
        elif i == 1:
            # Already handled in the base case
            continue
        elif i % 2 == 0:
            # Even index
            tribonacci_sequence[i] = 1 + i // 2
        else:
            # Odd index
            # Ensure we do not go out of bounds
            if i - 1 >= 0 and i - 2 >= 0 and i + 1 <= n:
                tribonacci_sequence[i] = tribonacci_sequence[i - 1] + tribonacci_sequence[i - 2] + tribonacci_sequence[i + 1]
    
    return tribonacci_sequence

# Example usage
print(tri(3))  # Output: [1, 3, 2, 8]
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We initialize a list `tribonacci_sequence` with zeros of length `n + 1`.
- We handle the base case by setting `tribonacci_sequence[1]` to 3.
- We iterate from 0 to `n` and compute each term based on whether the index is even or odd.
- For even indices, we use the formula `1 + i // 2`.
- For odd indices, we use the recursive formula, ensuring that we do not access out-of-bounds indices.
- Finally, we return the list containing the first `n + 1` Tribonacci numbers.
