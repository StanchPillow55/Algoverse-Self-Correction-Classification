To solve the problem of generating the Tribonacci sequence as described, we need to carefully follow the rules given for calculating each term in the sequence. Let's break down the problem and develop a solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Base Case**:
   - The sequence starts with `tri(1) = 3`.

2. **Recurrence Relations**:
   - If `n` is even, `tri(n) = 1 + n / 2`.
   - If `n` is odd, `tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1)`.

3. **Output Requirement**:
   - We need to return a list of the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence, starting from `tri(0)`.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with an empty list to store the sequence.
   - Handle the base case by setting `tri(1) = 3`.

2. **Iterative Calculation**:
   - Loop through numbers from 0 to `n` to calculate each `tri(i)`.
   - For each `i`, determine if it is even or odd and apply the respective formula.

3. **Handling Odd Indices**:
   - For odd indices, we need to calculate `tri(i + 1)` before `tri(i)` because the formula for odd `i` depends on `tri(i + 1)`.
   - This requires a careful ordering of calculations to ensure all necessary values are available.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Once the loop completes, return the list of calculated values.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function following the outlined approach:

```python
def tri(n):
    # Initialize the list with the first element tri(0) = 1
    sequence = [1]
    
    # Handle the base case for tri(1)
    if n >= 1:
        sequence.append(3)
    
    # Calculate the sequence up to tri(n)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # If i is even, use the even formula
            sequence.append(1 + i // 2)
        else:
            # If i is odd, use the odd formula
            # Ensure we have enough elements to calculate tri(i)
            if i + 1 > len(sequence) - 1:
                sequence.append(1 + (i + 1) // 2)  # Calculate tri(i+1) if needed
            sequence.append(sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2] + sequence[i + 1])
    
    return sequence

# Example usage:
print(tri(3))  # Output: [1, 3, 2, 8]
```

### Explanation

- We start by initializing the sequence with `tri(0) = 1`.
- We handle the base case for `tri(1)` explicitly.
- For each subsequent index `i`, we check if it is even or odd and apply the appropriate formula.
- For odd indices, we ensure that `tri(i + 1)` is calculated before using it in the formula.
- Finally, we return the sequence containing the first `n + 1` numbers.

This approach ensures that we correctly compute each term in the sequence according to the given rules and return the desired list.
