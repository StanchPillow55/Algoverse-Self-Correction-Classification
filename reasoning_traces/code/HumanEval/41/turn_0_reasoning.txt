To solve this problem, we need to determine how many collisions occur when two sets of cars, each containing `n` cars, move towards each other on a straight, infinitely long road. 

### Problem Analysis

1. **Understanding Collision**: 
   - A collision is defined as a car moving left to right (L->R) hitting a car moving right to left (R->L).
   - Despite the collision, both cars continue moving in their respective directions.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - We have `n` cars moving from left to right and another `n` cars moving from right to left.
   - The cars are initially positioned such that they are very far from each other.

3. **Movement and Collision**:
   - Since all cars move at the same speed, every car moving L->R will eventually collide with a car moving R->L.
   - Each L->R car will collide with exactly one R->L car.

4. **Counting Collisions**:
   - Since there are `n` cars moving in each direction, and each L->R car collides with one R->L car, the total number of collisions is simply `n`.

### Solution Approach

Given the above analysis, the solution is straightforward:
- The number of collisions is equal to the number of cars in one set, which is `n`.

### Implementation

The implementation of the solution is simple. We just need to return `n` as the number of collisions:

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Given n cars moving left to right and n cars moving right to left,
    this function returns the number of collisions that occur.
    
    Parameters:
    n (int): The number of cars in each direction.
    
    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions.
    """
    # Each car moving left to right will collide with one car moving right to left.
    # Therefore, the number of collisions is exactly n.
    return n
```

### Explanation

- **Function Definition**: The function `car_race_collision` takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of cars in each direction.
- **Return Value**: It returns `n`, which is the number of collisions, as each L->R car collides with one R->L car.

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(1) since it involves a simple arithmetic operation and does not depend on the size of the input in terms of computational steps.
