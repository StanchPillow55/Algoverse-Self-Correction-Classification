==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of collisions that occur when `n` cars are moving left to right and another `n` cars are moving right to left on an infinitely long straight road. 

### Thought Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have two sets of cars: one set moving from left to right and another set moving from right to left.
   - Each set contains `n` cars.
   - All cars move at the same speed.
   - A collision is defined as a car from the left-to-right set meeting a car from the right-to-left set.

2. **Collision Analysis:**
   - Since all cars move at the same speed, the relative speed between any two cars from opposite directions is twice the speed of one car.
   - The problem states that cars continue moving in their trajectory after a collision, meaning the collision does not affect their paths or speeds.
   - Given that the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, each car from the left-to-right set will collide with each car from the right-to-left set exactly once.

3. **Counting Collisions:**
   - Since each car from the left-to-right set will collide with each car from the right-to-left set, the total number of collisions is simply the product of the number of cars in each set.
   - Therefore, the total number of collisions is `n * n`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The number of collisions is determined solely by the number of cars in each set, and since both sets have `n` cars, the total number of collisions is `n^2`.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function `car_race_collision` to compute the number of collisions based on the above reasoning.

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions.
    
    Parameters:
    n (int): The number of cars in each set.
    
    Returns:
    int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    # Each car from the left-to-right set collides with each car from the right-to-left set.
    # Therefore, the total number of collisions is n * n.
    return n * n
```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `n^2`, which represents the total number of collisions between the two sets of cars.
