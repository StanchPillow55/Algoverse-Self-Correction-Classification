To solve the problem, we need to create a function `specialFilter` that takes a list of numbers and returns the count of numbers that satisfy two conditions:

1. The number is greater than 10.
2. Both the first and last digits of the number are odd.

Let's break down the steps needed to implement this function:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Initialize a Counter**: Start by initializing a counter to zero. This counter will keep track of how many numbers satisfy the given conditions.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Loop through each number in the input list.

3. **Check if the Number is Greater than 10**: For each number, first check if it is greater than 10. If not, skip to the next number.

4. **Convert Number to String**: Convert the number to a string to easily access its digits. We need to handle both positive and negative numbers. For negative numbers, we should consider the absolute value to get the correct digits.

5. **Extract First and Last Digits**: 
   - The first digit is the first character of the string (after converting to absolute value).
   - The last digit is the last character of the string.

6. **Check if Digits are Odd**: Convert these characters back to integers and check if both are odd. A digit is odd if it is one of [1, 3, 5, 7, 9].

7. **Update Counter**: If both conditions are satisfied, increment the counter.

8. **Return the Counter**: After iterating through all numbers, return the counter as the result.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    """Returns the count of numbers greater than 10 with both first and last digits odd."""
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            # Convert number to string, considering absolute value for negative numbers
            num_str = str(abs(num))
            first_digit = int(num_str[0])
            last_digit = int(num_str[-1])
            
            # Check if both first and last digits are odd
            if first_digit in {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} and last_digit in {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}:
                count += 1
    return count

# Example usage:
print(specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]))  # Output: 1
print(specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]))  # Output: 2
```

### Explanation:

- We use `abs(num)` to handle negative numbers correctly, ensuring we get the correct digits.
- The set `{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}` is used to check if a digit is odd, which is efficient for membership testing.
- The function iterates over each number, checks the conditions, and updates the count accordingly. Finally, it returns the count of numbers meeting the criteria.
