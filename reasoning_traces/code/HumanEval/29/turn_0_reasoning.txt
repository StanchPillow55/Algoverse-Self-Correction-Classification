To solve the problem of filtering a list of strings based on a given prefix, we need to follow a structured approach. Let's break down the problem and think through the solution step by step.

### Problem Understanding

We are given a list of strings and a prefix. Our task is to return a new list that contains only those strings from the input list that start with the given prefix.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Input and Output**:
   - **Input**: A list of strings (`strings`) and a string (`prefix`).
   - **Output**: A list of strings that start with the given prefix.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the input list is empty, the output should also be an empty list.
   - If the prefix is an empty string, technically every string starts with an empty prefix, so the output should be the same as the input list.

3. **Approach**:
   - We will iterate over each string in the input list.
   - For each string, we will check if it starts with the given prefix using the `str.startswith()` method.
   - If a string starts with the prefix, we will include it in the result list.
   - Finally, we will return the result list.

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - We can use a list comprehension to filter the strings efficiently.
   - The `str.startswith()` method is perfect for this task as it checks if a string starts with the specified prefix.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix.
    >>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
    []
    >>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
    ['abc', 'array']
    """
    # Use list comprehension to filter strings that start with the given prefix
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]

# Example usage:
# print(filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a'))  # Output: ['abc', 'array']
```

### Explanation

- **List Comprehension**: We use `[s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]` to create a new list. This expression iterates over each string `s` in the `strings` list and includes it in the new list if `s.startswith(prefix)` evaluates to `True`.
- **Efficiency**: The solution is efficient as it processes each string once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of strings in the input list.

This implementation is concise, leverages Python's built-in string methods, and handles edge cases effectively.
