==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to construct a list representing the number of stones in each level of a pile, given a positive integer `n`. The pile has `n` levels, and the number of stones in each level follows a specific pattern based on whether `n` is odd or even.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` levels in the pile.
   - The first level has exactly `n` stones.
   - For subsequent levels, the number of stones increases by the next odd number if `n` is odd, or by the next even number if `n` is even.

2. **Pattern Identification:**
   - If `n` is odd, the sequence of stones in the levels starts with `n` and increases by 2 for each subsequent level (i.e., odd numbers).
   - If `n` is even, the sequence starts with `n` and increases by 2 for each subsequent level (i.e., even numbers).

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - For `n = 3` (odd), the levels should be `[3, 5, 7]`.
     - Start with 3, then add 2 to get 5, then add 2 to get 7.
   - For `n = 4` (even), the levels should be `[4, 6, 8, 10]`.
     - Start with 4, then add 2 to get 6, then add 2 to get 8, and finally add 2 to get 10.

4. **Implementation Plan:**
   - Initialize an empty list `levels` to store the number of stones in each level.
   - Set the initial number of stones to `n`.
   - Use a loop to iterate `n` times (for each level).
     - Append the current number of stones to the `levels` list.
     - Increase the number of stones by 2 for the next level.
   - Return the `levels` list.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Since `n` is always a positive integer, we don't need to handle cases where `n` is zero or negative.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).
    """
    levels = []
    stones = n
    for _ in range(n):
        levels.append(stones)
        stones += 2
    return levels

# Example usage:
print(make_a_pile(3))  # Output: [3, 5, 7]
```

This function should correctly generate the sequence of stones for each level based on the given rules.
