To solve the problem of rescaling a list of numbers to a unit interval [0, 1], we need to apply a linear transformation to each element in the list. The goal is to transform the smallest number in the list to 0 and the largest number to 1, with all other numbers scaled proportionally between these two values.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Identify the Minimum and Maximum Values:**
   - First, we need to find the minimum and maximum values in the list. These values will be used to determine the range of the data.

2. **Calculate the Range:**
   - The range of the list is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This range will be used to scale the numbers.

3. **Apply the Linear Transformation:**
   - For each number `x` in the list, apply the transformation:
     \[
     \text{rescaled\_value} = \frac{x - \text{min\_value}}{\text{max\_value} - \text{min\_value}}
     \]
   - This formula shifts the number `x` by subtracting the minimum value, and then scales it by dividing by the range. This ensures that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The problem states that the list will have at least two elements, so we don't need to handle cases with fewer elements.
   - If all numbers in the list are the same, the range would be zero, which would cause division by zero. However, since the problem guarantees at least two different numbers, we don't need to handle this case.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function `rescale_to_unit` based on the above reasoning:

```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    """
    # Step 1: Find the minimum and maximum values
    min_value = min(numbers)
    max_value = max(numbers)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the range
    range_value = max_value - min_value
    
    # Step 3: Apply the linear transformation to each number
    rescaled_numbers = [(x - min_value) / range_value for x in numbers]
    
    return rescaled_numbers

# Example usage:
# print(rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]))  # Output: [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We first calculate the minimum and maximum values of the list using the `min()` and `max()` functions.
- We then compute the range by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value.
- We use a list comprehension to apply the linear transformation to each element in the list, resulting in a new list of rescaled values.
- Finally, we return the list of rescaled numbers. This implementation efficiently rescales the input list to the unit interval [0, 1].
