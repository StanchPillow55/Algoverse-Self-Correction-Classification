To solve the problem, we need to sort a given array of non-negative integers based on a specific condition. The condition is determined by the sum of the first and last elements of the array. Here's how we can approach the problem step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Input and Output:**
   - Input: An array of non-negative integers.
   - Output: A new array that is sorted based on the condition derived from the sum of the first and last elements.

2. **Condition for Sorting:**
   - If the sum of the first and last elements of the array is odd, sort the array in ascending order.
   - If the sum is even, sort the array in descending order.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the array is empty, return an empty array.
   - If the array has only one element, return a copy of the array as sorting is not needed.

4. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Check if the array is empty. If so, return an empty array.
   - Check if the array has only one element. If so, return a copy of the array.
   - Calculate the sum of the first and last elements of the array.
   - Determine if the sum is odd or even.
   - Sort the array in ascending order if the sum is odd.
   - Sort the array in descending order if the sum is even.
   - Return the sorted array.

5. **Implementation:**
   - Use Python's built-in `sorted()` function to create a sorted copy of the array.
   - Use slicing `[::-1]` to reverse the array for descending order when needed.

Now, let's implement the function based on this plan:

```python
def sort_array(array):
    """
    Given an array of non-negative integers, return a copy of the given array after sorting,
    you will sort the given array in ascending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is odd,
    or sort it in descending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is even.
    
    Note:
    * don't change the given array.
    """
    # Check if the array is empty
    if not array:
        return []
    
    # Check if the array has only one element
    if len(array) == 1:
        return array[:]
    
    # Calculate the sum of the first and last elements
    first_last_sum = array[0] + array[-1]
    
    # Determine if the sum is odd or even
    if first_last_sum % 2 == 1:
        # Sum is odd, sort in ascending order
        return sorted(array)
    else:
        # Sum is even, sort in descending order
        return sorted(array, reverse=True)

# Test cases
print(sort_array([]))  # => []
print(sort_array([5]))  # => [5]
print(sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]))  # => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6]))  # => [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
```

This implementation covers all the specified conditions and edge cases, ensuring that the original array is not modified and a sorted copy is returned based on the sum condition.
