Question: Bob wants to dig a hole 6 feet long by 4 feet wide by 3 feet deep. If it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, how long will it take him to dig the hole?

Reference Answer: The hole is 6 feet long by 4 feet wide by 3 feet deep or 6 * 4 * 3 = <<6*4*3=72>>72 cubic feet.
Bob shovels a cubic foot of earth every 3 seconds so it will take 72 * 3 = <<72*3=216>>216 seconds to dig the hole.
