Question: Tim makes a special honey and jam mix.  To make 1 jar of the mixture it takes 2 pounds of passion fruit and 1.5 pounds of jackfruit.  It also takes 2 pounds of special honey.  The passion fruit costs $6 per pound, the jackfruit is $8 per pound, and the honey is $10 per pound.  He sells each jar for $50.  How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?

Reference Answer: The cost of the passion fruit is 2*6=$<<2*6=12>>12
The jackfruit cost 1.5*8=$<<1.5*8=12>>12
The honey is 2*10=$<<2*10=20>>20
So the total cost for a jar is 12+12+20=$<<12+12+20=44>>44
So the profit per jar is 50-44=$<<50-44=6>>6
So the total profit for 10 jars is 10*6=$<<10*6=60>>60
