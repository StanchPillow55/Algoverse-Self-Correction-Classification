Question: Miss Albert's class is composed of 12 boys and 12 girls. One-third of the girls and one-fourth of the boys are on varsity. How many students are not on varsity?

Reference Answer: There are 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 students in Miss Albert's class.
12 x 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 girls are on varsity.
12 x 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 boys are on varsity.
A total of 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 students in Miss Albert's class are on varsity.
Therefore, 24 - 7 = <<24-7=17>>17 students are not on varsity.
