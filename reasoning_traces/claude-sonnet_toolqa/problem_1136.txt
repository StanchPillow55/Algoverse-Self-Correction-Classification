Question: Bob has a certain number of marbles. If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, how many marbles will Bob have?

Reference Answer: Let B be the number of marbles Bob starts with.
2 dozen marbles is 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 marbles.
So after receiving 2 dozen more marbles, we know B + 24 = 60.
This means B = 60 - 24 = <<60-24=36>>36.
Bob ends with 36 - 10 = <<36-10=26>>26 marbles.
