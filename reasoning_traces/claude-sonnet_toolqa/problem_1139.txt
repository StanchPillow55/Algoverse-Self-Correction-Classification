Question: Russell orders his favorite bagels online.  Each pack of bagels costs $10.00 and has 9 bagels in the pack.  If he orders 4 packs of bagels, he will receive a 10% discount.  After ordering 4 bags, how much will each single bagel cost?

Reference Answer: He orders 4 packs of bagels and each pack costs $10.00 so that's 4*10 = $<<4*10=40.00>>40.00
He orders 4 packs at $40.00 and receives a 10% discount so his discount is 40*.10 = $4.00
The bagels cost $40.00 and he has a $4.00 discount making his total 40-4 = $<<40-4=36.00>>36.00
Each pack of bagels has 9 bagels per pack and he orders 4 packs so that's 9*4 = <<9*4=36>>36 bagels
His order total was $36.00 and there are 36 bagels so each bagel costs 36/36 = $<<36/36=1.00>>1.00
