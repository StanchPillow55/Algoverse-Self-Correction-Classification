Question: Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food and 6 packages of dog food. Each package of cat food contained 11 tins, and each package of dog food contained 6 tins. How many more tins of cat food than dog food did Kimberly buy?

Reference Answer: The number of cat food tins that Kimberley has bought is 8 × 11 = <<8*11=88>>88.
Whilst the number of dog food tins she has bought is 6 × 6 = <<6*6=36>>36.
There are 88 - 36 = <<88-36=52>>52 more tins of cat food than dog food.
