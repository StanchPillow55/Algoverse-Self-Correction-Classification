Question: Bethany can run 10 laps on the track in one hour.  Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.  Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.  Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.  How many more laps can Bethany run compared to Quinn?

Reference Answer: Trey can run 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 laps in one hour.
Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = <<14/2=7>>7 laps in one hour.
Quinn can run 7 - 2 = <<7-2=5>>5 laps.
Bethany can run 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 more laps compared to Quinn.
