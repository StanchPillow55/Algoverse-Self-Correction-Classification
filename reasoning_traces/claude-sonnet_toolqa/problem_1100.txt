Question: Bobby takes a 30 min lunch and 2 15 minutes break per day at the office.  After 5 days, how many hours do his lunches and breaks add up to?

Reference Answer: He has 2 15 minutes breaks per day so together they add up to 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30 minutes
He also has a 30-minute lunch every day so together with his 30-minute break he has a 30+30 = 60-minute break each day
Every day his breaks total 60 minutes and he takes these breaks 5 days per week so he takes 60*5 = <<60*5=300>>300 minutes of break time
60 minutes is in an hour so 300/60 = <<300/60=5>>5 hours of break time
