Question: Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and reads for half as long.  He does this 3 times a week.  How many hours does he spend on TV and reading in 4 weeks?

Reference Answer: He reads for 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 hour a night
So he spends 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 hours on these activities
That means he spends 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 hours a week on them
So in 4 weeks, he spends 9*4=<<9*4=36>>36 hours on these activities
