Question: In his training as a professional athlete, Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach, however, wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. If he took the coach's advice and trained for a month, what is the total distance he covered in June?

Reference Answer: Tyson's coach wants him to run 1/5 * 5000 meters = <<5000/5=1000>>1000 more meters per day.
When he took the coach's advice, he increased the training distance he runs per day to 5000 meters + 1000 meters = <<5000+1000=6000>>6000 meters.
He covered 6000 meters/day * 30 days/month =<<6000*30=180000>>180000 meters in June on his training sessions.
