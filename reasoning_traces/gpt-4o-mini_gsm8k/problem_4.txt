Question: Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?

Reference Answer: If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.
