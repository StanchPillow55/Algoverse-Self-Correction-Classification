Question: There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. If both aquariums have the same number of fish in them, how many fish are there in each aquarium?

Reference Answer: The difference between the number of snails is 32 - 4 = <<32-4=28>>28 snails.
There are 28/2 = <<28/2=14>>14 fish in both aquariums.
There are 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 fish in each aquarium.
