Question: Together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. Lily found 7 more than David. David found half of what Bodhi found. How many insects did Lily find?

Reference Answer: Let B = the number of insects Bodhi collected
David = B/2
Lily = B/2 + 7
B + B + 7 = 43
2B = <<36=36>>36
B = <<18=18>>18 insects
David = 18/2 = <<18/2=9>>9 insects
Lily = 9 + 7 = <<9+7=16>>16 insects
Lily found <<16=16>>16 insects.
