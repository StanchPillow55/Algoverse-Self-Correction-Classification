Question: Greta and Celinda are baking cookies. Greta bakes 30 cookies and Celinda bakes twice as many. If the pair eat 10 of the cookies while they are cooling and put the rest in a box, how many cookies are there in the box?

Reference Answer: Celinda bakes 30 cookies * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 cookies.
So in total, Celinda and Greta bakes a total of 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 cookies.
After eating some of the cookies, they have 90 baked cookies â€“ 10 eaten cookies = <<90-10=80>>80 cookies in the box.
