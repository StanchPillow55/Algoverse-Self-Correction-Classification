Question: Jake is shopping at a clothing store. The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Then, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price. The original price of the shoes is $40. What is the total amount of money Jake spends at the store?

Reference Answer: The cost of a T-shirt after 50% is taken off of the original price is $8 * 0.50 = $<<8*0.50=4>>4
The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $<<8+4=12>>12
The amount of money taken off from the original price of the shoes is $40 * 0.40 = $<<40*0.4=16>>16
The cost of the shoes after the sale is $40 - $16 = $<<40-16=24>>24
The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $12 + $24 = $<<12+24=36>>36
