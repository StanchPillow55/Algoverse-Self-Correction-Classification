Question: Jackson is planting tulips. He can fit 6 red tulips in a row and 8 blue tulips in a row. If Jackson buys 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips, how many rows of flowers will he plant?

Reference Answer: First, divide the number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row: 36 / 6 = <<36/6=6>>6 rows.
Next, divide the number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips per row: 24 / 8 = <<24/8=3>>3 rows.
Now add the number of rows of each color to find the total: 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 rows.
