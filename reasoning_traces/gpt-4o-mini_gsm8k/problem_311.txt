Question: In a family of 5, three people eat three eggs each day while the rest eat two eggs each day. If they eat eggs every day, how many eggs will the family consume in a week?

Reference Answer: Three persons eat 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 eggs each day.
So, 5 - 3 = <<5-3=2>>2 persons eat two eggs in a day.
Thus, 2 x 2 = 4 eggs are consumed by the two other people in a day.
So the family consumes 9 + 4 = <<9+4=13>>13 eggs each day.
Therefore, 13 x 7 = <<13*7=91>>91 eggs will be consumed by the family in a week.
