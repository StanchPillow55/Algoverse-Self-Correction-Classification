Question: Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20. This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5 and the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. What was the final value of the number train?

Reference Answer: If Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20, half the number is 1/2*20=<<20-10=10>>10
The starting value plus half the number is 20+10=<<20+10=30>>30
This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5, giving a total of 30/5 = <<30/5=6>>6
The starting value minus 12 is 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8
The resulting value after dividing by 5 was times by the starting value minus 12, a total of 8*6 = <<8*6=48>>48
