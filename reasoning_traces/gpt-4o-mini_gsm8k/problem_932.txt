Question: Maria invited 4 of her friends over for a water balloon fight in the backyard. At the start of the game, Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons. She had one water balloon for herself.  Then her mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons.  How many total balloons did the girls have?

Reference Answer: Maria's 4 friends started with 2 balloons * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 balloons.
Maria started with 1 balloon + 8 balloons = <<1+8=9>>9 balloons to begin with.
Maria's mom came out and gave each girl 3 more balloons, which is 5 girls * 3 balloons = <<5*3=15>>15 balloons.
Total balloons used by the girls is 9 + 15 = <<9+15=24>>24 balloons.
