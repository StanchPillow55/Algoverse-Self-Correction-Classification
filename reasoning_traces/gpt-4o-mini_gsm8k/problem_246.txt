Question: Jeans makeup artist charges her $250 an hour.  She requires very expensive makeup for a movie she is in and it takes 6 hours to do each day and she needs it done 4 times a week.  The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.  After the movie is done the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done.  How much did Jean pay?

Reference Answer: Jean pays 250*6=$<<250*6=1500>>1500 a day
So he pays 1500*4=$<<1500*4=6000>>6000 a week
So the work cost 6000*5=$<<6000*5=30000>>30,000
They give a discount of 30,000*.1=$<<30000*.1=3000>>3000
So the total cost paid is 30,000-3000=$<<30000-3000=27000>>27,000
#### 27000
