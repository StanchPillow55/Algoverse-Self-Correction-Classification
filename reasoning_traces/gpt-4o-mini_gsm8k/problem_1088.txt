Question: There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but John has to take 2 extra classes.  Each class is 40 minutes long.  He goes to class for 5 days a week.  He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning?

Reference Answer: He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day
That means he spends 40*8=<<40*8=320>>320 minutes per day in class
So he spends 320*5=<<320*5=1600>>1600 minutes a week
That means he spends 1600/16=<<1600/16=100>>100 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday
So he spends 1600+100+100=<<1600+100+100=1800>>1800 minutes per week
So he spends 1800/60=<<1800/60=30>>30 hours per week
