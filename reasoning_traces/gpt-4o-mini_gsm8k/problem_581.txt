Question: Max plans to watch two movies this weekend. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long while the second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. How many minutes will it take Max to watch the two movies?

Reference Answer: One hour has 60 minutes.
The first movie is 60 + 30 = <<60+30=90>>90 minutes long.
Two hours is equal to 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.
The second movie is 120 + 5 = <<120+5=125>>125 minutes long.
Max will take 90 + 125 = <<90+125=215>>215 minutes to watch the two movies.
