Question: A raspberry bush has 6 clusters of 20 fruit each and 67 individual fruit scattered across the bush. How many raspberries are there total?

Reference Answer: First find the number of fruit in clusters: 20 fruit/cluster * 6 clusters = <<20*6=120>>120 fruit
Then add the number of individual fruit to find the total number of fruit: 120 fruit + 67 fruit = <<120+67=187>>187 fruit
