Question: James buys a plane.  The plane cost $150,000.  He pays $5000 a month to rent a hanger to keep it in.  He also spends twice as much as that on fuel per month.  How much did it cost him to get and maintain the plane for the first year?

Reference Answer: The fuel cost 5000*2=$<<5000*2=10000>>10000 per month
With the hanger that means he pays 10000+5000=$<<10000+5000=15000>>15,000 per month
So he spends 12*15000=$<<12*15000=180000>>180,000 a year
That means the total cost was 150,000+180,000=$<<150000+180000=330000>>330,000
#### 330000
