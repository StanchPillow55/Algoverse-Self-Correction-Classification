Question: A farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from a cow. Since he has 3 cows, how many more cows does he need to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day?

Reference Answer: He extracts 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 liters of milk in a day.
He should extract 25-15=<<25-15=10>>10 liters more in a day.
For that, he needs 10/5=<<10/5=2>>2 more cows.
