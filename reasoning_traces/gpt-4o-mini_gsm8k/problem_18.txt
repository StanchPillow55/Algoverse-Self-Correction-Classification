Question: Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.  How many dozens of eggs will she eat in 4 weeks?

Reference Answer: She eats 3 eggs every day and there are 7 days in a week so she eats 3*7 = <<3*7=21>>21 eggs a week
After 4 weeks she will have eaten 4*21 = <<4*21=84>>84 eggs
There are 12 eggs in 1 dozen and she'll eat 84 eggs so that's 84/12 = <<84/12=7>>7 dozen eggs
