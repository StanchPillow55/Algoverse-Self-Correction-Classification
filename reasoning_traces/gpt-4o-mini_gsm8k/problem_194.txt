Question: Violetta wants to buy new crayons. She needs them in 5 different colors and prepared $20 for this purchase. One crayon costs $2. How much change will she get?

Reference Answer: Violetta is going to pay 5 * 2 = $<<5*2=10>>10 for the crayons she wants.
If she pays $20, she will get 20 - 10 = $<<20-10=10>>10 of change.
