Question: Kalinda is working on a 360 piece puzzle with her mom. Kalinda can normally add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can typically place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.  How many hours will it take them to complete this puzzle?

Reference Answer: Her mom places 2 pieces per minute because 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2
On average they get in 6 pieces per minute because 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6
It will take 60 minutes to complete the puzzle because 360 / 6 = <<360/6=60>>60
It will take one hour because 60 / 60 = <<60/60=1>>1
