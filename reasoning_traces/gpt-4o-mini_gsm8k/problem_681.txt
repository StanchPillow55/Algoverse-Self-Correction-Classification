Question: Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max has. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, and Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. If Katarina has 68 cookies, how many cookies do they have in total?

Reference Answer: Max’s has a total of 68+5 = <<68+5=73>>73 cookies.
Cookie Monster’s total amount of cookies is 73-12 = <<73-12=61>>61.
Summer’s total cookie amount is 73+23 = <<73+23=96>>96.
Total amount of cookies 68+73+61+96 = <<68+73+61+96=298>>298.
