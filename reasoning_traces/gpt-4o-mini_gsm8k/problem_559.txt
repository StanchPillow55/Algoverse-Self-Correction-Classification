Question: A stickler for health, Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. By contract, Octavia’s husband Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks. Juan’s doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. By how many cups must Juan reduce his daily coffee intake?

Reference Answer: Since the daily recommendation is 4 cups of coffee, Octavia drinks 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 cups
Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, which translates to 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 cups
Subtracting the daily recommended amount from Juan’s current coffee intake gives 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 cups
Juan must therefore reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups
