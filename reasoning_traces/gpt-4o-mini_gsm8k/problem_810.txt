Question: In one year, the number of students on campus doubles at the end of every month. If there are 10 students on campus at the beginning of the year, how many additional students would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year?

Reference Answer: At the end of January, the number of students doubles to 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20
At the end of February, the number of students increases to 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40
By the end of March, the number of students doubles to 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80
By the end of April, the number of students is 2*80=<<2*80=160>>160
At the end of May, the number of students has doubled to 2*160=<<2*160=320>>320
If there were initially 10 students, 320-10=<<320-10=310>>310 students would join the campus by the end of May.
