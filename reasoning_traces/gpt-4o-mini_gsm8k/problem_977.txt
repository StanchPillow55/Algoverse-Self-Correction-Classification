Question: Pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside.  Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles.  While on vacation, if she will be outside 4 hours a day over 8 days, how many bottles of sunscreen will she need to pack?

Reference Answer: She will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days so that's 4*8 = <<4*8=32>>32 hours
She applies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour and she'll be outside for 32 hours so she needs 1*32 = <<1*32=32>>32 ounces of sunscreen
Her bottle holds 8 ounces of sunscreen and she needs 32 ounces so she will need to pack 32/8 = 4 bottles of sunscreen
