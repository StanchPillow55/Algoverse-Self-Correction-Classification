Question: James is putting together 4 tables.  Each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws.  He has 40 screws.  How many screws will he have left over?

Reference Answer: Each table will take 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 screws
So he needs 8*4=<<8*4=32>>32 screws
That means he will have 40-32=<<40-32=8>>8 screws left over
