Question: Peter plans to go to the movies this week. He always gets a ticket for $7 and popcorn for $7. If he has 42 dollars for the week, how many times can he go to the movies?

Reference Answer: It costs him $14 to go to the movies because 7 + 7 = <<7+7=14>>14
He can go to the movies 3 times because 42 / 14 = <<42/14=3>>3
