Question: At a spa, Iris spent $400 to do her hair, 1/4 as much to do a manicure, and 3/4 as much money as a manicure to do a pedicure. How much money did she spend at the spa?

Reference Answer: The total amount of money that Iris used to do a manicure is 1/4*$400 = $<<1/4*400=100>>100
Together, she used $400+$100 = $<<400+100=500>>500 to do her hair and manicure,
If Iris also spent 3/4 as much money as a manicure to do a pedicure, she used 3/4*$100 = $<<3/4*100=75>>75 to do a pedicure.
At the spa, Iris spent a total of $500+$75 = $<<500+75=575>>575
