Question: Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less, each, because she had to complete some assignments. If the rest of the week she slept 1 hour more than those two days, how many hours did she sleep in total throughout the week?

Reference Answer: If on Monday she slept 8 hours, then she slept 8-2 = <<8-2=6>>6 hours on each of the next two days.
The total number of hours slept for the two days will be 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours.
If she slept 1 hour more for the rest of the week each day, then each day she slept 6+1 = <<6+1=7>>7 hours.
The total for the rest of the week will be 4*7 = <<4*7=28>>28 hours.
The total number of hours slept for the whole week will be 8+12+28 = <<8+12+28=48>>48 hours.
