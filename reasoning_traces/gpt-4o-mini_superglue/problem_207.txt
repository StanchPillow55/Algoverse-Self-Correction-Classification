Question: Joe's bag of Halloween candy has 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. If each chocolate bar weighs 40g, how much does Joe's bag of candy weigh, in grams?

Reference Answer: The candied apples weigh 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 grams each.
The chocolate bars weigh 40*25=<<40*25=1000>>1000 grams in total.
The candied apples weigh 20*80=<<20*80=1600>>1600 grams in total.
Joe's bag weighs 1000+1600=<<1000+1600=2600>>2600 grams.
