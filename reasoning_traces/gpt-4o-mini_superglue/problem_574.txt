Question: A food truck only sells grilled cheeses.  They source their bread for $3.00 a loaf and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  They spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches.  If they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, what is their net profit?

Reference Answer: They spend $3.00 on bread and $30.00 on cheese and condiments for a total of 3+30 = $<<3+30=33.00>>33.00
They sell 10 sandwiches at $7.00 apiece for a total of 10*7 = $<<10*7=70.00>>70.00
They made $70.00 and spent $33.00 for a net profit of 70-33 = $<<70-33=37.00>>37.00 per 10 sandwiches
