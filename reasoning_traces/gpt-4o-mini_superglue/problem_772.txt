Question: Tatiana is deciding how much of her weekend she wants to spend playing soccer. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. She is dividing her time between soccer, video games, and reading. If she reads for 3 hours and plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, what percentage of her weekend does she spend playing soccer?

Reference Answer: She has 12 hours for her activities because 7 + 5 = <<7+5=12>>12
After reading, she has 9 hours left because 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9
She spends 3 hours playing video games because 9 x (1/3) = <<9*(1/3)=3>>3
After video games she has 6 hours left for soccer because 9 - 3 = <<6=6>>6
The proportion of time spend on soccer is .5 because 6 / 12 = <<6/12=.5>>.5
The percentage of time spent on soccer is 50 because .5 x 100 = <<50=50>>50
#### 50
