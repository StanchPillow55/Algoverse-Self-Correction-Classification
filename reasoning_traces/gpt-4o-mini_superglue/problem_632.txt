Question: Max bought stamps at the post office. Some of the stamps had a snowflake design, some had a truck design, and some had a rose design. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. How many stamps did Max buy in all?

Reference Answer: Max bought 16 + 3 = <<16+3=19>>19 truck stamps.
Max bought 19 â€“ 9 = <<19-9=10>>10 rose stamps.
In total Max bought 16 snowflake + 19 truck + 10 rose stamps = <<16+19+10=45>>45 stamps.
