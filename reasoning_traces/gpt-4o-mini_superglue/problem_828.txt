Question: Mulan has $40. Her father gave her $100. She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each and a bag for $20. How much money does Mulan have left?

Reference Answer: Mulan has a total of $40 + $100 = $<<40+100=140>>140.
Two pairs of jeans cost 2 x $30 = $<<2*30=60>>60.
Thus, Mulan spends a total of $60 + $20 = $<<60+20=80>>80.
Therefore, Mulan has $140 - $80 = $<<140-80=60>>60 left.
