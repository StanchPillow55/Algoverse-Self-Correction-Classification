Question: Twenty kids went out on a school trip. In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells. The boys went out for the search and brought back 60 shells each. If the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, how many seashells were brought by each girl?

Reference Answer: When they divided, each group had 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 students.
The total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10*60 = <<10*60=600>>600
The girls brought four times more seashells than the boys, which is 4*600 = <<4*600=2400>>2400
The total number of seashells brought by the girls is 2400+600 = <<2400+600=3000>>3000
If there were 10 girls, then each girl brought 3000/10 = <<3000/10=300>>300 seashells
