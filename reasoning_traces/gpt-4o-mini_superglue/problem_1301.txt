Question: Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. How many cookies does he have now?

Reference Answer: Randy originally has 9+4+5 = <<9+4+5=18>>18 cookies in total.
He has 18-3 = <<18-3=15>>15 cookies left.
He has 15-2 = <<15-2=13>>13 cookies left.
He has 13-2 = <<13-2=11>>11 cookies left.
Randy bakes 4*3 = <<4*3=12>>12 cookies.
Randy has 11+12 = <<11+12=23>>23 cookies.
