Question: Out of the 150 teachers on the school basketball court, 60% are history teachers. If the rest of the teachers on the court are math teachers, and each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, calculate the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day.

Reference Answer: The total number of teachers in the basketball court who teaches history is 60/100*150 = <<60/100*150=90>>90
This means there are 150-90 = <<150-90=60>>60 math teachers are on the basketball court.
If each teacher sleeps for 6 hours daily, the total amount of time the math teachers sleep in a day is 60*6 = <<60*6=360>>360 hours.
