Question: Carl has a cane that is half as long as he is tall.  Carl is one foot taller than his brother, Ned.  And Ned is two feet shorter than his cousin, Isabel.  If Isabel is 7 feet tall, how long is Carl's cane, in feet?

Reference Answer: If Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, then Ned is 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 feet tall.
If Carl is one foot taller than Ned, then Carl is 5+1=<<5+1=6>>6 feet tall.
Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, or 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 feet long.
