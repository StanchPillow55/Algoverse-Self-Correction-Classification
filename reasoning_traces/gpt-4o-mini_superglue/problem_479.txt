Question: Tom decides to give his wife an anniversary getaway.  The plane tickets cost $5000 each.  The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal because it is a busy weekend.  The normal price is $1500 per day.  If they are there for 3 days how much did the trip cost?

Reference Answer: The hotel room is 1500*.2=$<<1500*.2=300>>300 more expensive per night than normal
So they paid 1500+300=$<<1500+300=1800>>1800 per night
That means she paid 1800*3=$<<1800*3=5400>>5400
The plane tickets cost 5000*2=$<<5000*2=10000>>10,000
So the total cost is 10,000+5400=$<<10000+5400=15400>>15,400
#### 15400
