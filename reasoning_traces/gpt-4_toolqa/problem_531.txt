Question: 48 people are riding a bus. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. On the second stop 21, passengers get off and 3 times fewer passengers get on. How many passengers are riding the bus after the second stop?

Reference Answer: At the first stop, 5 * 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 passengers get on the bus.
After the first stop the bus has ( 48 - 8 ) + 40 = <<48-8+40=80>>80 passengers.
At the second stop, 21 / 3 = <<21/3=7>>7 passengers get on the bus.
After the second stop there are ( 80 - 21 ) + 7 = <<80-21+7=66>>66 passengers.
