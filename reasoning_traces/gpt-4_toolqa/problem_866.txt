Question: Together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. If Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn does, how many books does Fawn have?

Reference Answer: Let x = the number of books Anne has.
Then x + 25 + x + 12 + x = 85
3x + 37 = 85
3x = 48
x = 48 / 3 = <<48/3=16>>16 books
Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.
