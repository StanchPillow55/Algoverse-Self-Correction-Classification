Question: Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day.  A pack of gum has 15 pieces of chewing gum per pack.  How many packs of gum will he need to last him 30 days?

Reference Answer: He chews 4 pieces of gum a day so over 30 days he will chew 4*30 = <<4*30=120>>120 pieces of gum
Each pack of gum holds 15 pieces and he needs 120 pieces for the month so he will need 120/15 = <<120/15=8>>8 packs of gum
