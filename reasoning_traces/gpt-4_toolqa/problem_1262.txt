Question: John decides to take up an odd hobby of speed talking.  His normally speaking speed is 150 WPM.  After training his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed.  How long would it take him to speak 10 pages if each page has 450 words per page?

Reference Answer: He can speak 150*2.5=<<150*2.5=375>>375 words per minute
He wants to say 450*10=<<450*10=4500>>4500 words
So he can speak them in 4500/375=<<4500/375=12>>12 minutes
