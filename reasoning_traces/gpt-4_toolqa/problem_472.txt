Question: Matt wants cookies for a snack, but his dad wants him to eat healthily. He tells Matt he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, how many carrot sticks does he have to eat?

Reference Answer: First subtract the two cookies Matt gets for cleaning his room from the total number he wants to eat: 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3
Then double the number of cookies to find how many carrots sticks he has to eat: 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6.
