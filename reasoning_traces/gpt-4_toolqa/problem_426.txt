Question: Aleksandra went to a restaurant for dinner. She ordered some soup, a bagel, and a piece of cake. The bagel cost $4, and the soup 25% more. The cake is only half of the price of the bagel. How much did Aleksandra need to pay for the dinner she ordered?

Reference Answer: The soup cost 4 * 25/100 = $<<4*25/100=1>>1 more than the bagel.
So the soup cost is 4 + 1 = $<<4+1=5>>5.
The cake is half the price of the bagel, so it is 4 * 0.5 = $<<4*0.5=2>>2.
Aleksandra needed to pay 4 + 5 + 2 = $<<4+5+2=11>>11 for dinner.
