Question: John had a son James when he was 19.  James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years.  How old will John's youngest son, who was born when John was 32, be in 3 years?

Reference Answer: Dora is 12-3=<<12-3=9>>9
So James is 9*2=<<9*2=18>>18 years old
That means John is 18+19=<<18+19=37>>37
Johns youngest son is 37-32=<<37-32=5>>5 years old
So he will be 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 in 3 years
#### 8
