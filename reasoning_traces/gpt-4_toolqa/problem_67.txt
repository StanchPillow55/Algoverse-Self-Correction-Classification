Question: A treasure hunter found a buried treasure chest filled with gems. There were 175 diamonds, 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and twice the number of emeralds than the rubies.   How many of the gems were there in the chest?

Reference Answer: There were 175 - 35 = <<175-35=140>>140 rubies in the treasure chest.
There were 140 x 2 = <<140*2=280>>280 emeralds in the treasure chest.
So, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 175 + 140 + 280 = <<175+140+280=595>>595.
