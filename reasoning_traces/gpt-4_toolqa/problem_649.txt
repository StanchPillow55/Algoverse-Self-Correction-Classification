Question: Fishio posted her selfie on Instagram. She received 2000 likes on the photo after 1 week. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. If she received 20000 more new likes recently, how many Instagram likes are there?

Reference Answer: After receiving 2000 likes on her photo on Instagram on the first week, Fishio received 70*2000 = <<70*2000=140000>>140000 new likes on the photo after three more weeks.
The total number of likes in the four weeks is 140000+2000 = <<140000+2000=142000>>142000
If Fishio received 20000 more likes recently, the number of likes on the photo is 142000+20000=<<142000+20000=162000>>162000
#### 162000
