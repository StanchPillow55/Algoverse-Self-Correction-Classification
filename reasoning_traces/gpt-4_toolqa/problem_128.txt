Question: Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost. Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. What's the total amount of money he will spend if each pepper costs 15$?

Reference Answer: A watermelon costs three times what pepper costs, which is 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
An orange price is 45 - 5= $<<45-5=40>>40.
Dillon buys four watermelons at a total cost of 45 * 4 = $<<45*4=180>>180.
He also purchases peppers at a total price of 20 * 15 = $<<20*15=300>>300.
The oranges cost him a total of 10 * 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
He used a total of 400 + 300 + 180 = $<<400+300+180=880>>880.
