Question: John drives to his friend's house 200 miles away.  He drives at a speed of 70 mph.  He had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip.  After he gets there he takes a route home that is 240 miles but he goes 80 mph.  How long did the trip take?

Reference Answer: The first leg was 200+10=<<200+10=210>>210 miles
So he drove 210/70=<<210/70=3>>3 hours
The second route took 240/80=<<240/80=3>>3 hours
So in total he drove 3+3=<<3+3=6>>6 hours
