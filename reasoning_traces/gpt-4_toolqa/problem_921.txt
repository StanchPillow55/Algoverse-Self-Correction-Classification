Question: A loaf of bread has 24 slices. If Abby can eat 2 slices a day while Josh can eat twice as much, how many days will the loaf of bread last?

Reference Answer: Josh can eat 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 slices a day.
Together, Abby and Josh can eat 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 slices a day.
So, a loaf of bread will last for 24/6 = <<24/6=4>>4 days.
