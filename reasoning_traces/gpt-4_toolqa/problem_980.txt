Question: Adrianne is collecting different kinds of beads for making bracelets. Her mother gave her 20 metallic beads. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, and her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave.  How many beads did Adrianne have altogether?

Reference Answer: Adrianne received 20 +10 = <<20+10=30>>30 beads from her sister.
And, she received 2 x 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 beads from her friend.
Therefore, Adrianne had 20 + 30 + 40 = <<20+30+40=90>>90 beads altogether.
