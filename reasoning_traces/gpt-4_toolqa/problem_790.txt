Question: At the trip to the county-level scavenger hunt competition, 90 people were required to split into groups for the competition to begin. To break people up into smaller groups with different leaders, 9-person groups were formed. If 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each, how many seashells did they bring?

Reference Answer: Since the total number of people at the competition was 90, they formed 90/9=<<90/9=10>>10 groups after splitting into 9-person groups.
If 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bringing back 2 seashells each, then 3/5*10=<<3/5*10=6>>6 groups had members bringing back 2 seashells.
Since each group had 9 people, the number of people in the 6 groups, who found 2 seashells each, was 6*9= <<6*9=54>>54.
The total number of seashells the 54 people brought is 54*2=<<54*2=108>>108 seashells.
