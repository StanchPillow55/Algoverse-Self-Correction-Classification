Question: A customerâ€™s loyalty card at a store gives them rewards of $1 off their next purchase for every $20 they spend. Their last shopping trip, they spent $80. This shopping trip, they spent $43, used their rewards, and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. How many dollars did the customer pay on this shopping trip?

Reference Answer: The customer had 80 / 20 = $<<80/20=4>>4 in rewards.
Their coupon was worth 4 * 2 = $<<4*2=8>>8.
Thus, they paid 43 - 4 - 8 = $<<43-4-8=31>>31 on this shopping trip.
