Question: Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If they sold 88,000 copies combined, how many copies did Harald sell?

Reference Answer: Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.
Substituting the second equation into the first, we get 10h + h = 88,000
Combining like terms, we get 11h = 88,000
Dividing both sides by 11, we get h = 8,000
#### 8000
