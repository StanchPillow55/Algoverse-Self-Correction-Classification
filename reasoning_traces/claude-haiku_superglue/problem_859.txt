Question: While working at the restaurant, each of the forty customers who came into the restaurant gave Rafaela a $20 tip. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. How much money did Julieta and Rafaela receive as tips altogether?

Reference Answer: The total amount of money that Rafaela received as tips from the forty customers is 40*$20 = $<<40*20=800>>800
Julieta got 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, a total of 10/100*$800 = $<<10/100*800=80>>80
The total amount of money that Julieta received as tips is $800-$80 = $<<800-80=720>>720
Altogether, Julieta, and Rafaela received $720+$800 = $<<720+800=1520>>1520
