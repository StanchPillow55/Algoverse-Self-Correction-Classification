Question: If every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, how many jellyfish would 5 springs working at the same rate create in 4 hours?

Reference Answer: Since an hour has 3600 seconds, if every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, it will create 4*3600 = <<4*3600=14400>>14400 jellyfish in four hours.
Five springs working at the same rate will create 14400*5 =<<14400*5=72000>>72000 jellyfish in four hours.
