Question: A team of 4 painters worked on a mansion for 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks. How many hours of work did each painter put in?

Reference Answer: There are 24 hours in a day so 3/8ths of a day is (3/8)*24 = <<3/8*24=9>>9 hours
One week has 7 days so 3 weeks have 7*3 = <<7*3=21>>21 days
Each painter put in 9*21 = <<9*21=189>>189 hours of work
#### 189
