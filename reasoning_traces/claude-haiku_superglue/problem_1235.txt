Question: Michael is traveling on the interstate at an average speed of 50km/hr (taking into account all the necessary stops for gas, relaxation, etc.). If he goes on like this for 3 days, and the distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km, what percentage of this distance has he covered?

Reference Answer: There are 24 hours in each day, so he has been traveling for a total of 3*24 = <<24*3=72>>72 hours
At a rate of 50km/hr he has covered 50*72 = <<50*72=3600>>3600 km
3600km as a percentage of 6000km is (3600/6000)*100% = 60%
#### 60
