Question: In a student council election, candidate A got 20% of the votes while candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. The rest of the votes was given to candidate C. If there were 100 voters, how many votes did candidate C get?

Reference Answer: Candidate A got 100 x 20/100 = <<100*20/100=20>>20 votes.
Candidate B got 20 x 50/100 = <<20*50/100=10>>10 more votes than candidate A.
Thus, candidate B got 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 votes.
Candidate A and B have 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 votes together.
Therefore, candidate C got 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50 votes.
