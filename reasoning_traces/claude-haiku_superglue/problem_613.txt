Question: A Reddit group has 1000 members. If each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, what's the total number of posts that the group will have in March?

Reference Answer: The total number of posts from all members in a day is 1000 members * 3 posts/member = <<1000*3=3000>>3000 posts.
March has 31 days, so the total number of posts will be 31 days * 3000 posts/day = <<31*3000=93000>>93000 posts
