Question: Brenda invested $300 into a scheme that accumulates simple interest at the rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year. How much in total will she have after 3 years?

Reference Answer: Three-quarters of $300 is (3/4)*$300 = $<<(3/4)*300=225>>225
After 3 years, interest of $225*3 = $<<225*3=675>>675 has been accumulated
She now has a total of $300+$675 = $<<300+675=975>>975
#### 975
