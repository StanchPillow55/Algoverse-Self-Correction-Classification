Question: James hires a horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.  He gets 1 hour free.  The first paid hour is $15 and each hour after that is twice the cost.  How much did he pay?

Reference Answer: He got it for 9-5=<<9-5=4>>4 hours
He pays for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours
The first hour cost 1*15=$<<1*15=15>>15
The other 3-1=2 hours are more expensive
They cost 15*2=$<<15*2=30>>30 per hour
So those 2 hours cost 2*30=$<<2*30=60>>60
So he pays 60+15=$<<60+15=75>>75 per hours
#### 75
