Question: While walking down the street with his 3 younger siblings, Greg found $20. To be fair to his siblings, he decided to split the money equally. How much money did each of them get?

Reference Answer: Greg and his 3 siblings equal 3 people + 1 person = <<3+1=4>>4 people.
The 20 dollars were divided equally, so each of them received $20 / 4 people = <<20/4=5>>5 dollars/person
