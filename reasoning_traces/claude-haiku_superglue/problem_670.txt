Question: Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy after Halloween. If they decide to pool and share their candy equally with each other, how much candy would each of them have?

Reference Answer: Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy which equals 3 + 5 + 4 = <<3+5+4=12>>12 pounds of candy
Since there are three of them (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron), they divide the candy into 3 equal portions. 12/3 = <<12/3=4>>4 pounds of candy
