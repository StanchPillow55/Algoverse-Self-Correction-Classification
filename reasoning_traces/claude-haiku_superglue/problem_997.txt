Question: Walter is collecting money for charity. First he collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well. How much is Walter's lawyer going to contribute?

Reference Answer: Walter collects $500 + $1500 + $200 = $<<500+1500+200=2200>>2,200 he collects from everyone for charity.
His lawyer has offered to donate 3 times that amount, $2,200 x 3 = $<<3*2200=6600>>6,600 that Walter's lawyer is going to donate.
#### 6,600
