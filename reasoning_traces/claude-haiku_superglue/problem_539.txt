Question: My wife wants to evenly split the check but wants me to pay an additional 20% tip on our $50 dinner bill. How much did I end up paying?

Reference Answer: If the total bill is $50, the total tip of 20% would be $50*20% = $<<50*20*.01=10>>10
Similarly, if the bill was $50 an even split (1/2) would be $50 * 1/2 = $<<50*1/2=25>>25 to be paid by each person
That means I paid $25 for the bill + $10 for the tip = $<<25+10=35>>35
