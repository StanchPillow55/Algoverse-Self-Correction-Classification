Question: In a room, there are various toys: 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and a doll. The doll cost as much as 3 action figures and one red car cost $4. How much are all toys worth, of an action figure costs $5?

Reference Answer: Three actions figures are worth 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15, as much as the doll.
The red cars are worth 5 * 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
So all toys are worth 20 + 15 + 15 = $<<20+15+15=50>>50.
