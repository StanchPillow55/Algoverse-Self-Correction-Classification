Question: Katina has $3000 in her savings account. If she removes $100 from the account every month, how much money will be remaining within the account after 2 years?

Reference Answer: A year has 12 months, and since she withdraws money from the account every month, after 2 years, she will have withdrawn money for 2*12= <<24=24>>24 months.
Since she withdraws money from the account every month, after 24 months, she would have withdrawn 24*$100 = $<<24*100=2400>>2400.
The total amount of money remaining in the account after two years is $3000-$2400= $<<3000-2400=600>>600
