Question: Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, driving 55 miles per hour. Tom is driving 70 miles per hour. How long will it take Tom to catch up with Bob?

Reference Answer: Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour to Bob's 55 miles per hour, meaning Tom is gaining at a rate of 70 mph - 55 mph = <<70-55=15>>15 mph.
Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, and if Tom is gaining 15 mph on him, it will take Tom 75 miles / 15 mph = <<75/15=5>>5 hours to catch up with Bob.
