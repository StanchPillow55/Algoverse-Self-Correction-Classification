Question: A tomato vendor decides to switch who he buys his tomatoes for.  He sells 500 tomatoes a day.  He used to buy them for $.5 each but he gets a new vendor who sells them for $.4 each.  How much money does he save a week?

Reference Answer: He buys 500*7=<<500*7=3500>>3500
He used to pay 3500*.5=$<<3500*.5=1750>>1750
He now pays 3500*.4=$<<3500*.4=1400>>1400
So he saves 1750-1400=$<<1750-1400=350>>350
