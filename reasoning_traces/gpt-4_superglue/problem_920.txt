Question: Larry loves taking care of animals.  He has 3 cats.  He has 3 times as many dogs as cats.  He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.  He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits.  He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has.  How many pets does Larry have?

Reference Answer: Larry has 3 cats and 3 times as many dogs as cats, for 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 dogs
Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than his 9 dogs, for 9-2=7 rabbits
Larry has 3 times as many fish as rabbits, for 3*7=<<7*3=21>>21 fish
Larry has 1 /3 as many gerbils as he has fish, for 21/3= 7 gerbils
Adding these all together, he has 9+7+21+7+3= <<9+7+21+7+3=47>>47 pets
