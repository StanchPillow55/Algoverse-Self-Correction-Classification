Question: Amalia, Megan, and Dior divided the home chores so that each person had something to do while the others were working. Amalia's work was to mow the lawn, which took her 4 hours. Megan had to walk the dog and this took her 2 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore. Dior's work was to do laundry and she took well over 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn. Calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether.

Reference Answer: Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to do her work, a total of 4+2 = 6 hours.
Amalia and Megan's total time to finish their work is 6+4 = <<6+4=10>>10 hours.
If Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn, and Dior took 4 hours longer than her while doing laundry, Dior took 4+4 = <<4+4=8>>8 hours to do the laundry.
In total, they took 10+8 = <<10+8=18>>18 hours together doing their chores.
