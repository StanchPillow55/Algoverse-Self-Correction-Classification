Question: If 6 potatoes makes 36 hash browns, how many hash browns can you make out of 96 potatoes?

Reference Answer: First find the number of hash browns per potato: 36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = <<36/6=6>>6 hash browns/potato
Then multiply that number by the number of potatoes to find the total number of hash browns: 6 hash browns/potato * 96 potatoes = <<6*96=576>>576 hash browns
