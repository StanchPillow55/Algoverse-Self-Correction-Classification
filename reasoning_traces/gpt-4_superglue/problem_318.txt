Question: If a classroom has 3 times as many girls as they do boys, and 1/10 as many nongendered children as they do boys, and the classroom has 30 boys.  How many total children does it have?

Reference Answer: The classroom has 3 * 30 boys = <<3*30=90>>90 girls.
The classroom has 1/10 nongendered children so 10/100 * 30 boys = <<10/100*30=3>>3 nongendered children.
In total the classroom has 90 + 30 + 3 = <<90+30+3=123>>123 students.
