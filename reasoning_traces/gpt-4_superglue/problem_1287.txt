Question: In a family, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters. All sisters are the same age, which is 16. One of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. What is the total age of all these siblings?

Reference Answer: Three sisters are in total 3 * 16 = <<3*16=48>>48 years old.
The younger brother is only half the age of the older one, which leads us to the older brother being 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 years old.
So all family members in total are 48 + 12 + 24 = <<48+12+24=84>>84 years old.
