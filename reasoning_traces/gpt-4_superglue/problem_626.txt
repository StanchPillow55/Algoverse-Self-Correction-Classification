Question: Ashley has an internet connection speed of 20kb per second. Knowing that 1 Mb has 1000 kb, she wants to know her internet connection speed in Mb per hour. What is Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour?

Reference Answer: With a speed of 20 kb per second, there are 20*60 = <<20*60=1200>>1200 kb per minute.
As 1Mb has 1000kb, the converted speed is 1200/1000=<<1200/1000=1.2>>1.2Mb per minute.
So, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 1.2*60 = <<1.2*60=72>>72Mb per hour.
