Question: Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, nine burger platters for $11 each, and 20 sodas for $1.50 each. How much money does he make in total?

Reference Answer: First find the total cost of the milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50/milkshake = $<<6*5.5=33>>33
Then find the total cost of the burger platters: 9 platters * $11/platter = $<<9*11=99>>99
Then find the total cost of the sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50/soda = $<<20*1.5=30>>30
Then add the money from each type of food to find total amount of money Terry earns: $33 + $99 + $30 = $<<33+99+30=162>>162
