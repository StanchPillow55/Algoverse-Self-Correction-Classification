Question: Judy bought a dozen cups and twice as many dishes as cups to take to the church's charity event. At the event, she found out that her friend had brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than she had brought. What's the total number of utensils brought by the two?

Reference Answer: Judy brought a dozen cups, which is <<12=12>>12.
Judy's number of plates was twice as many as cups which totals 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24
All the utensils brought by Judy is 24 dishes+12 cups = <<24+12=36>>36
Her friend brought 24+ 20 = <<24+20=44>>44 dishes.
The total number of utensils brought by Judy's friend is 44 dishes+40 cups = <<44+40=84>>84
When they combined their utensils, they brought together 84+36 = <<84+36=120>>120
