Question: Chatty prepared three dozen eggs for her four children's Easter activity. Assuming each child gets the same number of eggs, how many eggs does each child receive?

Reference Answer: Chatty prepared 3 dozen x 12 eggs/dozen = <<3*12=36>>36 eggs.
Since all four children receive the same number of eggs, each child gets 36 eggs / 4 children = <<36/4=9>>9 eggs/child
