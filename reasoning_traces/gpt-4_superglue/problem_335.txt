Question: Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar to make a batch of suckers and 70 ounces of sugar to make a batch of fudge. How much sugar does he need to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge?

Reference Answer: First find the total sugar needed for the suckers: 30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = <<30*8=240>>240 ounces
Then add the amount he needs to make the fudge to find the total amount of sugar needed: 240 ounces + 70 ounces = <<240+70=310>>310 ounces
