Question: 100 people apply for a job at Google. Of the people that apply, only 30% receive interviews. Of those who receive interviews, 20% receive a job offer. Of those who receive a job offer, a third of the people accept the position. How many people accept the position?

Reference Answer: The number of people that receive interviews is 100 * 0.30 = <<100*0.30=30>>30 people
The number of people that receive a job offer is 30 * 0.20 = <<30*0.20=6>>6 people
The number of people that accept the position is 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 people
