Question: Britany records 18 4-minute TikTok videos each week. She spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs to sing on TikTok, and 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup before filming herself for TikTok. How much time does Britany spend on TikTok in a month with four weeks?

Reference Answer: First find how long Britany spends recording the videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = <<18*4=72>>72 minutes
Then find how long she spends writing songs in minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes
Then find how long Britany spending doing her makeup in a week: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = <<15*6=90>>90 minutes/week
Then add the time she spends on videos and song-writing to find the total time she spends on TikTok in a week: 72 minutes/week + 90 minutes/week + 120 minutes/week = <<72+90+120=282>>282 minutes/week
Then multiply the time spent per week by the number of weeks per month to find the total time spent per month: 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = <<282*4=1128>>1128 minutes/month
