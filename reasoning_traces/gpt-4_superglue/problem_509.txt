Question: Sophia and Rose went together to the market to buy onions and potatoes. Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. If Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, how many onions and potatoes in total did Sophia buy at the market?

Reference Answer: The number of onions Sophia bought is 12 / 4 = <<12/4=3>>3 onions.
The number of potatoes Sophia bought is 4 / 4 = <<4/4=1>>1 potato.
So, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought at the market is 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4.
