Question: Tim decides to cancel his cable subscription and get streaming services.  He gets Netflix for $10 a month.  Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 a month each but he saves 20% for bundling.  How much money does he save by cancelling his $60 cable package?

Reference Answer: Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost 10+10=$<<10+10=20>>20
By bundling he saves 20*.2=$<<20*.2=4>>4
So in total it cost 20-4=$<<20-4=16>>16
So he pays 16+10=$<<16+10=26>>26 for streaming
That means he saves 60-26=$<<60-26=34>>34 a month
