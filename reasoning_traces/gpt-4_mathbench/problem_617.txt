Question: Prince is a butcher. He sells 15kg of meat every hour he works, and he works 10 hours a day. His friend Bill gives him a bull that weighs 750kg. How many days will it take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull?

Reference Answer: In a day Bill sells 15 * 10 = <<15*10=150>>150kg of meat.
It will take Bill 750 / 150 = <<750/150=5>>5 days to sell all the meat from the bull.
