Question: A zookeeper is counting how many lions are in their enclosure. She counts 12 female lions, half as many male lions, and 14 lion cubs. How many lions are in the enclosure?

Reference Answer: There are 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 male lions in the enclosure.
So there is a total of 12 + 6 + 14 = <<12+6+14=32>>32 lions in the enclosure.
