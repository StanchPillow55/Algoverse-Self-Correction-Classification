Question: Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck. How many more years does Lauren need to work if she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, live with 40% of her current annual salary, and her current salary is $100,000?

Reference Answer: Lauren plans to live in retirement with 40% of her current salary ($100,000), therefore 40%*$100,000 = $<<40*.01*100000=40000>>40,000
If she wants to save for 20 years, then she will need to save 20 * $40,000 = $<<20*40000=800000>>800,000 to retire
If her current salary is $100,00 and she's saving 20%, then she's able to save $100,000 * 20% = $<<100000*20*.01=20000>>20,000 every year
To reach her desired savings goal ($800,000) she will need to work for another $800,000/$20,000 = <<800000/20000=40>>40 years
