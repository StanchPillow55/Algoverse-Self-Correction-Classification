Question: Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. How many points did Azibo score?

Reference Answer: Let B = the number of points Bahati scored
Azibo = B - 20
Dinar = B - 10
B + B -20 + B - 10 = 45
3B - 30 = 45;
3B = 75
B = <<25=25>>25
Azibo = 25 - 20 = <<25-20=5>>5 points
Azibo scored 5 points.
