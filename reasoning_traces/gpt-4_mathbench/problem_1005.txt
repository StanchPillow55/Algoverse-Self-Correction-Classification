Question: The population of porcupines in a park is 50. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. If each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, how many porcupines will be in the park after a year?

Reference Answer: The number of female porcupines in the park is 3/5*50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30.
In a month, the 30 female porcupines give birth to 30*4 = <<30*4=120>>120 new babies.
After a year, with 12 months, the total number of new porcupines in the park is 120*12 = <<120*12=1440>>1440
The total population of porcupines in the park after a year is 50+1440 = <<50+1440=1490>>1490
#### 1490
