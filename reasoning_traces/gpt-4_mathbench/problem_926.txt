Question: Colby loves going to the movies and every month his parents give him $150 to spend at the movies. Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10. Tickets for any other day cost $7. Popcorn costs $8 and boxes of candy cost $2. It is the last day of the month and it's a Friday. He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. How many movies can he see if he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month?

Reference Answer: He has spent $50 on Fri/Sat movies because 5 x 10 = <<50=50>>50
He has spent $56 on movies the rest of the day because 8 x 7 = <<8*7=56>>56
He has spent $16 on popcorn because 2 x 8 = <<16=16>>16
He has spent $8 on candy because 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8
He has spent 130 in total because 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = <<50+56+16+8=130>>130
He plans to spend $10 on popcorn and candy because 8 + 2 = <<8+2=10>>10
He has $10 left to spend because 150 - 130 - 10 = <<150-130-10=10>>10
He can see 1 movie because 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1
