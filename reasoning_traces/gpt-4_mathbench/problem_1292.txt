Question: Jackie grew 3" over the summer.  She is now 2" shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert.  If Albert is 36" tall, how tall was Jackie before summer?

Reference Answer: Anne is twice the size of Albert, who is 36", so Anne is 2*36 = <<72=72>>72" tall
Anne is 72" tall and Jackie is 2" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72-2 = <<72-2=70>>70" tall
Jackie is currently 70" tall and grew 3" over summer, so before summer she was 70-3= <<70-3=67>>67" tall
