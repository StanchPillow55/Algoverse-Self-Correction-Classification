Question: The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If the 3 ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters, what was the length of the red rope in centimeters?

Reference Answer: Let Y = the length of the yellow rope in centimeters
Blue rope = Y - 7
Red rope = 4 * (Y - 7)
Y + Y - 7 + 4 (Y - 7) = 37 cm
6Y - 35 = 37
6Y = 72
Y = <<12=12>>12 cm
The red rope was 20 cm long.
