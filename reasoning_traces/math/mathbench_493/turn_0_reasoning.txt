==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample math problem 493." Since the problem is not provided, I will demonstrate how to solve a general math problem step-by-step. Let's consider a typical algebra problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start with the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step 3: Eliminate the Constant Term**
Subtract 3 from both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left side:

\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 4: Solve for \( x \)**
Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
