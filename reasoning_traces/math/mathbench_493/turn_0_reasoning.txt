==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 493" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "493" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 493" is as follows:

**Problem 493:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

Step 1: Define the variables.
- Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
- Since the length is 3 times the width, let the length be \( 3w \).

Step 2: Write the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle.
- The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
  \[
  P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
  \]

Step 3: Substitute the known values into the perimeter formula.
- We know the perimeter is 48 units, so:
  \[
  48 = 2 \times (3w + w)
  \]

Step 4: Simplify the equation.
- Combine like terms inside the parentheses:
  \[
  48 = 2 \times (4w)
  \]

Step 5: Solve for \( w \).
- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  48 = 8w
  \]
- Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( w \):
  \[
  w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
  \]

Step 6: Find the length using the width.
- Since the length is 3 times the width:
  \[
  \text{Length} = 3w = 3 \times 6 = 18
  \]

Step 7: Verify the solution.
- Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
  \[
  P = 2 \times (18 + 6) = 2 \times 24 = 48
  \]
- The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 6 units
- Length = 18 units
