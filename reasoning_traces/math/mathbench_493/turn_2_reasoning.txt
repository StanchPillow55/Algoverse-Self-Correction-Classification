==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 493" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 493:**

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - We know the relationship between the length and width, and we have the perimeter.

2. **Define variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( l \) is \( 3w \).

3. **Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - We know \( P = 48 \).

4. **Substitute the expression for the length into the perimeter formula:**
   \[
   48 = 2(3w) + 2w
   \]

5. **Simplify and solve for \( w \):**
   \[
   48 = 6w + 2w
   \]
   \[
   48 = 8w
   \]
   \[
   w = \frac{48}{8}
   \]
   \[
   w = 6
   \]

6. **Find the length using the relationship \( l = 3w \):**
   \[
   l = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

7. **Verify the solution:**
   - Check if the calculated dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The perimeter is indeed 48, which matches the given condition.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 6 units
- Length = 18 units
