==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 493" entails. Since the problem is not explicitly given, let's assume it is a typical math problem that involves basic arithmetic or algebra. I will create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 493:**

A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends a total of $25, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of fruits is 10. Therefore, the first equation is:
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
   - We also know the total cost is $25. The cost equation is:
     \[
     2x + 3y = 25
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
     2x + 3y &= 25 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \end{align*}
     \]

   - Solve Equation 1 for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 10 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 10 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     2x + 3(10 - x) = 25
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 30 - 3x = 25
     \]
     \[
     -x + 30 = 25
     \]
     \[
     -x = 25 - 30
     \]
     \[
     -x = -5
     \]
     \[
     x = 5
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( y \):
     \[
     5 + y = 10
     \]
     \[
     y = 10 - 5
     \]
     \[
     y = 5
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of fruits:
     \[
     x + y = 5 + 5 = 10 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]
   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     2x + 3y = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.
