==================================================

To solve the problem labeled as "Sample math problem 493," I need more specific information about the problem itself. Since the problem isn't provided, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem step-by-step. Let's assume the problem involves solving a quadratic equation, which is a common type of math problem.

**Problem:** Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step 1: Identify the quadratic equation.**

The given quadratic equation is in the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

**Step 2: Calculate the discriminant.**

The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by the formula:
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]

Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into the formula:
\[
\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
\]

**Step 3: Determine the nature of the roots.**

Since the discriminant \(\Delta = 64\) is greater than 0, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

**Step 4: Use the quadratic formula to find the roots.**

The quadratic formula is:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
\]

Substitute the values of \(b\), \(\Delta\), and \(a\) into the formula:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the two roots.**

Calculate the first root (\(x_1\)):
\[
x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
\]

Calculate the second root (\(x_2\)):
\[
x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
\]

**Final Answer:**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
