Question ID: 880
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will go through the steps systematically.

1. **Calculate the total selling price of the rope:**
   Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 per meter. 

   \[
   \text{Total selling price} = \text{Length of rope} \times \text{Price per meter}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total selling price} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of the new rope:**
   Sarah plans to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 per meter. We need to find out how much she can buy with the money she has from selling the old rope.

   Let \( x \) be the length of the new rope she can buy. The cost of the new rope will be:

   \[
   \text{Cost of new rope} = x \, \text{meters} \times 1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter}
   \]

   To find out how much rope she can buy with her $40, we set up the equation:

   \[
   1.5x = 40
   \]

   Now, we solve for \( x \):

   \[
   x = \frac{40}{1.5}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4000}{150} = \frac{800}{30} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \, \text{meters}
   \]

   So, Sarah can buy approximately 26.67 meters of new rope.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the new rope:**
   Now we calculate the total cost of the new rope she can buy:

   \[
   \text{Total cost of new rope} = x \times 1.5 = \frac{80}{3} \times 1.5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of new rope} = \frac{80 \times 1.5}{3} = \frac{120}{3} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how much money Sarah has left over:**
   Since the total selling price of the old rope is $40 and the total cost of the new rope is also $40, we can find out how much money Sarah has left over:

   \[
   \text{Money left over} = \text{Total selling price} - \text{Total cost of new rope}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Money left over} = 40 - 40 = 0 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, after buying the new rope, Sarah will have **$0 left over**.

**Final Answer: $0**
