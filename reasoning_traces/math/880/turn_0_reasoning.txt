To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total selling price of the rope Sarah is selling.**
2. **Determine how much new rope Sarah can buy with the profit from selling the old rope.**
3. **Calculate how much money she will have left over after buying the new rope.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total selling price of the rope

Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 per meter. 

To find the total selling price, we multiply the length of the rope by the price per meter:

\[
\text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Length of Rope} \times \text{Price per Meter}
\]
\[
\text{Total Selling Price} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much new rope Sarah can buy

Next, we need to find out how much new rope Sarah can buy with the $40 she made from selling the old rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter.

To find out how many meters of new rope she can buy, we divide the total amount of money she has by the price per meter of the new rope:

\[
\text{Meters of New Rope} = \frac{\text{Total Money}}{\text{Price per Meter of New Rope}}
\]
\[
\text{Meters of New Rope} = \frac{40 \, \text{dollars}}{1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter}} \approx 26.67 \, \text{meters}
\]

Since Sarah cannot buy a fraction of a meter of rope, she can buy 26 meters of new rope.

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the new rope

Now we need to calculate how much money Sarah will spend on the 26 meters of new rope:

\[
\text{Cost of New Rope} = \text{Meters of New Rope} \times \text{Price per Meter of New Rope}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of New Rope} = 26 \, \text{meters} \times 1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 39 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate how much money Sarah will have left over

Finally, we will find out how much money Sarah has left after buying the new rope:

\[
\text{Money Left Over} = \text{Total Money} - \text{Cost of New Rope}
\]
\[
\text{Money Left Over} = 40 \, \text{dollars} - 39 \, \text{dollars} = 1 \, \text{dollar}
\]

### Final Answer

After buying the new rope, Sarah will have **$1** left over.
