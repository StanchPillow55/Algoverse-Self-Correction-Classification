==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total selling price of the rope Sarah is selling.**
   - Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long.
   - Her friend wants to buy the rope for $2 per meter.
   - Total selling price = Length of rope Ã— Price per meter
   \[
   \text{Total selling price} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine how much new rope Sarah can buy with the profit.**
   - The new rope costs $1.5 per meter.
   - To find out how many meters of new rope Sarah can buy, we divide the total selling price by the cost per meter of the new rope.
   \[
   \text{Meters of new rope} = \frac{\text{Total selling price}}{\text{Cost per meter of new rope}} = \frac{40 \, \text{dollars}}{1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter}} \approx 26.67 \, \text{meters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the new rope.**
   - We need to find out how much money Sarah will spend on the new rope.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of new rope} = \text{Meters of new rope} \times \text{Cost per meter of new rope} = 26.67 \, \text{meters} \times 1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter} \approx 40 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how much money Sarah will have left over.**
   - Since Sarah spends all the money she earned from selling the rope on the new rope, she will have:
   \[
   \text{Money left over} = \text{Total selling price} - \text{Total cost of new rope} = 40 \, \text{dollars} - 40 \, \text{dollars} = 0 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, after buying the new rope, Sarah will have **$0 left over**.

**Final Answer: $0**
