==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps and calculations carefully, keeping track of how many slices of cake are given away or eaten at each stage.

1. **Calculate the total number of slices:**
   - Alex has 2 cakes, and each cake is cut into 8 slices.
   - Therefore, the total number of slices is:
     \[
     2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ slices}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of slices given to friends:**
   - A fourth of the slices are given away to his friends.
   - Calculate one-fourth of the total slices:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \text{ slices}
     \]
   - After giving away 4 slices to friends, the remaining number of slices is:
     \[
     16 - 4 = 12 \text{ slices}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of slices given to family:**
   - A third of the remaining slices are given away to his family.
   - Calculate one-third of the remaining 12 slices:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices}
     \]
   - After giving away 4 slices to family, the remaining number of slices is:
     \[
     12 - 4 = 8 \text{ slices}
     \]

4. **Account for the slices Alex eats:**
   - Alex eats 3 slices.
   - Subtract the slices Alex eats from the remaining slices:
     \[
     8 - 3 = 5 \text{ slices}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - After all the distributions and Alex eating some slices, the number of slices left is 5.

Therefore, the final answer is that Alex has \(\boxed{5}\) slices of cake left.
