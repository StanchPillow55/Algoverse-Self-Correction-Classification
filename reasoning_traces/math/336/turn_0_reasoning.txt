==================================================

To solve the problem, we will go through it step by step, calculating the number of cake slices at each stage.

1. **Calculate the total number of slices:**
   Alex has 2 cakes, and each cake is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices is:
   \[
   \text{Total slices} = 2 \text{ cakes} \times 8 \text{ slices/cake} = 16 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Determine how many slices are given away to friends:**
   A fourth of the total slices are given away to his friends. To find out how many slices that is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Slices given to friends} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 \text{ slices} = 4 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining slices after giving some to friends:**
   After giving away 4 slices to friends, the number of slices remaining is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining slices} = 16 \text{ slices} - 4 \text{ slices} = 12 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Determine how many slices are given away to family:**
   A third of the remaining slices are given away to his family. We calculate how many slices that is:
   \[
   \text{Slices given to family} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \text{ slices} = 4 \text{ slices}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining slices after giving some to family:**
   After giving away 4 slices to family, the number of slices remaining is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining slices} = 12 \text{ slices} - 4 \text{ slices} = 8 \text{ slices}
   \]

6. **Determine how many slices Alex eats:**
   Alex eats 3 slices. We subtract this from the remaining slices:
   \[
   \text{Remaining slices after Alex eats} = 8 \text{ slices} - 3 \text{ slices} = 5 \text{ slices}
   \]

7. **Final count of slices left:**
   After all the transactions, the final number of slices left is:
   \[
   \text{Final answer} = 5 \text{ slices}
   \]

Thus, the number of slices of cake left is \( \boxed{5} \).
