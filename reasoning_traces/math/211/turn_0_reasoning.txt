==================================================

Let \( r \) represent the number of red chickens Jerry has. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, we can express the number of white chickens as \( w = r + 2 \).

Next, we know the following about egg production:
- Each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day.
- Each white chicken produces 5 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is:
\[
3r
\]
The total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is:
\[
5w = 5(r + 2)
\]

According to the problem, Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs each day. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[
3r + 5w = 42
\]

Substituting \( w \) with \( r + 2 \) in the equation gives:
\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

Now, we can simplify this equation:
\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]
\[
8r + 10 = 42
\]

Next, we isolate \( r \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:
\[
8r = 42 - 10
\]
\[
8r = 32
\]

Now, divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( r \):
\[
r = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Thus, Jerry has \( r = 4 \) red chickens.

To find the number of white chickens, we substitute \( r \) back into the equation for \( w \):
\[
w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

Now, let's verify the total number of eggs produced:
- Eggs from red chickens: \( 3r = 3 \times 4 = 12 \)
- Eggs from white chickens: \( 5w = 5 \times 6 = 30 \)

Adding these together gives:
\[
12 + 30 = 42
\]

This matches the total number of eggs Jerry collects, confirming our solution is correct.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
