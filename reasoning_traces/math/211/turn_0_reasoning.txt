To determine how much more Jessica pays for her expenses over the whole year compared to last year, we need to calculate her total expenses for both last year and this year, and then find the difference.

**Step 1: Calculate last year's monthly expenses.**

- Rent: $1000 per month
- Food: $200 per month
- Car Insurance: $100 per month

Total monthly expenses last year = Rent + Food + Car Insurance
\[ 
= 1000 + 200 + 100 = 1300 \text{ dollars per month}
\]

Total expenses for the whole year last year:
\[ 
1300 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 15600 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate this year's monthly expenses.**

- **Rent:** Rent increases by 30%. 
  \[
  \text{New Rent} = 1000 + (0.30 \times 1000) = 1000 + 300 = 1300 \text{ dollars per month}
  \]

- **Food:** Food costs increase by 50%.
  \[
  \text{New Food Cost} = 200 + (0.50 \times 200) = 200 + 100 = 300 \text{ dollars per month}
  \]

- **Car Insurance:** Car insurance cost triples.
  \[
  \text{New Car Insurance Cost} = 3 \times 100 = 300 \text{ dollars per month}
  \]

Total monthly expenses this year = New Rent + New Food Cost + New Car Insurance Cost
\[
= 1300 + 300 + 300 = 1900 \text{ dollars per month}
\]

Total expenses for the whole year this year:
\[
1900 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 22800 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in expenses between this year and last year.**

Difference in total expenses = Total expenses this year - Total expenses last year
\[
= 22800 - 15600 = 7200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Jessica pays **$7200 more** for her expenses over the whole year compared to last year.
