To find out how much more Jessica pays for her expenses over the whole year compared to last year, we will first calculate her total expenses for last year and then her total expenses for this year. Finally, we will find the difference between the two amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate Last Year's Monthly Expenses

1. **Rent**: $1000
2. **Food**: $200
3. **Car Insurance**: $100

Now, we will sum these amounts to find her total monthly expenses last year:

\[
\text{Total Monthly Expenses Last Year} = \text{Rent} + \text{Food} + \text{Car Insurance}
\]
\[
\text{Total Monthly Expenses Last Year} = 1000 + 200 + 100 = 1300
\]

Next, we calculate her total expenses for the entire year:

\[
\text{Total Yearly Expenses Last Year} = \text{Total Monthly Expenses Last Year} \times 12
\]
\[
\text{Total Yearly Expenses Last Year} = 1300 \times 12 = 15600
\]

### Step 2: Calculate This Year's Monthly Expenses

Now we will calculate her expenses for this year based on the increases provided:

1. **Rent Increase**: 
   - Rent increases by 30%.
   - New Rent = \(1000 + (0.30 \times 1000) = 1000 + 300 = 1300\)

2. **Food Increase**: 
   - Food costs increase by 50%.
   - New Food = \(200 + (0.50 \times 200) = 200 + 100 = 300\)

3. **Car Insurance Increase**: 
   - Car insurance triples.
   - New Car Insurance = \(3 \times 100 = 300\)

Now, we will sum these amounts to find her total monthly expenses this year:

\[
\text{Total Monthly Expenses This Year} = \text{New Rent} + \text{New Food} + \text{New Car Insurance}
\]
\[
\text{Total Monthly Expenses This Year} = 1300 + 300 + 300 = 1900
\]

Next, we calculate her total expenses for the entire year:

\[
\text{Total Yearly Expenses This Year} = \text{Total Monthly Expenses This Year} \times 12
\]
\[
\text{Total Yearly Expenses This Year} = 1900 \times 12 = 22800
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Difference in Expenses

Now, we find out how much more Jessica pays this year compared to last year:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total Yearly Expenses This Year} - \text{Total Yearly Expenses Last Year}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 22800 - 15600 = 7200
\]

### Final Answer

Jessica pays **$7200** more for her expenses over the whole year compared to last year.
