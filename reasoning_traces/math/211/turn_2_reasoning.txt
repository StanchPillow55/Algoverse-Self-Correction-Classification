==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( r \) = the number of red chickens
- \( w \) = the number of white chickens

From the problem, we know two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of eggs collected daily is 42.
2. There are two more white chickens than red chickens.

We can express the second piece of information as:
\[
w = r + 2
\]

Next, we know the egg production rates:
- Each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day.
- Each white chicken produces 5 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs produced by all the chickens can be expressed as:
\[
3r + 5w = 42
\]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( w \) from the second equation into the first equation. Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the egg production equation gives us:
\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation:
\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]
\[
8r + 10 = 42
\]

Next, we will isolate \( r \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:
\[
8r = 42 - 10
\]
\[
8r = 32
\]

Now, divide both sides by 8:
\[
r = \frac{32}{8}
\]
\[
r = 4
\]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. 

Now, let's find the number of white chickens using the equation \( w = r + 2 \):
\[
w = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

To verify, we can check the total egg production:
- Red chickens produce: \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) eggs
- White chickens produce: \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \) eggs
- Total eggs: \( 12 + 30 = 42 \) eggs

Since the calculations are consistent with the problem statement, we can conclude that the solution is correct.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
