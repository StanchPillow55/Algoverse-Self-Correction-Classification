Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens and \( w \) be the number of white chickens. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

2. The total number of eggs produced by the red and white chickens is 42 eggs per day. The red chickens produce 3 eggs each, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs each:
   \[
   3r + 5w = 42
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( w \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

Expanding this equation gives:

\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]

Combining like terms results in:

\[
8r + 10 = 42
\]

Next, we isolate \( r \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[
8r = 32
\]

Now, divide both sides by 8:

\[
r = 4
\]

Now that we have the number of red chickens, we can find the number of white chickens using the first equation:

\[
w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

To verify, we can check the total number of eggs produced:

- Red chickens produce: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) eggs
- White chickens produce: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) eggs

Adding these gives:

\[
12 + 30 = 42 \text{ eggs}
\]

This confirms our calculations are correct. 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\] 

Jerry has 4 red chickens.
