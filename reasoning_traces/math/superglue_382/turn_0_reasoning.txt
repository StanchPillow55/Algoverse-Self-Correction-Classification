==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 382" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and calculations. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. Last month, the company produced a total of 500 widgets and made a total profit of $2,000. How many of each type of widget did the company produce?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Total widgets produced: 
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - Profit equation:
     - Profit from Type A = (Selling price - Cost price) \(\times\) Number of units = \((10 - 5)x = 5x\)
     - Profit from Type B = (Selling price - Cost price) \(\times\) Number of units = \((15 - 8)y = 7y\)
     - Total profit = $2,000:
     \[
     5x + 7y = 2000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 500 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   5x + 7y &= 2000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   - From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 500 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     5x + 7(500 - x) = 2000
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     5x + 3500 - 7x = 2000
     \]
     \[
     -2x + 3500 = 2000
     \]
     \[
     -2x = 2000 - 3500
     \]
     \[
     -2x = -1500
     \]
     \[
     x = 750
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 750 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - 750
     \]
     \[
     y = -250
     \]

   However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as the number of widgets cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate our steps.

4. **Re-evaluate the Solution:**

   Upon reviewing, we see that the calculation error occurred in solving the equation. Let's correct it:

   - From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 500 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     5x + 7(500 - x) = 2000
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     5x + 3500 - 7x = 2000
     \]
     \[
     -2x + 3500 = 2000
     \]
     \[
     -2x = 2000 - 3500
     \]
     \[
     -2x = -1500
     \]
     \[
     x = 750
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 750 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - 750
     \]
     \[
     y = -250
     \]

   The error persists, indicating a fundamental issue with the setup or assumptions. Let's re-evaluate the problem constraints or assumptions.

5. **Reconsider Problem Constraints:**

   Upon re-evaluation, the constraints or assumptions may need adjustment. For instance, the total profit or production numbers might be incorrect or misinterpreted.

**Final Answer:**

Given the hypothetical problem setup and calculations, the solution process revealed inconsistencies, suggesting a need for revisiting problem constraints or assumptions. In a real-world scenario, verifying input data and assumptions is crucial for accurate solutions.
