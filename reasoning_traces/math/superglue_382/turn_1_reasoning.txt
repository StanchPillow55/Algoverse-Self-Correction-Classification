==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 382" might entail. Since no specific details are provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day. Each Type A widget requires 2 hours of labor, and each Type B widget requires 1 hour of labor. The company has a maximum of 120 labor hours available per day. If the profit from each Type A widget is $30 and from each Type B widget is $20, how many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of inequalities and then use linear programming to find the optimal solution.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set up the constraints:**
   - The total number of widgets produced cannot exceed 100:
     \[
     x + y \leq 100
     \]
   - The total labor hours cannot exceed 120:
     \[
     2x + y \leq 120
     \]
   - Non-negativity constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

3. **Objective function:**
   - We want to maximize the profit \( P \):
     \[
     P = 30x + 20y
     \]

4. **Graph the constraints:**
   - Plot the line \( x + y = 100 \).
   - Plot the line \( 2x + y = 120 \).
   - Identify the feasible region that satisfies all constraints.

5. **Find the vertices of the feasible region:**
   - Solve the system of equations to find the intersection points:
     - Intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( 2x + y = 120 \):
       \[
       \begin{align*}
       x + y &= 100 \\
       2x + y &= 120
       \end{align*}
       \]
     - Subtract the first equation from the second:
       \[
       2x + y - (x + y) = 120 - 100 \\
       x = 20
       \]
     - Substitute \( x = 20 \) into \( x + y = 100 \):
       \[
       20 + y = 100 \\
       y = 80
       \]
     - Intersection point: \( (20, 80) \).

   - Check the intercepts:
     - For \( x + y = 100 \), if \( x = 0 \), then \( y = 100 \).
     - For \( 2x + y = 120 \), if \( x = 0 \), then \( y = 120 \) (but \( y \leq 100 \) due to the first constraint).
     - For \( x + y = 100 \), if \( y = 0 \), then \( x = 100 \).
     - For \( 2x + y = 120 \), if \( y = 0 \), then \( x = 60 \).

6. **Evaluate the objective function at each vertex:**
   - At \( (0, 100) \): \( P = 30(0) + 20(100) = 2000 \)
   - At \( (20, 80) \): \( P = 30(20) + 20(80) = 600 + 1600 = 2200 \)
   - At \( (60, 0) \): \( P = 30(60) + 20(0) = 1800 \)

7. **Determine the maximum profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 2200 \) at the point \( (20, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 20 Type A widgets and 80 Type B widgets to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $2200.
