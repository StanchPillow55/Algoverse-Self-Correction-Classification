==================================================

To solve the problem, we will first determine the total number of pizzas ordered, then calculate how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his friends, and finally find out how many slices are left.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizzas

Bryce and his four friends make a total of 5 people. Each person ordered 1 pizza, so:

\[
\text{Total pizzas} = 5 \text{ people} \times 1 \text{ pizza/person} = 5 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of slices

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices in all pizzas is:

\[
\text{Total slices} = 5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} = 60 \text{ slices}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many slices were eaten

**Bryce and two friends:**
- They ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas.
- Since there are 3 people (Bryce + 2 friends), the total number of pizzas they had is 3.

The number of slices they ate is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Slices eaten by Bryce and friends} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} \times \frac{2}{3} = 3 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Calculate the total slices for 3 pizzas:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. Now calculate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 36 slices:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ slices}
   \]

**Two remaining friends:**
- They ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas.
- There are 2 remaining friends, so they had 2 pizzas.

The number of slices they ate is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Slices eaten by remaining friends} = 2 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} \times \frac{3}{4} = 2 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Calculate the total slices for 2 pizzas:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. Now calculate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of 24 slices:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 24 = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total slices eaten

Now, we add the slices eaten by both groups:

\[
\text{Total slices eaten} = 24 \text{ slices (Bryce and friends)} + 18 \text{ slices (remaining friends)} = 42 \text{ slices}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the remaining slices

Finally, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total slices available:

\[
\text{Slices left} = \text{Total slices} - \text{Total slices eaten} = 60 \text{ slices} - 42 \text{ slices} = 18 \text{ slices}
\]

### Final Answer

The number of slices of pizza left is:

\[
\boxed{18}
\]
