Question ID: superglue_303
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 303" refers to. Since the question itself is not explicitly provided, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 100 positive integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 100 positive integers. These integers are 1, 2, 3, ..., 100.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 100 \). Substitute 100 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{100(100 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate Inside the Parentheses:**
   \[
   100 + 1 = 101
   \]

5. **Multiply:**
   \[
   100 \times 101 = 10100
   \]

6. **Divide by 2:**
   \[
   S = \frac{10100}{2} = 5050
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 100 positive integers is 5050.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 100 positive integers is 5050.
