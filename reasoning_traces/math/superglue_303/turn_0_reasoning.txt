==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 303" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that involves logical reasoning and calculations. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company sells two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company sells Product A for $20 each and Product B for $30 each. In one day, the company sold a total of 100 products and made $2,400 in revenue. How many of each product did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Product A sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Product B sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know the total number of products sold is 100:
     \[
     x + y = 100
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue is $2,400:
     \[
     20x + 30y = 2400
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 100 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   20x + 30y &= 2400 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution Method:**

   From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 100 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 100 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   20x + 30(100 - x) = 2400
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   20x + 3000 - 30x = 2400
   \]
   \[
   -10x + 3000 = 2400
   \]
   \[
   -10x = 2400 - 3000
   \]
   \[
   -10x = -600
   \]
   \[
   x = 60
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 60 \) back into the expression for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 100 - 60 = 40
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check if these values satisfy both equations:
   - For Equation 1: \( x + y = 60 + 40 = 100 \) (Correct)
   - For Equation 2: \( 20x + 30y = 20(60) + 30(40) = 1200 + 1200 = 2400 \) (Correct)

Both equations are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The company sold 60 units of Product A and 40 units of Product B.
