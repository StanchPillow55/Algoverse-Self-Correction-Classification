To solve the problem effectively, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 303." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by solving an example problem. Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a rectangle with a length that is twice its width.
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units.
   - We need to find the dimensions of the rectangle (length and width).

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Since the length is twice the width, the length \( l \) can be expressed as \( l = 2w \).

3. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 36 units, so we can set up the equation:
     \[
     2l + 2w = 36
     \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for Length:**
   - Substitute \( l = 2w \) into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(2w) + 2w = 36
     \]

5. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     4w + 2w = 36
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     6w = 36
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = 6
     \]

6. **Find the Length:**
   - Use the expression for length \( l = 2w \):
     \[
     l = 2(6) = 12
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

8. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the rectangle are: width = 6 units, length = 12 units.

This is the complete reasoning and solution for the sample problem. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample reasoning question 303," please provide the details, and I will solve it accordingly.
