==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis travels in both directions and then determine his final position relative to his starting point (his house).

### Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled west

Elvis drives west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 miles per hour (mph). We can calculate the distance using the formula:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

For the westward journey:

\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{west}} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled east

Next, Elvis turns around and drives east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18 mph. We will again use the distance formula:

For the eastward journey:

\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{east}} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 144 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 3: Determine his final position relative to his house

Now we need to find out how far he is from his house after both parts of the journey. 

1. After traveling west, he is 90 miles away from his house.
2. After traveling east, he travels back towards his house. The distance he travels east (144 miles) is greater than the distance he traveled west (90 miles).

To find his final position, we can calculate the net distance:

\[
\text{Net Distance} = \text{Distance traveled east} - \text{Distance traveled west}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Net Distance} = 144 \, \text{miles} - 90 \, \text{miles} = 54 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Conclusion

Elvis is 54 miles east of his house after completing his journey.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{54 \text{ miles}}
\]
