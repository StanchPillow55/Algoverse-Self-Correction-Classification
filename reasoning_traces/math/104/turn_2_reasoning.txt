Question ID: 104
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people the boat can transport in 2 days, given the constraints provided.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Capacity per Trip:**
   - The boat can take up to 12 people during one trip.

2. **Calculate the Total Capacity for One Day:**
   - There are 4 boat trips through the lake in one day.
   - For each trip, the boat can carry 12 people.
   - Therefore, the total number of people the boat can transport in one day is calculated by multiplying the number of trips by the capacity per trip:
     \[
     \text{Total capacity per day} = 4 \text{ trips/day} \times 12 \text{ people/trip} = 48 \text{ people/day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Capacity for Two Days:**
   - We need to find out how many people the boat can transport in 2 days.
   - Since the boat can transport 48 people in one day, in two days it can transport:
     \[
     \text{Total capacity for 2 days} = 48 \text{ people/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 96 \text{ people}
     \]

### Conclusion:

The boat can transport a total of 96 people in 2 days.

**Final Answer: 96 people**
