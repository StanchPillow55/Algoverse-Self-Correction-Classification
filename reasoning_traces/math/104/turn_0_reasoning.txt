Question ID: 104
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of pieces in the puzzle.**
   The total number of pieces in the jigsaw puzzle is given as 1000.

2. **Calculate the number of pieces Poppy places on the board.**
   Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board. To find out how many pieces that is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of pieces remaining after Poppy places her pieces.**
   After Poppy places 250 pieces, we need to find out how many pieces are left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of pieces Poppy's mom places on the board.**
   Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces. We need to calculate one third of the remaining 750 pieces:
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by mom} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of pieces remaining after Poppy's mom places her pieces.**
   After Poppy's mom places 250 pieces, we find out how many pieces are left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 750 - 250 = 500
   \]

6. **State the final answer.**
   The number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:
   \[
   \boxed{500}
   \]
