==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people the boat can transport in 2 days given the constraints provided.

**Step 1: Determine the capacity per trip.**

The boat can take up to 12 people during one trip. This means that for each trip, the maximum number of people that can be transported is 12.

**Step 2: Calculate the total capacity for one day.**

There are 4 boat trips through the lake in one day. Since each trip can carry 12 people, we calculate the total number of people that can be transported in one day by multiplying the number of trips by the capacity per trip:

\[
\text{Total capacity for one day} = 4 \text{ trips} \times 12 \text{ people per trip} = 48 \text{ people}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total capacity for two days.**

Now, we need to find out how many people can be transported in 2 days. Since we already know the boat can transport 48 people in one day, we multiply this number by 2 to find the total for two days:

\[
\text{Total capacity for two days} = 48 \text{ people per day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 96 \text{ people}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The boat can transport a total of 96 people in 2 days.
