To solve the problem, we need to determine how many people can be transported by the boat over a period of 2 days, given the constraints provided.

**Step 1: Determine the number of trips in one day.**
According to the problem, there are 4 boat trips in one day.

**Step 2: Determine the capacity of the boat per trip.**
The boat can take up to 12 people during one trip.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of people transported in one day.**
To find out how many people can be transported in one day, we multiply the number of trips by the capacity of the boat:

\[
\text{Total people in one day} = \text{Number of trips} \times \text{Capacity per trip}
\]
\[
\text{Total people in one day} = 4 \text{ trips} \times 12 \text{ people/trip} = 48 \text{ people}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of people transported in 2 days.**
Now, we need to find out how many people can be transported in 2 days. We multiply the total number of people transported in one day by 2:

\[
\text{Total people in 2 days} = \text{Total people in one day} \times 2
\]
\[
\text{Total people in 2 days} = 48 \text{ people} \times 2 = 96 \text{ people}
\]

**Final Answer:**
The boat can transport a total of **96 people** in 2 days.
