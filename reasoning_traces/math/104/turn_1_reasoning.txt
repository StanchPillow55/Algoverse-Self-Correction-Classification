Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many people the boat can transport in 2 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of trips in 2 days**:
   - There are 4 boat trips in one day.
   - Therefore, in 2 days, the number of trips is:
     \[
     4 \text{ trips/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 8 \text{ trips}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity for one trip**:
   - The boat can take up to 12 people during one trip.

3. **Calculate the total number of people transported in 2 days**:
   - Multiply the number of trips in 2 days by the capacity of the boat:
     \[
     8 \text{ trips} \times 12 \text{ people/trip} = 96 \text{ people}
     \]

Thus, the boat can transport a total of **96 people** in 2 days.

Final answer: **96 people**.
