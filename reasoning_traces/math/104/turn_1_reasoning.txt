==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people the boat can transport in two days, given the constraints of the number of trips per day and the capacity of the boat per trip.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of trips per day:**
   - The problem states that there are 4 boat trips through the lake each day.

2. **Determine the capacity of the boat per trip:**
   - The boat can take up to 12 people during one trip.

3. **Calculate the total number of people transported in one day:**
   - Since there are 4 trips per day and each trip can carry 12 people, the total number of people transported in one day is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{People per day} = \text{Number of trips per day} \times \text{Capacity per trip} = 4 \times 12 = 48
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of people transported in two days:**
   - To find out how many people can be transported in two days, we multiply the number of people transported in one day by 2:
   \[
   \text{People in 2 days} = \text{People per day} \times 2 = 48 \times 2 = 96
   \]

Therefore, the boat can transport a total of 96 people in 2 days.

**Final Answer: 96 people**
