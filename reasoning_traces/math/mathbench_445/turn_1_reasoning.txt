==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 445," we need to first understand what the problem entails. However, the problem statement provided is not clear or complete. It seems to be a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here. 

To proceed, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 445" is a generic placeholder for a math problem. Since no specific details are given, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Calculate the sum of the first 445 positive integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 445 positive integers. The sequence of the first 445 positive integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 445.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 445 \). Substitute this value into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{445(445 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate Inside the Parentheses:**
   First, calculate \( 445 + 1 \):
   \[
   445 + 1 = 446
   \]

5. **Multiply the Terms:**
   Next, calculate \( 445 \times 446 \):
   \[
   445 \times 446 = 198,370
   \]

6. **Divide by 2:**
   Finally, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S = \frac{198,370}{2} = 99,185
   \]

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   The sum of the first 445 positive integers is \( 99,185 \).

Thus, the final answer to the hypothetical problem is \( 99,185 \). If "Sample math problem 445" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details so I can assist you further.
