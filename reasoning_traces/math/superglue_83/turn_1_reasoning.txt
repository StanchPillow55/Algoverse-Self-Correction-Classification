==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 83" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details or numbers, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math reasoning problem. 

Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by building a fence parallel to the shorter side. How long will the fence be?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is rectangular with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal parts by building a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - Imagine the rectangle with the longer side (100 meters) as the base.
   - The shorter side (60 meters) is the width.
   - The fence will be parallel to the 60-meter side, meaning it will run along the length of the field.

3. **Determine the Length of the Fence:**
   - Since the fence is parallel to the shorter side, it will span the entire length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the fence will be equal to the length of the field.

4. **Calculate the Length of the Fence:**
   - The length of the field is 100 meters.
   - Therefore, the length of the fence is 100 meters.

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Dividing the field into two equal parts means each part will have an area of half the total area of the field.
   - Total area of the field = 100 meters * 60 meters = 6000 square meters.
   - Area of each part = 6000 square meters / 2 = 3000 square meters.
   - Each part will have dimensions of 100 meters (length) by 30 meters (width), confirming the fence divides the field equally.

**Final Answer:**
The length of the fence is 100 meters.
