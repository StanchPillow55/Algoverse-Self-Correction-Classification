==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 83" as it is not provided in the prompt. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem.

### General Approach to Solving a Math Reasoning Problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given data or conditions.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Determine the mathematical concepts or formulas that might apply.
   - Consider drawing diagrams or making tables if applicable.
   - Break the problem into smaller, manageable parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the necessary calculations step by step.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.
   - Check each step for accuracy.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify that each step logically follows from the previous one.
   - Ensure that the final answer addresses the question.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm the result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem:

**Problem Statement:**
A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 120 miles, at a speed of 40 miles per hour. How long does the journey take?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time taken for the journey.
   - Given: Distance = 120 miles, Speed = 40 miles/hour.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{120 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ miles/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Check the calculation: \(120 \div 40 = 3\).
   - The units (miles and miles/hour) cancel appropriately to give hours.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The journey takes 3 hours.
