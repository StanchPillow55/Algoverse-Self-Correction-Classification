==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 83" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll guide you through a generic approach to solving reasoning-based math problems. Let's assume a typical math reasoning problem involves logical deduction, pattern recognition, or arithmetic calculations.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given data or conditions.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - Determine if it's a pattern recognition, arithmetic, algebraic, or logical reasoning problem.

3. **Gather Information:**
   - List all known values and conditions.
   - Identify any patterns or sequences if applicable.

4. **Develop a Strategy:**
   - Choose an appropriate method to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical deduction).

5. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Perform calculations or logical deductions step by step.
   - Keep track of your work to avoid errors.

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the solution meets all the conditions of the problem.
   - Ensure calculations are correct.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer with appropriate units or explanations.

### Example Problem:

Let's assume a sample reasoning problem:

**Problem:** Find the next number in the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the next number in the sequence.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - This is a pattern recognition problem involving a sequence.

3. **Gather Information:**
   - The sequence given is: 2, 4, 8, 16.

4. **Develop a Strategy:**
   - Look for a pattern in the sequence.
   - Notice that each number is double the previous number.

5. **Execute the Plan:**
   - The pattern is multiplying by 2.
   - 2 × 2 = 4
   - 4 × 2 = 8
   - 8 × 2 = 16
   - Therefore, the next number is 16 × 2 = 32.

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the pattern holds for all given numbers.
   - Yes, each number is double the previous one.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The next number in the sequence is 32.

This approach can be adapted to various types of reasoning problems by modifying the strategy and execution steps based on the specific problem type. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can offer a more tailored solution.
