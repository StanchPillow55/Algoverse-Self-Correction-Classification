Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 496" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 496" is a typical algebra problem. Here's how we might approach solving it:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully.** Identify what is being asked and what information is provided.
- **Identify the variables.** Determine what quantities are unknown and assign variables to them.

### Step 2: Develop a Plan
- **Choose a strategy.** Common strategies include writing an equation, drawing a diagram, or considering special cases.
- **Set up equations.** Use the information given in the problem to set up one or more equations.

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- **Solve the equations.** Use algebraic methods to solve for the unknowns.
- **Check your work.** Substitute your solution back into the original equations to verify it satisfies all conditions.

### Step 4: State the Solution
- **Write the final answer.** Clearly state the solution to the problem, including units if applicable.

### Example Problem
Let's solve a sample algebra problem using the steps above:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 2: Develop a Plan
- We will isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. **Subtract 3 from both sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

3. **Check the solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

#### Step 4: State the Solution
- The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

### Final Answer
The value of \( x \) is 4.

This example demonstrates a structured approach to solving a math problem. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that particular problem.
