To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 496" refers to. Since the question itself is not provided, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. If the company produces and sells 100 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets, what is the total profit?

**Solution:**

To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the Total Revenue:**

   - Revenue from Type A widgets:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from Type A} = \text{Number of Type A widgets} \times \text{Selling price per Type A widget}
     \]
     \[
     = 100 \times 10 = 1000
     \]

   - Revenue from Type B widgets:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from Type B} = \text{Number of Type B widgets} \times \text{Selling price per Type B widget}
     \]
     \[
     = 150 \times 15 = 2250
     \]

   - Total Revenue:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Revenue from Type A} + \text{Revenue from Type B}
     \]
     \[
     = 1000 + 2250 = 3250
     \]

2. **Calculate the Total Cost:**

   - Cost for Type A widgets:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type A} = \text{Number of Type A widgets} \times \text{Cost per Type A widget}
     \]
     \[
     = 100 \times 5 = 500
     \]

   - Cost for Type B widgets:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type B} = \text{Number of Type B widgets} \times \text{Cost per Type B widget}
     \]
     \[
     = 150 \times 8 = 1200
     \]

   - Total Cost:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost for Type A} + \text{Cost for Type B}
     \]
     \[
     = 500 + 1200 = 1700
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Profit:**

   - Total Profit:
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
     \]
     \[
     = 3250 - 1700 = 1550
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The total profit from producing and selling 100 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets is $1550.
