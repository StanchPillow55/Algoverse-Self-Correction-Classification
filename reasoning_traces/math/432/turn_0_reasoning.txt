==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Tina sold based on her profit and the cost of each book.

1. **Understanding Profit**: 
   - Tina sells each book for $20.
   - Each book costs $5 to make.
   - Therefore, the profit per book can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Profit per book} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Cost price} = 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Total Profit**: 
   - Tina realizes a total profit of $120.
   - To find out how many books she sold, we can use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = \text{Profit per book} \times \text{Number of books sold}
     \]
   - Rearranging this gives us:
     \[
     \text{Number of books sold} = \frac{\text{Total Profit}}{\text{Profit per book}} = \frac{120}{15} = 8
     \]

3. **Calculating the Number of Customers**: 
   - Each customer buys 2 books at a time.
   - To find the number of customers, we divide the total number of books sold by the number of books each customer buys:
     \[
     \text{Number of customers} = \frac{\text{Number of books sold}}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
     \]

4. **Final Answer**: 
   - Therefore, the number of people (customers) Tina sold the books to is:
     \[
     \boxed{4}
     \]
