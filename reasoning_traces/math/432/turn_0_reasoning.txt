To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people Tina has sold books to, given the conditions provided. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Profit Equation

Tina sells each book for $20 and makes a profit of $120. We need to account for both the revenue from selling the books and the cost of producing them.

1. **Revenue from Selling Books:**
   - If Tina sells \( x \) books, the revenue is \( 20x \) dollars.

2. **Cost of Producing Books:**
   - Each book costs $5 to make, so the total cost for \( x \) books is \( 5x \) dollars.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit is calculated as Revenue minus Cost.
   - Therefore, the profit equation is:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = 20x - 5x = 15x
     \]
   - We know the profit is $120, so:
     \[
     15x = 120
     \]

### Step 2: Solve for \( x \)

To find \( x \), the number of books sold, solve the equation:
\[
15x = 120
\]

Divide both sides by 15:
\[
x = \frac{120}{15} = 8
\]

So, Tina sold 8 books.

### Step 3: Determine the Number of People

Each customer buys 2 books at a time. Therefore, the number of people (or customers) Tina sold books to is:
\[
\text{Number of People} = \frac{x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
\]

### Conclusion

Tina sold books to 4 people. Each person bought 2 books, resulting in a total of 8 books sold. This aligns with the profit calculation, confirming that the solution is consistent with all given conditions.

**Final Answer: Tina sold books to 4 people.**
