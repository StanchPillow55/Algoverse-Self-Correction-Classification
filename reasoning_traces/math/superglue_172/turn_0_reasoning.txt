==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 172." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by outlining a step-by-step reasoning process. Let's assume a sample math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Sample Problem:**

A car travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour and returns from City B to City A at a speed of 40 miles per hour. If the total travel time is 5 hours, what is the distance between City A and City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B in miles.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]
     So, the time taken to travel from City A to City B is \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - The time taken to travel back from City B to City A is \( \frac{d}{40} \) hours.

3. **Total Travel Time:**
   - According to the problem, the total travel time is 5 hours. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = 5
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To solve for \( d \), first find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 60 and 40 is 120.
   - Rewrite the equation with a common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{5d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 120 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     5d = 600
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( d \):
     \[
     d = 120
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.

**Final Answer:**

The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.
