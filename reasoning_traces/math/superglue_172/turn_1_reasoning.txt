Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 172" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's consider a generic math problem and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**
Calculate the area of a right triangle with a base of 6 units and a height of 8 units.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the formula for the area of a triangle:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Substitute the given values into the formula:**
   Here, the base \( b \) is 6 units and the height \( h \) is 8 units. Substitute these values into the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 8
   \]

3. **Perform the multiplication:**
   First, multiply the base and height:
   \[
   6 \times 8 = 48
   \]

4. **Calculate the area:**
   Now, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
   \]

5. **State the final answer:**
   The area of the right triangle is 24 square units.

**Final Answer:**
The area of the right triangle is 24 square units.

This solution demonstrates a clear understanding of how to calculate the area of a triangle using the given dimensions. If "Sample reasoning question 172" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details, and I can solve that problem accordingly.
