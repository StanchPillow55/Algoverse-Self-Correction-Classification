==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 172" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem-solving exercise. Let's consider a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step, showing all work and reasoning.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   - We have a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).
   - The equation is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - Our goal is to solve for \( x \). To do this, we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side gives:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
