Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 172" entails. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details or numbers, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. How long does it take for the train to reach City B from City A?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Distance between City A and City B: 300 miles
   - Speed of the train: 60 miles per hour

2. **Determine the Formula to Use:**
   To find the time it takes to travel a certain distance at a constant speed, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - If the train travels 60 miles in one hour, in 5 hours it would travel:
     \[
     60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - This matches the given distance, confirming our calculation is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The train takes 5 hours to travel from City A to City B.

This hypothetical problem demonstrates a clear step-by-step approach to solving a typical distance-speed-time problem. If "Sample reasoning question 172" refers to a specific problem, please provide the details, and I can solve that particular problem using a similar structured approach.
