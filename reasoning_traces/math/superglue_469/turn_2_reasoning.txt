Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I'll need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 469." Since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating an example problem and solving it step by step.

**Example Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 150 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the entire field and also divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is rectangular with a length of 150 meters and a width of 80 meters.
   - We need to calculate the total length of the fence required to enclose the field and divide it into two equal parts.

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substitute the given values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (150 + 80) = 2 \times 230 = 460 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Divide the Field into Two Equal Parts:**
   - The field is divided into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).
   - This means we need an additional fence equal to the length of the field, which is 150 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence:**
   - The total length of the fence required is the perimeter plus the additional dividing fence:
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} = 460 + 150 = 610 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total length of the fence required is 610 meters.

This example demonstrates how to approach a problem by understanding the requirements, applying relevant formulas, and performing calculations step by step. If you have a specific problem or question in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that problem specifically.
