To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of the individual fruits in the crate. We will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of each fruit:**
   - The cost of one apple is given as $0.5.
   - The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one banana} = 2 \times \text{Cost of one apple} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1.0 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one orange} = 3 \times \text{Cost of one banana} = 3 \times 1.0 = 3.0 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the quantity of each fruit in the crate:**
   - The crate contains:
     - 5 bananas
     - 12 apples
     - 7 oranges

3. **Calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:**
   - **Total cost of bananas:**
     \[
     \text{Total cost of bananas} = \text{Number of bananas} \times \text{Cost of one banana} = 5 \times 1.0 = 5.0 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - **Total cost of apples:**
     \[
     \text{Total cost of apples} = \text{Number of apples} \times \text{Cost of one apple} = 12 \times 0.5 = 6.0 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - **Total cost of oranges:**
     \[
     \text{Total cost of oranges} = \text{Number of oranges} \times \text{Cost of one orange} = 7 \times 3.0 = 21.0 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total price for the crate:**
   - Now, we sum the total costs of all the fruits:
     \[
     \text{Total price for the crate} = \text{Total cost of bananas} + \text{Total cost of apples} + \text{Total cost of oranges}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total price for the crate} = 5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = 32.0 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   The price for the crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32.0}\) dollars.
