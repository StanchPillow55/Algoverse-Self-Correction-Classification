==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the effects of using both sanitizer sprays on the germs present. Let's denote the total number of germs as \( G \).

1. **Understanding the Effect of Each Spray**:
   - The first spray kills 50% of the germs. Therefore, after using the first spray, the number of germs left is:
     \[
     G_1 = G - 0.5G = 0.5G
     \]

   - The second spray kills 25% of the germs. However, we need to consider that 5% of the germs killed by the second spray are the same germs that were already killed by the first spray.

2. **Calculating the Germs Killed by the Second Spray**:
   - The second spray kills 25% of the original germs \( G \):
     \[
     \text{Germs killed by the second spray} = 0.25G
     \]
   - Out of these, 5% are the same germs that were killed by the first spray. The number of germs that are the same is:
     \[
     \text{Same germs killed} = 0.05G
     \]

3. **Calculating the Effective Germs Killed by the Second Spray**:
   - The effective number of germs killed by the second spray, considering the overlap, is:
     \[
     \text{Effective germs killed by the second spray} = 0.25G - 0.05G = 0.20G
     \]

4. **Calculating the Total Germs Left After Both Sprays**:
   - After using both sprays, the total number of germs left can be calculated as follows:
     - Start with \( G \).
     - After the first spray, we have \( 0.5G \).
     - Now, we apply the second spray to the remaining germs. The second spray kills 20% of the original germs, but we need to apply it to the remaining \( 0.5G \):
     \[
     \text{Germs killed by the second spray on remaining} = 0.20G
     \]
     - The effective number of germs left after both sprays is:
     \[
     \text{Germs left} = 0.5G - (0.20G \text{ of the original } G)
     \]

5. **Calculating the Final Number of Germs Left**:
   - The total germs left can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Germs left} = 0.5G - 0.20G = 0.30G
     \]

6. **Calculating the Percentage of Germs Left**:
   - To find the percentage of germs left after using both sprays, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Percentage of germs left} = \left( \frac{0.30G}{G} \right) \times 100\% = 30\%
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that **30% of the germs would be left after using both sanitizer sprays together**.
