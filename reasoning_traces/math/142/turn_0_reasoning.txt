==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage of germs that remain after using both sanitizer sprays together. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the individual effects of each spray

1. **First Spray**: Kills 50% of germs.
2. **Second Spray**: Kills 25% of germs.

### Step 2: Determine the overlap in germs killed

The problem states that 5% of the germs killed are the same ones. This means that 5% of the germs are killed by both sprays.

### Step 3: Calculate the total percentage of germs killed

To find the total percentage of germs killed by both sprays, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion:

\[
\text{Total percentage killed} = (\text{Percentage killed by first spray}) + (\text{Percentage killed by second spray}) - (\text{Overlap percentage})
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Total percentage killed} = 50\% + 25\% - 5\%
\]

\[
\text{Total percentage killed} = 70\%
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage of germs remaining

If 70% of the germs are killed, then the percentage of germs that remain is:

\[
\text{Percentage remaining} = 100\% - \text{Total percentage killed}
\]

\[
\text{Percentage remaining} = 100\% - 70\%
\]

\[
\text{Percentage remaining} = 30\%
\]

### Final Answer

After using both sanitizer sprays together, 30% of the germs would be left.
