To solve the problem, we need to analyze the effectiveness of both sanitizer sprays and how they interact with the germs.

1. **Understanding the Germs Killed by Each Spray:**
   - Letâ€™s assume we start with 100% of the germs.
   - The first spray kills 50% of the germs. Therefore, after using the first spray, the percentage of germs left is:
     \[
     100\% - 50\% = 50\%
     \]
   - The second spray kills 25% of the germs. However, we need to consider that 5% of the germs killed by the second spray are the same germs that were already killed by the first spray.

2. **Calculating the Germs Killed by the Second Spray:**
   - The second spray is applied to the remaining 50% of germs after the first spray.
   - The second spray kills 25% of the remaining germs:
     \[
     25\% \text{ of } 50\% = 0.25 \times 50\% = 12.5\%
     \]
   - However, out of this 12.5%, 5% are the same germs that were already killed by the first spray. Therefore, the effective new germs killed by the second spray that are not already accounted for is:
     \[
     12.5\% - 5\% = 7.5\%
     \]

3. **Calculating Total Germs Killed:**
   - The total percentage of germs killed by both sprays is the sum of the germs killed by the first spray and the effective new germs killed by the second spray:
     \[
     50\% \text{ (from the first spray)} + 7.5\% \text{ (newly killed by the second spray)} = 57.5\%
     \]

4. **Calculating the Percentage of Germs Left:**
   - To find the percentage of germs left after using both sprays, we subtract the total percentage of germs killed from 100%:
     \[
     100\% - 57.5\% = 42.5\%
     \]

Thus, the percentage of germs left after using both sanitizer sprays together is:

\[
\boxed{42.5\%}
\]
