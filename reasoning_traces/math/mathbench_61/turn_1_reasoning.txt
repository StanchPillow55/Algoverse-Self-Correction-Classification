==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample math problem 61." Since the problem isn't provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details.

Let's assume a sample math problem for demonstration:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

**Step 3: Subtract 5 from Both Sides**

Subtract 5 from both sides to get rid of the constant term on the left:

\[
3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x = 15
\]

**Step 4: Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \)**

Now, divide both sides by 3, the coefficient of \( x \), to solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 5
\]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]

Calculate the left side:

\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

If you have a specific "Sample math problem 61" in mind, please provide the details, and I will solve it accordingly.
