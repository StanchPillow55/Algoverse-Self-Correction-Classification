==================================================

To solve a math problem, it's crucial to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 61" doesn't provide specific details about the problem itself. Without additional context or details, I can't solve a specific problem. However, I can guide you on how to approach solving a math problem in general.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to solving a typical math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - If possible, use a different method to check the result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample math problem 61," I can't provide a direct solution. If you can provide the actual problem or more context, I'd be happy to help solve it!
