Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining piece of chalk after using 45% of the original 5-inch piece on Monday.

1. **Calculate the amount of chalk used on Monday:**
   The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk and uses 45% of it on Monday.

   \[
   \text{Chalk used on Monday} = 5 \text{ inches} \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   After using 2.25 inches, we subtract this from the original 5 inches.

   \[
   \text{Remaining chalk} = 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Determine the daily usage going forward:**
   The teacher plans to use only 20% of the chalk each day. We need to calculate 20% of the remaining 2.75 inches.

   \[
   \text{Daily usage} = 2.75 \text{ inches} \times 0.20 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Calculate how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk:**
   To find out how many days the teacher can continue using the chalk at the rate of 0.55 inches per day, we divide the remaining chalk by the daily usage.

   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{2.75 \text{ inches}}{0.55 \text{ inches/day}} = 5 \text{ days}
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The teacher can use the remaining piece of chalk for 5 days before he has to recycle it.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]
