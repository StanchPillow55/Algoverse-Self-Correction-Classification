Question ID: 1176
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk after using 45% of it on Monday.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday. We calculate how much chalk this is:
   \[
   \text{Chalk used on Monday} = 0.45 \times 5 \text{ inches} = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Remaining Chalk After Monday**: We subtract the chalk used from the initial length:
   \[
   \text{Remaining chalk} = 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Daily Chalk Usage**: The teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day. We calculate how much chalk he will use each day:
   \[
   \text{Daily usage} = 0.20 \times 5 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch}
   \]

5. **Days Before Recycling**: To find out how many days the teacher can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk, we divide the remaining chalk by the daily usage:
   \[
   \text{Days} = \frac{2.75 \text{ inches}}{1 \text{ inch/day}} = 2.75 \text{ days}
   \]

Since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he can use the chalk for 2 full days before it becomes less than 2 inches and needs to be recycled.

6. **Final Answer**: The teacher has **2 days** before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.
