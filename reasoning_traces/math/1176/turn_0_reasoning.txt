==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk after using 45% of it on Monday, given that he typically uses 20% each day.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of chalk used on Monday

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of this piece. We can calculate the amount of chalk used as follows:

\[
\text{Chalk used on Monday} = 5 \text{ inches} \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday

Next, we need to find out how much chalk is left after Monday's usage:

\[
\text{Remaining chalk} = 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the daily usage going forward

The teacher plans to use only 20% of the chalk each day going forward. We can calculate the daily usage based on the remaining chalk:

\[
\text{Daily usage} = 2.75 \text{ inches} \times 0.20 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk

To find out how many days the teacher can continue using the remaining chalk before it becomes too small to use (less than 2 inches), we need to determine how many days it takes to use up the chalk down to 2 inches.

First, we need to find out how much chalk can be used before reaching the 2-inch threshold:

\[
\text{Chalk that can be used} = 2.75 \text{ inches} - 2 \text{ inches} = 0.75 \text{ inches}
\]

Now, we can calculate how many days it will take to use up this 0.75 inches at a rate of 0.55 inches per day:

\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{0.75 \text{ inches}}{0.55 \text{ inches/day}} \approx 1.36 \text{ days}
\]

Since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he can use the chalk for **1 full day** before it becomes too small.

### Final Answer

The teacher has **1 day** before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.
