==================================================

To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need for her party, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed**:
   - Lori has 16 guests.
   - Each guest is expected to eat 3 deviled egg halves.
   - Therefore, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:
     \[
     \text{Total halves} = \text{Number of guests} \times \text{Halves per guest} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ halves}
     \]

2. **Determine how many whole eggs are needed**:
   - According to the problem, 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
   - To find out how many whole eggs are needed for 48 halves, we can use the following calculation:
     \[
     \text{Whole eggs needed} = \frac{\text{Total halves}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Convert the number of eggs to dozens**:
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   - To find out how many dozens of eggs are needed, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
     \[
     \text{Dozens of eggs needed} = \frac{\text{Whole eggs needed}}{12} = \frac{24}{12} = 2 \text{ dozens}
     \]

Thus, Lori will need **2 dozens of eggs** for her party.

Final answer: **2 dozens of eggs**.
