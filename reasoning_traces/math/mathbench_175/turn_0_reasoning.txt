To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 175" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about this problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 175" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 175:**

Suppose you have a rectangle with a length that is 3 times its width. The perimeter of the rectangle is 64 units. Find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Since the length is 3 times the width, let \( l = 3w \).

2. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 64 units, so:
     \[
     2l + 2w = 64
     \]

3. **Substitute the Expression for Length:**
   - Substitute \( l = 3w \) into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(3w) + 2w = 64
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     6w + 2w = 64
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     8w = 64
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides by 8:
     \[
     w = \frac{64}{8} = 8
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Since \( l = 3w \), substitute \( w = 8 \) into the expression for \( l \):
     \[
     l = 3 \times 8 = 24
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(24) + 2(8) = 48 + 16 = 64
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width: 8 units
- Length: 24 units
