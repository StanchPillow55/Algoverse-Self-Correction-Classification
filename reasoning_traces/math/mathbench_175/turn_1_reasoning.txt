Question ID: mathbench_175
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 175," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 175" without providing any specific details or context. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that needs to be solved.

Since I don't have the actual problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Calculate the sum of the first 175 positive integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 175 positive integers. This is a classic problem that can be solved using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this case, \( n = 175 \). Substitute 175 into the formula:
   \[
   S_{175} = \frac{175(175 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, calculate \( 175 + 1 \):
     \[
     175 + 1 = 176
     \]
   - Next, multiply 175 by 176:
     \[
     175 \times 176 = 30800
     \]
   - Finally, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:
     \[
     S_{175} = \frac{30800}{2} = 15400
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   The sum of the first 175 positive integers is 15,400.

Therefore, the final answer to the hypothetical problem is 15,400. If you have a specific "Sample math problem 175" in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
