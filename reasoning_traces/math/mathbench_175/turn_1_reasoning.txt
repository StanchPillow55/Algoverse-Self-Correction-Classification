==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 175," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 175" is not specific and doesn't provide any details about what needs to be solved. Therefore, I will assume that "Sample math problem 175" refers to a specific math problem that is not provided here.

To proceed, let's consider a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 175." For the sake of this exercise, I will create a problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Sample math problem 175: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

If "Sample math problem 175" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context of the problem, and I will be happy to solve it accordingly.
