Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 175," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume it is a generic math problem involving basic arithmetic or algebra. I will create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 5 = 17 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 17 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 12
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2, to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{12}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   \[
   2(6) + 5 = 17
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   12 + 5 = 17
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 6 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 17 \) is \( x = 6 \).
