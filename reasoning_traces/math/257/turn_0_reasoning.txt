To solve the problem, we need to determine the total weight of the redwood tree after accounting for the wood that was eaten by termites. Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the tree

The redwood tree is 200 feet tall. Since each section of the tree is 10 feet, we can find the total number of sections by dividing the height of the tree by the height of each section:

\[
\text{Number of sections} = \frac{\text{Height of the tree}}{\text{Height of each section}} = \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the tree before termites

Each solid 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of the tree before any wood is eaten can be calculated by multiplying the number of sections by the weight of each section:

\[
\text{Total weight before termites} = \text{Number of sections} \times \text{Weight per section} = 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the weight of the wood eaten by termites

Termites ate 30% of the wood. To find out how much weight was lost due to the termites, we calculate 30% of the total weight of the tree:

\[
\text{Weight eaten by termites} = 0.30 \times \text{Total weight before termites} = 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining weight of the tree

To find the weight of the tree after the termites have eaten part of it, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by termites from the total weight before termites:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = \text{Total weight before termites} - \text{Weight eaten by termites} = 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Final Answer

The weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood is:

\[
\boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}
\]
