==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Hannah earned from selling cookies and cupcakes, then determine how much she spent on the measuring spoons, and finally find out how much money she has left.

**Step 1: Calculate the total earnings from cookies.**

Hannah sold 40 pieces of cookies at $0.8 each. To find the total earnings from the cookies, we multiply the number of cookies by the price per cookie:

\[
40 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.8/\text{cookie} = \$32
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total earnings from cupcakes.**

Hannah sold 30 cupcakes at $2 each. To find the total earnings from the cupcakes, we multiply the number of cupcakes by the price per cupcake:

\[
30 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2/\text{cupcake} = \$60
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total earnings from both cookies and cupcakes.**

To find the total earnings, we add the earnings from the cookies and the cupcakes:

\[
\$32 + \$60 = \$92
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the measuring spoons.**

Hannah bought 2 sets of measuring spoons at $6.5 each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of sets by the price per set:

\[
2 \text{ sets} \times \$6.5/\text{set} = \$13
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the remaining money.**

To find out how much money Hannah has left, we subtract the total cost of the measuring spoons from the total earnings:

\[
\$92 - \$13 = \$79
\]

Therefore, after buying the measuring spoons, Hannah has \$79 left.

**Final Answer:**

Hannah has \$79 left.
