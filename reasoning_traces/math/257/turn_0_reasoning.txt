To determine how much money Hannah has left after selling cookies and cupcakes and buying measuring spoons, we will break the problem down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling cookies.
Hannah sold 40 pieces of cookies for $0.8 each. We can calculate the total revenue from cookies as follows:

\[
\text{Total revenue from cookies} = \text{Number of cookies} \times \text{Price per cookie}
\]
\[
\text{Total revenue from cookies} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling cupcakes.
Hannah sold 30 cupcakes for $2 each. We can calculate the total revenue from cupcakes as follows:

\[
\text{Total revenue from cupcakes} = \text{Number of cupcakes} \times \text{Price per cupcake}
\]
\[
\text{Total revenue from cupcakes} = 30 \times 2 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from both cookies and cupcakes.
Now, we will add the total revenue from cookies and cupcakes to find the overall revenue:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = \text{Total revenue from cookies} + \text{Total revenue from cupcakes}
\]
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 32 + 60 = 92 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the measuring spoons.
Hannah bought 2 sets of measuring spoons for $6.5 each. We can calculate the total cost of the measuring spoons as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost of measuring spoons} = \text{Number of sets} \times \text{Price per set}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of measuring spoons} = 2 \times 6.5 = 13 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the remaining money after buying the measuring spoons.
Now, we will subtract the total cost of the measuring spoons from the total revenue to find out how much money Hannah has left:

\[
\text{Money left} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost of measuring spoons}
\]
\[
\text{Money left} = 92 - 13 = 79 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Hannah has **$79** left after selling the cookies and cupcakes and buying the measuring spoons.
