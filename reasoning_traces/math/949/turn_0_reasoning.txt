==================================================

To solve the problem, we will define the ages of Marcus, Leo, and Deanna using variables and relationships given in the problem.

1. **Identify Deanna's Age**:
   - We know from the problem that Deanna is 26 years old.
   \[
   \text{Deanna's age} = 26
   \]

2. **Determine Marcus's Age**:
   - The problem states that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. Therefore, we can calculate Marcus's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21
   \]

3. **Determine Leo's Age**:
   - The problem also states that Marcus is half of Leo's age. We can express this relationship mathematically:
   \[
   \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age}
   \]
   Substituting Marcus's age into the equation:
   \[
   21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age}
   \]

4. **Solve for Leo's Age**:
   - To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   2 \times 21 = \text{Leo's age}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Leo's age} = 42
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

In conclusion, after working through the relationships and calculations step by step, we find that Leo's age is:
\[
\boxed{42}
\]
