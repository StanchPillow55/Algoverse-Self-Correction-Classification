Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 93" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll assume this is a generic math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 93:**

"Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**

   The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**

   From the problem, we know:
   - Base \( b = 10 \) units
   - Height \( h = 5 \) units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**

   Substitute the given values for the base and height into the area formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**

   First, multiply the base and height:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50
   \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**

   Now, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**

   The area of the triangle is \( 25 \) square units.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle using the given base and height. If "Sample math problem 93" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details or context so I can assist you accurately.
