==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 93," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not provided here, so I will assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem based on common topics and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 15 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 15 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 15 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 12
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{12}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(6) + 3 = 15
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   12 + 3 = 15
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 6 \).

This completes the solution to the hypothetical problem. If you have a specific "Sample math problem 93" in mind, please provide the details, and I can solve that particular problem for you.
