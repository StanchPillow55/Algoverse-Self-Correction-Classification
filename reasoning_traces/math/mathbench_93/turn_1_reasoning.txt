==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 93" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement given, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

Step 1: Define the variables.  
Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.  
Then, the length \( l \) of the rectangle is \( 3w \) because the length is 3 times the width.

Step 2: Write the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle.  
The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:  
\[ P = 2l + 2w \]

Step 3: Substitute the known values into the formula.  
We know the perimeter is 48 units, so:  
\[ 48 = 2(3w) + 2w \]

Step 4: Simplify and solve for \( w \).  
\[ 48 = 6w + 2w \]  
\[ 48 = 8w \]  
Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( w \):  
\[ w = \frac{48}{8} \]  
\[ w = 6 \]

Step 5: Find the length using the width.  
Since \( l = 3w \), substitute \( w = 6 \):  
\[ l = 3 \times 6 \]  
\[ l = 18 \]

Step 6: Verify the solution.  
Check if the calculated dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:  
\[ P = 2l + 2w = 2(18) + 2(6) \]  
\[ P = 36 + 12 \]  
\[ P = 48 \]  
The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**  
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 6 units and a length of 18 units.
