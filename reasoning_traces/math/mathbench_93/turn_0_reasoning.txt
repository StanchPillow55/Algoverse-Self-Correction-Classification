==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about what "Sample math problem 93" entails. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem by creating an example. Let's assume "Sample math problem 93" is a typical algebra problem:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 5 = 17 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 5 = 17 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 5 = 17
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant:

   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 12
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{12}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying gives:

   \[
   x = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   2(6) + 5 = 17
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   12 + 5 = 17
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 17 \) is \( x = 6 \).
