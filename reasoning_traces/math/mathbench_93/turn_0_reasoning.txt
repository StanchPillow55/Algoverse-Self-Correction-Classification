To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 93" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't specified, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 93:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with vertices at points A(1, 2), B(4, 6), and C(6, 2).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

To find the area of a triangle given its vertices, we can use the formula derived from the determinant of a matrix:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \right|
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) are the coordinates of the vertices A, B, and C, respectively.

**Step 1: Assign the coordinates to the variables:**

- \(A(1, 2)\) means \(x_1 = 1\) and \(y_1 = 2\).
- \(B(4, 6)\) means \(x_2 = 4\) and \(y_2 = 6\).
- \(C(6, 2)\) means \(x_3 = 6\) and \(y_3 = 2\).

**Step 2: Plug the coordinates into the area formula:**

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 1(6-2) + 4(2-2) + 6(2-6) \right|
\]

**Step 3: Simplify the expression:**

- Calculate each term inside the absolute value:
  - \(1(6-2) = 1 \times 4 = 4\)
  - \(4(2-2) = 4 \times 0 = 0\)
  - \(6(2-6) = 6 \times (-4) = -24\)

- Combine these results:
  \[
  4 + 0 - 24 = -20
  \]

**Step 4: Take the absolute value and multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):**

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| -20 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
\]

**Final Answer:**

The area of the triangle with vertices at points A(1, 2), B(4, 6), and C(6, 2) is 10 square units.
