==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate Sansa's earnings from selling portraits over a period of 3 days. We'll break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the price of each portrait:**
   - The price of an 8-inch portrait is given as $5.
   - The price of a 16-inch portrait is twice the price of the 8-inch portrait:
     \[
     \text{Price of 16-inch portrait} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the daily earnings from selling portraits:**
   - Sansa sells 3 of the 8-inch portraits per day:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from 8-inch portraits} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - She also sells 5 of the 16-inch portraits per day:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from 16-inch portraits} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate total daily earnings:**
   - Now, we add the earnings from both types of portraits:
     \[
     \text{Total daily earnings} = 15 + 50 = 65 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate earnings over 3 days:**
   - To find out how much she earns in 3 days, we multiply her daily earnings by 3:
     \[
     \text{Earnings in 3 days} = 65 \times 3 = 195 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Sansa earns a total of **$195** over the course of 3 days.

Final answer: **$195**
