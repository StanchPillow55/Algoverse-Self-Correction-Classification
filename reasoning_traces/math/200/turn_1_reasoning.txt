==================================================

To determine how much Sansa earns in 3 days, we will first calculate her daily earnings from the portraits she sells.

1. **Price of Portraits**:
   - An 8-inch portrait costs $5.
   - A 16-inch portrait costs twice the price of the 8-inch portrait:
     \[
     \text{Price of 16-inch portrait} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Daily Sales**:
   - Sansa sells 3 8-inch portraits per day.
   - Sansa sells 5 16-inch portraits per day.

3. **Daily Earnings Calculation**:
   - Earnings from 8-inch portraits:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from 8-inch portraits} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Earnings from 16-inch portraits:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from 16-inch portraits} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total daily earnings:
     \[
     \text{Total daily earnings} = 15 + 50 = 65 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Earnings Over 3 Days**:
   - To find the total earnings over 3 days, we multiply the daily earnings by 3:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings in 3 days} = 65 \times 3 = 195 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Sansa earns a total of **$195** over 3 days. 

Final answer: **$195**.
