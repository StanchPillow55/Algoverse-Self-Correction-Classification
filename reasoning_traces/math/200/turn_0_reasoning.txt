To determine how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of pails Baldur collects in a day:**
   - In the morning, Baldur collects 5 pails of water.
   - In the afternoon, he collects 6 pails of water.
   - To find the total number of pails collected in a day, we add the morning and afternoon pails together:

   \[
   \text{Total pails} = \text{Morning pails} + \text{Afternoon pails} = 5 + 6 = 11 \text{ pails}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total volume of water in liters:**
   - Each pail contains 5 liters of water.
   - To find the total volume of water collected in liters, we multiply the total number of pails by the volume of water per pail:

   \[
   \text{Total liters} = \text{Total pails} \times \text{Liters per pail} = 11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail}
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   11 \times 5 = 55 \text{ liters}
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total amount of water Baldur gets every day is:

   \[
   \boxed{55} \text{ liters}
   \]
