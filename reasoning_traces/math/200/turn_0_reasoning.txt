To solve the problem, we will first determine the price of each type of portrait, then calculate the total earnings for one day, and finally find out how much Sansa earns in three days.

1. **Determine the price of each portrait:**
   - The price of an 8-inch portrait is given as $5.
   - The price of a 16-inch portrait is twice the price of the 8-inch portrait. Therefore:
     \[
     \text{Price of 16-inch portrait} = 2 \times \text{Price of 8-inch portrait} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings for one day:**
   - Sansa sells 3 of the 8-inch portraits and 5 of the 16-inch portraits per day.
   - First, we calculate the earnings from the 8-inch portraits:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from 8-inch portraits} = 3 \times \text{Price of 8-inch portrait} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Next, we calculate the earnings from the 16-inch portraits:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from 16-inch portraits} = 5 \times \text{Price of 16-inch portrait} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Now, we can find the total earnings for one day by adding the earnings from both types of portraits:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings for one day} = \text{Earnings from 8-inch portraits} + \text{Earnings from 16-inch portraits} = 15 + 50 = 65 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings for three days:**
   - To find out how much Sansa earns in three days, we multiply her daily earnings by 3:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings for 3 days} = 3 \times \text{Total earnings for one day} = 3 \times 65 = 195 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Sansa earns a total of **$195** in three days.

Final answer: **$195**
