To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total earnings Sansa makes from selling her portraits over a period of 3 days. We will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the price of each type of portrait:**
   - An 8-inch portrait is sold for $5.
   - A 16-inch portrait is sold for twice the price of an 8-inch portrait. Therefore, the price of a 16-inch portrait is:
     \[
     2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate daily earnings from each type of portrait:**
   - Sansa sells three 8-inch portraits per day. Therefore, her earnings from the 8-inch portraits per day are:
     \[
     3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Sansa sells five 16-inch portraits per day. Therefore, her earnings from the 16-inch portraits per day are:
     \[
     5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate total daily earnings:**
   - The total earnings per day from both types of portraits are:
     \[
     15 + 50 = 65 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate total earnings over 3 days:**
   - To find out how much Sansa earns over 3 days, we multiply her daily earnings by 3:
     \[
     65 \times 3 = 195 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Sansa earns a total of $195 every 3 days.

**Final Answer: Sansa earns $195 every 3 days.**
