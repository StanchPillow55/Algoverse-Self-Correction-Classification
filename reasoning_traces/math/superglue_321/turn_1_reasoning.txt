==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 321" refers to. However, the question as presented is not clear or specific. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that might be detailed elsewhere. Since there is no specific mathematical problem or context provided, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it.

Let's create a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A company sells two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company sells Product A for $50 each and Product B for $30 each. In one week, the company sold a total of 100 products and made $4,000 in revenue. How many of each product did the company sell?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Product A sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Product B sold.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - The total number of products sold is 100:
     \[
     x + y = 100
     \]
   - The total revenue from selling these products is $4,000:
     \[
     50x + 30y = 4000
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**

   We have the following system:
   \[
   \begin{cases} 
   x + y = 100 \\
   50x + 30y = 4000 
   \end{cases}
   \]

   We can solve this system using the substitution or elimination method. Here, I'll use the substitution method.

   From the first equation, solve for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 100 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 100 - x \) into the second equation:
   \[
   50x + 30(100 - x) = 4000
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   50x + 3000 - 30x = 4000
   \]
   \[
   20x + 3000 = 4000
   \]
   \[
   20x = 1000
   \]
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 50 \) back into the equation \( y = 100 - x \):
   \[
   y = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**

   The company sold 50 units of Product A and 50 units of Product B.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 50 units of Product A and 50 units of Product B.
