==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 321" entails. However, since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a hypothetical problem for demonstration purposes:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a linear equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies this equation.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, we need to isolate \( x \) by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
     Simplifying the left side gives:
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
     Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

**Final Answer:**
\( x = 4 \)

This approach demonstrates a systematic way to solve a linear equation. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details or clarify the problem statement.
