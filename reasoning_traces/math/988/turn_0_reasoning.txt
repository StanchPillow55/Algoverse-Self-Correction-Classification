To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Jessica's monthly savings for shoes**:
   Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes. 

   \[
   \text{Monthly savings} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500
   \]

   So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes.

2. **Calculate Jessica's annual savings for shoes**:
   Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate her total savings for shoes over the year.

   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = \text{Monthly savings} \times 12 = 500 \times 12 = 6000
   \]

   Therefore, Jessica saves $6,000.00 in a year for shoes.

3. **Determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy**:
   Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her annual savings, we divide her total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes.

   \[
   \text{Number of shoes} = \frac{\text{Annual savings}}{\text{Cost per pair}} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6
   \]

   Thus, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

4. **Final answer**:
   Jessica can buy a total of **6 pairs of shoes** in a year.
