Question ID: mathbench_219
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I'll first need to understand what "Sample math problem 219" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets labeled as "Sample math problem 219," I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 219" is a typical algebra problem.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x - 7 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Equation:**
   The given equation is:
   \[ 3x + 5 = 2x - 7 \]

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

3. **Subtract \( 2x \) from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x - 7 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = -7
   \]

4. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = -7 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = -12
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = -12 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(-12) + 5 = 2(-12) - 7
   \]
   Calculate each side:
   \[
   -36 + 5 = -24 - 7
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   -31 = -31
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, the solution \( x = -12 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
\[ x = -12 \]

This is the complete solution to the hypothetical problem. If "Sample math problem 219" refers to a specific problem, please provide the details of the problem so I can solve it accurately.
