Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 219" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 219" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 219:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 7 = 2x + 15 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to get all terms containing \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

   Start by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides of the equation to get:

   \[
   3x + 7 - 2x = 2x + 15 - 2x
   \]

   Simplifying both sides, we have:

   \[
   x + 7 = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Next, subtract 7 from both sides to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   x + 7 - 7 = 15 - 7
   \]

   Simplifying further, we get:

   \[
   x = 8
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 8 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   3(8) + 7 = 2(8) + 15
   \]

   Calculate both sides:

   Left side: \( 3 \times 8 + 7 = 24 + 7 = 31 \)

   Right side: \( 2 \times 8 + 15 = 16 + 15 = 31 \)

   Since both sides are equal, our solution \( x = 8 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 8 \).
