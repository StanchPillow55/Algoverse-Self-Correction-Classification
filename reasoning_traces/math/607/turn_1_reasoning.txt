==================================================

To determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses only 1 pump per wash, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of washes per bottle**: 
   The directions state that 2 pumps of shampoo provide 120 washings. Therefore, we can calculate how many washes can be obtained from 1 pump:
   \[
   \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of washes for the entire bottle**:
   Since the bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, we can confirm that the total number of washes for the entire bottle is indeed 120 washes.

3. **Determine the cost per wash**:
   To find the cost per wash, we divide the total cost of the bottle by the total number of washes:
   \[
   \text{Cost per wash} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash}
   \]

4. **Convert the cost per wash to cents**:
   Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we convert the cost per wash from dollars to cents:
   \[
   0.20 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 20 \text{ cents per wash}
   \]

5. **Determine the cost per pump when using 1 pump per wash**:
   Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the cost per pump is the same as the cost per wash. Therefore, the cost per pump is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per pump} = 20 \text{ cents}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that each pump costs **20 cents**.
