Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of washes per bottle**: 
   The directions state that 2 pumps of shampoo provide 120 washings. Therefore, we can calculate how many washes can be achieved with 1 pump:
   \[
   \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of washes with 1 pump**:
   Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, she will get 60 washes from the shampoo bottle.

3. **Determine the total cost of the shampoo**:
   The cost of the jumbo bottle of shampoo is $24.00. We need to convert this to cents for easier calculation:
   \[
   24.00 \text{ dollars} = 24.00 \times 100 = 2400 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost per wash**:
   Since Jackie can get 60 washes from the bottle, we can find the cost per wash:
   \[
   \text{Cost per wash} = \frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{60 \text{ washes}} = 40 \text{ cents per wash}
   \]

5. **Determine the cost per pump**:
   Since Jackie uses 1 pump for each wash, the cost per pump is the same as the cost per wash:
   \[
   \text{Cost per pump} = 40 \text{ cents}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\] 

This means each pump of shampoo costs 40 cents when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash.
