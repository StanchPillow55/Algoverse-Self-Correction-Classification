To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash instead of the recommended 2 pumps.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of washes per bottle.**

The directions state that 2 pumps of shampoo provide 120 washings. Therefore, we can calculate how many washes can be achieved with 1 pump:

\[
\text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of washes when using 1 pump per wash.**

If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of washes she can get from the bottle is:

\[
\text{Total washes} = 120 \text{ washes} \quad (\text{since she uses 1 pump per wash})
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pumps used.**

Since Jackie uses 1 pump for each wash, the total number of pumps used for 120 washes is:

\[
\text{Total pumps used} = 120 \text{ pumps}
\]

**Step 4: Determine the cost per pump.**

The total cost of the jumbo bottle of shampoo is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we first convert the total cost into cents:

\[
\text{Total cost in cents} = 24.00 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 2400 \text{ cents}
\]

Now, we can calculate the cost per pump:

\[
\text{Cost per pump} = \frac{\text{Total cost in cents}}{\text{Total pumps used}} = \frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{120 \text{ pumps}} = 20 \text{ cents per pump}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The cost of each pump of shampoo, when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, is **20 cents**.
