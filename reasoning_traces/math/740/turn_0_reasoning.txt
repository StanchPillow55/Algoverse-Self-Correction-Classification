==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of students**: 
   The total number of students in the class is 50.

2. **Identify the number of students with specific hobbies**:
   - Number of students who like to bake: 10
   - Number of students who like to play basketball: 5

3. **Determine the number of students who like to play music**:
   According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:
   \[
   \text{Number of students who like to play music} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of students accounted for**:
   Now we can add the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music:
   \[
   \text{Total accounted for} = \text{Students who like to bake} + \text{Students who like to play basketball} + \text{Students who like to play music}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total accounted for} = 10 + 5 + 10 = 25
   \]

5. **Determine the number of students who like to play video games**:
   Since the total number of students is 50, we can find the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the total accounted for from the total number of students:
   \[
   \text{Number of students who like to play video games} = \text{Total students} - \text{Total accounted for}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of students who like to play video games} = 50 - 25 = 25
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:
   \[
   \boxed{25}
   \]
