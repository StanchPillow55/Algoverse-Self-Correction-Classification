==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of marbles Amanda, Katrina, and Mabel have.

1. **Identify Mabel's marbles**: 
   We know from the problem that Mabel has 85 marbles.

2. **Establish the relationship between Mabel and Katrina**: 
   The problem states that Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. Let \( K \) represent the number of marbles Katrina has. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   M = 5K
   \]
   where \( M = 85 \) (the number of marbles Mabel has). Substituting Mabel's marbles into the equation gives:
   \[
   85 = 5K
   \]
   To find \( K \), we divide both sides by 5:
   \[
   K = \frac{85}{5} = 17
   \]
   So, Katrina has 17 marbles.

3. **Establish the relationship between Amanda and Katrina**: 
   The problem states that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. Let \( A \) represent the number of marbles Amanda has. The relationship can be expressed as:
   \[
   A + 12 = 2K
   \]
   Substituting \( K = 17 \) into the equation gives:
   \[
   A + 12 = 2 \times 17
   \]
   Simplifying the right side:
   \[
   A + 12 = 34
   \]
   To find \( A \), we subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   A = 34 - 12 = 22
   \]
   So, Amanda has 22 marbles.

4. **Calculate how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda**: 
   We know Mabel has 85 marbles and Amanda has 22 marbles. To find how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, we subtract the number of marbles Amanda has from the number of marbles Mabel has:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = M - A = 85 - 22 = 63
   \]

Thus, Mabel has 63 more marbles than Amanda.

**Final Answer**: Mabel has 63 more marbles than Amanda.
