To determine how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for both the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate the cost of the tomato seeds:**
   - Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
   - The cost of one packet of tomato seeds is $40.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the tomato seeds can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of tomato seeds} = \text{Number of packets} \times \text{Cost per packet}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost of tomato seeds} = 20 \times 40 = 800
     \]
   - So, the total cost for the tomato seeds is $800.

2. **Calculate the cost of the celery seeds:**
   - Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
   - The cost of one packet of celery seeds is $30.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the celery seeds can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of celery seeds} = \text{Number of packets} \times \text{Cost per packet}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost of celery seeds} = 80 \times 30 = 2400
     \]
   - So, the total cost for the celery seeds is $2400.

3. **Calculate the total cost for all seeds:**
   - Now, we add the total costs of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds to find the overall total cost:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of tomato seeds} + \text{Total cost of celery seeds}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 800 + 2400 = 3200
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is **$3200**.

Final answer: **$3200**.
