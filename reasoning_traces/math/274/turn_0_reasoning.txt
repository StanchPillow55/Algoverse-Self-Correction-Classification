To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of marbles each person has and then find the difference between the number of marbles Mabel has and the number Amanda has.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( K \) represent the number of marbles Katrina has.
- Let \( A \) represent the number of marbles Amanda has.
- Let \( M \) represent the number of marbles Mabel has.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   A + 12 = 2K
   \]
   Simplifying this equation, we get:
   \[
   A = 2K - 12
   \]

2. Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   M = 5K
   \]

3. We are given that Mabel has 85 marbles:
   \[
   M = 85
   \]

Using equation 2, we substitute the value of \( M \) into the equation:
\[
5K = 85
\]

To find \( K \), divide both sides by 5:
\[
K = \frac{85}{5} = 17
\]

Now that we know \( K = 17 \), we can find \( A \) using the equation \( A = 2K - 12 \):
\[
A = 2(17) - 12
\]
\[
A = 34 - 12
\]
\[
A = 22
\]

Now we know:
- Katrina has 17 marbles.
- Amanda has 22 marbles.
- Mabel has 85 marbles.

Finally, we need to find how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda:
\[
M - A = 85 - 22
\]
\[
M - A = 63
\]

Therefore, Mabel has 63 more marbles than Amanda.

The final answer is: Mabel has 63 more marbles than Amanda.
