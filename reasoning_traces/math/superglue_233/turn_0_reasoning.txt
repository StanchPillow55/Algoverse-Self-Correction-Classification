==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 233" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 233" is a math problem involving algebraic expressions. Here's a possible problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3(x - 4) + 2 = 5x - 8 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Distribute and Simplify:**
   Start by distributing the 3 on the left side of the equation:
   \[
   3(x - 4) = 3x - 12
   \]
   So the equation becomes:
   \[
   3x - 12 + 2 = 5x - 8
   \]

2. **Combine Like Terms:**
   Combine the constant terms on the left side:
   \[
   3x - 10 = 5x - 8
   \]

3. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), first get all terms involving \( x \) on one side and constant terms on the other. Subtract \( 3x \) from both sides:
   \[
   -10 = 2x - 8
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Add 8 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   -10 + 8 = 2x
   \]
   \[
   -2 = 2x
   \]

5. **Divide to Solve for \( x \):**
   Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{-2}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = -1
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3(x - 4) + 2 = 5x - 8 \) is \( x = -1 \).

This completes the problem-solving process. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details, and I can help solve that particular problem.
