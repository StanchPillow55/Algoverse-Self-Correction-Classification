==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 233" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning to solve. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is 20 meters longer than its width. The perimeter of the field is 200 meters. What are the dimensions of the field?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field.
   - Let the width of the field be \( w \) meters.
   - The length of the field is \( w + 20 \) meters.
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is given as 200 meters.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute the known values into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     200 = 2 \times ((w + 20) + w)
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms inside the parentheses:
     \[
     200 = 2 \times (2w + 20)
     \]
   - Distribute the 2:
     \[
     200 = 4w + 40
     \]

5. **Solve for \( w \):**
   - Subtract 40 from both sides to isolate the term with \( w \):
     \[
     160 = 4w
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = 40
     \]

6. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length is \( w + 20 \), substitute \( w = 40 \):
     \[
     \text{Length} = 40 + 20 = 60
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the field are:
- Width: 40 meters
- Length: 60 meters
