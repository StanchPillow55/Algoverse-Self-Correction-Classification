==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 233." Unfortunately, the question itself is not provided, so I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by outlining the steps and reasoning involved.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 233" is a math problem that involves solving an equation. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to approach solving an equation:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully**: Make sure you understand what is being asked. Identify the unknowns, knowns, and what you need to find.
- **Identify the type of problem**: Is it algebraic, geometric, calculus-based, etc.?

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
- **Translate the problem into mathematical language**: Write down the equation(s) that represent the problem.
- **Identify variables**: Assign symbols to unknown quantities.

### Step 3: Solve the Equation
- **Simplify the equation**: Combine like terms and simplify both sides of the equation if necessary.
- **Isolate the variable**: Use algebraic operations to solve for the unknown variable. This might involve adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, or using more advanced techniques like factoring or using the quadratic formula.

### Step 4: Check Your Work
- **Verify your solution**: Substitute your solution back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
- **Consider alternative solutions**: If applicable, check for other possible solutions, especially in quadratic or higher-degree equations.

### Step 5: State the Final Answer
- **Write the solution clearly**: Make sure your final answer is clearly stated and in the correct form.

### Example Problem
Let's solve a sample algebraic equation:

**Problem**: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1**: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2**: Set Up the Equation
- The equation is already given: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 3**: Solve the Equation
- Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4**: Check Your Work
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 11
  \]
  \[
  8 + 3 = 11
  \]
  \[
  11 = 11
  \]
- The solution is verified.

**Step 5**: State the Final Answer
- The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
