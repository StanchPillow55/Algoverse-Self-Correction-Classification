To find the net profit for the food truck selling grilled cheeses, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of making 10 sandwiches.**
2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches.**
3. **Determine the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.**

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost

**Cost of Bread:**
- The cost of one loaf of bread is $3.00.
- Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.
- Therefore, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is:
  \[
  \text{Cost of bread} = 3.00 \text{ (for 1 loaf)}
  \]

**Cost of Cheese and Condiments:**
- The cost for cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.

**Total Cost:**
- Now, we add the cost of the bread and the cost of cheese and condiments:
  \[
  \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of bread} + \text{Cost of cheese and condiments}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total Cost} = 3.00 + 30.00 = 33.00
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Revenue

**Selling Price per Sandwich:**
- The selling price for each sandwich is $7.00.

**Total Revenue from Selling 10 Sandwiches:**
- To find the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches, we multiply the selling price by the number of sandwiches:
  \[
  \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Selling Price per Sandwich} \times \text{Number of Sandwiches}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total Revenue} = 7.00 \times 10 = 70.00
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Net Profit

**Net Profit Calculation:**
- Net profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
  \[
  \text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Net Profit} = 70.00 - 33.00 = 37.00
  \]

### Final Answer
The net profit for the food truck after selling 10 grilled cheese sandwiches is **$37.00**.
