==================================================

Certainly! Let's work through a hypothetical math problem step by step. Since the problem is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 493," I'll create a sample math problem and solve it.

**Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of a rectangle.
   - We know the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.
   - The length is 3 times the width.

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( l \) is \( 3w \).

3. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - We know \( P = 48 \), so:
     \[
     48 = 2(3w) + 2w
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**
   - Substitute \( l = 3w \) into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     48 = 6w + 2w
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     48 = 8w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides by 8:
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

5. **Find the Length \( l \):**
   - Since \( l = 3w \), substitute \( w = 6 \):
     \[
     l = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width \( w = 6 \) units
- Length \( l = 18 \) units
