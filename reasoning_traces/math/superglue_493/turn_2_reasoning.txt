==================================================

To solve this problem, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 493" might entail. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. Let's create a sample problem and solve it.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. The production cost for Type A is $30 per widget, and for Type B, it is $40 per widget. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and made a profit of $15,000. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Total widgets sold: \( x + y = 500 \)
   - Profit equation: Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.
     - Revenue from Type A: \( 50x \)
     - Revenue from Type B: \( 70y \)
     - Total Revenue: \( 50x + 70y \)
     - Cost for Type A: \( 30x \)
     - Cost for Type B: \( 40y \)
     - Total Cost: \( 30x + 40y \)
     - Profit: \( (50x + 70y) - (30x + 40y) = 15,000 \)

3. **Simplify the Profit Equation:**
   \[
   (50x + 70y) - (30x + 40y) = 15,000
   \]
   \[
   20x + 30y = 15,000
   \]

4. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have two equations:
     1. \( x + y = 500 \)
     2. \( 20x + 30y = 15,000 \)

   - Solve the first equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into the second equation:
     \[
     20x + 30(500 - x) = 15,000
     \]
     \[
     20x + 15,000 - 30x = 15,000
     \]
     \[
     -10x + 15,000 = 15,000
     \]
     \[
     -10x = 0
     \]
     \[
     x = 0
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 0 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - 0 = 500
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The company sold 0 Type A widgets and 500 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 0 Type A widgets and 500 Type B widgets.
