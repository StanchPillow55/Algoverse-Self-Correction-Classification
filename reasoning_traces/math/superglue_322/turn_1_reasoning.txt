==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 322" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear and lacks specific details, let's assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that measures 120 meters in length and 80 meters in width. He wants to divide the field into smaller, equal-sized square plots. What is the largest possible side length of each square plot?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 120 meters by 80 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into square plots of equal size.
   - The goal is to find the largest possible side length for these square plots.

2. **Identify the Mathematical Concept:**
   - The problem requires finding the largest square that can fit into both the length and the width of the rectangle.
   - This is equivalent to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two dimensions.

3. **Calculate the GCD:**
   - The dimensions of the field are 120 meters and 80 meters.
   - We need to find the GCD of 120 and 80.

4. **Use the Euclidean Algorithm:**
   - The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the GCD of two numbers.
   - Start with the larger number (120) and divide it by the smaller number (80).
   - Calculate the remainder: \( 120 \div 80 = 1 \) remainder \( 40 \).
   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number (80) and the smaller number with the remainder (40).
   - Repeat the process: \( 80 \div 40 = 2 \) remainder \( 0 \).
   - When the remainder is 0, the divisor at this step (40) is the GCD.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The greatest common divisor of 120 and 80 is 40.
   - Therefore, the largest possible side length of each square plot is 40 meters.

**Final Answer:**

The largest possible side length of each square plot is 40 meters.
