==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 132," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 132" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact question or the type of math problem it represents. Therefore, I will assume a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**

The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

- Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

\[
2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x = 8
\]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**

Now that we have \( 2x = 8 \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 4
\]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to check if both sides are equal:

Original equation: \( 2x + 5 = 13 \)

Substitute \( x = 4 \):

\[
2(4) + 5 = 13
\]

Calculate the left side:

\[
8 + 5 = 13
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified to be correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \) is \( x = 4 \).
