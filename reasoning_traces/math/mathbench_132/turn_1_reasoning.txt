Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 132" refers to. Since the problem itself is not specified, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 132" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 132:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 5.
