==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 435" might entail. Since no specific details are provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of gadgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A gadgets for $50 each and Type B gadgets for $70 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 300 gadgets and earned $18,000 in revenue. How many of each type of gadget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A gadgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B gadgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of gadgets sold is 300. This gives us our first equation:
     \[
     x + y = 300
     \]

   - We also know the total revenue is $18,000. The revenue from Type A gadgets is \( 50x \) and from Type B gadgets is \( 70y \). This gives us our second equation:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 18,000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   - Start with the first equation:
     \[
     x + y = 300
     \]
     Solve for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 300 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 300 - x \) into the second equation:
     \[
     50x + 70(300 - x) = 18,000
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     50x + 21,000 - 70x = 18,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x + 21,000 = 18,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = 18,000 - 21,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = -3,000
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-3,000}{-20}
     \]
     \[
     x = 150
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 150 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 300 - x = 300 - 150 = 150
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Check the total number of gadgets:
     \[
     x + y = 150 + 150 = 300
     \]
     This matches the given total.

   - Check the total revenue:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 50(150) + 70(150) = 7,500 + 10,500 = 18,000
     \]
     This matches the given revenue.

**Final Answer:**

The company sold 150 Type A gadgets and 150 Type B gadgets.
