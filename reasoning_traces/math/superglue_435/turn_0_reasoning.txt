==================================================

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a missing part of the question. "Sample reasoning question 435" doesn't provide enough information for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by outlining a step-by-step process. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what is missing.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the solution.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Double-check calculations and logic.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, including units if applicable.
   - Ensure the answer addresses the question asked.

If you provide a specific math problem, I can apply this process to solve it and show all the work and reasoning involved.
