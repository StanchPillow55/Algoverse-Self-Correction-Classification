==================================================

To find out how long it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we can break the problem down into steps.

1. **Calculate the time to dig small holes:**
   - Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
   - Number of small holes = 30
   - Total time for small holes = Time per small hole × Number of small holes
   \[
   \text{Total time for small holes} = 3 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 30 \text{ holes} = 90 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time to dig large holes:**
   - Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
   - Number of large holes = 15
   - Total time for large holes = Time per large hole × Number of large holes
   \[
   \text{Total time for large holes} = 10 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 15 \text{ holes} = 150 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Total time for small holes + Total time for large holes
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Convert total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we convert minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
   \[
   \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is **4 hours**. 

Final answer: **4 hours**.
