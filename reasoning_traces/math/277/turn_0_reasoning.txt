==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the two puppies that are not on sale, given that Arven bought five puppies for a total of $800 and three of them were on sale for $150 each.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total cost of the three puppies on sale:**
   - Each of the three puppies costs $150.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the three puppies is:
     \[
     3 \times 150 = 450
     \]

2. **Calculate the remaining cost for the other two puppies:**
   - Arven spent a total of $800 on all five puppies.
   - The cost for the three puppies on sale is $450.
   - Therefore, the remaining cost for the other two puppies is:
     \[
     800 - 450 = 350
     \]

3. **Determine the cost of each of the two other puppies:**
   - The two other puppies cost the same amount.
   - Let \( x \) be the cost of each of these two puppies.
   - Since there are two puppies, the equation for their total cost is:
     \[
     2x = 350
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the cost of each puppy:
     \[
     x = \frac{350}{2} = 175
     \]

Therefore, each of the two other puppies costs $175.

**Final Answer:**
Each of the two other puppies costs $175.
