To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of the two puppies that are not on sale, given that Arven bought five puppies for a total of $800 and that three of those puppies are on sale for $150 each.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the three puppies on sale.**

The cost of one puppy on sale is $150. Since there are three puppies on sale, we can calculate the total cost for these three puppies as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost of three puppies on sale} = 3 \times 150 = 450
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost of the two other puppies.**

We know that the total cost of all five puppies is $800. To find the total cost of the two puppies that are not on sale, we subtract the total cost of the three puppies on sale from the total cost of all five puppies:

\[
\text{Total cost of two other puppies} = \text{Total cost of all puppies} - \text{Total cost of three puppies on sale}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Total cost of two other puppies} = 800 - 450 = 350
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of each of the two other puppies.**

Since the two other puppies cost the same, we can find the cost of each puppy by dividing the total cost of the two puppies by 2:

\[
\text{Cost of each of the two other puppies} = \frac{\text{Total cost of two other puppies}}{2} = \frac{350}{2} = 175
\]

**Final Answer:**

The cost of each of the two other puppies is **$175**.
