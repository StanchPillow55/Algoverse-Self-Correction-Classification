==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

**Step 1: Calculate the time taken for small holes.**

Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole. Therefore, the time taken to dig 30 small holes can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Time for small holes} = \text{Number of small holes} \times \text{Time per small hole}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Time for small holes} = 30 \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the time taken for large holes.**

Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole. Therefore, the time taken to dig 15 large holes can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Time for large holes} = \text{Number of large holes} \times \text{Time per large hole}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Time for large holes} = 15 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 150 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total time taken.**

Now, we add the time taken for small holes and large holes to find the total time:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time for small holes} + \text{Time for large holes}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total time} = 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 4: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.**

To convert minutes into hours, we divide the total minutes by 60:

\[
\text{Total time in hours} = \frac{\text{Total time in minutes}}{60}
\]

Substituting the total time:

\[
\text{Total time in hours} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

**Final Answer:**

It will take Matthew a total of **4 hours** to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.
