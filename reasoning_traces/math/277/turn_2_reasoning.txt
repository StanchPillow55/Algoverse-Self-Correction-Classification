Question ID: 277
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how long it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we can break the problem down into steps.

1. **Calculate the time to dig small holes:**
   - Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
   - Number of small holes = 30
   - Total time for small holes = 30 holes × 3 minutes/hole = 90 minutes

2. **Calculate the time to dig large holes:**
   - Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
   - Number of large holes = 15
   - Total time for large holes = 15 holes × 10 minutes/hole = 150 minutes

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time for small holes + Time for large holes
   - Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

4. **Convert total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Total time in hours = Total time in minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour
   - Total time in hours = 240 minutes ÷ 60 = 4 hours

Thus, it will take Matthew **4 hours** to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes. 

Final answer: **4 hours**.
