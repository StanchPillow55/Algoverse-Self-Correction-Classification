==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 367" refers to. Since no specific details or numbers are provided in the question, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem to solve:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. In one week, the company sold a total of 100 widgets and made $5,800 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know the total number of widgets sold is 100:
     \[
     x + y = 100
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue is $5,800:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 5800
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 100 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   50x + 70y &= 5800 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution Method:**

   From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 100 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 100 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   50x + 70(100 - x) = 5800
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   50x + 7000 - 70x = 5800
   \]
   \[
   -20x + 7000 = 5800
   \]
   \[
   -20x = 5800 - 7000
   \]
   \[
   -20x = -1200
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{-1200}{-20} = 60
   \]

   Now, substitute \( x = 60 \) back into the expression for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 100 - 60 = 40
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the total number of widgets:
   \[
   x + y = 60 + 40 = 100
   \]

   Check the total revenue:
   \[
   50x + 70y = 50(60) + 70(40) = 3000 + 2800 = 5800
   \]

   Both conditions are satisfied.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 60 Type A widgets and 40 Type B widgets.
