==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 367" refers to. However, since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 367" is a problem involving algebra, specifically solving a linear equation. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:** Solve the equation for \( x \):  
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.

   Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   Substitute \( x = 5 \) into the original equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Calculate the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This process demonstrates a typical approach to solving a linear equation, including understanding the problem, isolating the variable, solving for the variable, and verifying the solution. If "Sample reasoning question 367" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details for a more specific solution.
