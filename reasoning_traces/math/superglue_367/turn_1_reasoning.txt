==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 367," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete and does not contain any specific details or numbers to work with. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example based on common problem-solving techniques.

Let's assume the problem is a basic algebra problem. Here is a hypothetical example:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \):**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 2, the coefficient of \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This example demonstrates a typical approach to solving a simple algebraic equation. If you have a specific problem or more details about "Sample reasoning question 367," please provide them, and I will be happy to assist further.
