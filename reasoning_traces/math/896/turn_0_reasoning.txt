To determine how much profit John makes from renting out his car, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total income from renting the car.**
   - John rents his car out 10 times a month.
   - Each rental lasts for 3 hours.
   - He charges $25 per hour.

   First, we calculate the total hours rented in a month:
   \[
   \text{Total hours rented} = \text{Number of rentals} \times \text{Hours per rental} = 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ hours}
   \]

   Next, we calculate the total income from these rentals:
   \[
   \text{Total income} = \text{Total hours rented} \times \text{Rate per hour} = 30 \times 25 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total expenses.**
   - John has a car payment of $500 per month.

3. **Calculate the profit.**
   - Profit is calculated as total income minus total expenses.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total income} - \text{Total expenses} = 750 - 500 = 250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, after calculating all the necessary components, we find that John makes a profit of **$250** from renting out his car.

Final answer:
\[
\text{John's profit is } \boxed{250} \text{ dollars.}
\]
