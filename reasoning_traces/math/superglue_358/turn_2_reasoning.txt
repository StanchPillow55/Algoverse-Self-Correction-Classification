Question ID: superglue_358
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what is being asked. The problem statement is "Sample reasoning question 358." However, this doesn't provide any specific mathematical problem to solve. It seems like there might be missing information or context needed to address the problem accurately.

Since the problem is labeled as a "reasoning question," let's consider the possibility that it might involve logical reasoning or a sequence of steps that need to be followed. However, without additional details, it's challenging to determine the exact nature of the problem.

If we assume that "358" is a reference to a specific problem or a sequence, we could explore some possibilities:

1. **Numerical Analysis**: If "358" is a number that needs to be analyzed, we could look at its properties:
   - **Prime Factorization**: 358 is not a prime number. Its prime factorization is \( 2 \times 179 \).
   - **Even or Odd**: 358 is an even number because it ends in 8.
   - **Divisibility**: It is divisible by 2, as shown in the prime factorization.

2. **Pattern Recognition**: If "358" is part of a sequence or pattern, we would need more context to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence.

3. **Logical Reasoning**: If this is a reasoning question, it might involve deducing information or making inferences based on given data. However, without additional context, it's difficult to apply logical reasoning.

Given the lack of specific information, it's challenging to provide a definitive solution. If there is additional context or details available, please provide them so that a more accurate and complete solution can be developed.

In conclusion, without further information, the problem remains unsolved. If "Sample reasoning question 358" refers to a specific problem or context, please provide additional details for a more targeted solution.
