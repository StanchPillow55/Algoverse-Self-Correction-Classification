To solve the problem effectively, I'll need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 358." Since the question isn't provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem step by step. Let's assume a sample problem for demonstration purposes:

**Sample Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 300 square meters. How many such plots can he create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - We need to divide this field into smaller plots, each with an area of 300 square meters.
   - Our goal is to determine how many such plots can be created.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width.
   - For the field: Area = 100 meters × 60 meters = 6000 square meters.

3. **Determine the Number of Plots:**
   - Each plot has an area of 300 square meters.
   - To find the number of plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
     \[
     \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{6000 \text{ square meters}}{300 \text{ square meters}} = 20.
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Multiply the number of plots by the area of one plot to ensure it equals the total area of the field:
     \[
     20 \text{ plots} \times 300 \text{ square meters/plot} = 6000 \text{ square meters}.
     \]
   - The calculation is correct, confirming that the field can indeed be divided into 20 plots of 300 square meters each.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The farmer can create 20 plots, each with an area of 300 square meters.

This approach demonstrates how to break down a problem, perform calculations, and verify the results to ensure accuracy. If you have a specific problem or question, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to assist further!
