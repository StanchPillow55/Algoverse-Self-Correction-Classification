==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 156, let's first clarify what the problem is asking. Since "Sample math problem 156" is not specific, I'll create a hypothetical problem involving the number 156 and solve it step-by-step.

**Problem:**  
Find the prime factorization of 156 and determine whether it is a perfect square.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization**

To find the prime factorization of 156, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. **Divide by 2:**
   \[
   156 \div 2 = 78
   \]
   So, 2 is a factor.

2. **Divide 78 by 2:**
   \[
   78 \div 2 = 39
   \]
   So, another 2 is a factor.

3. **Divide 39 by 3:**
   \[
   39 \div 3 = 13
   \]
   So, 3 is a factor.

4. **13 is a prime number.**

Thus, the prime factorization of 156 is:
\[
156 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 13
\]

**Step 2: Check if 156 is a Perfect Square**

A number is a perfect square if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even. Let's examine the exponents in the prime factorization of 156:

- The exponent of 2 is 2 (even).
- The exponent of 3 is 1 (odd).
- The exponent of 13 is 1 (odd).

Since not all exponents are even, 156 is not a perfect square.

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 156 is \(2^2 \times 3 \times 13\).  
156 is not a perfect square.
