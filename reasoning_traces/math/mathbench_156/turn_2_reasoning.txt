Question ID: mathbench_156
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 156," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 156" is not specific enough for us to determine what the actual mathematical question is. 

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 156" refers to a typical math problem that could involve basic arithmetic, algebra, geometry, or another area of mathematics. Since we don't have the specific details, I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Calculate the sum of the first 156 positive integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 156 positive integers. This is a common problem that can be solved using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this case, \( n = 156 \). Substitute 156 into the formula:
   \[
   S_{156} = \frac{156 \times (156 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - Calculate \( 156 + 1 = 157 \).
   - Multiply 156 by 157:
     \[
     156 \times 157 = 24492
     \]
   - Divide the product by 2 to find the sum:
     \[
     S_{156} = \frac{24492}{2} = 12246
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 156 positive integers is 12,246.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 156 positive integers is 12,246.
