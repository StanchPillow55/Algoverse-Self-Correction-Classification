To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, given that Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day and his brother eats half as many.

### Step 1: Determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day.

Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we can calculate this as follows:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by brother per day} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Pretzels eaten by Edgar per day}
\]

Substituting the number of pretzels Edgar eats:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by brother per day} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by brother per day} = 9
\]

### Step 2: Calculate how many pretzels his brother eats in a week.

Now that we know Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels a day, we can find out how many he eats in a week (7 days). We do this by multiplying the number of pretzels he eats in a day by the number of days in a week:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by brother in a week} = \text{Pretzels eaten by brother per day} \times \text{Number of days in a week}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by brother in a week} = 9 \times 7
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by brother in a week} = 63
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, Edgar's brother eats **63 pretzels in a week**.
