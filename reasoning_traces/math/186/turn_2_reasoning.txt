To solve the problem, we need to break down the information given and set up equations based on the distribution of straw among the rodents.

1. **Understanding the distribution of straw**:
   - **Rats**: There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw.
   - **Hamsters**: There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
   - **Rabbits**: A total of 20 pieces of straw is distributed among the rabbits.

2. **Total straw distributed**: We know that the total amount of straw distributed among all rodents is 160 pieces.

3. **Setting up the equations**:
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - The total number of rats is \( 3r \) (since there are 3 cages).
   - The total straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \) pieces of straw.

   - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage.
   - The total number of hamsters is \( 10h \) (since there are 10 cages).
   - The total straw given to the hamsters is \( 10h \times 5 = 50h \) pieces of straw.

   - The total straw given to the rabbits is 20 pieces.

4. **Combining the equations**:
   The total straw distributed can be expressed as:
   \[
   18r + 50h + 20 = 160
   \]

5. **Simplifying the equation**:
   We can simplify this equation by subtracting 20 from both sides:
   \[
   18r + 50h = 140
   \]

6. **Finding integer solutions**:
   We need to find integer values for \( r \) and \( h \) that satisfy this equation. We can rearrange the equation to express \( h \) in terms of \( r \):
   \[
   50h = 140 - 18r
   \]
   \[
   h = \frac{140 - 18r}{50}
   \]

   For \( h \) to be an integer, \( 140 - 18r \) must be divisible by 50. We can test integer values for \( r \) to find suitable values.

7. **Testing values for \( r \)**:
   - If \( r = 0 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 0}{50} = \frac{140}{50} = 2.8 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - If \( r = 1 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 1}{50} = \frac{122}{50} = 2.44 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - If \( r = 2 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 2}{50} = \frac{104}{50} = 2.08 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - If \( r = 3 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 3}{50} = \frac{86}{50} = 1.72 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - If \( r = 4 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 4}{50} = \frac{68}{50} = 1.36 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - If \( r = 5 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 5}{50} = \frac{50}{50} = 1 \quad \text{(integer)}
     \]
   - If \( r = 6 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 6}{50} = \frac{32}{50} = 0.64 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - If \( r = 7 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 7}{50} = \frac{14}{50} = 0.28 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

8. **Conclusion**:
   The only integer solution we found is when \( r = 5 \) and \( h = 1 \). Thus, the number of rats in each cage is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]
