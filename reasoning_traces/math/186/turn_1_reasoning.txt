==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break down the distribution of straw among the different types of rodents: rats, hamsters, and rabbits.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw.
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
   - There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

2. **Calculate the total straw used for each type of rodent:**

   - **For the rats:**
     - The total number of rats is \( 3r \) (since there are 3 cages).
     - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw for rats is:
       \[
       \text{Straw for rats} = 3r \times 6 = 18r
       \]

   - **For the hamsters:**
     - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage. Thus, the total number of hamsters is \( 10h \).
     - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, so the total straw for hamsters is:
       \[
       \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10h \times 5 = 50h
       \]

   - **For the rabbits:**
     - The total straw for rabbits is given as 20 pieces.

3. **Set up the equation for total straw distributed:**
   - According to the problem, the total amount of straw distributed among all rodents is 160 pieces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   18r + 50h + 20 = 160
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   18r + 50h = 140
   \]

5. **Solve for one variable in terms of the other:**
   - Rearranging gives:
   \[
   18r = 140 - 50h
   \]
   - Dividing everything by 2 for simplicity:
   \[
   9r = 70 - 25h
   \]
   - Thus:
   \[
   r = \frac{70 - 25h}{9}
   \]

6. **Determine possible integer values for \( h \):**
   - Since \( r \) must be a non-negative integer, \( 70 - 25h \) must be divisible by 9.
   - We can test integer values for \( h \) to find suitable values for \( r \).

   - **Testing \( h = 0 \):**
     \[
     r = \frac{70 - 25(0)}{9} = \frac{70}{9} \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **Testing \( h = 1 \):**
     \[
     r = \frac{70 - 25(1)}{9} = \frac{45}{9} = 5 \quad \text{(valid)}
     \]

   - **Testing \( h = 2 \):**
     \[
     r = \frac{70 - 25(2)}{9} = \frac{20}{9} \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **Testing \( h = 3 \):**
     \[
     r = \frac{70 - 25(3)}{9} = \frac{-5}{9} \quad \text{(not valid)}
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The only valid solution we found is when \( h = 1 \) and \( r = 5 \).
   - Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \( \boxed{5} \).
