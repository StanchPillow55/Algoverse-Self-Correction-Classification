==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break down the distribution of straw among the different rodents and set up an equation based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
   - Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw given to the rats is \( 6 \times 3r = 18r \).

2. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage. Thus, the total number of hamsters is \( 10h \).
   - The total straw given to the hamsters is \( 5 \times 10h = 50h \).

3. **Rabbits:**
   - The problem states that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. This is a fixed amount.

4. **Total straw distributed:**
   - According to the problem, the total amount of straw distributed among all rodents is 160 pieces. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   18r + 50h + 20 = 160
   \]

5. **Simplifying the equation:**
   - First, subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   18r + 50h = 140
   \]

6. **Finding integer solutions:**
   - We need to find integer values for \( r \) and \( h \) that satisfy this equation. Rearranging gives:
   \[
   18r = 140 - 50h
   \]
   - This means \( 140 - 50h \) must be divisible by 18. We can test integer values for \( h \) to find suitable \( r \).

7. **Testing values for \( h \):**
   - **If \( h = 0 \):**
     \[
     18r = 140 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \frac{140}{18} \approx 7.78 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - **If \( h = 1 \):**
     \[
     18r = 140 - 50 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 18r = 90 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = 5 \quad \text{(integer)}
     \]
   - **If \( h = 2 \):**
     \[
     18r = 140 - 100 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 18r = 40 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \frac{40}{18} \approx 2.22 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - **If \( h = 3 \):**
     \[
     18r = 140 - 150 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 18r = -10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \frac{-10}{18} \quad \text{(not valid)}
     \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The only valid solution we found is when \( h = 1 \) and \( r = 5 \). This means there are 5 rats in each cage.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\] 

This indicates that there are 5 rats in each cage.
