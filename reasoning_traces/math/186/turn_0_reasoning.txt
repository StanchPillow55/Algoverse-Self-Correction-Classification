To find the total length of all of Christina's snakes combined, we need to ensure that all measurements are in the same unit. Since two of the snakes are measured in inches, we will convert the length of the snake that is measured in feet into inches.

1. **Convert the length of the snake from feet to inches:**
   - We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.
   - Therefore, the length of the 2-foot snake in inches is:
     \[
     2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **List the lengths of all the snakes in inches:**
   - First snake: 24 inches (converted from 2 feet)
   - Second snake: 16 inches
   - Third snake: 10 inches

3. **Add the lengths of all the snakes together:**
   \[
   \text{Total length} = 24 \text{ inches} + 16 \text{ inches} + 10 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Perform the addition step-by-step:**
   - First, add the first two lengths:
     \[
     24 + 16 = 40 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Next, add the length of the third snake:
     \[
     40 + 10 = 50 \text{ inches}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   The total length of all of Christina's snakes combined is:
   \[
   \boxed{50} \text{ inches}
   \]
