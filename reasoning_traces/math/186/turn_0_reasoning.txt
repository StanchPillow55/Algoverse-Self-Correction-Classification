==================================================

To solve the problem of finding the total length of Christina's snakes in inches, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the lengths of each snake:**
   - The first snake is 2 feet long.
   - The second snake is 16 inches long.
   - The third snake is 10 inches long.

2. **Convert all measurements to the same unit:**
   - Since the problem asks for the total length in inches, we need to convert the length of the first snake from feet to inches.
   - We know that 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches. Therefore, to convert 2 feet to inches, we multiply by 12:
     \[
     2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Add the lengths of all the snakes in inches:**
   - Now that all measurements are in inches, we can add them together:
     \[
     24 \text{ inches (first snake)} + 16 \text{ inches (second snake)} + 10 \text{ inches (third snake)}
     \]

4. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add the lengths of the first and second snakes:
     \[
     24 + 16 = 40 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Then, add the length of the third snake:
     \[
     40 + 10 = 50 \text{ inches}
     \]

5. **State the final answer:**
   - The total length of all of Christina's snakes combined is 50 inches.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50 \text{ inches}}
\]
