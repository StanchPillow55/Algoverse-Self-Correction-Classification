==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many skips Roberto and Valerie each complete in fifteen minutes and then sum these values to find the total number of skips.

**Step 1: Determine Roberto's skipping rate per minute.**

Roberto can skip 4,200 times in one hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can find his skipping rate per minute by dividing the total skips by the number of minutes in an hour:

\[
\text{Roberto's skips per minute} = \frac{4,200 \text{ skips}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 70 \text{ skips per minute}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Roberto's total skips in fifteen minutes.**

Now that we know Roberto skips 70 times per minute, we can calculate how many skips he completes in fifteen minutes:

\[
\text{Roberto's total skips in 15 minutes} = 70 \text{ skips/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 1,050 \text{ skips}
\]

**Step 3: Determine Valerie's skipping rate per minute.**

Valerie's skipping rate is given as 80 times per minute. Therefore, we don't need to perform any additional calculations for her rate.

**Step 4: Calculate Valerie's total skips in fifteen minutes.**

Using Valerie's skipping rate, we calculate her total skips in fifteen minutes:

\[
\text{Valerie's total skips in 15 minutes} = 80 \text{ skips/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 1,200 \text{ skips}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the total skips for both Roberto and Valerie.**

Finally, we add the total skips for Roberto and Valerie to find the combined total:

\[
\text{Total skips} = 1,050 \text{ skips (Roberto)} + 1,200 \text{ skips (Valerie)} = 2,250 \text{ skips}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The total number of skips Roberto and Valerie complete together in fifteen minutes is 2,250 skips.
