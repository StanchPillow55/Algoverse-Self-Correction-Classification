==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many skips Roberto and Valerie each complete in fifteen minutes and then add those numbers together to find the total number of skips.

**Step 1: Calculate Roberto's skips in fifteen minutes.**

Roberto can skip 4,200 times in one hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to find out how many skips he completes in one minute and then multiply that by fifteen.

First, find Roberto's skips per minute:
\[
\text{Roberto's skips per minute} = \frac{4,200 \text{ skips}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 70 \text{ skips per minute}
\]

Next, calculate the number of skips Roberto completes in fifteen minutes:
\[
\text{Roberto's skips in 15 minutes} = 70 \text{ skips per minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 1,050 \text{ skips}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Valerie's skips in fifteen minutes.**

Valerie can skip 80 times a minute. To find out how many skips she completes in fifteen minutes, we multiply her skips per minute by fifteen.

\[
\text{Valerie's skips in 15 minutes} = 80 \text{ skips per minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 1,200 \text{ skips}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total skips by both Roberto and Valerie.**

Now, add the number of skips Roberto and Valerie each complete in fifteen minutes to find the total number of skips.

\[
\text{Total skips} = \text{Roberto's skips} + \text{Valerie's skips} = 1,050 \text{ skips} + 1,200 \text{ skips} = 2,250 \text{ skips}
\]

Thus, the total number of skips Roberto and Valerie complete together in fifteen minutes is \(\boxed{2,250}\).
