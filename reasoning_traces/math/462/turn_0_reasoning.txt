==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of skips Roberto and Valerie each make in fifteen minutes and then add those numbers together to find the total number of skips.

### Step 1: Calculate Roberto's Skips

Roberto can skip 4,200 times in one hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we first need to find out how many skips Roberto makes in one minute:

\[
\text{Roberto's skips per minute} = \frac{4,200 \text{ skips}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 70 \text{ skips per minute}
\]

Now, we calculate how many skips Roberto makes in fifteen minutes:

\[
\text{Roberto's skips in 15 minutes} = 70 \text{ skips per minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 1,050 \text{ skips}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Valerie's Skips

Valerie can skip 80 times a minute. We need to calculate how many skips Valerie makes in fifteen minutes:

\[
\text{Valerie's skips in 15 minutes} = 80 \text{ skips per minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 1,200 \text{ skips}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Skips

To find the total number of skips Roberto and Valerie make together in fifteen minutes, we add the number of skips each of them makes:

\[
\text{Total skips} = \text{Roberto's skips in 15 minutes} + \text{Valerie's skips in 15 minutes} = 1,050 \text{ skips} + 1,200 \text{ skips} = 2,250 \text{ skips}
\]

### Final Answer

The total number of skips that Roberto and Valerie make together in fifteen minutes is \( \boxed{2,250} \).
