==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate how many skips Roberto and Valerie will make in fifteen minutes.

**Step 1: Calculate Roberto's skips in 15 minutes.**

Roberto can skip 4,200 times in one hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can find out how many skips he makes in one minute:

\[
\text{Roberto's skips per minute} = \frac{4200 \text{ skips}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 70 \text{ skips per minute}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many skips he makes in 15 minutes:

\[
\text{Roberto's skips in 15 minutes} = 70 \text{ skips per minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 1050 \text{ skips}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Valerie's skips in 15 minutes.**

Valerie can skip 80 times in one minute. To find out how many skips she makes in 15 minutes, we multiply her skips per minute by 15:

\[
\text{Valerie's skips in 15 minutes} = 80 \text{ skips per minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 1200 \text{ skips}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total skips by both Roberto and Valerie.**

Now we add the skips made by both Roberto and Valerie:

\[
\text{Total skips} = \text{Roberto's skips} + \text{Valerie's skips} = 1050 \text{ skips} + 1200 \text{ skips} = 2250 \text{ skips}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The total number of skips made by Roberto and Valerie in fifteen minutes is \( \boxed{2250} \).
