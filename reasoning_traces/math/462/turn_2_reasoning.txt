Question ID: 462
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of skips Roberto and Valerie make in fifteen minutes and then add them together.

**Step 1: Calculate Roberto's skips in fifteen minutes.**

Roberto can skip 4,200 times in one hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can find out how many skips Roberto makes in one minute by dividing his hourly skips by 60:

\[
\text{Roberto's skips per minute} = \frac{4,200 \text{ skips}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 70 \text{ skips per minute}
\]

Now, we need to calculate how many skips Roberto makes in fifteen minutes:

\[
\text{Roberto's skips in 15 minutes} = 70 \text{ skips per minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 1,050 \text{ skips}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Valerie's skips in fifteen minutes.**

Valerie can skip 80 times a minute. To find out how many skips she makes in fifteen minutes, we multiply her skips per minute by fifteen:

\[
\text{Valerie's skips in 15 minutes} = 80 \text{ skips per minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 1,200 \text{ skips}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of skips.**

To find the total number of skips Roberto and Valerie make together in fifteen minutes, we add their individual skips:

\[
\text{Total skips} = \text{Roberto's skips} + \text{Valerie's skips} = 1,050 \text{ skips} + 1,200 \text{ skips} = 2,250 \text{ skips}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The total number of skips Roberto and Valerie make together in fifteen minutes is 2,250 skips.
