Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of skips Roberto and Valerie make in fifteen minutes and then add them together.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Roberto's Skips per Minute:**
   - Roberto can skip 4,200 times in one hour.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - To find out how many times Roberto skips per minute, divide the total skips per hour by the number of minutes in an hour:
     \[
     \text{Roberto's skips per minute} = \frac{4,200 \text{ skips}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 70 \text{ skips per minute}
     \]

2. **Calculate Roberto's Total Skips in Fifteen Minutes:**
   - Now that we know Roberto skips 70 times per minute, we can calculate how many skips he makes in fifteen minutes:
     \[
     \text{Roberto's total skips in 15 minutes} = 70 \text{ skips/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 1,050 \text{ skips}
     \]

3. **Determine Valerie's Skips per Minute:**
   - Valerie can skip 80 times a minute, as given in the problem.

4. **Calculate Valerie's Total Skips in Fifteen Minutes:**
   - Since Valerie skips 80 times per minute, we calculate her total skips in fifteen minutes:
     \[
     \text{Valerie's total skips in 15 minutes} = 80 \text{ skips/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 1,200 \text{ skips}
     \]

5. **Calculate the Combined Total Skips:**
   - To find the total number of skips both Roberto and Valerie make together, add their individual totals:
     \[
     \text{Total skips} = \text{Roberto's skips} + \text{Valerie's skips} = 1,050 \text{ skips} + 1,200 \text{ skips} = 2,250 \text{ skips}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Roberto and Valerie will total 2,250 skips in fifteen minutes.
