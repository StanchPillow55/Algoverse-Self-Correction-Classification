==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 330" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $30, and the profit from each unit of product B is $50. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 150 units per day. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - We want to maximize the profit, \( P \), which is given by:
     \[
     P = 30x + 50y
     \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     1. \( x \leq 100 \) (Product A production limit)
     2. \( y \leq 80 \) (Product B production limit)
     3. \( x + y \leq 150 \) (Total production limit)

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines:
     - \( x = 100 \)
     - \( y = 80 \)
     - \( x + y = 150 \)

5. **Find the Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are found by solving the system of equations given by the intersection of the lines:
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (100, 50) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (70, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( y = 80 \): \( (100, 80) \)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(100, 50) = 30(100) + 50(50) = 3000 + 2500 = 5500 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 30(70) + 50(80) = 2100 + 4000 = 6100 \)
   - \( P(100, 80) = 30(100) + 50(80) = 3000 + 4000 = 7000 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the point \( (100, 80) \) with a profit of $7000.

**Final Answer:**

The company should produce 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $7000.
