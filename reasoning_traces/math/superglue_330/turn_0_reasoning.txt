To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 330" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem statement, I'll assume it is a placeholder for a specific problem. Without the actual content of "Sample reasoning question 330," I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 330" is a typical math problem. For illustration, I'll create a sample problem and solve it:

**Sample Problem:**
A car travels from City A to City B, a distance of 150 miles, at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. How long does the journey take?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the car to travel from City A to City B.
   - We are given:
     - Distance = 150 miles
     - Speed = 50 miles per hour

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Plug the given values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{50 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 150 by 50:
     \[
     \text{Time} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the units make sense: We divided miles by miles per hour, which correctly gives us hours.
   - Recalculate to ensure no arithmetic errors were made.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The journey takes 3 hours.

This is a complete solution to the sample problem I created. If you have a specific problem or more details about "Sample reasoning question 330," please provide them, and I can solve that specific problem for you.
