==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 330," let's first clarify what the problem might be asking. Since the question is not specific, I'll assume it's a math problem involving reasoning, possibly related to a number or a sequence.

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
The problem mentions "330," which could refer to a number in a sequence, a specific value to be calculated, or a target number for a problem. Without additional context, let's explore a few possibilities:

1. **Arithmetic Sequence**: If 330 is part of an arithmetic sequence, we need to determine the common difference and the position of 330 in the sequence.
2. **Geometric Sequence**: If 330 is part of a geometric sequence, we need to find the common ratio and the position of 330.
3. **Divisibility or Factors**: 330 could be a number for which we need to find factors or check divisibility.
4. **Sum or Product Problem**: 330 might be the result of a sum or product of a series of numbers.

### Step 2: Exploring Possibilities

#### Possibility 1: Arithmetic Sequence
Assume 330 is the nth term of an arithmetic sequence with the first term \( a_1 \) and common difference \( d \).

The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

If 330 is the nth term, we need more information about \( a_1 \) and \( d \) to proceed.

#### Possibility 2: Geometric Sequence
Assume 330 is the nth term of a geometric sequence with the first term \( a_1 \) and common ratio \( r \).

The nth term of a geometric sequence is given by:
\[ a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{(n-1)} \]

Again, without specific values for \( a_1 \) and \( r \), we cannot proceed further.

#### Possibility 3: Divisibility or Factors
Let's explore the factors of 330.

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - 330 is even, so divide by 2: \( 330 \div 2 = 165 \)
   - 165 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \( 165 \div 5 = 33 \)
   - 33 is divisible by 3: \( 33 \div 3 = 11 \)
   - 11 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 330 is:
\[ 330 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 11 \]

2. **Divisors**:
   Using the prime factorization, we can find all divisors by considering combinations of the prime factors:
   - 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, 22, 30, 33, 55, 66, 110, 165, 330

#### Possibility 4: Sum or Product Problem
If 330 is the result of a sum or product, we need more context to determine the numbers involved.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Without additional context or specific instructions, we explored several mathematical interpretations of the number 330. The prime factorization and list of divisors are concrete results we can provide.

**Final Answer**: The prime factorization of 330 is \( 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 11 \). The divisors of 330 are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, 22, 30, 33, 55, 66, 110, 165, 330.
