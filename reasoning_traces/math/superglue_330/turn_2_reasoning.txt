Question ID: superglue_330
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 330" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear and lacks specific details, I'll approach this as a generic math problem-solving exercise, demonstrating a structured approach to solving a typical math problem.

### Step-by-Step Problem Solving Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   Since the problem statement is ambiguous, let's assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. For illustration, let's consider a simple algebra problem: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Identify What is Given and What is Unknown:**
   - Given: The equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Unknown: The value of \( x \).

3. **Plan a Strategy:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. This can be done using basic algebraic operations.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   11 = 11
   \]
   The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is the correct solution.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

### Conclusion

Since the original problem statement was unclear, I demonstrated a structured approach to solving a typical algebraic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 330" refers to a specific problem, please provide additional details or context for a more accurate solution.
