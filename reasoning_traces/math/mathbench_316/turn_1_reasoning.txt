Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 316," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 316" is not a specific question, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 316 positive integers.

**Solution:**

To find the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) integers.

In this case, \( n = 316 \). Plugging this value into the formula gives:

\[
S_{316} = \frac{316 \times (316 + 1)}{2}
\]

First, calculate \( 316 + 1 \):

\[
316 + 1 = 317
\]

Next, multiply 316 by 317:

\[
316 \times 317 = 100172
\]

Now, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:

\[
S_{316} = \frac{100172}{2} = 50086
\]

Therefore, the sum of the first 316 positive integers is \( 50,086 \).

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 316 positive integers is 50,086.
