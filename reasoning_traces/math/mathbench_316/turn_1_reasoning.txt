==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 316," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete or unclear. Without specific details or context, it's challenging to provide a precise solution. 

Let's assume that "Sample math problem 316" refers to a typical math problem that might involve arithmetic, algebra, geometry, or another area of mathematics. Since we don't have specific details, I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
Let's assume "Sample math problem 316" is the following algebra problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 17 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 17 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 5 = 17
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term:

   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 12
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{12}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying gives:

   \[
   x = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation to verify:

   \[
   2(6) + 5 = 17
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   12 + 5 = 17
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 17 \) is \( x = 6 \).

If "Sample math problem 316" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details or context so that I can assist you more accurately.
