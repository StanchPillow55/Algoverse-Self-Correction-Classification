==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 316," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 316" is not specific and does not provide any details or context. Therefore, I will demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 316" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's a sample problem:

**Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the quadratic equation:**
   The given equation is \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

2. **Write the equation in standard form:**
   The equation is already in standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

3. **Calculate the discriminant:**
   The discriminant \(\Delta\) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\).
   \[
   \Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
   \]

4. **Determine the nature of the roots:**
   Since the discriminant \(\Delta = 64\) is positive, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

5. **Use the quadratic formula to find the roots:**
   The quadratic formula is given by:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
   \]
   Substituting the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(\Delta\) into the formula:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

6. **Calculate the two roots:**
   - First root:
     \[
     x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   - Second root:
     \[
     x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

7. **State the final answer:**
   The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

Thus, the final answer is \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
