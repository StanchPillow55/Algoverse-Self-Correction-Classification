Question ID: mathbench_316
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 316" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem that might be labeled as such. Let's consider a common type of math problem that could be labeled with a number like 316, such as solving an equation, working with a geometric figure, or performing a calculation.

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume "Sample math problem 316" involves solving a quadratic equation, as this is a common type of math problem. Let's say the problem is:

Solve the quadratic equation: \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the quadratic equation**: 
   The given equation is \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \).

2. **Factor the quadratic equation**:
   To factor the quadratic equation, we need to find two numbers that multiply to the constant term (6) and add to the linear coefficient (-5).

   - The factors of 6 are: 1 and 6, 2 and 3.
   - We need two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5. These numbers are -2 and -3 because:
     \[
     (-2) \times (-3) = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad (-2) + (-3) = -5
     \]

3. **Write the factored form**:
   Using the numbers found, we can write the equation in its factored form:
   \[
   (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for the roots**:
   Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x - 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 2
   \]
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3
   \]

5. **Verify the solutions**:
   Substitute \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   - For \( x = 2 \):
     \[
     (2)^2 - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0
     \]
   - For \( x = 3 \):
     \[
     (3)^2 - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0
     \]

   Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

### Final Answer:
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \).
