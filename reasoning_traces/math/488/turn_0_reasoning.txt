To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Mrs. Smith needs after receiving a discount and how much more money she will need beyond the $500 she initially had.

### Step 1: Determine the Total Cost Without Discount

Mrs. Smith initially has $500, but she realizes she needs two-fifths more money than she has. Let's calculate how much more money she needs:

1. **Calculate two-fifths of $500:**

   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 500 = \frac{2 \times 500}{5} = \frac{1000}{5} = 200
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost without discount:**

   \[
   500 + 200 = 700
   \]

   So, the total cost of the items she picked is $700.

### Step 2: Apply the Discount

The shop owner offers a 15% discount on the total cost. We need to calculate the discounted price:

1. **Calculate 15% of $700:**

   \[
   0.15 \times 700 = 105
   \]

2. **Subtract the discount from the total cost:**

   \[
   700 - 105 = 595
   \]

   So, the discounted price is $595.

### Step 3: Calculate the Additional Money Needed

Mrs. Smith has $500, and the discounted price is $595. We need to find out how much more money she needs:

1. **Calculate the additional money needed:**

   \[
   595 - 500 = 95
   \]

### Final Answer

Mrs. Smith will still need an additional $95 after the discount is applied.
