==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of Pomeranians**: We know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Jana has a total of 27 puppies. 

   To find the number of Pomeranians, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of Pomeranians} = \frac{2}{3} \times 27
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 27 = \frac{2 \times 27}{3} = \frac{54}{3} = 18
   \]
   So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

2. **Determine the number of girl Pomeranians**: We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls. 

   To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of girl Pomeranians} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = \frac{18}{3} = 6
   \]
   So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

Now, we can summarize our findings:

- Total puppies: 27
- Total Pomeranians: 18
- Total girl Pomeranians: 6

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
