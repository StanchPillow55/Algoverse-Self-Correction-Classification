==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total cost of the items Mrs. Smith wants to buy.**  
   Let \( C \) be the total cost of the items she picked out. According to the problem, she needs two-fifths more money than she has. Since she has $500, we can express this mathematically as:
   \[
   C = 500 + \frac{2}{5} \times 500
   \]

2. **Calculate two-fifths of $500.**  
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 500 = \frac{1000}{5} = 200
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost \( C \).**  
   Now we can substitute this value back into the equation for \( C \):
   \[
   C = 500 + 200 = 700
   \]
   So, the total cost of the items is $700.

4. **Calculate the discount given by the shop owner.**  
   The shop owner gives a discount of 15% on the total cost. We need to calculate the amount of the discount:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 0.15 \times C = 0.15 \times 700
   \]

5. **Calculate the discount amount.**  
   \[
   0.15 \times 700 = 105
   \]

6. **Calculate the new price after the discount.**  
   Now we subtract the discount from the original total cost to find the new price:
   \[
   \text{New Price} = C - \text{Discount} = 700 - 105 = 595
   \]

7. **Determine how much more money Mrs. Smith needs.**  
   Now we need to find out how much more money she needs after the discount. She initially had $500, so we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Additional Money Needed} = \text{New Price} - 500 = 595 - 500 = 95
   \]

Thus, after all calculations, Mrs. Smith will still need **$95** more to buy the items after the discount.

**Final Answer:** $95
