==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 5," we need to first understand the problem. However, the problem statement is not provided here, so I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 5" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Sample math problem 5: A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle.
   - Let the width of the rectangle be \( w \).
   - The length of the rectangle is 3 times the width, so the length is \( 3w \).
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     P = 2(\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 48 units.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute the expressions for length and width into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     48 = 2(3w + w)
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms inside the parentheses:
     \[
     48 = 2(4w)
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     48 = 8w
     \]

4. **Solve for \( w \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 8 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length is 3 times the width:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 3w = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the calculated dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2(\text{Length} + \text{Width}) = 2(18 + 6) = 2 \times 24 = 48
     \]
   - The perimeter is indeed 48 units, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 6 units
- Length = 18 units
