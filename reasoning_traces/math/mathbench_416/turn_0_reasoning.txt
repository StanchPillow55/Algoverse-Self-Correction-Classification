==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 416" refers to. Since this is not a standard problem description, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem statement, I can't solve it directly. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to approach a typical math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might apply (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Consider similar problems you have solved in the past.
   - Decide on a strategy to solve the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of your work to avoid mistakes.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Recalculate if necessary to ensure accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down your final answer.
   - Ensure it answers the question posed in the problem.

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample math problem 416," I can't provide a direct solution. If you can provide the actual problem statement, I'd be happy to help solve it with detailed reasoning and calculations.
