Question ID: mathbench_416
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

It seems like there might be some confusion with the problem statement "Sample math problem 416." Without a specific math problem or context, it's challenging to provide a solution. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem if you provide more details or specify the type of problem you're referring to (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus, etc.).

If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help you solve it step by step.
