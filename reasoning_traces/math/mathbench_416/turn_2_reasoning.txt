Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 416, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 416" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. 

Let's assume that "Sample math problem 416" refers to a typical math problem that involves basic arithmetic, algebra, or geometry. Since no specific details are provided, I'll create a hypothetical problem based on common math topics and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 416:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even numbers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   - The first positive even numbers are: 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., up to the 20th term.
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

2. **Find the 20th Term:**
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - For the 20th term (\( n = 20 \)):
     \[
     a_{20} = 2 + (20-1) \cdot 2 = 2 + 38 = 40
     \]

3. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Plugging in the values for \( n = 20 \), \( a_1 = 2 \), and \( a_{20} = 40 \):
     \[
     S_{20} = \frac{20}{2} \cdot (2 + 40) = 10 \cdot 42 = 420
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 20 positive even numbers is 420.
