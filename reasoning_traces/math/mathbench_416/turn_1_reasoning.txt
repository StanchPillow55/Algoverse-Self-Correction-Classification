==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 416" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about this problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "416" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 416:**

A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 64 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Since the length is 3 times the width, let the length be \( 3w \).

2. **Write the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2(\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]

3. **Substitute Known Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 64 units, so:
     \[
     64 = 2(3w + w)
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms inside the parentheses:
     \[
     64 = 2(4w)
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     64 = 8w
     \]

5. **Solve for \( w \):**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to isolate \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{64}{8} = 8
     \]

6. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length is 3 times the width:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 3w = 3 \times 8 = 24
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the calculated dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2(24 + 8) = 2 \times 32 = 64
     \]
   - The perimeter matches the given condition, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 8 units
- Length = 24 units
