Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 113" entails. However, since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem, illustrating the step-by-step reasoning and calculations involved.

Let's assume a sample math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Problem:**  
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   From the problem, we know:
   - Base \( = 10 \) units
   - Height \( = 5 \) units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   Plug the given values into the area formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   First, multiply the base and the height:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50
   \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   Now, multiply the result by \( \frac{1}{2} \):
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle is \( 25 \) square units.

By following these steps, we ensure a clear and logical approach to solving the problem. If you have a specific problem or question in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem for you.
