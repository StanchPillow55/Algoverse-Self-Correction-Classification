==================================================

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a missing part of your question. "Sample reasoning question 113" doesn't provide enough information for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by outlining a step-by-step process. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully to understand what is being asked.
   - Identify the knowns (given information) and the unknowns (what you need to find).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies or formulas that might be applicable to solve the problem.
   - Consider drawing a diagram or making a table if it helps visualize the problem.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all your work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency if applicable.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - If possible, check your answer by plugging it back into the original problem.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly state the solution to the problem, including units if applicable.

If you provide a specific math problem, I can apply this process to solve it for you.
