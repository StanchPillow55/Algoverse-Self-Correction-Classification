To determine how much Tom has to pay per month for the bedroom set, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the net cost of the bedroom set after selling the old one.**
2. **Determine the monthly payment based on the interest rate.**

### Step 1: Calculate the net cost of the bedroom set

Tom buys a new bedroom set for $3000. He sells his old bedroom set for $1000. We can find the net cost of the new bedroom set by subtracting the amount he received from selling the old set from the cost of the new set.

\[
\text{Net Cost} = \text{Cost of New Bedroom Set} - \text{Sale Price of Old Bedroom Set}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Net Cost} = 3000 - 1000 = 2000
\]

So, the net cost of the new bedroom set is **$2000**.

### Step 2: Determine the monthly payment

Tom has to pay 10% interest per month on the remaining balance of $2000. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of the net cost.

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \text{Net Cost} \times \text{Interest Rate}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = 2000 \times 0.10 = 200
\]

Thus, Tom has to pay **$200** per month for the bedroom set.

### Final Answer

Tom has to pay **$200** per month.
