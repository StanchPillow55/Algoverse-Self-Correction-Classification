Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will first define the number of each type of stamp Max bought based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the number of snowflake stamps:**
   - Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
   - Let \( S = 16 \) (where \( S \) represents the number of snowflake stamps).

2. **Determine the number of truck stamps:**
   - The problem states that Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps.
   - Therefore, the number of truck stamps \( T \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   T = S + 3
   \]
   Substituting the value of \( S \):
   \[
   T = 16 + 3 = 19
   \]

3. **Determine the number of rose stamps:**
   - The problem states that Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps.
   - Therefore, the number of rose stamps \( R \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   R = T - 9
   \]
   Substituting the value of \( T \):
   \[
   R = 19 - 9 = 10
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of stamps:**
   - Now we can find the total number of stamps Max bought by adding the number of each type of stamp together:
   \[
   \text{Total stamps} = S + T + R
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total stamps} = 16 + 19 + 10
   \]
   Performing the addition:
   \[
   \text{Total stamps} = 45
   \]

Thus, the total number of stamps that Max bought is \( \boxed{45} \).
