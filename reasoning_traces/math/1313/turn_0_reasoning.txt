To solve the problem, we need to determine how much each watermelon was sold for after the vendor made a profit of 25%.

### Step 1: Calculate the Cost Price per Watermelon
The vendor bought 50 watermelons for a total of $80. To find the cost price (CP) per watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons:

\[
\text{Cost Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{80}{50}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Cost Price per Watermelon} = 1.60
\]

So, each watermelon cost the vendor $1.60.

### Step 2: Calculate the Selling Price per Watermelon
The vendor sold all the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price (SP) per watermelon, we need to calculate 25% of the cost price and then add that to the cost price.

First, we calculate 25% of the cost price:

\[
\text{Profit} = 25\% \text{ of } \text{Cost Price} = 0.25 \times 1.60
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Profit} = 0.25 \times 1.60 = 0.40
\]

Now, we add the profit to the cost price to find the selling price:

\[
\text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 1.60 + 0.40
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = 2.00
\]

### Final Answer
The vendor sold each watermelon for $2.00.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{2.00}
\]
