To solve the problem, we need to determine how many packages Colby completes in an hour and then calculate his earnings based on that.

1. **Determine the number of packages Colby completes in an hour:**
   - The problem states that Colby completes "10 less than 50 packages per hour."
   - We can express this mathematically as:
     \[
     \text{Packages per hour} = 50 - 10 = 40
     \]
   - Therefore, Colby completes 40 packages in one hour.

2. **Calculate Colby's earnings per hour:**
   - Colby earns $0.20 for each package he completes.
   - To find his earnings for one hour, we multiply the number of packages he completes by the amount he earns per package:
     \[
     \text{Earnings per hour} = \text{Packages per hour} \times \text{Earnings per package}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Earnings per hour} = 40 \times 0.20 = 8.00
     \]
   - Thus, Colby earns $8.00 in one hour.

3. **Calculate Colby's earnings for an eight-hour workday:**
   - To find out how much he earns in an eight-hour workday, we multiply his hourly earnings by the number of hours he works:
     \[
     \text{Earnings for eight hours} = \text{Earnings per hour} \times \text{Number of hours}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Earnings for eight hours} = 8.00 \times 8 = 64.00
     \]
   - Therefore, Colby earns $64.00 in a typical eight-hour workday.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Colby's total earnings for an eight-hour workday is \(\boxed{64.00}\) dollars.
