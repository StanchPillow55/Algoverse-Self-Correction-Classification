Question ID: superglue_466
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 466" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by outlining a step-by-step reasoning process. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - We are given the base and the height of the triangle.

2. **Recall the Formula:**
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - Base (\(b\)) = 10 units
   - Height (\(h\)) = 5 units
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

**Conclusion:**

By following these steps, we calculated the area of the triangle to be 25 square units. This process demonstrates how to approach a math problem by understanding the problem, recalling relevant formulas, substituting given values, performing calculations, and stating the final answer. If "Sample reasoning question 466" refers to a specific problem, please provide the details, and I can apply a similar step-by-step approach to solve it.
