==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many tickets are available for graduates to distribute to their friends and family after accounting for the seats reserved for graduates and faculty.

1. **Total Capacity of the Fine Arts Center**: 
   The total capacity is given as 6000 seats.

2. **Seats Reserved for Graduates**: 
   There are 950 seats reserved for graduates.

3. **Seats Reserved for Faculty**: 
   There are 300 seats reserved for faculty.

4. **Calculating the Total Reserved Seats**: 
   We need to add the seats reserved for graduates and faculty together:
   \[
   \text{Total Reserved Seats} = \text{Seats for Graduates} + \text{Seats for Faculty}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Reserved Seats} = 950 + 300 = 1250
   \]

5. **Calculating Available Seats for Friends and Family**: 
   To find out how many seats are left for friends and family, we subtract the total reserved seats from the total capacity:
   \[
   \text{Available Seats} = \text{Total Capacity} - \text{Total Reserved Seats}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Available Seats} = 6000 - 1250 = 4750
   \]

6. **Calculating the Number of Graduates**: 
   The problem does not specify the number of graduates, but we will assume that the number of graduates is equal to the number of seats reserved for graduates, which is 950.

7. **Calculating Tickets per Graduate**: 
   To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we divide the available seats by the number of graduates:
   \[
   \text{Tickets per Graduate} = \frac{\text{Available Seats}}{\text{Number of Graduates}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tickets per Graduate} = \frac{4750}{950}
   \]

   Performing the division:
   \[
   \text{Tickets per Graduate} = 5
   \]

Thus, each graduate would receive **5 tickets** to give to their friends and family.

**Final Answer**: Each graduate receives 5 tickets.
