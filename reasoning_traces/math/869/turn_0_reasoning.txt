==================================================

To determine how much change the seller will give back, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the phones.**
   The seller bought 5 phones, and each phone costs $700. We can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of phones by the cost per phone:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Phones} \times \text{Cost per Phone}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 5 \times 700 = 3500
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of money given to the seller.**
   The seller gives $4000 in dollar bills to pay for the phones.

3. **Calculate the change to be given back.**
   To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:

   \[
   \text{Change} = \text{Amount Given} - \text{Total Cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Change} = 4000 - 3500 = 500
   \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   The seller will give back $500 in change.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{500}
\]
