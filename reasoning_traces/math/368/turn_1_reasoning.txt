Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the cost of the stuffed animal, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items Linda bought, excluding the stuffed animal.

1. **Calculate the cost of the coloring books:**
   - Linda bought 2 coloring books at $4 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of coloring books} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the packs of peanuts:**
   - Linda bought 4 packs of peanuts at $1.50 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of peanuts} = 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the coloring books and peanuts:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost of coloring books and peanuts} = 8 + 6 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how much Linda spent in total:**
   - Linda gave the cashier $25 and received no change, which means she spent the entire $25.
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = 25 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost of the stuffed animal:**
   - Let \( x \) be the cost of the stuffed animal. The total cost of all items is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of coloring books and peanuts} + \text{Cost of stuffed animal}
   \]
   \[
   25 = 14 + x
   \]
   - To find \( x \), we rearrange the equation:
   \[
   x = 25 - 14 = 11 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the cost of the stuffed animal is **$11**. 

Final answer: **$11**.
