==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, given that after scoring those points, she has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points.

Let's denote:
- \( E \) as the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points.
- After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points become \( E + 14 \).
- Sara's total points are given as 8.

According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. We can express this relationship mathematically:

\[
E + 14 = 3 \times \text{Sara's points}
\]

Substituting Sara's points (which is 8) into the equation gives us:

\[
E + 14 = 3 \times 8
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
3 \times 8 = 24
\]

Now we can rewrite the equation:

\[
E + 14 = 24
\]

To find \( E \), we need to isolate it. We do this by subtracting 14 from both sides:

\[
E = 24 - 14
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
E = 10
\]

Thus, Erin had **10 points** before scoring 14 points.

To summarize:
1. We established the relationship between Erin's and Sara's points after Erin scored.
2. We set up the equation based on the information given.
3. We solved for \( E \) and found that Erin had 10 points before scoring.

Final answer: Erin had **10 points** before scoring.
