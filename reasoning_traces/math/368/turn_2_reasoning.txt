Question ID: 368
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many points Erin had before she scored 14 points, given that after scoring those points, she has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Sara's Points**: 
   - We know that Sara scored 8 points.

2. **Determine Erin's Points After Scoring**: 
   - Let \( E \) represent the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points. 
   - After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points become \( E + 14 \).

3. **Set Up the Relationship**: 
   - According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. 
   - Therefore, we can express this relationship mathematically as:
     \[
     E + 14 = 3 \times \text{(Sara's points)}
     \]
   - Substituting Sara's points (which is 8) into the equation gives:
     \[
     E + 14 = 3 \times 8
     \]

4. **Calculate the Right Side**: 
   - Now we calculate \( 3 \times 8 \):
     \[
     3 \times 8 = 24
     \]
   - So, we can rewrite the equation as:
     \[
     E + 14 = 24
     \]

5. **Solve for Erin's Points Before Scoring**: 
   - To find \( E \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 14 from both sides:
     \[
     E = 24 - 14
     \]
   - Performing the subtraction gives:
     \[
     E = 10
     \]

6. **Conclusion**: 
   - Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
