==================================================

To find out how much the stuffed animal costs, we need to calculate the total amount Linda spent on the coloring books and the packs of peanuts, and then subtract that from the amount she gave to the cashier.

1. **Calculate the cost of the coloring books:**
   - Linda bought 2 coloring books at $4 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of coloring books} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the packs of peanuts:**
   - Linda bought 4 packs of peanuts at $1.50 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of peanuts} = 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the coloring books and peanuts:**
   - Now, we add the cost of the coloring books and the cost of the peanuts together.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of coloring books and peanuts} = 8 + 6 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how much Linda spent on the stuffed animal:**
   - Linda gave the cashier $25 and received no change. Therefore, the total amount she spent is $25.
   - To find the cost of the stuffed animal, we subtract the total cost of the coloring books and peanuts from the total amount she spent.
   \[
   \text{Cost of stuffed animal} = \text{Total amount given} - \text{Total cost of coloring books and peanuts}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of stuffed animal} = 25 - 14 = 11 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the cost of the stuffed animal is **$11**.

Final answer: The stuffed animal costs **$11**.
