To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the stuffed animal. We know the total amount Linda spent and the cost of the other items she purchased. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the coloring books:**
   - Linda bought two coloring books, each costing $4.
   - Total cost for coloring books = 2 books × $4/book = $8.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the packs of peanuts:**
   - Linda bought 4 packs of peanuts, each costing $1.50.
   - Total cost for peanuts = 4 packs × $1.50/pack = $6.

3. **Determine the total amount spent on coloring books and peanuts:**
   - Total cost for coloring books and peanuts = $8 (coloring books) + $6 (peanuts) = $14.

4. **Determine the total amount Linda spent:**
   - Linda gave the cashier $25 and received no change, so she spent the entire $25.

5. **Calculate the cost of the stuffed animal:**
   - Total amount spent = Cost of coloring books + Cost of peanuts + Cost of stuffed animal.
   - $25 = $14 + Cost of stuffed animal.
   - To find the cost of the stuffed animal, subtract the cost of the coloring books and peanuts from the total amount spent:
   - Cost of stuffed animal = $25 - $14 = $11.

Therefore, the cost of the stuffed animal is $11.

**Final Answer:**
The stuffed animal costs $11.
