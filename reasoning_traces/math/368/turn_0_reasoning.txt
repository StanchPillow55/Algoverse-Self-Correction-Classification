==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many points Erin had before she scored 14 points, given that after scoring those points, she has three times more points than Sara.

Let's denote:
- \( E \) as the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points.
- \( S \) as the number of points Sara has, which is given as 8 points.

After Erin scores 14 points, her total points become:
\[
E + 14
\]

According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[
E + 14 = 3S
\]

Substituting the value of \( S \) (which is 8) into the equation:
\[
E + 14 = 3 \times 8
\]
\[
E + 14 = 24
\]

Now, we will solve for \( E \):
\[
E = 24 - 14
\]
\[
E = 10
\]

Thus, Erin had **10 points** before scoring 14 points.

To verify:
- Before scoring, Erin had 10 points.
- After scoring 14 points, Erin has:
\[
10 + 14 = 24 \text{ points}
\]
- Sara has 8 points, and three times Sara's points is:
\[
3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ points}
\]

Since both calculations match, our solution is confirmed.

Final answer:
Erin had **10 points** before scoring.
