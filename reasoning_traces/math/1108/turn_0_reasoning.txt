==================================================

To find out how much money your mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items before the coupon discount.**
   - The cost of the pots is $19.
   - The cost of the sack of garden soil is $26.

   We add these two amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = \text{Cost of pots} + \text{Cost of soil}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 19 + 26
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 45
   \]

2. **Apply the coupon discount.**
   - Your mom used a coupon for $7 off.

   We subtract the coupon amount from the total cost:

   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \text{Total cost before discount} - \text{Coupon amount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 45 - 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 38
   \]

3. **Final answer.**
   - Therefore, the amount of money your mom spent at the gardening shop is **$38**.

In conclusion, after calculating the total cost of the pots and soil, and applying the coupon discount, your mom spent a total of **$38** at the gardening shop.
