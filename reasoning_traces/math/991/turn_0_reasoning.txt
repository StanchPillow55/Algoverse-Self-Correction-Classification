==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Comet's Orbit**: 
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. This means that it is visible from Earth every 75 years.

2. **Bill's Dad's Age**:
   - Let’s denote the year when Bill's dad saw the comet as Year 0.
   - At that time, Bill's dad was 30 years old.

3. **Bill's Age When He Saw the Comet**:
   - We need to determine how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. 
   - Since the comet appears every 75 years, the next appearance after Bill's dad saw it would be in Year 75.

4. **Bill's Dad's Age at the Next Appearance**:
   - When the comet appears again in Year 75, Bill's dad will be:
     \[
     30 + 75 = 105 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Bill's Age When He Saw the Comet the Second Time**:
   - According to the problem, Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Bill's dad was 30 years old when he first saw the comet, so when Bill sees the comet the second time, he is three times that age:
     \[
     3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years old}
     \]

6. **Calculating Bill's Age**:
   - Let’s denote Bill's age when he first saw the comet as \( x \).
   - Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he first saw the comet, and Bill saw it again when he was 90 years old, we can set up the following equation:
     \[
     x + 75 = 90
     \]
   - This equation states that Bill's age when he first saw the comet plus 75 years (the time until the next appearance) equals 90 years (his age when he saw it the second time).

7. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - Rearranging the equation gives:
     \[
     x = 90 - 75
     \]
     \[
     x = 15
     \]

Thus, Bill was **15 years old** when he saw the comet for the first time.

**Final Answer**: Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.
