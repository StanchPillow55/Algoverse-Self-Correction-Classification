==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of model trains Max receives over the 5-year period and then determine how many he has after his parents double his collection.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Trains Received for Birthdays:**
   - Max receives 1 train for each birthday.
   - Over 5 years, he will have 5 birthdays.
   - Therefore, the total number of trains received for birthdays is:
     \[
     1 \text{ train/birthday} \times 5 \text{ birthdays} = 5 \text{ trains}
     \]

2. **Trains Received for Christmas:**
   - Max receives 2 trains each Christmas.
   - Over 5 years, there are 5 Christmases.
   - Therefore, the total number of trains received for Christmas is:
     \[
     2 \text{ trains/Christmas} \times 5 \text{ Christmases} = 10 \text{ trains}
     \]

3. **Total Trains Before Doubling:**
   - Add the trains received for birthdays and Christmas:
     \[
     5 \text{ trains (birthdays)} + 10 \text{ trains (Christmas)} = 15 \text{ trains}
     \]

4. **Doubling the Collection:**
   - At the end of the 5 years, Max's parents give him double the number of trains he already has.
   - Therefore, the number of trains after doubling is:
     \[
     2 \times 15 \text{ trains} = 30 \text{ trains}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Max has a total of 30 model trains after his parents double his collection at the end of the 5 years.
