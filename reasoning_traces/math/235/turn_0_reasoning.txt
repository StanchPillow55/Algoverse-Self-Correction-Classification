==================================================

To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of slices needed**: 
   John has 20 friends and wants each of them to have 4 slices. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of slices required by multiplying the number of friends by the number of slices each friend will have.

   \[
   \text{Total slices needed} = \text{Number of friends} \times \text{Slices per friend}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total slices needed} = 20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Determine how many slices are in one pizza**: 
   Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions (slices). 

3. **Calculate the number of pizzas needed**: 
   To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza.

   \[
   \text{Number of pizzas needed} = \frac{\text{Total slices needed}}{\text{Slices per pizza}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of pizzas needed} = \frac{80}{8} = 10
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure that each of his 20 friends can have 4 slices.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]
