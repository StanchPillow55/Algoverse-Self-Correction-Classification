To determine how many model trains Max has after 5 years, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the gifts Max receives each year:**
   - For each birthday, Max asks for 1 model train.
   - For each Christmas, Max asks for 2 model trains.

2. **Calculate the total number of gifts Max receives in one year:**
   - Max has 1 birthday and 1 Christmas each year.
   - Therefore, the total number of trains Max receives in one year is:
     \[
     \text{Total trains per year} = \text{Trains from birthday} + \text{Trains from Christmas} = 1 + 2 = 3
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of trains Max receives over 5 years:**
   - Since Max receives 3 trains each year and he does this for 5 years, the total number of trains he receives over 5 years is:
     \[
     \text{Total trains over 5 years} = \text{Total trains per year} \times \text{Number of years} = 3 \times 5 = 15
     \]

4. **Determine the total number of trains Max has after 5 years:**
   - After 5 years, Max has received 15 model trains.

5. **Calculate the number of trains Max's parents give him at the end of 5 years:**
   - At the end of the 5 years, his parents give him double the number of trains he already has. Since he has 15 trains, the number of additional trains he receives is:
     \[
     \text{Additional trains} = 2 \times \text{Current trains} = 2 \times 15 = 30
     \]

6. **Calculate the total number of trains Max has now:**
   - To find the total number of trains Max has after receiving the additional trains, we add the additional trains to the current number of trains:
     \[
     \text{Total trains now} = \text{Current trains} + \text{Additional trains} = 15 + 30 = 45
     \]

Therefore, after 5 years, Max has a total of **45 model trains**.

Final answer: **45**
