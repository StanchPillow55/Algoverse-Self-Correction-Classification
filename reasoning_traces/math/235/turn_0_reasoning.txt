To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of model trains Max receives over a period of 5 years, including the additional trains his parents give him at the end of this period.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Trains Received on Birthdays:**
   - Max receives 1 train for each birthday.
   - Over 5 years, he will have 5 birthdays.
   - Therefore, the total number of trains received from birthdays is:
     \[
     1 \text{ train/birthday} \times 5 \text{ birthdays} = 5 \text{ trains}
     \]

2. **Trains Received on Christmas:**
   - Max receives 2 trains each Christmas.
   - Over 5 years, he will have 5 Christmases.
   - Therefore, the total number of trains received from Christmas is:
     \[
     2 \text{ trains/Christmas} \times 5 \text{ Christmases} = 10 \text{ trains}
     \]

3. **Total Trains Before the Final Gift:**
   - Add the trains received from birthdays and Christmas:
     \[
     5 \text{ trains (birthdays)} + 10 \text{ trains (Christmas)} = 15 \text{ trains}
     \]

4. **Final Gift from Parents:**
   - At the end of the 5 years, Max's parents give him double the number of trains he already has.
   - He already has 15 trains, so he receives:
     \[
     2 \times 15 \text{ trains} = 30 \text{ trains}
     \]

5. **Total Number of Trains Max Has Now:**
   - Add the trains he had before the final gift to the trains received as the final gift:
     \[
     15 \text{ trains} + 30 \text{ trains} = 45 \text{ trains}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Max has a total of 45 model trains now.
