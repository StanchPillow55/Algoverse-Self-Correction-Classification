Question ID: 235
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of model trains Max receives over the 5-year period and then determine how many trains he has after his parents double his collection.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Trains Received for Birthdays:**
   - Max receives 1 train for each birthday.
   - Over 5 years, he will have 5 birthdays.
   - Therefore, the total number of trains received for birthdays is:
     \[
     5 \text{ trains (1 per year for 5 years)}
     \]

2. **Trains Received for Christmas:**
   - Max receives 2 trains each Christmas.
   - Over 5 years, he will have 5 Christmases.
   - Therefore, the total number of trains received for Christmas is:
     \[
     2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ trains}
     \]

3. **Total Trains Before Doubling:**
   - Add the trains received for birthdays and Christmas:
     \[
     5 \text{ (birthdays)} + 10 \text{ (Christmas)} = 15 \text{ trains}
     \]

4. **Doubling the Collection:**
   - At the end of the 5 years, his parents double the number of trains he has.
   - Therefore, the total number of trains after doubling is:
     \[
     2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ trains}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Max has a total of 30 model trains after his parents double his collection.
