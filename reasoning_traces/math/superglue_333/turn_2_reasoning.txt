Question ID: superglue_333
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 333" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not clear or specific, I will assume that "Sample reasoning question 333" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. 

Let's create a hypothetical math problem to solve:

**Problem:** Calculate the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the value of \( n \):**
   - We are asked to find the sum of the first 10 positive integers, so \( n = 10 \).

2. **Apply the formula:**
   - Substitute \( n = 10 \) into the formula:
   \[
   S_{10} = \frac{10(10 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate the expression:**
   - First, calculate \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).
   - Then, calculate \( 10 \times 11 = 110 \).
   - Finally, divide by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S_{10} = \frac{110}{2} = 55
   \]

4. **Verify the calculation by listing the integers:**
   - The first 10 positive integers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
   - Calculate their sum directly:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55
   \]

Both methods confirm that the sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.
