==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. However, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by using a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Calculate the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 10 positive integers. These integers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 10 \). Substitute 10 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{10(10 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - Calculate \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).
   - Multiply 10 by 11 to get 110.
   - Divide 110 by 2 to get 55.

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure accuracy, let's add the numbers directly:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55
   \]
   This confirms our result using the formula.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.

By following these steps, we have solved the problem systematically. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can assist you with that.
