Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 333" entails. However, since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem Statement:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a linear equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies this equation.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   - Now, divide each side of the equation by 2 to solve for \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

### Conclusion:
By following these steps, we have successfully solved the equation and verified that the solution is correct. This approach can be applied to a wide range of algebraic problems to systematically find the solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide additional details.
