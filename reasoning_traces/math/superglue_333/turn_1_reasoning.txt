==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what is being asked. However, the question "Sample reasoning question 333" is not clear or specific. It seems to be a placeholder or an incomplete question. Without additional context or details, it's challenging to provide a specific solution.

However, let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 333" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step to demonstrate the process.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume the problem is: "If 333 is divided by 3, what is the quotient?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to divide 333 by 3 and find the quotient.

2. **Set Up the Division:**
   - We will perform the division operation: \( 333 \div 3 \).

3. **Perform the Division:**
   - Start by dividing the first digit of 333 by 3. The first digit is 3.
   - \( 3 \div 3 = 1 \). Write 1 above the division bar.
   - Multiply 1 by 3 and subtract from 3. \( 3 - 3 = 0 \).
   - Bring down the next digit, which is 3, making it 03.
   - Divide 03 by 3. \( 3 \div 3 = 1 \). Write 1 above the division bar next to the first 1.
   - Multiply 1 by 3 and subtract from 3. \( 3 - 3 = 0 \).
   - Bring down the last digit, which is 3, making it 03.
   - Divide 03 by 3. \( 3 \div 3 = 1 \). Write 1 above the division bar next to the previous 1s.
   - Multiply 1 by 3 and subtract from 3. \( 3 - 3 = 0 \).

4. **Check the Result:**
   - The division is complete, and there is no remainder.
   - The quotient is 111.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The quotient of 333 divided by 3 is 111.

**Final Answer:**
The quotient of 333 divided by 3 is 111.
