==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 333" entails. However, the question as presented is not clear or specific. It seems to be a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not provided here. 

To proceed, I'll assume this is a generic math problem-solving task and outline a general approach to solving math problems step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details so I can assist you more accurately.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what is needed.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning).
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency if applicable.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution answers the question posed.
   - Check calculations for errors.
   - Consider whether the solution is reasonable and makes sense in the context of the problem.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, ensuring it is in the correct form and units.

### Example Problem:

Let's consider a simple example problem to illustrate the process:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- We can solve this linear equation by isolating \( x \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
- Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Review/Check the Solution**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).
