To determine how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to break down his carrot consumption based on the days of the week.

1. **Identify the number of weekdays and weekend days:**
   - There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday).
   - There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).

2. **Calculate the number of carrots eaten on weekdays:**
   - Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday.
   - Therefore, the total number of carrots eaten on weekdays can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Carrots on weekdays} = \text{Number of weekdays} \times \text{Carrots per weekday}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Carrots on weekdays} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ carrots}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of carrots eaten on weekends:**
   - Mason eats 5 carrots each weekend day.
   - Therefore, the total number of carrots eaten on weekends can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Carrots on weekends} = \text{Number of weekend days} \times \text{Carrots per weekend day}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Carrots on weekends} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ carrots}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of carrots eaten in a week:**
   - To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we add the carrots eaten on weekdays and the carrots eaten on weekends:
     \[
     \text{Total carrots in a week} = \text{Carrots on weekdays} + \text{Carrots on weekends}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total carrots in a week} = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ carrots}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Mason eats **30 carrots** in a week.
