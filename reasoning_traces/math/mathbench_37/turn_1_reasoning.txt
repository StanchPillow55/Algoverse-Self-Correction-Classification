==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 37" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 37" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Sample math problem 37: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 7 = 22 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 7 = 22 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 7 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 7 = 22
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 7 = 22
   \]
   \[
   22 = 22
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 7 = 22 \) is \( x = 5 \).
