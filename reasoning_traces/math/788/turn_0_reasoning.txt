==================================================

To determine how much money John is missing for the school trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total cost of the trip**: The trip costs $300.

2. **Determine how much the school will cover**: The school has decided to cover half the cost of the trip. Therefore, we calculate half of $300:
   \[
   \text{Amount covered by the school} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]

3. **Calculate how much John needs to contribute**: Since the school is covering $150, John will need to cover the remaining half of the trip cost:
   \[
   \text{Amount John needs to contribute} = 300 - 150 = 150
   \]

4. **Determine how much money John currently has**: John has $50.

5. **Calculate how much money John is missing**: To find out how much more money John needs, we subtract the amount he has from the amount he needs to contribute:
   \[
   \text{Amount John is missing} = 150 - 50 = 100
   \]

Thus, John is missing **$100** to fully cover his share of the trip cost.

Final answer: John is missing **$100**.
