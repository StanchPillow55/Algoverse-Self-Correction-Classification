To solve this problem, we need to determine how far the ship was blown backward by the storm. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total distance to the destination:**

   Let's denote the total distance to the destination as \( D \).

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by the ship before the storm:**

   The Skipper sailed halfway to the destination by traveling due east for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour. The distance traveled in this time is given by the formula:

   \[
   \text{Distance traveled} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{km/h} \times 20 \, \text{h} = 600 \, \text{km}
   \]

   Since this distance is halfway to the destination, we have:

   \[
   \frac{D}{2} = 600 \, \text{km}
   \]

   Solving for \( D \), we find:

   \[
   D = 2 \times 600 \, \text{km} = 1200 \, \text{km}
   \]

3. **Determine the ship's position after the storm:**

   After the storm, the Skipper found that he was only one-third of the way to his destination. Therefore, the ship's new position is:

   \[
   \frac{D}{3} = \frac{1200 \, \text{km}}{3} = 400 \, \text{km}
   \]

   This means that after the storm, the ship is 400 km from the starting point.

4. **Calculate the distance blown backward by the storm:**

   Initially, the ship was 600 km from the starting point (halfway to the destination). After the storm, the ship was only 400 km from the starting point. Therefore, the distance the ship was blown backward by the storm is:

   \[
   600 \, \text{km} - 400 \, \text{km} = 200 \, \text{km}
   \]

Thus, the ship was blown 200 kilometers in a westward direction by the storm.

**Final Answer:**

The ship was blown 200 kilometers in a westward direction by the storm.
