To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete trip between the three cities and then determine how many days it can operate before needing service.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city.

1. **Distance from the first city to the second city:** 75 miles
2. **Distance from the second city to the third city:** 100 miles
3. **Combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance from first to second to third} = 75 + 100 = 175 \text{ miles}
   \]
4. **Distance from the third city to the first city:** The problem states that this distance is 50 miles less than the combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city.
   \[
   \text{Distance from third city to first city} = 175 - 50 = 125 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance for one complete trip.

Now we can calculate the total distance for one complete trip that goes from the first city to the second city, then to the third city, and finally back to the first city:
\[
\text{Total distance for one trip} = \text{Distance from first to second} + \text{Distance from second to third} + \text{Distance from third to first}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance for one trip} = 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled in one day.

The train makes this trip 3 times a day:
\[
\text{Total distance traveled in one day} = 3 \times \text{Total distance for one trip}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance traveled in one day} = 3 \times 300 = 900 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 4: Determine how many days the train can operate before needing service.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it can operate before needing service, we divide the total service distance by the distance traveled in one day:
\[
\text{Number of days before service} = \frac{18,000 \text{ miles}}{900 \text{ miles/day}}
\]
\[
\text{Number of days before service} = 20 \text{ days}
\]

### Final Answer:
The train can operate for **20 days** between services.
