==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and perform the necessary calculations.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance to the destination

The Skipper sailed halfway to the destination. We need to first determine how far that halfway point is. 

1. **Speed of the ship**: 30 kilometers per hour
2. **Time sailed**: 20 hours

Using the formula for distance:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]
we can calculate the distance traveled on the first day:
\[
\text{Distance traveled} = 30 \, \text{km/h} \times 20 \, \text{h} = 600 \, \text{km}
\]

Since this distance represents half of the total distance to the destination, we can find the total distance to the destination:
\[
\text{Total distance to destination} = 2 \times 600 \, \text{km} = 1200 \, \text{km}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the distance to the destination after the storm

After the storm, the Skipper found that he was only one-third of the way to his destination. We can calculate this distance:
\[
\text{Distance to destination after storm} = \frac{1}{3} \times 1200 \, \text{km} = 400 \, \text{km}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the distance the ship was blown backward

Initially, after sailing for 20 hours, the Skipper was at the halfway point, which is 600 km from the starting point. After the storm, he was at a point that is 400 km from the starting point. 

To find out how far the ship was blown backward by the storm, we subtract the new position from the initial position:
\[
\text{Distance blown backward} = \text{Initial position} - \text{New position}
\]
\[
\text{Distance blown backward} = 600 \, \text{km} - 400 \, \text{km} = 200 \, \text{km}
\]

### Final Answer

The ship was blown **200 kilometers** in a westward direction by the storm.
