==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 255" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I will assume that "Sample math problem 255" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 255" is the following:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

**Solution:**

Step 1: Identify the even numbers between 1 and 100.
- Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
- The even numbers between 1 and 100 are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

Step 2: Determine the sequence of even numbers.
- This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

Step 3: Find the number of terms in the sequence.
- The last term \( a_n = 100 \).
- The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
  \[
  a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
  \]
- Plug in the known values:
  \[
  100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
  \]
- Simplify and solve for \( n \):
  \[
  100 = 2 + 2n - 2
  \]
  \[
  100 = 2n
  \]
  \[
  n = 50
  \]
- There are 50 even numbers between 1 and 100.

Step 4: Calculate the sum of the sequence.
- The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
  \[
  S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
  \]
- Plug in the values:
  \[
  S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
  \]
  \[
  S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
  \]
  \[
  S_{50} = 2550
  \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.
