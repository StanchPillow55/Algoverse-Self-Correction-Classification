==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample math problem 255" doesn't provide enough information to determine what the problem is asking. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem, assuming it involves basic arithmetic or algebra. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details.

Let's assume a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   - To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   - Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   - Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a different or specific problem in mind, please provide the complete problem statement, and I'll be happy to help solve it.
