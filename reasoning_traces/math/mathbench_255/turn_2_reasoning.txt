Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 255," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 255" is not specific enough to determine what mathematical operations or concepts are involved. 

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 255" refers to a generic math problem involving the number 255. We will explore a few possible interpretations and solve them:

### Interpretation 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations
Let's assume the problem involves basic arithmetic operations with the number 255.

1. **Addition**: What is 255 + 100?
   \[
   255 + 100 = 355
   \]

2. **Subtraction**: What is 255 - 50?
   \[
   255 - 50 = 205
   \]

3. **Multiplication**: What is 255 \times 2?
   \[
   255 \times 2 = 510
   \]

4. **Division**: What is 255 \div 5?
   \[
   255 \div 5 = 51
   \]

### Interpretation 2: Prime Factorization
Let's find the prime factorization of 255.

1. Check divisibility by 2: 255 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.
2. Check divisibility by 3: Sum of digits \(2 + 5 + 5 = 12\), which is divisible by 3.
   \[
   255 \div 3 = 85
   \]
3. Factor 85: Check divisibility by 5 (last digit is 5).
   \[
   85 \div 5 = 17
   \]
4. Check 17: 17 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 255 is:
\[
255 = 3 \times 5 \times 17
\]

### Interpretation 3: Binary Representation
Convert 255 to binary.

1. 255 in binary is \(11111111_2\).

### Interpretation 4: Solving an Equation
Assume the problem involves solving an equation with 255. For example, solve for \(x\) in the equation \(x + 100 = 255\).

1. Subtract 100 from both sides:
   \[
   x + 100 - 100 = 255 - 100
   \]
   \[
   x = 155
   \]

### Conclusion
Without a specific problem statement, we explored several interpretations involving the number 255. Here are the results:

- Basic arithmetic operations: Examples provided.
- Prime factorization: \(255 = 3 \times 5 \times 17\).
- Binary representation: \(255 = 11111111_2\).
- Solving an equation: \(x + 100 = 255\) gives \(x = 155\).

If you have a specific problem involving 255, please provide more details for a precise solution.
