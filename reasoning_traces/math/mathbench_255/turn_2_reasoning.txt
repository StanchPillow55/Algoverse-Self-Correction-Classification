==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 255" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, we can assume it might be a placeholder for a specific math problem. However, without further context, it's challenging to determine the exact nature of the problem.

Let's consider a hypothetical math problem involving the number 255. We can explore a few different types of problems that might involve this number:

### Problem 1: Prime Factorization of 255

**Step 1: Check divisibility by small prime numbers.**

- **Divisibility by 2:** 255 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
- **Divisibility by 3:** Sum of digits of 255 is \(2 + 5 + 5 = 12\). Since 12 is divisible by 3, 255 is divisible by 3.
  \[
  255 \div 3 = 85
  \]

**Step 2: Factor 85.**

- **Divisibility by 2:** 85 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
- **Divisibility by 3:** Sum of digits of 85 is \(8 + 5 = 13\). 13 is not divisible by 3.
- **Divisibility by 5:** 85 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.
  \[
  85 \div 5 = 17
  \]

**Step 3: Check if 17 is a prime number.**

- 17 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 17.

**Conclusion:**

The prime factorization of 255 is \(3 \times 5 \times 17\).

### Problem 2: Convert 255 to Binary

**Step 1: Divide by 2 and record the remainder.**

- \(255 \div 2 = 127\) remainder 1
- \(127 \div 2 = 63\) remainder 1
- \(63 \div 2 = 31\) remainder 1
- \(31 \div 2 = 15\) remainder 1
- \(15 \div 2 = 7\) remainder 1
- \(7 \div 2 = 3\) remainder 1
- \(3 \div 2 = 1\) remainder 1
- \(1 \div 2 = 0\) remainder 1

**Step 2: Write the remainders in reverse order.**

The binary representation of 255 is \(11111111_2\).

### Problem 3: Sum of Digits of 255

**Step 1: Add the digits of 255.**

- \(2 + 5 + 5 = 12\)

**Conclusion:**

The sum of the digits of 255 is 12.

### Final Answer

Since the original problem is unspecified, I've demonstrated solving three different types of problems involving the number 255:

1. Prime Factorization: \(3 \times 5 \times 17\)
2. Binary Representation: \(11111111_2\)
3. Sum of Digits: 12

If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can address it directly.
