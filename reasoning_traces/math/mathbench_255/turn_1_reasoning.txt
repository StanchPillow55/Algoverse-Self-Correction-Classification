==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 255," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 255" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. Therefore, I will assume that the problem number refers to a specific math problem that might involve basic arithmetic, algebra, or another mathematical concept. 

Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's consider a hypothetical math problem involving the number 255, such as finding its prime factorization. This is a common type of problem that involves breaking down a number into its prime factors.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We are tasked with finding the prime factorization of the number 255. Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of its prime numbers.

2. **Check for Divisibility:**
   - **Divisibility by 2:** The number 255 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - **Divisibility by 3:** To check if 255 is divisible by 3, sum the digits of 255: \(2 + 5 + 5 = 12\). Since 12 is divisible by 3, 255 is also divisible by 3.

3. **Divide by 3:**
   \[
   255 \div 3 = 85
   \]
   So, one of the prime factors is 3, and we are left with 85.

4. **Factor 85:**
   - **Divisibility by 2:** 85 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - **Divisibility by 3:** The sum of the digits of 85 is \(8 + 5 = 13\), which is not divisible by 3.
   - **Divisibility by 5:** The last digit of 85 is 5, so it is divisible by 5.

5. **Divide by 5:**
   \[
   85 \div 5 = 17
   \]
   So, another prime factor is 5, and we are left with 17.

6. **Check 17:**
   17 is a prime number, so it cannot be factored further.

7. **Compile the Prime Factors:**
   The prime factorization of 255 is the product of the prime numbers we found: \(3 \times 5 \times 17\).

### Final Answer:
The prime factorization of 255 is \(3 \times 5 \times 17\).

This completes the solution to the assumed problem involving the number 255. If the original problem was different, please provide more details or clarify the problem statement.
