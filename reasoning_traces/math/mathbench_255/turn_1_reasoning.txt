Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 255" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 255" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. However, without additional context or details about what "Sample math problem 255" entails, I cannot solve it directly.

Instead, let's consider a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 255" and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 255.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of all integers from 1 to 255. This is an arithmetic series where the first term \( a = 1 \) and the last term \( l = 255 \).

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a \) is the first term, and \( l \) is the last term.

3. **Calculate the Number of Terms:**
   Since we are summing from 1 to 255, the number of terms \( n \) is 255.

4. **Apply the Formula:**
   Substitute the values into the formula:
   \[
   S_{255} = \frac{255}{2} \times (1 + 255)
   \]

5. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - Calculate \( 1 + 255 = 256 \).
   - Calculate \( \frac{255}{2} = 127.5 \).
   - Multiply \( 127.5 \times 256 \).

6. **Final Calculation:**
   \[
   127.5 \times 256 = 32640
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of all integers from 1 to 255 is 32,640.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all integers from 1 to 255 is 32,640.
