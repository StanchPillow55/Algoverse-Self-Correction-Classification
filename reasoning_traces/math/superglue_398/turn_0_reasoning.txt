==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 398" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company has a budget of $400 for production costs. If the company wants to produce a total of 60 widgets, how many of each type should they produce to maximize the number of Type A widgets?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of widgets produced is 60:  
     \[
     x + y = 60
     \]
   - The total production cost should not exceed $400:  
     \[
     5x + 8y \leq 400
     \]

3. **Objective:**
   - Maximize the number of Type A widgets, \( x \).

4. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - From the first equation, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):  
     \[
     y = 60 - x
     \]
   - Substitute \( y = 60 - x \) into the cost inequality:  
     \[
     5x + 8(60 - x) \leq 400
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):  
     \[
     5x + 480 - 8x \leq 400
     \]
     \[
     -3x + 480 \leq 400
     \]
     \[
     -3x \leq 400 - 480
     \]
     \[
     -3x \leq -80
     \]
     \[
     x \geq \frac{-80}{-3}
     \]
     \[
     x \geq \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67
     \]

5. **Determine Integer Solutions:**
   - Since \( x \) must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than or equal to 26.67 is 27.

6. **Calculate \( y \):**
   - Substitute \( x = 27 \) back into the equation for \( y \):  
     \[
     y = 60 - 27 = 33
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the cost constraint:  
     \[
     5(27) + 8(33) = 135 + 264 = 399
     \]
   - The total cost is $399, which is within the budget of $400.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The company should produce 27 Type A widgets and 33 Type B widgets to maximize the number of Type A widgets while staying within budget.

**Final Answer:**  
The company should produce 27 Type A widgets and 33 Type B widgets.
