Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 398" might entail. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires a structured approach to solve. Let's break down the process of solving a generic math problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume it's a typical math problem involving algebra, geometry, or arithmetic. For demonstration purposes, let's consider a simple algebraic problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step 2: Identify What is Being Asked
We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

### Step 3: Plan a Solution
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. This involves basic algebraic manipulation.

### Step 4: Execute the Plan
Let's solve the equation step by step:

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides**:  
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2** to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
\[
11 = 11
\]

The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that our solution is correct.

### Step 6: State the Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

In conclusion, by following a structured approach to problem-solving, we have determined that the value of \( x \) that satisfies the given equation is \( x = 4 \).
