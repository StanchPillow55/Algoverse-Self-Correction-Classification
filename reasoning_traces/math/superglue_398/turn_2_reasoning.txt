Question ID: superglue_398
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 398" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume this is a hypothetical reasoning problem that requires a structured approach to solve. Let's break down a generic reasoning problem-solving process:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Identify the Problem Type**: Is it a mathematical problem, a logical puzzle, or a word problem?
- **Extract Key Information**: What are the given data points, and what is being asked?

### Step 2: Develop a Strategy
- **Choose a Method**: Depending on the problem type, decide whether to use algebra, geometry, logical deduction, etc.
- **Plan the Steps**: Outline the steps needed to solve the problem.

### Step 3: Execute the Plan
- **Perform Calculations**: Carry out any necessary calculations or logical deductions.
- **Check Each Step**: Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one.

### Step 4: Review and Conclude
- **Verify the Solution**: Double-check calculations and logic.
- **State the Final Answer**: Clearly present the solution.

Since "Sample reasoning question 398" is not a specific problem, let's create a hypothetical example to illustrate the process:

### Hypothetical Problem Example:
**Problem Statement**: A farmer has 398 apples. He wants to distribute them equally among his 7 children. How many apples will each child receive, and how many apples will be left over?

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Given**: 398 apples, 7 children.
- **Asked**: Apples per child and remainder.

#### Step 2: Develop a Strategy
- **Method**: Use division to find how many apples each child receives and the remainder.

#### Step 3: Execute the Plan
- **Perform Division**: Divide 398 by 7.
  \[
  398 \div 7 = 56 \text{ R } 6
  \]
  - **Calculation**: 
    - 7 goes into 39 five times (since \(7 \times 5 = 35\)), leaving a remainder of 4.
    - Bring down the 8 to make 48.
    - 7 goes into 48 six times (since \(7 \times 6 = 42\)), leaving a remainder of 6.

#### Step 4: Review and Conclude
- **Verify**: 
  - \(7 \times 56 = 392\)
  - \(398 - 392 = 6\)
- **Final Answer**: Each child receives 56 apples, and there are 6 apples left over.

This structured approach ensures that we thoroughly understand and solve the problem, even if the original "Sample reasoning question 398" was not explicitly defined.
