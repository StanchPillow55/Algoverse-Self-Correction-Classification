==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pages Nico read on Wednesday. We are given the following information:

1. On Monday, Nico reads the first book which has 20 pages.
2. On Tuesday, Nico reads the second book which has 12 pages.
3. From Monday to Wednesday, Nico reads a total of 51 pages.

We need to find out how many pages Nico read on Wednesday.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of pages read on Monday and Tuesday:**

   - Pages read on Monday = 20 pages
   - Pages read on Tuesday = 12 pages

   Total pages read on Monday and Tuesday = 20 pages + 12 pages = 32 pages

2. **Determine the number of pages read on Wednesday:**

   We know that the total number of pages read from Monday to Wednesday is 51 pages. Therefore, the number of pages read on Wednesday can be calculated by subtracting the total pages read on Monday and Tuesday from the total pages read from Monday to Wednesday.

   Pages read on Wednesday = Total pages read from Monday to Wednesday - Total pages read on Monday and Tuesday

   Pages read on Wednesday = 51 pages - 32 pages = 19 pages

Therefore, Nico read 19 pages on Wednesday.

**Final Answer: Nico read 19 pages on Wednesday.**
