To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the problem using algebra.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land. This means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left, since:

\[
1 - \frac{3}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

We know that the amount of land he has left is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \) to isolate \( x \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

Thus, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first is:

\[
\boxed{32} \text{ hectares}
\]

To verify, we can check our work:

1. If Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares initially, then the amount he sold is:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 32 = 19.2 \text{ hectares}
\]

2. The amount of land left would be:

\[
32 - 19.2 = 12.8 \text{ hectares}
\]

This matches the information given in the problem, confirming that our solution is correct. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{32} \text{ hectares}
\]
