To find out how many pages Nico read on Wednesday, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total pages read from Monday to Wednesday**: According to the problem, Nico has read a total of 51 pages from Monday to Wednesday.

2. **Determine the pages read on Monday and Tuesday**:
   - On Monday, Nico read 20 pages from the first book.
   - On Tuesday, he read 12 pages from the second book.

3. **Calculate the total pages read on Monday and Tuesday**:
   \[
   \text{Total pages read on Monday and Tuesday} = \text{Pages on Monday} + \text{Pages on Tuesday}
   \]
   \[
   = 20 + 12 = 32 \text{ pages}
   \]

4. **Calculate the pages read on Wednesday**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pages Nico read on Wednesday. According to the problem, the total pages read from Monday to Wednesday is 51 pages. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Total pages read} = \text{Pages on Monday} + \text{Pages on Tuesday} + \text{Pages on Wednesday}
   \]
   \[
   51 = 20 + 12 + x
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation**:
   \[
   51 = 32 + x
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x = 51 - 32
   \]
   \[
   x = 19
   \]

Thus, the number of pages Nico read on Wednesday is \( \boxed{19} \).
