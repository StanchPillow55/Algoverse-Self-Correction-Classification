==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given and then solve for the unknown.

Let's define the variable:
- Let \( B \) represent the square footage of Benedict's house.

According to the problem, Kennedy's house is 600 square feet larger than 4 times the size of Benedict's house. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[
K = 4B + 600
\]

where \( K \) is the square footage of Kennedy's house. We are given that Kennedy's house is 10,000 square feet, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[
10000 = 4B + 600
\]

Now, we need to solve for \( B \). Start by isolating the term with \( B \) on one side of the equation:

1. Subtract 600 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the right side:

\[
10000 - 600 = 4B
\]

\[
9400 = 4B
\]

2. Next, divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for \( B \):

\[
B = \frac{9400}{4}
\]

3. Perform the division:

\[
B = 2350
\]

Thus, the square footage of Benedict's house is 2,350 square feet.

Final Answer:
Benedict's house is 2,350 square feet.
