Question ID: 135
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.

1. **Identify the variables**:
   - Let \( B \) represent the size of Benedict's house in square feet.
   - We know that Kennedy's house is 600 square feet larger than 4 times the size of Benedict's house.

2. **Set up the equation**:
   - According to the problem, Kennedy's house size can be expressed as:
     \[
     K = 4B + 600
     \]
   - We are also given that Kennedy's house is 10,000 square feet:
     \[
     K = 10000
     \]

3. **Substitute the value of \( K \) into the equation**:
   \[
   10000 = 4B + 600
   \]

4. **Solve for \( B \)**:
   - First, we will isolate the term involving \( B \) by subtracting 600 from both sides:
     \[
     10000 - 600 = 4B
     \]
     \[
     9400 = 4B
     \]
   - Next, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{9400}{4}
     \]
     \[
     B = 2350
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - The size of Benedict's house is \( \boxed{2350} \) square feet. 

This completes the problem, and we have shown all calculations and reasoning step by step.
