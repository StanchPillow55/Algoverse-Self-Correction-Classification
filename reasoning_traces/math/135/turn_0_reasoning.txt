==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many video games Bobby has based on the information given about Brian's video games.

1. **Identify the number of video games Brian has**: 
   - The problem states that Brian has 20 video games but lost 5 before the comparison was made. 
   - Therefore, we need to calculate how many video games Brian currently has:
     \[
     \text{Brian's current video games} = 20 - 5 = 15
     \]

2. **Determine the relationship between Bobby's and Brian's video games**:
   - According to the problem, Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian.
   - We can express this relationship mathematically:
     \[
     \text{Bobby's video games} = 3 \times \text{Brian's current video games} - 5
     \]

3. **Substitute Brian's current video games into the equation**:
   - We already calculated that Brian has 15 video games. Now we substitute this value into the equation for Bobby's video games:
     \[
     \text{Bobby's video games} = 3 \times 15 - 5
     \]

4. **Perform the calculations**:
   - First, calculate \(3 \times 15\):
     \[
     3 \times 15 = 45
     \]
   - Next, subtract 5 from 45:
     \[
     45 - 5 = 40
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games.

The final answer is:
\[
\text{Bobby has } 40 \text{ video games.}
\]
