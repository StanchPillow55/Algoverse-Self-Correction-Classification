Question ID: 135
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to establish a relationship between the sizes of Kennedy's house and Benedict's house using the information given.

Let's define:
- \( K \) as the size of Kennedy's house in square feet.
- \( B \) as the size of Benedict's house in square feet.

From the problem, we know:
1. Kennedy's house is 600 square feet larger than 4 times Benedict's house.
2. Kennedy's house is 10,000 square feet.

We can translate the first statement into an equation:
\[ K = 4B + 600 \]

We also know from the second statement:
\[ K = 10,000 \]

Now, we can substitute the value of \( K \) from the second statement into the equation from the first statement:
\[ 10,000 = 4B + 600 \]

To find \( B \), we need to solve this equation for \( B \).

First, subtract 600 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 10,000 - 600 = 4B \]
\[ 9,400 = 4B \]

Next, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{9,400}{4} \]

Perform the division:
\[ B = 2,350 \]

Therefore, the size of Benedict's house is 2,350 square feet.

Final Answer:
Benedict's house is 2,350 square feet.
