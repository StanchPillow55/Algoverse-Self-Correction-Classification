==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to establish a relationship between the sizes of Kennedy's house and Benedict's house using the information given.

Let's define:
- \( K \) as the size of Kennedy's house in square feet.
- \( B \) as the size of Benedict's house in square feet.

According to the problem, Kennedy's house is 600 square feet larger than 4 times the size of Benedict's house. This relationship can be expressed as an equation:

\[ K = 4B + 600 \]

We are also given that Kennedy's house is 10,000 square feet. Therefore, we can substitute \( K \) with 10,000 in the equation:

\[ 10000 = 4B + 600 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( B \), the size of Benedict's house.

1. Start by isolating the term with \( B \) on one side of the equation. Subtract 600 from both sides:

   \[ 10000 - 600 = 4B \]

   \[ 9400 = 4B \]

2. Next, solve for \( B \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:

   \[ B = \frac{9400}{4} \]

3. Perform the division:

   \[ B = 2350 \]

Therefore, the size of Benedict's house is 2,350 square feet.

Final Answer:
Benedict's house is 2,350 square feet.
