To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total distance Bobby traveled and then determine the rate of gasoline consumption in miles per gallon.

1. **Calculate the distance to the supermarket and back:**
   - Distance to the supermarket: 5 miles
   - Distance back home: 5 miles
   - Total distance for this trip: 
     \[
     5 \text{ miles} + 5 \text{ miles} = 10 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance to the farm and back home:**
   - Distance to the farm: 6 miles
   - Bobby drove 2 miles towards the farm before turning around, so he traveled:
     - Distance to the point where he turned around: 2 miles
     - Distance back home from that point: 2 miles
   - After retrieving the tools, he then drove the full distance to the farm: 6 miles
   - Total distance for this trip:
     \[
     2 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 10 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance from the supermarket trip: 10 miles
   - Total distance from the farm trip: 10 miles
   - Overall total distance:
     \[
     10 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 20 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Calculate the amount of gasoline used:**
   - Bobby started with 12 gallons of gasoline and has 2 gallons left.
   - Therefore, the amount of gasoline used is:
     \[
     12 \text{ gallons} - 2 \text{ gallons} = 10 \text{ gallons}
     \]

5. **Calculate the rate of gasoline consumption:**
   - The rate of gasoline consumption in miles per gallon is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total gallons of gasoline used:
     \[
     \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Gasoline used}} = \frac{20 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ gallons}} = 2 \text{ miles per gallon}
     \]

Thus, the rate at which Bobby's truck has been consuming gasoline is \( \boxed{2} \) miles per gallon.
