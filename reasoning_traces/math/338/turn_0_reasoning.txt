==================================================

Let the number of students in each of the two equal groups be denoted as \( x \). Since the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups, we can denote the number of students in the smallest group as \( x - 10 \).

According to the problem, the total number of students in all three groups is 200. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + x + (x - 10) = 200
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x + (x - 10) = 200
\]

Combining like terms gives:

\[
3x - 10 = 200
\]

Next, we will isolate \( x \) by adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[
3x = 210
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 70
\]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

\[
\text{Number of students in the smallest group} = x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60
\]

To ensure our solution is correct, we can verify the total number of students:

- Number of students in the first group: \( 70 \)
- Number of students in the second group: \( 70 \)
- Number of students in the smallest group: \( 60 \)

Adding these together:

\[
70 + 70 + 60 = 200
\]

Since the total is indeed 200, our calculations are correct.

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]
