Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which Bobby's truck consumes gasoline in miles per gallon. We know the following:

1. Bobby started with 12 gallons of gasoline.
2. After all his trips, he has 2 gallons left.
3. Therefore, he used \(12 - 2 = 10\) gallons of gasoline.

Next, we need to calculate the total distance Bobby traveled:

1. **Trip to the supermarket and back:**
   - The supermarket is 5 miles away.
   - The round trip distance is \(5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Trip towards the farm and back home:**
   - He initially drove 2 miles towards the farm.
   - Then he turned around and drove 2 miles back home.
   - This round trip is \(2 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 4 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Trip to the farm:**
   - The farm is 6 miles away.
   - He drove directly to the farm from home, which is 6 miles.

Now, let's add up all the distances:

- Supermarket round trip: 10 miles
- Partial farm trip and return: 4 miles
- Final trip to the farm: 6 miles

Total distance traveled = \(10 + 4 + 6 = 20\) miles.

Now, we know Bobby used 10 gallons of gasoline to travel 20 miles. Therefore, the rate of gasoline consumption is:

\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Total distance traveled}}{\text{Total gallons used}} = \frac{20 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ gallons}} = 2 \text{ miles per gallon}
\]

Thus, the truck has been consuming gasoline at a rate of 2 miles per gallon.

**Final Answer: 2 miles per gallon**
