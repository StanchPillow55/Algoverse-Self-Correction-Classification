==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cookies Ann keeps after baking and giving away a certain number of each type of cookie. We'll break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Cookies Baked

1. **Oatmeal Raisin Cookies:**
   - Ann bakes three dozen oatmeal raisin cookies.
   - Since one dozen equals 12 cookies, three dozen is calculated as:
     \[
     3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ oatmeal raisin cookies}
     \]

2. **Sugar Cookies:**
   - Ann bakes two dozen sugar cookies.
   - Two dozen is calculated as:
     \[
     2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ sugar cookies}
     \]

3. **Chocolate Chip Cookies:**
   - Ann bakes four dozen chocolate chip cookies.
   - Four dozen is calculated as:
     \[
     4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ chocolate chip cookies}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Number of Cookies Given Away

1. **Oatmeal Raisin Cookies Given Away:**
   - Ann gives away two dozen oatmeal raisin cookies.
   - Two dozen is:
     \[
     2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ oatmeal raisin cookies given away}
     \]

2. **Sugar Cookies Given Away:**
   - Ann gives away 1.5 dozen sugar cookies.
   - 1.5 dozen is:
     \[
     1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ sugar cookies given away}
     \]

3. **Chocolate Chip Cookies Given Away:**
   - Ann gives away 2.5 dozen chocolate chip cookies.
   - 2.5 dozen is:
     \[
     2.5 \times 12 = 30 \text{ chocolate chip cookies given away}
     \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Cookies Ann Keeps

1. **Oatmeal Raisin Cookies Kept:**
   - Total baked: 36
   - Total given away: 24
   - Cookies kept:
     \[
     36 - 24 = 12 \text{ oatmeal raisin cookies kept}
     \]

2. **Sugar Cookies Kept:**
   - Total baked: 24
   - Total given away: 18
   - Cookies kept:
     \[
     24 - 18 = 6 \text{ sugar cookies kept}
     \]

3. **Chocolate Chip Cookies Kept:**
   - Total baked: 48
   - Total given away: 30
   - Cookies kept:
     \[
     48 - 30 = 18 \text{ chocolate chip cookies kept}
     \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Cookies Kept

Finally, we sum up all the cookies Ann keeps:
\[
12 \text{ (oatmeal raisin)} + 6 \text{ (sugar)} + 18 \text{ (chocolate chip)} = 36 \text{ cookies kept}
\]

### Final Answer

Ann keeps a total of 36 cookies.
