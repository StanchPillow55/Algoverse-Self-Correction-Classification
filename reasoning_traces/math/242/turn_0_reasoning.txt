To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of cookies Ann bakes, then determine how many cookies she gives away, and finally subtract the number of cookies given away from the total she baked to find out how many cookies she keeps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies baked.**

- Oatmeal raisin cookies: Ann bakes 3 dozen.
- Sugar cookies: Ann bakes 2 dozen.
- Chocolate chip cookies: Ann bakes 4 dozen.

First, we convert the dozens into individual cookies. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we perform the following calculations:

- Oatmeal raisin cookies: 
  \[
  3 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ cookies/dozen} = 36 \text{ cookies}
  \]

- Sugar cookies: 
  \[
  2 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ cookies/dozen} = 24 \text{ cookies}
  \]

- Chocolate chip cookies: 
  \[
  4 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ cookies/dozen} = 48 \text{ cookies}
  \]

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total number of cookies baked:

\[
36 \text{ (oatmeal raisin)} + 24 \text{ (sugar)} + 48 \text{ (chocolate chip)} = 108 \text{ cookies}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of cookies given away.**

Next, we calculate how many cookies Ann gives away:

- Oatmeal raisin cookies: She gives away 2 dozen.
- Sugar cookies: She gives away 1.5 dozen.
- Chocolate chip cookies: She gives away 2.5 dozen.

Again, we convert these dozens into individual cookies:

- Oatmeal raisin cookies given away:
  \[
  2 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ cookies/dozen} = 24 \text{ cookies}
  \]

- Sugar cookies given away:
  \[
  1.5 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ cookies/dozen} = 18 \text{ cookies}
  \]

- Chocolate chip cookies given away:
  \[
  2.5 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ cookies/dozen} = 30 \text{ cookies}
  \]

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total number of cookies given away:

\[
24 \text{ (oatmeal raisin)} + 18 \text{ (sugar)} + 30 \text{ (chocolate chip)} = 72 \text{ cookies}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of cookies kept.**

Finally, we subtract the total number of cookies given away from the total number of cookies baked:

\[
108 \text{ (total baked)} - 72 \text{ (total given away)} = 36 \text{ cookies}
\]

Thus, the total number of cookies Ann keeps is:

\[
\boxed{36}
\]
