To determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of pen pals Mike has after stopping correspondence with some:**
   - Initially, Mike had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - Therefore, the number of pen pals he continues to correspond with is:
     \[
     5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of letters sent to Mike each week:**
   - Each of the 3 remaining pen pals sends 2 letters per week.
   - Thus, the total number of letters Mike receives per week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters/pen pal} = 6 \text{ letters}
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of pages in the letters Mike receives:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages Mike receives per week is:
     \[
     6 \text{ letters} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 30 \text{ pages}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of pages Mike writes in response:**
   - Mike responds in kind, meaning he writes the same number of pages he receives.
   - Thus, he writes 30 pages in response each week.

5. **Determine how long it takes Mike to write one page:**
   - Mike can write a page in 6 minutes.

6. **Calculate the total time Mike spends writing 30 pages:**
   - The total time in minutes to write 30 pages is:
     \[
     30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]

7. **Convert the total writing time from minutes to hours:**
   - To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
     \[
     \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

Finally, the total time Mike spends writing letters each week is:
\[
\boxed{3} \text{ hours}
\]
