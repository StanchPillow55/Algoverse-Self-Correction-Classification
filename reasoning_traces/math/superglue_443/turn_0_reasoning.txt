==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 443" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $50, and the profit from each unit of product B is $70. The company can produce a maximum of 300 units of product A and 200 units of product B per month. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 400 units per month. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we will use linear programming, a method to achieve the best outcome in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - We want to maximize the profit, \( P \), which is given by the profit per unit times the number of units:
   \[
   P = 50x + 70y
   \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production of product A cannot exceed 300 units:
   \[
   x \leq 300
   \]
   - The production of product B cannot exceed 200 units:
   \[
   y \leq 200
   \]
   - The total production cannot exceed 400 units:
   \[
   x + y \leq 400
   \]
   - Non-negativity constraints (you cannot produce a negative number of units):
   \[
   x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
   \]

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is the area where all these constraints overlap.

5. **Find the Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are found by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraints:
     - Intersection of \( x = 300 \) and \( x + y = 400 \):
       \[
       x = 300, \quad y = 400 - 300 = 100 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (300, 100)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( y = 200 \) and \( x + y = 400 \):
       \[
       y = 200, \quad x = 400 - 200 = 200 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (200, 200)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( x + y = 400 \):
       \[
       x = 0, \quad y = 400 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (0, 400)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( y = 0 \) and \( x + y = 400 \):
       \[
       y = 0, \quad x = 400 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (400, 0)
       \]

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(300, 100) = 50(300) + 70(100) = 15000 + 7000 = 22000 \)
   - \( P(200, 200) = 50(200) + 70(200) = 10000 + 14000 = 24000 \)
   - \( P(0, 400) = 50(0) + 70(400) = 0 + 28000 = 28000 \)
   - \( P(400, 0) = 50(400) + 70(0) = 20000 + 0 = 20000 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the point \( (0, 400) \) with a profit of $28,000.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 0 units of product A and 400 units of product B, resulting in a maximum profit of $28,000.
