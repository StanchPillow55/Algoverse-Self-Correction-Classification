==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what is being asked. The question provided is "Sample reasoning question 443," which doesn't specify a particular mathematical problem or context. However, I will assume that this is a placeholder for a typical math problem, and I'll create a sample problem to solve.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. Each Type A widget requires 2 hours of labor and 3 units of material, while each Type B widget requires 1 hour of labor and 4 units of material. The company has a maximum of 100 hours of labor and 120 units of material available. If the profit from each Type A widget is $5 and from each Type B widget is $4, how many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we will use linear programming. We need to define our variables, constraints, and objective function.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - We want to maximize the profit, \( P \).
   - Profit from Type A widgets = \( 5x \).
   - Profit from Type B widgets = \( 4y \).
   - Thus, the objective function is: 
     \[
     P = 5x + 4y
     \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - Labor constraint: \( 2x + y \leq 100 \) (since each Type A widget requires 2 hours and each Type B widget requires 1 hour).
   - Material constraint: \( 3x + 4y \leq 120 \) (since each Type A widget requires 3 units of material and each Type B widget requires 4 units).
   - Non-negativity constraints: \( x \geq 0 \) and \( y \geq 0 \).

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The line \( 2x + y = 100 \) intersects the axes at \( (50, 0) \) and \( (0, 100) \).
   - The line \( 3x + 4y = 120 \) intersects the axes at \( (40, 0) \) and \( (0, 30) \).
   - The feasible region is bounded by these lines and the axes.

5. **Find the Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are where the lines intersect each other and the axes.
   - Solve the system of equations to find the intersection of \( 2x + y = 100 \) and \( 3x + 4y = 120 \):
     \[
     2x + y = 100 \quad \text{(1)}
     \]
     \[
     3x + 4y = 120 \quad \text{(2)}
     \]
     Multiply equation (1) by 4:
     \[
     8x + 4y = 400
     \]
     Subtract equation (2) from this result:
     \[
     8x + 4y - 3x - 4y = 400 - 120
     \]
     \[
     5x = 280 \Rightarrow x = 56
     \]
     Substitute \( x = 56 \) back into equation (1):
     \[
     2(56) + y = 100 \Rightarrow 112 + y = 100 \Rightarrow y = -12
     \]
     Since \( y \) cannot be negative, this point is not feasible.

   - Check the intersections with the axes:
     - \( (0, 0) \)
     - \( (50, 0) \)
     - \( (0, 30) \)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Feasible Corner Point:**
   - \( P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 4(0) = 0 \)
   - \( P(50, 0) = 5(50) + 4(0) = 250 \)
   - \( P(0, 30) = 5(0) + 4(30) = 120 \)

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum profit is $250, achieved by producing 50 Type A widgets and 0 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 50 Type A widgets and 0 Type B widgets to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $250.
