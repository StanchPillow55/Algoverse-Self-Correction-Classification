To determine how much Ella would earn after 12 hours of dog walking, we first need to find her hourly rate based on the information given.

1. **Calculate the hourly rate:**
   Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of work. To find her hourly rate, we divide her total earnings by the number of hours she worked.

   \[
   \text{Hourly Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{\text{Total Hours}} = \frac{33}{3}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \text{Hourly Rate} = 11
   \]

   So, Ella earns $11 per hour.

2. **Calculate earnings for 12 hours:**
   Now that we know her hourly rate, we can calculate how much she would earn for 12 hours of dog walking. We multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she plans to work.

   \[
   \text{Earnings for 12 hours} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Number of Hours} = 11 \times 12
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 132
   \]

Thus, Ella would earn $132 after walking dogs for 12 hours.

**Final Answer:**
Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking.
