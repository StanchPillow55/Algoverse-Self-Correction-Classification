==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much James pays for hiring the horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, taking into account the free hour and the cost structure.

1. **Determine the total time hired**: 
   James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM. 
   \[
   9 \text{ PM} - 5 \text{ PM} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Account for the free hour**: 
   James gets 1 hour free. Therefore, we subtract this free hour from the total hours hired.
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} - 1 \text{ free hour} = 3 \text{ paid hours}
   \]

3. **Understand the cost structure**: 
   - The first paid hour costs $15.
   - Each hour after the first paid hour costs twice the first hour's rate. Therefore, the cost for the second hour is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - The cost for the third hour is also:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost**: 
   Now we can calculate the total cost for the 3 paid hours:
   - First hour: $15
   - Second hour: $30
   - Third hour: $30

   Adding these amounts together:
   \[
   15 + 30 + 30 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total amount James paid for hiring the horse-drawn carriage is:
   \[
   \boxed{75} \text{ dollars}
   \]
