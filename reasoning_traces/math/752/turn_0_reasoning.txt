==================================================

To determine how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the monthly share for each roommate**:
   The total electricity bill each month is $100. Since there are 5 people (Jenna and her 4 roommates), we need to divide the total bill by the number of people.

   \[
   \text{Monthly share per roommate} = \frac{\text{Total bill}}{\text{Number of roommates}} = \frac{100}{5} = 20
   \]

   So, each roommate pays $20 per month.

2. **Calculate the annual share for each roommate**:
   Since there are 12 months in a year, we need to multiply the monthly share by 12 to find out how much each roommate pays in a year.

   \[
   \text{Annual share per roommate} = \text{Monthly share} \times 12 = 20 \times 12 = 240
   \]

Thus, each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity.

3. **Final answer**:
Each roommate will pay **$240 per year** for electricity.
