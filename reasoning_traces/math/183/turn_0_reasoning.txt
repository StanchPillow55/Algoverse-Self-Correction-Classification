==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many birds of each type are lost over the course of a week and then subtract these losses from the initial counts.

**Step 1: Determine the daily loss of each type of bird.**

- Chickens: The farm loses 20 chickens per day.
- Turkeys: The farm loses 8 turkeys per day.
- Guinea fowls: The farm loses 5 guinea fowls per day.

**Step 2: Calculate the total loss over a week (7 days) for each type of bird.**

- Chickens: 
  \[
  \text{Total loss of chickens in a week} = 20 \text{ chickens/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 140 \text{ chickens}
  \]

- Turkeys:
  \[
  \text{Total loss of turkeys in a week} = 8 \text{ turkeys/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ turkeys}
  \]

- Guinea fowls:
  \[
  \text{Total loss of guinea fowls in a week} = 5 \text{ guinea fowls/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 35 \text{ guinea fowls}
  \]

**Step 3: Subtract the total loss from the initial count for each type of bird.**

- Chickens:
  \[
  \text{Remaining chickens} = 300 \text{ initial chickens} - 140 \text{ lost chickens} = 160 \text{ chickens}
  \]

- Turkeys:
  \[
  \text{Remaining turkeys} = 200 \text{ initial turkeys} - 56 \text{ lost turkeys} = 144 \text{ turkeys}
  \]

- Guinea fowls:
  \[
  \text{Remaining guinea fowls} = 80 \text{ initial guinea fowls} - 35 \text{ lost guinea fowls} = 45 \text{ guinea fowls}
  \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of birds remaining on the farm.**

Add the remaining birds of each type:
\[
\text{Total remaining birds} = 160 \text{ chickens} + 144 \text{ turkeys} + 45 \text{ guinea fowls} = 349 \text{ birds}
\]

**Final Answer:**

After a week, there will be 349 birds left in the poultry farm.
