To determine how many birds will be left on the poultry farm after one week, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial number of each type of bird:**
   - Chickens: 300
   - Turkeys: 200
   - Guinea fowls: 80

2. **Identify the daily loss of each type of bird:**
   - Chickens lost per day: 20
   - Turkeys lost per day: 8
   - Guinea fowls lost per day: 5

3. **Calculate the total loss for each type of bird over one week (7 days):**
   - Total loss of chickens in one week:
     \[
     \text{Total loss of chickens} = 20 \text{ chickens/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 140 \text{ chickens}
     \]
   - Total loss of turkeys in one week:
     \[
     \text{Total loss of turkeys} = 8 \text{ turkeys/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ turkeys}
     \]
   - Total loss of guinea fowls in one week:
     \[
     \text{Total loss of guinea fowls} = 5 \text{ guinea fowls/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 35 \text{ guinea fowls}
     \]

4. **Calculate the remaining number of each type of bird after one week:**
   - Remaining chickens:
     \[
     \text{Remaining chickens} = 300 - 140 = 160
     \]
   - Remaining turkeys:
     \[
     \text{Remaining turkeys} = 200 - 56 = 144
     \]
   - Remaining guinea fowls:
     \[
     \text{Remaining guinea fowls} = 80 - 35 = 45
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of birds left on the farm:**
   \[
   \text{Total remaining birds} = \text{Remaining chickens} + \text{Remaining turkeys} + \text{Remaining guinea fowls}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total remaining birds} = 160 + 144 + 45 = 349
   \]

Thus, after one week, the total number of birds left on the poultry farm is **349**. 

Final answer: **349 birds**.
