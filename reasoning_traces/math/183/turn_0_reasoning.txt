To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference in their times.

### Step 1: Calculate the total time for the well-rounded team.

The well-rounded team has each of its four members running their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds. Therefore, the total time for this team can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total time for well-rounded team} = 4 \times 55 \text{ seconds}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team.

The first runner of the less well-rounded team runs their leg in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner runs 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. We can calculate the times for each runner as follows:

- **First runner:** 60 seconds
- **Second runner:** 60 seconds - 3 seconds = 57 seconds
- **Third runner:** 57 seconds - 3 seconds = 54 seconds
- **Fourth runner:** 54 seconds - 3 seconds = 51 seconds

Now, we can calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team:

\[
\text{Total time for less well-rounded team} = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

\[
60 + 57 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 54 = 171
\]
\[
171 + 51 = 222
\]

So, the total time for the less well-rounded team is:

\[
\text{Total time for less well-rounded team} = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in total times.

Now we can find out how many seconds the faster team (the well-rounded team) wins by:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total time for less well-rounded team} - \text{Total time for well-rounded team}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Difference} = 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Final Answer

The faster team wins by **2 seconds**.
