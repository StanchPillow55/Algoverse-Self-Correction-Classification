Question ID: 183
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team in the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference in their times to determine how many seconds the faster team wins by.

### Step 1: Calculate the total time for the well-rounded team.

The well-rounded team has each of its four members running their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds. 

Total time for the well-rounded team:
\[
\text{Total time} = 4 \times 55 \text{ seconds} = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team.

The first runner of the less well-rounded team runs their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. 

- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: \(60 - 3 = 57\) seconds
- Third runner: \(57 - 3 = 54\) seconds
- Fourth runner: \(54 - 3 = 51\) seconds

Now, we can calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team:
\[
\text{Total time} = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:
\[
60 + 57 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 54 = 171
\]
\[
171 + 51 = 222
\]

So, the total time for the less well-rounded team is:
\[
\text{Total time} = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the difference in times.

Now we need to find out how many seconds the faster team (the well-rounded team) wins by:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Time of less well-rounded team} - \text{Time of well-rounded team}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Final Answer

The faster team wins by **2 seconds**.
