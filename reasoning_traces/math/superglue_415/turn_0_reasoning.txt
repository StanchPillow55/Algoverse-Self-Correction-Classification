==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 415." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning problem by creating a sample question and solving it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such plots can the farmer create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters.
   - The total area of the field is calculated by multiplying the length and the width.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   \[
   \text{Total Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 100 \, \text{m} \times 60 \, \text{m} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
   \]

3. **Determine the Area of Each Plot:**
   - Each smaller plot has an area of 150 square meters.

4. **Calculate the Number of Plots:**
   - To find out how many 150 square meter plots can fit into the 6000 square meter field, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot.
   \[
   \text{Number of Plots} = \frac{\text{Total Area of the Field}}{\text{Area of One Plot}} = \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{150 \, \text{square meters}}
   \]

5. **Perform the Division:**
   \[
   \frac{6000}{150} = 40
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 150 square meters.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 smaller plots, each with an area of 150 square meters.
