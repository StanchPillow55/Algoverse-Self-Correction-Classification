==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I'll need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 415" as it seems to be a reference to a specific problem or exercise, possibly from a textbook or a set of problems. Without the actual content of the question, I can't provide a detailed solution or reasoning.

However, I can guide you on how to approach a typical math problem by following a structured problem-solving process:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully to understand what is being asked.
   - Identify the knowns (given data) and unknowns (what you need to find).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts or formulas that might be relevant.
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before and how they were approached.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all steps clearly.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - If possible, use a different method to confirm the result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, ensuring it is in the correct form and units.

If you can provide the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 415," I would be glad to work through it using the above approach.
