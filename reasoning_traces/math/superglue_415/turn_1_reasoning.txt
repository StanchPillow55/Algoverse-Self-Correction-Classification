Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 415" entails. Since the question is not explicitly stated, let's assume it involves a mathematical problem-solving scenario. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Suppose we have a sequence of numbers where each term is generated by the formula \( a_n = 3n + 2 \). We are tasked with finding the 415th term of this sequence.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula:**
   The given formula for the sequence is \( a_n = 3n + 2 \). This is a linear sequence where:
   - \( n \) is the position of the term in the sequence.
   - \( a_n \) is the value of the term at position \( n \).

2. **Identify the Term to Find:**
   We need to find the 415th term, which means we need to calculate \( a_{415} \).

3. **Substitute the Value of \( n \):**
   Substitute \( n = 415 \) into the formula:
   \[
   a_{415} = 3(415) + 2
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   Calculate \( 3 \times 415 \):
   \[
   3 \times 415 = 1245
   \]

5. **Add the Constant:**
   Add 2 to the result from the multiplication:
   \[
   1245 + 2 = 1247
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The 415th term of the sequence is 1247.

**Final Answer:**
The 415th term of the sequence \( a_n = 3n + 2 \) is 1247.
