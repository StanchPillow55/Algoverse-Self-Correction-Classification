Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of people Martin invited to his party by breaking down the information given and performing calculations step by step.

1. **Identify the number of people invited from each group:**

   - **Hometown:** Martin invited 5 people from his hometown.

   - **School:** Martin invited twice as many people from his school as from his hometown. Since he invited 5 people from his hometown, he invited \(2 \times 5 = 10\) people from his school.

   - **Sports Club:** Martin invited as many people from his sports club as the sum of people invited from his hometown and his school. The sum of people from his hometown and school is \(5 + 10 = 15\). Therefore, he invited 15 people from his sports club.

2. **Calculate the total number of people invited from these three groups:**

   The total number of people invited from his hometown, school, and sports club is:
   \[
   5 \, (\text{hometown}) + 10 \, (\text{school}) + 15 \, (\text{sports club}) = 30
   \]

3. **Determine the number of remaining invitations:**

   The remaining invitations represent 20% of the total number of people invited from the three groups above. To find this, we calculate 20% of 30:
   \[
   0.20 \times 30 = 6
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of people invited to the party:**

   The total number of people invited is the sum of the people from the three groups and the remaining invitations:
   \[
   30 \, (\text{from the three groups}) + 6 \, (\text{remaining invitations}) = 36
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people who can potentially come to the party Martin is organizing is \(\boxed{36}\).
