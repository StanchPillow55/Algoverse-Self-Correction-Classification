==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to determine how many beads each sister bought based on the number of packs they purchased and the number of beads in each pack.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought.**

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 beads. Therefore, we calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought as follows:

\[
\text{Total beads for Elizabeth} = (\text{Number of red packs} + \text{Number of clear packs}) \times \text{Beads per pack}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total beads for Elizabeth} = (1 + 2) \times 20 = 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ beads}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought.**

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Using the same calculation method:

\[
\text{Total beads for Margareth} = (\text{Number of blue packs} + \text{Number of red packs}) \times \text{Beads per pack}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total beads for Margareth} = (3 + 4) \times 20 = 7 \times 20 = 140 \text{ beads}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters.**

Now, we need to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other. We will subtract the total number of beads Elizabeth has from the total number of beads Margareth has:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total beads for Margareth} - \text{Total beads for Elizabeth}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Difference} = 140 - 60 = 80
\]

**Final Answer:**

Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.
