==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of people invited from each group**:
   - Martin invited 5 people from his hometown.
   - He invited twice as many people from his school, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) people.
   - The total number of people invited from his hometown and school is:
     \[
     5 + 10 = 15
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of people invited from the sports club**:
   - Martin invited as many people from his sports club as the sum of the people invited from his hometown and school. Therefore, he invited 15 people from his sports club.

3. **Calculate the total number of people invited so far**:
   - The total number of people invited from all three groups is:
     \[
     5 \text{ (hometown)} + 10 \text{ (school)} + 15 \text{ (sports club)} = 30
     \]

4. **Determine the remaining invitations**:
   - The remaining invitations represent 20% of the total number of people invited so far. Let \(x\) be the total number of people invited (which we already calculated as 30).
   - The remaining invitations can be calculated as:
     \[
     0.2 \times x = 0.2 \times 30 = 6
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of people who can potentially come to the party**:
   - The total number of people who can potentially come to the party is the sum of the people already invited and the remaining invitations:
     \[
     30 + 6 = 36
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that **36 people can potentially come to the party Martin is organizing**.
