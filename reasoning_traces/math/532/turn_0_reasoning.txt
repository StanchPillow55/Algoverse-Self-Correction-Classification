Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. Therefore, we can find his current age by subtracting 5 from 27:
   \[
   \text{Jame's current age} = 27 - 5 = 22
   \]

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   In 8 years, Jame's age will be:
   \[
   \text{Jame's age in 8 years} = 22 + 8 = 30
   \]

3. **Determine Jame's cousin's age in 8 years:**
   According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. We can express this mathematically:
   \[
   \text{Cousin's age in 8 years} = 2 \times \text{Jame's age in 8 years} - 5
   \]
   Substituting Jame's age in 8 years:
   \[
   \text{Cousin's age in 8 years} = 2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55
   \]

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   Since we know the cousin's age in 8 years is 55, we can find the cousin's current age by subtracting 8:
   \[
   \text{Cousin's current age} = 55 - 8 = 47
   \]

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   Now we can find the difference in their current ages:
   \[
   \text{Age difference} = \text{Cousin's current age} - \text{Jame's current age} = 47 - 22 = 25
   \]

Thus, the number of years that separate the ages of Jame and his cousin now is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]
