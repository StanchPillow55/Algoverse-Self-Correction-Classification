To solve the problem, we need to determine how many slices each person ate and then find the total number of slices they consumed.

1. **Understanding the problem**:
   - There are 4 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices.
   - Total slices of pizza = 4 pizzas Ã— 8 slices/pizza = 32 slices.
   - We know that:
     - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
     - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
     - Becky ate 10 slices.

2. **Setting up the equations**:
   - Let \( J \) represent the number of slices Jake ate.
   - According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake:
     \[
     B = J + 3
     \]
   - We also know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake:
     \[
     S = 2J
     \]
   - We are given that Becky ate 10 slices:
     \[
     B = 10
     \]

3. **Finding Jake's slices**:
   - From the equation \( B = J + 3 \), we can substitute \( B \) with 10:
     \[
     10 = J + 3
     \]
   - To find \( J \), we subtract 3 from both sides:
     \[
     J = 10 - 3 = 7
     \]

4. **Finding Silvia's slices**:
   - Now that we have \( J = 7 \), we can find how many slices Silvia ate using the equation \( S = 2J \):
     \[
     S = 2 \times 7 = 14
     \]

5. **Calculating the total slices eaten**:
   - Now we can find the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
     \[
     \text{Total slices} = B + J + S = 10 + 7 + 14
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     \text{Total slices} = 31
     \]

6. **Final answer**:
   - The total number of slices they ate is \( \boxed{31} \).
