==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 29" refers to. However, since no specific details or context about "Sample reasoning question 29" are provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem step by step. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field and also divide the field into two equal smaller rectangles by adding a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - We need to calculate the total length of the fence required to enclose the field and divide it into two equal parts.

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 + 60) = 2 \times 160 = 320 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Divide the Field into Two Equal Parts:**
   - To divide the field into two equal smaller rectangles, we add a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).
   - This additional fence will be equal to the length of the field, which is 100 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence:**
   - The total length of the fence required is the perimeter of the field plus the additional fence to divide the field:
     \[
     \text{Total length} = \text{Perimeter} + \text{Additional fence}
     \]
   - Substituting the calculated values:
     \[
     \text{Total length} = 320 + 100 = 420 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total length of the fence required is 420 meters.

By following these steps, I've demonstrated how to approach and solve a problem systematically. If you have a specific problem or context for "Sample reasoning question 29," please provide more details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
