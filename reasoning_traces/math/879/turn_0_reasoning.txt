==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break down the expenses that Iris incurred at the spa step by step.

1. **Cost of Hair**: 
   Iris spent $400 on her hair.

2. **Cost of Manicure**: 
   According to the problem, Iris spent 1/4 as much on her manicure as she did on her hair. 
   \[
   \text{Cost of Manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]

3. **Cost of Pedicure**: 
   The problem states that she spent 3/4 as much money on her pedicure as she did on her manicure. 
   \[
   \text{Cost of Pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

4. **Total Cost**: 
   Now, we will add up all the expenses to find the total amount Iris spent at the spa.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Hair} + \text{Cost of Manicure} + \text{Cost of Pedicure}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 400 + 100 + 75
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 575
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is \(\boxed{575}\).
