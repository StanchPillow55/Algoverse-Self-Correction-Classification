==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many shells each team found, starting with the total number of shells and the percentages given for the Alphas and The finders.

1. **Total shells discovered**: 
   \[
   \text{Total shells} = 700
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas**:
   Team Alphas found 40% of the total shells. We calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining shells after Alphas**:
   After team Alphas found their shells, we need to find out how many shells are left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining shells} = \text{Total shells} - \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 700 - 280 = 420
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders**:
   Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells. We calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining shells after The finders**:
   Now we need to find out how many shells are left after both teams Alphas and The finders have found their shells:
   \[
   \text{Remaining shells} = \text{Remaining shells after Alphas} - \text{Shells found by The finders} = 420 - 252 = 168
   \]

6. **Determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters**:
   The remaining shells are the ones found by team Gogetters. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 168
   \]

Finally, we summarize our findings:
- Team Alphas found 280 shells.
- Team The finders found 252 shells.
- Team Gogetters found 168 shells.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Team Gogetters found } 168 \text{ shells.}
\]
