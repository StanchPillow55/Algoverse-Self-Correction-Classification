==================================================

Certainly! Let's tackle this problem step by step. However, it seems like the problem statement "Sample reasoning question 298" is not providing specific details about the math problem we need to solve. For the sake of demonstration, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - We are given:
     - Base (\(b\)) = 10 units
     - Height (\(h\)) = 5 units

2. **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**
   - Using the formula for the area of a triangle:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

3. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

**Final Answer:**
The area of the triangle is 25 square units.
