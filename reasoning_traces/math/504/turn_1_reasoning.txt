Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the cost of one pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

Suzie bought:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum, costing \( 2x \).
- 1 pack of grape gum, costing $2.
- 1 small pack of green apple gum, costing half as much as the grape gum, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total cost of all the packs of gum:

\[
2x + 2 + 1 = 7
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
2x + 3 = 7
\]

Next, we subtract 3 from both sides:

\[
2x = 7 - 3
\]
\[
2x = 4
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{4}{2}
\]
\[
x = 2
\]

Thus, the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is \( \boxed{2} \) dollars.
