Let's denote the cost of one pack of strawberry gum as \( x \). 

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost for the strawberry gum is \( 2x \).
2. She bought 1 pack of grape gum for $2.
3. She bought 1 small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum. Since the grape gum costs $2, the green apple gum costs \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total amount Suzie spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of strawberry gum} + \text{Cost of grape gum} + \text{Cost of green apple gum}
\]

Substituting the known values into the equation gives us:

\[
7 = 2x + 2 + 1
\]

Now, simplify the equation:

\[
7 = 2x + 3
\]

Next, we isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 3 from both sides:

\[
7 - 3 = 2x
\]
\[
4 = 2x
\]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{4}{2} = 2
\]

Thus, the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is \( \boxed{2} \) dollars. 

To verify, we can check the total cost:
- Cost of 2 packs of strawberry gum: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars
- Cost of 1 pack of grape gum: \( 2 \) dollars
- Cost of 1 pack of green apple gum: \( 1 \) dollar

Adding these amounts together:

\[
4 + 2 + 1 = 7
\]

Since the total is indeed $7, our solution is confirmed. The final answer is that each pack of strawberry gum costs \( \boxed{2} \) dollars.
