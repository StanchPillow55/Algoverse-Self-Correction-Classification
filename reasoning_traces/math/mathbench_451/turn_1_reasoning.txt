==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 451," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by outlining a step-by-step problem-solving strategy. 

Let's assume a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - Our goal is to solve for \( x \). To do this, we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   - To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   - To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Simplifying the left side:
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

By following these steps, we have successfully solved the hypothetical problem. If you have a specific "Sample math problem 451" in mind, please provide the details, and I can apply a similar step-by-step approach to solve it.
