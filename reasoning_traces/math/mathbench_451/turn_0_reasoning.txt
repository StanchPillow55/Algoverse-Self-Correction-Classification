==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 451," I'll need more specific details about the problem itself. Since I don't have the actual content of "Sample math problem 451," I'll demonstrate how to solve a typical math problem by creating an example and walking through it step-by-step.

**Example Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to solve for \( x \), which means finding the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - The equation is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).
   - To isolate \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side, which is \( 5 \).

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   - Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is \( 3 \).
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
