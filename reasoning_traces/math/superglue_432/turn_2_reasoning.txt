Question ID: superglue_432
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 432" refers to. However, since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem using a hypothetical math problem as an example. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** If a car travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, how long will it take to travel 180 miles?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for a car to travel 180 miles at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - Distance = 180 miles
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 180 by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - To ensure the calculation is correct, consider the units:
     - Miles cancel out, leaving hours as the unit for time, which is appropriate.
   - Recalculate to confirm:
     \[
     60 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - The calculation checks out.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - It will take the car 3 hours to travel 180 miles at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.

By following these steps, we have solved the hypothetical problem. If "Sample reasoning question 432" refers to a specific problem, please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem using a similar step-by-step approach.
