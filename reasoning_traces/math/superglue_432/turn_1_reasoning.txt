Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 432" might entail. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. 

Let's create a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Problem:**
A store sells two types of candies: chocolate bars and gummy bears. The chocolate bars are priced at $2 each, and the gummy bears are priced at $1.50 each. A customer buys a total of 10 candies and spends $17. How many chocolate bars and gummy bears did the customer buy?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate bars.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of gummy bears.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of candies bought is 10:
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
   - The total cost of the candies is $17:
     \[
     2x + 1.5y = 17
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   2x + 1.5y &= 17 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Step 1:** Solve Equation 1 for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 10 - x
   \]

   **Step 2:** Substitute \( y = 10 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   2x + 1.5(10 - x) = 17
   \]

   **Step 3:** Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 15 - 1.5x = 17
   \]
   \[
   0.5x + 15 = 17
   \]
   \[
   0.5x = 2
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{2}{0.5} = 4
   \]

   **Step 4:** Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( y \):
   \[
   4 + y = 10
   \]
   \[
   y = 10 - 4 = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check if the values satisfy both equations:
   - For Equation 1: \( 4 + 6 = 10 \) (True)
   - For Equation 2: \( 2(4) + 1.5(6) = 8 + 9 = 17 \) (True)

Since both equations are satisfied, the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 4 chocolate bars and 6 gummy bears.
