Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 432." Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem, focusing on logical reasoning and detailed explanation.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

Without specific details, let's assume "Sample reasoning question 432" involves a common type of math problem, such as solving an equation, analyzing a pattern, or working with geometric figures. For illustration, let's assume it's an algebraic equation problem.

**Example Problem: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).**

**Step 2: Identify What is Being Asked**

The problem asks us to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 3: Plan a Solution**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. This involves performing inverse operations to simplify the equation.

**Step 4: Execute the Plan**

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation** to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2** to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**

Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
Calculating the left side gives:
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Step 6: State the Final Answer**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This structured approach can be applied to a wide range of math problems by adapting the specific steps to the problem's requirements. If you have a specific "Sample reasoning question 432" in mind, please provide more details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
