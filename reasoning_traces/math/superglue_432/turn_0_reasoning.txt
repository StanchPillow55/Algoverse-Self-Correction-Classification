==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 432" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 432 widgets and made $25,920 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of widgets sold is 432:
     \[
     x + y = 432
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue from the sales is $25,920:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 25,920
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 432 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   50x + 70y &= 25,920 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution or Elimination Method:**

   Let's use the substitution method. Solve Equation 1 for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 432 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 432 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   50x + 70(432 - x) = 25,920
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   50x + 70 \times 432 - 70x = 25,920
   \]
   \[
   50x + 30,240 - 70x = 25,920
   \]
   \[
   -20x + 30,240 = 25,920
   \]
   \[
   -20x = 25,920 - 30,240
   \]
   \[
   -20x = -4,320
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{-4,320}{-20}
   \]
   \[
   x = 216
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 216 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( y \):
   \[
   216 + y = 432
   \]
   \[
   y = 432 - 216
   \]
   \[
   y = 216
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the solution in Equation 2:
   \[
   50(216) + 70(216) = 25,920
   \]
   \[
   10,800 + 15,120 = 25,920
   \]
   \[
   25,920 = 25,920
   \]

   The solution satisfies both equations.

**Final Answer:**

The company sold 216 Type A widgets and 216 Type B widgets.
