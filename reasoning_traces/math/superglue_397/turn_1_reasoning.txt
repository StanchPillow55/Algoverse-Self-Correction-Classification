Question ID: superglue_397
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what is being asked. However, the question provided is "Sample reasoning question 397," which doesn't give us any specific mathematical problem to solve. Since there is no explicit problem statement or numerical data to work with, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating an example problem.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Example Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - Base of the triangle, \( b = 10 \) units
   - Height of the triangle, \( h = 5 \) units

3. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   - Now, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of a triangle using the given base and height. This approach can be applied to any similar problem involving the calculation of a triangle's area. If you have a specific problem or question in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you accordingly.
