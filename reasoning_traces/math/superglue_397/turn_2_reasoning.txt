==================================================

To solve a problem effectively, it's crucial to understand the question and break it down into manageable parts. However, the question provided, "Sample reasoning question 397," lacks specific details or context. Therefore, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Question:** A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the dimensions (length and width) of a rectangle.
   - We know the relationship between the length and width: Length = 3 Ã— Width.
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is given as 48 units.

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( l \) can be expressed as \( l = 3w \).

3. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - Substitute the known perimeter and the expression for the length:
     \[
     48 = 2(3w) + 2w
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     48 = 6w + 2w
     \]
     \[
     48 = 8w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Substitute \( w = 6 \) back into the expression for the length:
     \[
     l = 3w = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 6 units
- Length = 18 units

This approach demonstrates how to systematically solve a math problem by defining variables, using known formulas, simplifying equations, solving for unknowns, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details.
