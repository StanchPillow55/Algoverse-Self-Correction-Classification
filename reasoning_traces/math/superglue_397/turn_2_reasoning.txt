==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 397," we need to first understand what the question is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it stands. Without specific details or numbers, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem, using a hypothetical example.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 397" is a math problem involving solving a linear equation. Here's how we would approach it:

### Hypothetical Problem:
Solve the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This is a general approach to solving a linear equation. If "Sample reasoning question 397" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details or context so that I can assist you accurately.
