==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 356," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is not clear or specific, so let's assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. Since the problem is labeled as a "reasoning question," it might involve logical reasoning or mathematical reasoning.

Let's assume a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Problem:** A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. A customer buys a total of 10 fruits (apples and oranges) and spends $25. How many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we have two conditions:
     1. The total number of fruits is 10: 
        \[
        x + y = 10
        \]
     2. The total cost is $25:
        \[
        2x + 3y = 25
        \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   2x + 3y &= 25 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution Method:**

   - Solve Equation 1 for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 10 - y
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 10 - y \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     2(10 - y) + 3y = 25
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( y \):
     \[
     20 - 2y + 3y = 25
     \]
     \[
     20 + y = 25
     \]
     \[
     y = 25 - 20
     \]
     \[
     y = 5
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 5 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( x \):
     \[
     x + 5 = 10
     \]
     \[
     x = 10 - 5
     \]
     \[
     x = 5
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Check the total number of fruits:
     \[
     x + y = 5 + 5 = 10
     \]
   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     2x + 3y = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25
     \]

   Both conditions are satisfied.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.
