==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 356." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of a rectangle.
   - We know the relationship between the length and width: Length = 3 Ã— Width.
   - We also know the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( l \) is \( 3w \).
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
     \]
   - Substitute the known values into the formula:
     \[
     48 = 2 \times (3w + w)
     \]

3. **Simplify and Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify inside the parentheses:
     \[
     48 = 2 \times (4w)
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     48 = 8w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides by 8:
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

4. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length \( l \) is 3 times the width:
     \[
     l = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the calculated dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (18 + 6) = 2 \times 24 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 6 units and a length of 18 units.
