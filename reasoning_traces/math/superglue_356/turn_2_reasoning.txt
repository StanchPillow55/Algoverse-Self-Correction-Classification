Question ID: superglue_356
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 356" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I will assume it is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 10 positive integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   The first 10 positive integers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

2. **Understand the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 10 \). Substitute 10 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{10(10 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   \[
   S = \frac{10 \times 11}{2} = \frac{110}{2} = 55
   \]

5. **Verify by Direct Addition:**
   To ensure the formula is applied correctly, let's add the numbers directly:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55
   \]

Both methods give the same result, confirming the calculation is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.
