Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 356" might entail. Since the problem statement is vague and doesn't provide specific details, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. 

Let's create a sample math problem and solve it:

**Sample Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular sections, each with an area of 150 square meters, to plant different crops. How many such sections can he create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
   \]
   For the farmer's field:
   \[
   \text{Area of the field} = 100 \, \text{meters} \times 60 \, \text{meters} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
   \]

2. **Determine the Area of Each Section:**
   Each section has an area of 150 square meters.

3. **Calculate the Number of Sections:**
   To find out how many sections of 150 square meters can be created from the total area, divide the total area by the area of each section:
   \[
   \text{Number of sections} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of each section}} = \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{150 \, \text{square meters}}
   \]

4. **Perform the Division:**
   \[
   \frac{6000}{150} = 40
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The farmer can divide the field into 40 smaller rectangular sections, each with an area of 150 square meters.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 sections of 150 square meters each.
