==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many face masks Tyrion uses in a given time frame based on the information provided.

1. **Understanding the usage per outing**:
   - Tyrion changes his face mask **2 times** every time he goes out.

2. **Calculating daily usage**:
   - Tyrion goes out **3 times a day**.
   - Therefore, the total number of face masks he uses in one day can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Face masks per day} = \text{Number of outings per day} \times \text{Face masks per outing}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Face masks per day} = 3 \text{ outings} \times 2 \text{ masks per outing} = 6 \text{ masks}
     \]

3. **Calculating usage over 2 days**:
   - To find out how many face masks he uses in **2 days**, we multiply the daily usage by 2:
     \[
     \text{Face masks in 2 days} = \text{Face masks per day} \times 2
     \]
     \[
     \text{Face masks in 2 days} = 6 \text{ masks} \times 2 = 12 \text{ masks}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Tyrion uses a total of **12 face masks** every 2 days.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
