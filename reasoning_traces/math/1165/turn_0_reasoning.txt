To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of apartments in each complex.

1. **First complex**: 200 apartments
2. **Second complex**: 200 apartments
3. **Third complex**: The third complex is 60% bigger than the first two combined.

First, we calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
\[
\text{Total apartments in first two complexes} = 200 + 200 = 400
\]

Now, we calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:
\[
\text{Increase in size} = 60\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.60 \times 400 = 240
\]
\[
\text{Total apartments in third complex} = 400 + 240 = 640
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of apartments across all complexes.

Now we sum the number of apartments in all three complexes:
\[
\text{Total apartments} = 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of collections per week.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:
\[
\text{Total collections per week} = 3 \text{ collections/week} \times 3 \text{ complexes} = 9 \text{ collections/week}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the payment per collection.

John gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment. Therefore, the total payment per collection for all apartments is:
\[
\text{Payment per collection} = 0.40 \text{ dollars/apartment} \times 1040 \text{ apartments} = 416 \text{ dollars/collection}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total earnings for the week.

Now we multiply the payment per collection by the total number of collections per week:
\[
\text{Total earnings for the week} = 416 \text{ dollars/collection} \times 9 \text{ collections/week} = 3744 \text{ dollars/week}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, John makes a total of **$3744** in a week.
