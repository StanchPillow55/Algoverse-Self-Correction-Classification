Question ID: 1165
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Determine the number of apartments in each complex:**
   - The first two apartment complexes each have 200 apartments.
   - Therefore, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is:
     \[
     200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:**
   - The third complex is 60% bigger than the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.
   - First, we calculate 60% of the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
     \[
     60\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ apartments}
     \]
   - Now, we add this to the total number of apartments in the first two complexes to find the total number of apartments in the third complex:
     \[
     400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of apartments across all complexes:**
   - Now we sum the apartments from all three complexes:
     \[
     200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of collections per week:**
   - John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment.
   - Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ collections/week} \times 1040 \text{ apartments} = 3120 \text{ collections/week}
     \]

5. **Calculate John's earnings per week:**
   - John earns $0.40 per collection for each apartment.
   - To find his total earnings for the week, we multiply the total number of collections by the payment per collection:
     \[
     3120 \text{ collections} \times 0.40 \text{ dollars/collection} = 1248 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   - Therefore, the total amount of money John makes in a week is:
     \[
     \boxed{1248} \text{ dollars}
     \]
