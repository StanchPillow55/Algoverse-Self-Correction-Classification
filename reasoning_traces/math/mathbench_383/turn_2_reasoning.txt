Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 383," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 383" is not specific and does not provide any details or context. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. 

Since the problem is not specified, let's consider a common type of math problem: solving a quadratic equation. I will demonstrate how to solve a quadratic equation step by step.

### Problem:
Solve the quadratic equation: \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the coefficients**: 
   The given quadratic equation is in the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where:
   - \( a = 1 \)
   - \( b = -5 \)
   - \( c = 6 \)

2. **Check for factorability**:
   We will try to factor the quadratic equation. We need two numbers that multiply to \( ac = 1 \times 6 = 6 \) and add to \( b = -5 \).

   The numbers that satisfy these conditions are -2 and -3 because:
   - \((-2) \times (-3) = 6\)
   - \((-2) + (-3) = -5\)

3. **Factor the quadratic equation**:
   Using the numbers found, we can factor the equation as:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x - 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 2
   \]
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3
   \]

5. **Verify the solutions**:
   Substitute \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   - For \( x = 2 \):
     \[
     (2)^2 - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0
     \]
   - For \( x = 3 \):
     \[
     (3)^2 - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0
     \]

Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

### Final Answer:
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \).
