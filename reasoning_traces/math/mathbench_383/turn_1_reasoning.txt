==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 383," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 383" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact question or mathematical operation required. Therefore, let's assume a hypothetical problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 383" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem 383:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   Even numbers are integers divisible by 2. From 1 to 100, the even numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

2. **Determine the Sequence:**
   The sequence of even numbers from 1 to 100 is an arithmetic sequence where:
   - The first term (\(a_1\)) is 2.
   - The common difference (\(d\)) is 2 (since each even number is 2 more than the previous one).
   - The last term (\(a_n\)) is 100.

3. **Find the Number of Terms (\(n\)):**
   To find the number of terms in this sequence, use the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
   \]
   \[
   100 = 2 + 2n - 2
   \]
   \[
   100 = 2n
   \]
   \[
   n = 50
   \]
   So, there are 50 even numbers from 1 to 100.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
   \]
   \[
   S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
   \]
   \[
   S_{50} = 2550
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100 is 2550.
