==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 491" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

Let's say the problem is as follows:

"A company produces widgets. The cost to produce \( x \) widgets is given by the function \( C(x) = 50x + 200 \), where \( C(x) \) is the total cost in dollars. The company sells each widget for $70. How many widgets must the company sell to break even?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The company incurs a cost to produce widgets and earns revenue by selling them.
   - The goal is to determine the number of widgets that must be sold to cover the production costs, i.e., to break even.

2. **Define the Break-Even Point:**
   - The break-even point occurs when total revenue equals total cost.

3. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - Total cost, \( C(x) \), is given by the equation \( C(x) = 50x + 200 \).
   - Revenue from selling \( x \) widgets is \( R(x) = 70x \).

4. **Set Revenue Equal to Cost:**
   \[
   70x = 50x + 200
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract \( 50x \) from both sides to isolate terms involving \( x \):
     \[
     70x - 50x = 200
     \]
     \[
     20x = 200
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 20 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{200}{20}
     \]
     \[
     x = 10
     \]

6. **Interpret the Solution:**
   - The company must sell 10 widgets to break even.

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Calculate the total cost for 10 widgets:
     \[
     C(10) = 50(10) + 200 = 500 + 200 = 700
     \]
   - Calculate the revenue from selling 10 widgets:
     \[
     R(10) = 70(10) = 700
     \]
   - Since the total cost equals the total revenue at 10 widgets, the solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The company must sell 10 widgets to break even.
