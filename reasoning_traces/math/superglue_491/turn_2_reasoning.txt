==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I'll need more specific details about "Sample reasoning question 491." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a rectangle where the length (L) is 3 times the width (W).
   - The perimeter (P) of the rectangle is 48 units.
   - We need to find the dimensions: the length and the width.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \( P = 2L + 2W \).
   - We know \( L = 3W \) from the problem statement.
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter formula: 
     \[
     48 = 2(3W) + 2W
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     48 = 6W + 2W
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     48 = 8W
     \]

4. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 3W \) to find L:
     \[
     L = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 18 units

This approach can be adapted to solve various math problems by identifying the knowns and unknowns, setting up equations, simplifying, solving, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through it similarly.
