Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 371," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 371" is not a specific math problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 371:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 7 = 22 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 7 = 22 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 7 = 22
   \]
   Calculate the left side:
   \[
   15 + 7 = 22
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
