==================================================

It seems like you've mentioned "Sample math problem 371," but I don't have the details of what that specific problem entails. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem. If you provide the specific details of the problem, I can give a more tailored solution. For now, let's go through a generic problem-solving process:

### Generic Math Problem Solving Steps

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning, etc.).
   - Choose the most appropriate strategy based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify each step of your work.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Ensure that the final answer addresses the question asked.

### Example Problem

Let's assume a simple algebra problem: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- We can solve this linear equation by isolating \( x \).

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. Start with the equation: 
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check the Solution
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming our solution is correct.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that particular problem for you.
