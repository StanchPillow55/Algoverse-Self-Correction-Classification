==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 371" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about this problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "371" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 371:**

*Calculate the area of a triangle with vertices at points A(1, 2), B(4, 6), and C(6, 2) in the coordinate plane.*

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the area of a triangle given its vertices in the coordinate plane.

2. **Use the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle with vertices at \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \right|
   \]

3. **Substitute the Coordinates:**
   For vertices A(1, 2), B(4, 6), and C(6, 2), substitute into the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \left| 1(6-2) + 4(2-2) + 6(2-6) \right|
   \]

4. **Calculate Each Term:**
   - First term: \( 1(6-2) = 1 \times 4 = 4 \)
   - Second term: \( 4(2-2) = 4 \times 0 = 0 \)
   - Third term: \( 6(2-6) = 6 \times (-4) = -24 \)

5. **Sum the Terms:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \left| 4 + 0 - 24 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| -20 \right|
   \]

6. **Calculate the Absolute Value and Multiply by 1/2:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle with vertices at A(1, 2), B(4, 6), and C(6, 2) is 10 square units.

This completes the solution to our hypothetical problem 371. If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample math problem 371," please provide the details, and I will solve it accordingly.
