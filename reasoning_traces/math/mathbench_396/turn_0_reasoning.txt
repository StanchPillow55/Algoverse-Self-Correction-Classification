==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 396" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I can't provide a specific solution. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems.

Here's a general step-by-step approach to solving a math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the strategy that seems most appropriate for the problem.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check your calculations for any errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample math problem 396," I can't provide a specific solution. If you can provide the actual problem, I'd be happy to work through it with you!
