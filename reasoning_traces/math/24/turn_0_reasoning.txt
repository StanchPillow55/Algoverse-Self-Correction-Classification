Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Mary initially spent her full credit limit of $100. 

She then paid off $15 on Tuesday. To find out how much she still owes after this payment, we subtract the amount she paid from the total amount she spent:

$100 - $15 = $85

So, after Tuesday, Mary still owes $85.

Then, on Thursday, she paid off another $23. Again, we subtract this amount from the remaining balance to find out how much she still owes:

$85 - $23 = $62

So, after making both payments, Mary still owes $62.

Therefore, before her next shopping trip, Mary will need to pay $62.
