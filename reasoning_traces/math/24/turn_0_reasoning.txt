==================================================

To determine how much credit Mary needs to pay before her next shopping trip, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total credit limit**: Mary has a credit limit of $100.

2. **Calculate the total amount spent**: Mary spent the full credit limit of $100.

3. **Determine the payments made**: 
   - On Tuesday, Mary paid $15.
   - On Thursday, Mary paid $23.

4. **Calculate the total payments made**: 
   \[
   \text{Total payments} = 15 + 23 = 38
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining balance**: 
   To find out how much credit Mary still owes, we subtract the total payments made from the total amount spent:
   \[
   \text{Remaining balance} = \text{Total spent} - \text{Total payments}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Remaining balance} = 100 - 38 = 62
   \]

6. **Conclusion**: Mary needs to pay the remaining balance of $62 before her next shopping trip.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{62}
\]
