Question ID: 79
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

James has been teaching for 40 years. His partner has been teaching for 10 years less than James. 

To find out how long his partner has been teaching, we subtract 10 from the number of years James has been teaching. 

So, 40 years (James's teaching experience) - 10 years = 30 years (partner's teaching experience)

To find their combined experience, we add the number of years James has been teaching to the number of years his partner has been teaching.

So, 40 years (James's teaching experience) + 30 years (partner's teaching experience) = 70 years

Therefore, their combined teaching experience is 70 years.
