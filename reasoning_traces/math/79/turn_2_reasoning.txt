Question ID: 79
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

James has been teaching for 40 years. His partner has been teaching for 10 years less than James, which means his partner has been teaching for 40 years - 10 years = 30 years.

To find their combined experience, we add the number of years James has been teaching to the number of years his partner has been teaching. 

So, 40 years (James's experience) + 30 years (his partner's experience) = 70 years.

Therefore, their combined teaching experience is 70 years.
