==================================================

To find out how much John will pay for the grooming after applying the discount, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the discount amount**: The groomer offers a 30% discount on the original grooming cost of $100. To find the discount amount, we calculate 30% of $100.

   \[
   \text{Discount} = \text{Original Cost} \times \text{Discount Rate}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 100 \times 0.30 = 30
   \]

   So, the discount amount is $30.

2. **Calculate the final cost after the discount**: To find the final cost that John has to pay, we subtract the discount from the original cost.

   \[
   \text{Final Cost} = \text{Original Cost} - \text{Discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Cost} = 100 - 30 = 70
   \]

Thus, the grooming cost after applying the discount is $70.

3. **State the final answer**: 

The final answer is that the grooming costs John **$70** after the discount.
