==================================================

To find the combined teaching experience of James and his partner, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify James's teaching experience**: 
   - James has been teaching for 40 years.

2. **Determine the partner's teaching experience**: 
   - The partner has been teaching for 10 years less than James. 
   - Therefore, we calculate the partner's experience as follows:
     \[
     \text{Partner's experience} = \text{James's experience} - 10 \text{ years}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Partner's experience} = 40 \text{ years} - 10 \text{ years} = 30 \text{ years}
     \]

3. **Calculate the combined teaching experience**: 
   - To find the total experience, we add James's experience to his partner's experience:
     \[
     \text{Combined experience} = \text{James's experience} + \text{Partner's experience}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Combined experience} = 40 \text{ years} + 30 \text{ years} = 70 \text{ years}
     \]

Thus, the combined teaching experience of James and his partner is **70 years**.

Final answer: **70 years**.
