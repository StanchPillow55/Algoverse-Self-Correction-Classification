==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 264" refers to. Since the question itself is not provided, I will assume that "264" is a placeholder for a math problem that involves reasoning or calculations related to the number 264. 

Let's explore some possible mathematical problems involving the number 264 and solve them step by step.

### Problem 1: Prime Factorization of 264

**Step 1: Determine if 264 is even or odd.**
- Since 264 ends in 4, it is even. Therefore, it is divisible by 2.

**Step 2: Divide 264 by 2.**
- \( 264 \div 2 = 132 \)

**Step 3: Check if 132 is even or odd.**
- 132 ends in 2, so it is even. Divide by 2 again.

**Step 4: Divide 132 by 2.**
- \( 132 \div 2 = 66 \)

**Step 5: Check if 66 is even or odd.**
- 66 ends in 6, so it is even. Divide by 2 again.

**Step 6: Divide 66 by 2.**
- \( 66 \div 2 = 33 \)

**Step 7: Check if 33 is divisible by any prime numbers.**
- 33 is not even, so it is not divisible by 2.
- Sum of digits of 33 is \( 3 + 3 = 6 \), which is divisible by 3.

**Step 8: Divide 33 by 3.**
- \( 33 \div 3 = 11 \)

**Step 9: Check if 11 is a prime number.**
- 11 is a prime number.

**Conclusion:**
The prime factorization of 264 is \( 2^3 \times 3 \times 11 \).

### Problem 2: Calculate the Sum of the Digits of 264

**Step 1: Identify the digits of 264.**
- The digits are 2, 6, and 4.

**Step 2: Add the digits together.**
- \( 2 + 6 + 4 = 12 \)

**Conclusion:**
The sum of the digits of 264 is 12.

### Problem 3: Determine if 264 is a Perfect Square

**Step 1: Find the square root of 264.**
- Estimate the square root: \( \sqrt{256} = 16 \) and \( \sqrt{289} = 17 \), so \( \sqrt{264} \) is between 16 and 17.

**Step 2: Check if 264 is a perfect square.**
- Since 264 is not a perfect square of an integer (16^2 = 256 and 17^2 = 289), 264 is not a perfect square.

**Conclusion:**
264 is not a perfect square.

### Final Answer

Based on the problems explored, here are the conclusions:
1. The prime factorization of 264 is \( 2^3 \times 3 \times 11 \).
2. The sum of the digits of 264 is 12.
3. 264 is not a perfect square.
