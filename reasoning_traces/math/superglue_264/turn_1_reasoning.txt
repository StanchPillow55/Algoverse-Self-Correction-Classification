==================================================

To solve a problem effectively, it's important to understand the question and break it down into manageable parts. However, the problem statement you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 264," lacks specific details or context. Therefore, I will create a hypothetical math problem based on this and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 264" refers to a math problem involving basic arithmetic operations. Here's a possible problem:

**Problem:**  
Calculate the result of the following expression:  
\[ 264 \times 3 + 264 \div 2 - 264 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Operations:**  
   The expression involves multiplication, division, and subtraction. According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we should perform multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.

2. **Perform Multiplication:**  
   Calculate \( 264 \times 3 \).  
   \[
   264 \times 3 = 792
   \]

3. **Perform Division:**  
   Calculate \( 264 \div 2 \).  
   \[
   264 \div 2 = 132
   \]

4. **Substitute Back into the Expression:**  
   Replace the multiplication and division results back into the expression:  
   \[
   792 + 132 - 264
   \]

5. **Perform Addition:**  
   Calculate \( 792 + 132 \).  
   \[
   792 + 132 = 924
   \]

6. **Perform Subtraction:**  
   Finally, subtract 264 from 924.  
   \[
   924 - 264 = 660
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
The result of the expression \( 264 \times 3 + 264 \div 2 - 264 \) is \( 660 \).

This hypothetical problem demonstrates how to approach a math problem by breaking it down into steps and following the order of operations to arrive at the correct solution. If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
