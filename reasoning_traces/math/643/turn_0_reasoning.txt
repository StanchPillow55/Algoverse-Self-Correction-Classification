==================================================

To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the daily article count for each website**:
   - The news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles daily.
   - The sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles daily.

2. **Calculate the total daily articles published by both websites**:
   - Total daily articles = Articles from the news website + Articles from the sister company
   - Total daily articles = 20 (from the news website) + 10 (from the sister company)
   - Total daily articles = 30 articles

3. **Calculate the total number of articles published in February**:
   - February has 28 days.
   - Total articles in February = Total daily articles × Number of days in February
   - Total articles in February = 30 articles/day × 28 days

4. **Perform the multiplication**:
   \[
   30 \times 28 = 840
   \]

Thus, the total number of articles published by both websites together in February is **840**.

Final answer: **840 articles**.
