To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the prices of each type of bike:**
   - Price of one MTB = $500
   - Price of one BMX = half the price of an MTB = $500 / 2 = $250
   - Price of one Trekking bike = $450

2. **Determine the total number of bikes sold:**
   - Total bikes sold = 300

3. **Calculate the number of Trekking bikes sold:**
   - Half of the total bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - Number of Trekking bikes = 300 / 2 = 150

4. **Calculate the number of BMX bikes sold:**
   - 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - Number of BMX bikes = 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45

5. **Calculate the number of MTB bikes sold:**
   - The remaining bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   - Total bikes sold = Trekking bikes + BMX bikes + MTB bikes
   - Therefore, MTB bikes = Total bikes - (Trekking bikes + BMX bikes)
   - MTB bikes = 300 - (150 + 45) = 300 - 195 = 105

6. **Calculate the earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes * Price of one MTB
     \[
     \text{Earnings from MTB} = 105 \times 500 = 52500
     \]
   - Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes * Price of one BMX
     \[
     \text{Earnings from BMX} = 45 \times 250 = 11250
     \]
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes * Price of one Trekking bike
     \[
     \text{Earnings from Trekking} = 150 \times 450 = 67500
     \]

7. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from MTB + Earnings from BMX + Earnings from Trekking
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 52500 + 11250 + 67500 = 131250
   \]

Thus, Marcel earned a total of **$131,250** from selling bicycles during that month.

**Final Answer: $131,250**
