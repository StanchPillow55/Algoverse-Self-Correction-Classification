==================================================

To solve this problem effectively, let's first understand what is being asked. The question is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 195," but it doesn't provide any specific details or context about the problem itself. Therefore, I'll need to make some assumptions or create a hypothetical problem to demonstrate the process of solving a math problem step by step.

Let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 195" is a math problem involving algebra. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) by itself.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This is a demonstration of how to solve a basic algebraic equation step by step. If you have a specific problem or context for "Sample reasoning question 195," please provide more details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
