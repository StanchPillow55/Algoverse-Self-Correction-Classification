==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 195" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical reasoning problem using a hypothetical example.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 195" is a logical reasoning problem involving a sequence of numbers. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:**
Consider the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ... What is the 10th term in this sequence?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - Look at the given sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
   - Notice that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2.
   - This is a geometric sequence where each term is double the previous one.

2. **Determine the General Formula:**
   - In a geometric sequence, the nth term can be found using the formula:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 \times r^{(n-1)}
     \]
     where \( a_1 \) is the first term and \( r \) is the common ratio.
   - Here, \( a_1 = 2 \) and \( r = 2 \).

3. **Calculate the 10th Term:**
   - Substitute the values into the formula to find the 10th term:
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 2^{(10-1)}
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 2^9
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 512
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 1024
     \]

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Double-check the calculation of \( 2^9 \):
     \[
     2^9 = 512
     \]
   - Multiply by 2:
     \[
     2 \times 512 = 1024
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The 10th term in the sequence is 1024.

**Final Answer:**
The 10th term in the sequence is 1024.

This approach demonstrates how to systematically solve a reasoning problem involving sequences by identifying patterns, deriving a formula, and performing calculations. If "Sample reasoning question 195" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details for a more specific solution.
