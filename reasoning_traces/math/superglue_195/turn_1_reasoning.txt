==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 195" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical problem and work through it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide this field into two equal parts by constructing a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the length of the fence needed and the area of each part.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is rectangular with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal parts using a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - Imagine the rectangle with the longer side (100 meters) as the base.
   - The fence will be parallel to the shorter side (60 meters), effectively dividing the field into two smaller rectangles.

3. **Determine the Length of the Fence:**
   - Since the fence is parallel to the shorter side, it will span the entire length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the fence needed is equal to the length of the field, which is 100 meters.

4. **Calculate the Area of Each Part:**
   - The total area of the field is given by the formula for the area of a rectangle: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 100 \, \text{m} \times 60 \, \text{m} = 6000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]
   - Since the field is divided into two equal parts, the area of each part is:
     \[
     \text{Area of each part} = \frac{6000 \, \text{m}^2}{2} = 3000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - The fence divides the field into two rectangles, each with an area of 3000 square meters.
   - The length of the fence matches the length of the field, ensuring the division is parallel to the shorter side.

**Final Answer:**
- The length of the fence needed is 100 meters.
- The area of each part of the field is 3000 square meters.

This approach demonstrates how to tackle a math reasoning problem by breaking it down into manageable steps, ensuring clarity and accuracy in the solution.
