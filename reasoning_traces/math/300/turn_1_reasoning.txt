Question ID: 300
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how much money Jenny should get in change after her purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of printing her essay and buying the pens, and then subtract that from the amount she pays.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of printing the essay

1. **Cost to print one page**: $0.10
2. **Number of pages in the essay**: 25
3. **Number of copies to print**: 7

First, we calculate the cost to print one copy of the essay:
\[
\text{Cost to print one copy} = \text{Cost per page} \times \text{Number of pages} = 0.10 \times 25 = 2.50
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost to print 7 copies:
\[
\text{Total printing cost} = \text{Cost to print one copy} \times \text{Number of copies} = 2.50 \times 7 = 17.50
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the pens

1. **Cost of one pen**: $1.50
2. **Number of pens**: 7

Now, we calculate the total cost for the pens:
\[
\text{Total pen cost} = \text{Cost per pen} \times \text{Number of pens} = 1.50 \times 7 = 10.50
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all items

Now we add the total printing cost and the total pen cost:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total printing cost} + \text{Total pen cost} = 17.50 + 10.50 = 28.00
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the amount paid and the change

Jenny pays with 2 twenty dollar bills:
\[
\text{Amount paid} = 2 \times 20 = 40.00
\]

Now, we calculate the change she should receive:
\[
\text{Change} = \text{Amount paid} - \text{Total cost} = 40.00 - 28.00 = 12.00
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the amount of money Jenny should get in change is:
\[
\boxed{12.00}
\]
