==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of printing the essay and buying the pens, and then determine how much change Jenny should receive after paying with two twenty-dollar bills.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of printing the essay

Jenny wants to print 7 copies of her 25-page essay. The cost to print one page is $0.10.

1. **Calculate the total number of pages to print:**
   \[
   \text{Total pages} = 7 \text{ copies} \times 25 \text{ pages per copy} = 175 \text{ pages}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of printing:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of printing} = 175 \text{ pages} \times \$0.10 \text{ per page} = \$17.50
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying the pens

Jenny wants to buy 7 pens, each costing $1.50.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the pens:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of pens} = 7 \text{ pens} \times \$1.50 \text{ per pen} = \$10.50
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost

Add the cost of printing and the cost of the pens to find the total cost.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$17.50 + \$10.50 = \$28.00
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the change

Jenny pays with 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is a total of $40.

1. **Calculate the change:**
   \[
   \text{Change} = \$40.00 - \$28.00 = \$12.00
   \]

### Final Answer

Jenny should get $12.00 in change.
