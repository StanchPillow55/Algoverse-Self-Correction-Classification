==================================================

To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to determine the total amount of time he exercised on Sunday and Monday combined.

1. **Calculate the total exercise time for Sunday and Monday:**
   - Time exercised on Sunday: 23 minutes
   - Time exercised on Monday: 16 minutes

   We add these two amounts together:
   \[
   \text{Total time on Sunday and Monday} = \text{Time on Sunday} + \text{Time on Monday} = 23 \text{ minutes} + 16 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time on Sunday and Monday} = 39 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Determine the exercise time for Tuesday:**
   Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time by 2:
   \[
   \text{Time on Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Total time on Sunday and Monday} = 2 \times 39 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time on Tuesday} = 78 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, Peter needs to exercise for **78 minutes** on Tuesday to meet his goal.

**Final Answer: 78 minutes**
