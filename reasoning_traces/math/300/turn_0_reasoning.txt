==================================================

To determine how much change Jenny should receive after her purchases, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of printing the essay.**
   - The cost to print one page is $0.10.
   - Jenny wants to print 25 pages for each copy of her essay.
   - Therefore, the cost to print one copy of the essay is:
     \[
     25 \text{ pages} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/page} = 2.50 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Since she wants to print 7 copies, the total printing cost will be:
     \[
     7 \text{ copies} \times 2.50 \text{ dollars/copy} = 17.50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the pens.**
   - Each pen costs $1.50.
   - Jenny wants to buy 7 pens, so the total cost for the pens is:
     \[
     7 \text{ pens} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/pen} = 10.50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of all items.**
   - Now, we add the total printing cost and the total pen cost:
     \[
     17.50 \text{ dollars (printing)} + 10.50 \text{ dollars (pens)} = 28.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine how much money Jenny pays.**
   - Jenny pays with 2 twenty dollar bills:
     \[
     2 \times 20 \text{ dollars} = 40.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the change Jenny should receive.**
   - To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
     \[
     40.00 \text{ dollars} - 28.00 \text{ dollars} = 12.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Jenny should receive **$12.00** in change.
