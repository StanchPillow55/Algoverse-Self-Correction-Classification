==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 178" refers to. Since no specific details are given about the problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 178" is the following:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation.

   \[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

   First, subtract 3 from both sides to remove the constant term on the left side:

   \[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[ 2x = 8 \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

   \[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[ x = 4 \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
\[ x = 4 \]

This is a complete solution to the hypothetical problem based on the assumption made about "Sample math problem 178." If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details so I can assist you accordingly.
