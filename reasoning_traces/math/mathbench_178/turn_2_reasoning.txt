==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 178" refers to. However, since no specific details or numbers are provided in the question, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 178" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 178:**

A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a rectangle with a length that is 3 times its width.
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.
   - We need to find the dimensions (length and width) of the rectangle.

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then, the length \( l \) of the rectangle is \( 3w \).

3. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - Substitute the given perimeter and the expression for the length:
     \[
     48 = 2(3w) + 2w
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     48 = 6w + 2w
     \]
     \[
     48 = 8w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides by 8:
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

5. **Find the Length \( l \):**
   - Since \( l = 3w \), substitute \( w = 6 \) into the equation for \( l \):
     \[
     l = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the calculated dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width: 6 units
- Length: 18 units
