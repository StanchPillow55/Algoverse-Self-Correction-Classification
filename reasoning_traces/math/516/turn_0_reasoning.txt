==================================================

To determine how many punches Joe throws during the fight, we can break the problem down into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the total duration of the fight in minutes**:
   - The fight lasts for 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes long.
   - Total duration of the fight = Number of rounds Ã— Duration of each round
   \[
   \text{Total duration} = 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of punches Joe throws per minute**:
   - According to the problem, Joe throws an average of 25 punches per minute.

3. **Calculate the total number of punches thrown during the fight**:
   - To find the total number of punches, we multiply the number of punches per minute by the total duration of the fight in minutes.
   \[
   \text{Total punches} = \text{Punches per minute} \times \text{Total duration}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total punches} = 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 375 \text{ punches}
   \]

Thus, the total number of punches Joe threw during the fight is **375**.

Final answer: **375 punches**.
