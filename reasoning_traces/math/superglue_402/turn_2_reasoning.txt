Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 402" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, let's assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 50 positive even numbers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   - The sequence of the first 50 positive even numbers is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

2. **Find the Last Term:**
   - The \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - For the 50th term:
     \[
     a_{50} = 2 + (50-1) \cdot 2 = 2 + 98 = 100
     \]

3. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100) = 25 \cdot 102 = 2550
     \]

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - To ensure accuracy, let's verify by calculating the sum using another method.
   - The sum of the first \( n \) even numbers can also be calculated by:
     \[
     S_n = n \cdot (n + 1)
     \]
   - For \( n = 50 \):
     \[
     S_{50} = 50 \cdot 51 = 2550
     \]

Both methods yield the same result, confirming the calculation is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 50 positive even numbers is 2550.
