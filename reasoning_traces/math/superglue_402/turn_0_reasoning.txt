==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about what "Sample reasoning question 402" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem using logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. Let's assume a sample problem:

**Problem:**  
A store sells apples for $2 each and bananas for $1.50 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits and spends $17, how many apples and how many bananas did they buy?

**Step 1: Define Variables**  
Let \( a \) be the number of apples and \( b \) be the number of bananas.

**Step 2: Set Up Equations**  
We have two pieces of information that can be translated into equations:
1. The total number of fruits:  
   \[
   a + b = 10
   \]
2. The total cost of the fruits:  
   \[
   2a + 1.5b = 17
   \]

**Step 3: Solve the System of Equations**  
We will solve these equations simultaneously.

**Equation 1:**  
\[
a + b = 10
\]

**Equation 2:**  
\[
2a + 1.5b = 17
\]

From Equation 1, express \( b \) in terms of \( a \):  
\[
b = 10 - a
\]

Substitute \( b = 10 - a \) into Equation 2:  
\[
2a + 1.5(10 - a) = 17
\]

Distribute the 1.5:  
\[
2a + 15 - 1.5a = 17
\]

Combine like terms:  
\[
0.5a + 15 = 17
\]

Subtract 15 from both sides:  
\[
0.5a = 2
\]

Divide by 0.5:  
\[
a = 4
\]

**Step 4: Find \( b \)**  
Substitute \( a = 4 \) back into the equation for \( b \):  
\[
b = 10 - a = 10 - 4 = 6
\]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**  
Check the solution in the cost equation:  
\[
2a + 1.5b = 2(4) + 1.5(6) = 8 + 9 = 17
\]

The solution satisfies both equations.

**Final Answer:**  
The customer bought 4 apples and 6 bananas.
