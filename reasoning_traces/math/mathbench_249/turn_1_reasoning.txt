==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 249," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 249" is not specific, and without additional context or details, it's impossible to determine what the problem entails. 

Since the problem is not clearly defined, let's consider a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 249." For the sake of this exercise, let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Hypothetical Problem 249:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) on one side of the equation and constants on the other.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
