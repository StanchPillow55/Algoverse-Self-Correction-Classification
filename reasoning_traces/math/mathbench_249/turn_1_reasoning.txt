==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 249" refers to. However, since there is no specific problem statement provided, I will assume that "Sample math problem 249" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Without a specific problem to solve, I will create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample math problem 249" is the following:

**Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**

   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**

   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation.

   Start with the given equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**

   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify the solution:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
