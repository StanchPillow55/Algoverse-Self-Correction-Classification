To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 249" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll assume this is a generic math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 249:**

**Problem:**  
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of a rectangle.
   - The length (L) is 3 times the width (W).
   - The perimeter (P) of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]
   - We know that \( L = 3W \).
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     48 = 2(3W) + 2W
     \]

3. **Simplify and solve for W:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     48 = 6W + 2W
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     48 = 8W
     \]
   - Solve for \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

4. **Find the length using the width:**
   - Since \( L = 3W \):
     \[
     L = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

5. **Verify the solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
- The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 18 units.
