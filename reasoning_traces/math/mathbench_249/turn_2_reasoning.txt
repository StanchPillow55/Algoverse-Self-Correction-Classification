==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 249," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 249" is not a specific math problem, I will create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "249" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Math Problem 249:**

Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers between 1 and 100 are numbers divisible by 2.
   - The sequence of even numbers between 1 and 100 is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

2. **Determine the Number of Terms:**
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the last term \( a_n = 100 \).
   - The common difference \( d = 2 \).
   - To find the number of terms \( n \), use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \times d
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2 + (n-1) \times 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = 50
     \]

3. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \times (2 + 100)
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 25 \times 102
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 2550
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.
