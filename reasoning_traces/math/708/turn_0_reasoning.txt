==================================================

To determine how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring at a rate of $12 per day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of days in 2 weeks**:
   - A week has 7 days.
   - Therefore, in 2 weeks, the total number of days is:
     \[
     2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total charge for 14 days**:
   - Alex charges $12 per day.
   - To find the total charge for 14 days, we multiply the daily charge by the total number of days:
     \[
     14 \text{ days} \times 12 \text{ dollars/day} = 168 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring is:
     \[
     \boxed{168} \text{ dollars}
     \]
