   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Re-calculate if necessary to confirm the results.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

To illustrate, let's solve a simple arithmetic problem:

**Problem:** What is the sum of 123 and 456?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the sum of two numbers: 123 and 456.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use basic addition to find the sum.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Align the numbers vertically and add:
     \[
     \begin{array}{c}
       \phantom{+}123 \\
     + 456 \\
     \hline
     \end{array}
     \]
   - Start from the rightmost digit:
     - Units place: \(3 + 6 = 9\)
     - Tens place: \(2 + 5 = 7\)
     - Hundreds place: \(1 + 4 = 5\)

   - Write the result:
     \[
     \begin{array}{c}
       \phantom{+}123 \\
     + 456 \\
     \hline
       \phantom{+}579 \\
     \end{array}
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Re-check each digit addition to ensure no mistakes were made.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The sum of 123 and 456 is 579.
