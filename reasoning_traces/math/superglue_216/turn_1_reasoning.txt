==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 216" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of gadgets: Gadget A and Gadget B. The company can produce up to 100 gadgets in a day. The profit from selling Gadget A is $30 per unit, and the profit from selling Gadget B is $50 per unit. The company must produce at least 20 units of Gadget A and at least 10 units of Gadget B each day. How many of each type of gadget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Gadget A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Gadget B produced.

2. **Set Up the Constraints:**
   - The total production constraint: \( x + y \leq 100 \).
   - Minimum production for Gadget A: \( x \geq 20 \).
   - Minimum production for Gadget B: \( y \geq 10 \).

3. **Objective Function:**
   - We want to maximize the profit function: \( P = 30x + 50y \).

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the line \( x + y = 100 \).
   - Shade the region where \( x + y \leq 100 \).
   - Draw the vertical line \( x = 20 \) and shade the region to the right.
   - Draw the horizontal line \( y = 10 \) and shade the region above.

5. **Identify the Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines \( x = 20 \), \( y = 10 \), and \( x + y = 100 \).

6. **Find the Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are where the lines intersect:
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( y = 10 \): \( (20, 10) \).
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( x + y = 100 \): \( (20, 80) \).
     - Intersection of \( y = 10 \) and \( x + y = 100 \): \( (90, 10) \).

7. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - At \( (20, 10) \): \( P = 30(20) + 50(10) = 600 + 500 = 1100 \).
   - At \( (20, 80) \): \( P = 30(20) + 50(80) = 600 + 4000 = 4600 \).
   - At \( (90, 10) \): \( P = 30(90) + 50(10) = 2700 + 500 = 3200 \).

8. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the point \( (20, 80) \) with a profit of $4600.

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 20 units of Gadget A and 80 units of Gadget B to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $4600.
