==================================================

To solve a problem effectively, it's important to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the question provided, "Sample reasoning question 216," does not contain specific details or numerical data to work with. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step-by-step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the dimensions (length and width) of a rectangle.
   - The length is 3 times the width.
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( l \) is \( 3w \).

3. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - Substitute the given perimeter and the expression for the length:
     \[
     48 = 2(3w) + 2w
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     48 = 6w + 2w
     \]
     \[
     48 = 8w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Since \( l = 3w \), substitute \( w = 6 \):
     \[
     l = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 6 units and a length of 18 units.
