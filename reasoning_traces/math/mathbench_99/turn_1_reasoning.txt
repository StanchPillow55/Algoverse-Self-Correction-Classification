==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 99" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem involving the number 99 and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 99.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

To find the sum of all integers from 1 to 99, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula for the sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) natural numbers is:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)
\]

where:
- \( n \) is the number of terms,
- \( a \) is the first term,
- \( l \) is the last term.

In this problem:
- The first term \( a = 1 \),
- The last term \( l = 99 \),
- The number of terms \( n = 99 \).

Plug these values into the formula:

\[
S = \frac{99}{2} \times (1 + 99)
\]

Calculate the sum inside the parentheses:

\[
1 + 99 = 100
\]

Now substitute back into the formula:

\[
S = \frac{99}{2} \times 100
\]

Calculate \( \frac{99}{2} \):

\[
\frac{99}{2} = 49.5
\]

Now multiply by 100:

\[
S = 49.5 \times 100 = 4950
\]

Thus, the sum of all integers from 1 to 99 is 4950.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all integers from 1 to 99 is 4950.
