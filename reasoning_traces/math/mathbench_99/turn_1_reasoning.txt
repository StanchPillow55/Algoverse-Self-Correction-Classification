Certainly! Let's tackle the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Sample math problem 99

Since the problem statement is not clear, let's assume a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes. Let's say the problem is:

"Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 99."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of all integers from 1 to 99. This is a classic arithmetic series problem.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)
   \]
   where:
   - \( n \) is the number of terms,
   - \( a \) is the first term,
   - \( l \) is the last term.

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The first term \( a = 1 \).
   - The last term \( l = 99 \).
   - The number of terms \( n = 99 \).

4. **Apply the Formula:**
   Substitute the values into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{99}{2} \times (1 + 99)
   \]

5. **Calculate the Sum:**
   - First, calculate the sum inside the parentheses:
     \[
     1 + 99 = 100
     \]
   - Then, multiply by the number of terms divided by 2:
     \[
     S = \frac{99}{2} \times 100 = 49.5 \times 100 = 4950
     \]

6. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure the calculation is correct, consider using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n = 99 \):
   \[
   S = \frac{99 \times 100}{2} = \frac{9900}{2} = 4950
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all integers from 1 to 99 is \( 4950 \).
