Question ID: mathbench_99
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 99," let's first clarify what this problem might entail. Since "Sample math problem 99" is not a standard or specific math problem, I'll assume it could be a placeholder for a variety of potential math problems. Let's consider a few possibilities and solve one of them:

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem
If "Sample math problem 99" refers to a simple arithmetic problem, it could be something like "What is 99 plus 1?"

**Solution:**
- Start with the number 99.
- Add 1 to 99.
- Calculation: \( 99 + 1 = 100 \).

**Final Answer:** 100

### Possibility 2: Algebraic Equation
If "Sample math problem 99" refers to solving an algebraic equation, it could be something like "Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( x + 99 = 0 \)."

**Solution:**
- Start with the equation: \( x + 99 = 0 \).
- To isolate \( x \), subtract 99 from both sides of the equation.
- Calculation: 
  \[
  x + 99 - 99 = 0 - 99 
  \]
  \[
  x = -99 
  \]

**Final Answer:** \( x = -99 \)

### Possibility 3: Word Problem
If "Sample math problem 99" refers to a word problem, it could be something like "If you have 99 apples and you give away 20, how many apples do you have left?"

**Solution:**
- Start with 99 apples.
- Subtract the 20 apples you give away.
- Calculation: \( 99 - 20 = 79 \).

**Final Answer:** 79 apples

### Conclusion
Without a specific problem statement, I have provided solutions to a few potential interpretations of "Sample math problem 99." If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details for a precise solution.
