==================================================

To solve the sample math problem "99," let's assume that the problem is asking us to perform some operations or find some properties related to the number 99. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll explore a few different mathematical aspects of the number 99.

### 1. Prime Factorization
First, let's find the prime factorization of 99.

- Start by dividing 99 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 99 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.
- Next, try dividing by 3. The sum of the digits of 99 is \(9 + 9 = 18\), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 99 is divisible by 3.
  \[
  99 \div 3 = 33
  \]
- Now, factor 33. Again, check divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 33 is \(3 + 3 = 6\), which is divisible by 3.
  \[
  33 \div 3 = 11
  \]
- Finally, 11 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 99 is:
\[
99 = 3^2 \times 11
\]

### 2. Divisors of 99
Using the prime factorization, we can find all the divisors of 99. The divisors are obtained by taking all combinations of the prime factors raised to their respective powers.

- \(3^0 \times 11^0 = 1\)
- \(3^1 \times 11^0 = 3\)
- \(3^2 \times 11^0 = 9\)
- \(3^0 \times 11^1 = 11\)
- \(3^1 \times 11^1 = 33\)
- \(3^2 \times 11^1 = 99\)

Thus, the divisors of 99 are: 1, 3, 9, 11, 33, and 99.

### 3. Properties of 99
- **Even or Odd**: 99 is an odd number because it is not divisible by 2.
- **Perfect Square**: 99 is not a perfect square because there is no integer \(n\) such that \(n^2 = 99\).
- **Perfect Cube**: 99 is not a perfect cube because there is no integer \(n\) such that \(n^3 = 99\).

### 4. Sum of Digits
The sum of the digits of 99 is:
\[
9 + 9 = 18
\]

### 5. Multiples of 99
Some multiples of 99 are:
- \(99 \times 1 = 99\)
- \(99 \times 2 = 198\)
- \(99 \times 3 = 297\)
- \(99 \times 4 = 396\)
- \(99 \times 5 = 495\)

### Conclusion
The number 99 has a prime factorization of \(3^2 \times 11\), divisors of 1, 3, 9, 11, 33, and 99, and is an odd number. The sum of its digits is 18. It is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube.

If the problem intended something specific with "99," please provide more details for a more targeted solution. Otherwise, this exploration covers various mathematical aspects of the number 99.
