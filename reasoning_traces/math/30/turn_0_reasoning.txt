Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio of their ages, which is 7:11.

1. **Define Variables**:
   Let Darrell's age be \( 7x \) and Allen's age be \( 11x \), where \( x \) is a common multiplier.

2. **Set Up the Equation**:
   According to the problem, the total of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   7x + 11x = 162
   \]

3. **Combine Like Terms**:
   Combine the terms on the left side:
   \[
   18x = 162
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 18:
   \[
   x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
   \]

5. **Calculate Their Current Ages**:
   Now that we have \( x \), we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:
   - Darrell's age:
     \[
     7x = 7 \times 9 = 63
     \]
   - Allen's age:
     \[
     11x = 11 \times 9 = 99
     \]

6. **Calculate Allen's Age in 10 Years**:
   To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
   \[
   99 + 10 = 109
   \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now will be:
   \[
   \boxed{109}
   \]
