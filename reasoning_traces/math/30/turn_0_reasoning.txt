To solve the problem, we will first determine how many pieces of pizza each person eats and then calculate how many pieces are left uneaten.

1. **Determine the total number of pizzas and pieces:**
   Each person buys 1 personal pan pizza, and each pizza is cut into 4 pieces. Since there are 4 people (Ann, Bill, Cate, and Dale), the total number of pizzas is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pizzas}
   \]
   The total number of pieces of pizza is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pizzas} \times 4 \text{ pieces per pizza} = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many pieces each person eats:**
   - **Bill and Dale eat 50% of their pizzas:**
     Each of them has 1 pizza, so they eat:
     \[
     50\% \text{ of } 4 \text{ pieces} = 0.5 \times 4 = 2 \text{ pieces}
     \]
     Therefore, both Bill and Dale eat:
     \[
     2 \text{ pieces (Bill)} + 2 \text{ pieces (Dale)} = 4 \text{ pieces}
     \]

   - **Ann and Cate eat 75% of their pizzas:**
     Each of them also has 1 pizza, so they eat:
     \[
     75\% \text{ of } 4 \text{ pieces} = 0.75 \times 4 = 3 \text{ pieces}
     \]
     Therefore, both Ann and Cate eat:
     \[
     3 \text{ pieces (Ann)} + 3 \text{ pieces (Cate)} = 6 \text{ pieces}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces eaten:**
   Now we can find the total number of pieces eaten by all four individuals:
   \[
   4 \text{ pieces (Bill and Dale)} + 6 \text{ pieces (Ann and Cate)} = 10 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of pieces left uneaten:**
   To find the number of pieces left uneaten, we subtract the total number of pieces eaten from the total number of pieces:
   \[
   16 \text{ total pieces} - 10 \text{ pieces eaten} = 6 \text{ pieces left uneaten}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
