==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pieces of pizza each person eats and then calculate how many pieces are left uneaten.

Each personal pan pizza is cut into 4 pieces. Therefore, each person starts with 4 pieces of pizza.

Let's break down the problem for each individual:

1. **Bill:**
   - Bill eats 50% of his pizza.
   - 50% of 4 pieces = 0.5 * 4 = 2 pieces.
   - Therefore, Bill eats 2 pieces and leaves 2 pieces uneaten.

2. **Dale:**
   - Dale also eats 50% of his pizza.
   - 50% of 4 pieces = 0.5 * 4 = 2 pieces.
   - Therefore, Dale eats 2 pieces and leaves 2 pieces uneaten.

3. **Ann:**
   - Ann eats 75% of her pizza.
   - 75% of 4 pieces = 0.75 * 4 = 3 pieces.
   - Therefore, Ann eats 3 pieces and leaves 1 piece uneaten.

4. **Cate:**
   - Cate eats 75% of her pizza.
   - 75% of 4 pieces = 0.75 * 4 = 3 pieces.
   - Therefore, Cate eats 3 pieces and leaves 1 piece uneaten.

Now, let's calculate the total number of uneaten pieces:

- Bill leaves 2 pieces uneaten.
- Dale leaves 2 pieces uneaten.
- Ann leaves 1 piece uneaten.
- Cate leaves 1 piece uneaten.

Adding these up gives us the total number of uneaten pieces:

\[ 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6 \]

Thus, the total number of pizza pieces left uneaten is 6.

**Final Answer: 6 pieces**
