Question ID: mathbench_472
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 472" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 472:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). The goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation.

   - Start with the equation:
     \[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

   - Subtract 5 from both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
     \[ 3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5 \]
     \[ 3x = 15 \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3} \]
   \[ x = 5 \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[ 3(5) + 5 = 20 \]
   \[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]
   \[ 20 = 20 \]

   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 5.
