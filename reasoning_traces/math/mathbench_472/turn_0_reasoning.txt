==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more information about "Sample math problem 472" as it is not specified in your request. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems by breaking down the steps typically involved. If you provide the specific details of the problem, I can tailor the solution accordingly. Here's a general approach:

### Step-by-Step Approach to Solving a Math Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the type of problem.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Recalculate if necessary to confirm the results.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.
   - Ensure the answer addresses the question posed.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's consider a simple example problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming the solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).
