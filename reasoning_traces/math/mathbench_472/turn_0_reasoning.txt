To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 472" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 472" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 472:**

A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 64 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Let the width of the rectangle be \( w \).
   - The length of the rectangle is 3 times the width, so the length is \( 3w \).
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
     \]
   - We are given that the perimeter is 64 units.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute the expressions for length and width into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     64 = 2 \times (3w + w)
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms inside the parentheses:
     \[
     64 = 2 \times (4w)
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     64 = 8w
     \]

4. **Solve for \( w \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 8 to isolate \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{64}{8} = 8
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length is 3 times the width:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 3w = 3 \times 8 = 24
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that the dimensions satisfy the original perimeter condition:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (24 + 8) = 2 \times 32 = 64
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 8 units
- Length = 24 units
