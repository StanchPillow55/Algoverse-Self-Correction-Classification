==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 500" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear, I'll assume it involves solving a math problem related to the number 500. Let's consider a few possibilities:

1. **Prime Factorization of 500:**

   To find the prime factorization of 500, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

   \[
   500 \div 2 = 250
   \]

   250 is still even, so we divide by 2 again:

   \[
   250 \div 2 = 125
   \]

   125 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since 125 is not divisible by 3, we try the next prime number, which is 5.

   \[
   125 \div 5 = 25
   \]

   25 is divisible by 5:

   \[
   25 \div 5 = 5
   \]

   Finally, 5 is divisible by 5:

   \[
   5 \div 5 = 1
   \]

   So, the prime factorization of 500 is:

   \[
   500 = 2^2 \times 5^3
   \]

2. **Sum of Digits of 500:**

   The sum of the digits of 500 is calculated as follows:

   \[
   5 + 0 + 0 = 5
   \]

3. **Is 500 a Perfect Square?**

   A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. To check if 500 is a perfect square, we find the square root of 500:

   \[
   \sqrt{500} \approx 22.36
   \]

   Since 22.36 is not an integer, 500 is not a perfect square.

4. **Divisors of 500:**

   To find the divisors of 500, we use its prime factorization \(2^2 \times 5^3\). The number of divisors can be found by adding 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and multiplying the results:

   \[
   (2+1)(3+1) = 3 \times 4 = 12
   \]

   The divisors of 500 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, and 500.

5. **Is 500 a Multiple of 10?**

   A number is a multiple of 10 if it ends in 0. Since 500 ends in 0, it is a multiple of 10.

Based on these analyses, if the problem was to determine the prime factorization of 500, the final answer would be:

\[
500 = 2^2 \times 5^3
\]

If the problem was to find the sum of the digits, the answer would be:

\[
5
\]

If the problem was to determine if 500 is a perfect square, the answer would be:

\[
\text{No, 500 is not a perfect square.}
\]

If the problem was to find the divisors of 500, the answer would be:

\[
1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, 500
\]

If the problem was to check if 500 is a multiple of 10, the answer would be:

\[
\text{Yes, 500 is a multiple of 10.}
\]

Without a specific question, these are the possible interpretations and solutions related to the number 500.
