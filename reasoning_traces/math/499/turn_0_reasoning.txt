==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Santo earned and then find the total earnings of both Salvadore and Santo.

1. **Identify Salvadore's earnings**: 
   Salvadore earned $1956.

2. **Calculate Santo's earnings**: 
   Santo earned half of what Salvadore earned. To find this, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Santo's earnings} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Salvadore's earnings}
   \]
   Substituting Salvadore's earnings into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Santo's earnings} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1956
   \]

   Now, we perform the calculation:
   \[
   \text{Santo's earnings} = \frac{1956}{2} = 978
   \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings of both men**: 
   To find the total earnings, we add Salvadore's earnings and Santo's earnings together:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Salvadore's earnings} + \text{Santo's earnings}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 1956 + 978
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 2934
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   The total amount of money that Salvadore and Santo earned together is:
   \[
   \boxed{2934}
   \]
