To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money both Salvadore and Santo earned together. We are given that Salvadore earned $1956 and Santo earned half of what Salvadore earned.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine Santo's Earnings:**
   - We know that Santo earned half of what Salvadore earned.
   - Salvadore's earnings = $1956.
   - Therefore, Santo's earnings = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 1956\).

2. **Calculate Santo's Earnings:**
   - To find half of $1956, we perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{1956}{2} = 978
   \]
   - So, Santo earned $978.

3. **Calculate the Total Earnings of Both Men:**
   - Now, we need to find the total amount earned by both Salvadore and Santo.
   - Total earnings = Salvadore's earnings + Santo's earnings.
   - Total earnings = $1956 + $978.

4. **Perform the Addition:**
   - Add the two amounts together:
   \[
   1956 + 978 = 2934
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money earned by Salvadore and Santo together is $2934.

**Final Answer:**
The two men earned a total of $2934 together.
