==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information or details about "Sample reasoning question 329." Since the question isn't provided, I'll guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem involving reasoning. Let's assume we have a typical math problem and solve it step by step.

### Problem:
Let's assume the problem is: "If a train travels 60 miles in 1.5 hours, what is its average speed in miles per hour?"

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the average speed of the train.
   - We know the distance traveled is 60 miles.
   - The time taken is 1.5 hours.

2. **Recall the Formula for Average Speed:**
   - Average speed is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Total Distance = 60 miles
   - Total Time = 1.5 hours
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{1.5 \text{ hours}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 60 by 1.5:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{60}{1.5} = 40 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - To ensure the calculation is correct, consider the division:
     - 60 divided by 1.5 can be thought of as multiplying 60 by the reciprocal of 1.5, which is \(\frac{2}{3}\).
     - So, \(60 \times \frac{2}{3} = 60 \times 0.6667 \approx 40\).

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The average speed of the train is 40 miles per hour.

### Conclusion:
By following these steps, we determined that the train's average speed is 40 miles per hour. This methodical approach ensures that all aspects of the problem are considered and the calculations are verified for accuracy.
