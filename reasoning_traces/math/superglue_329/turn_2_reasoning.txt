==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand the context and the specific question being asked. However, the problem statement "Sample reasoning question 329" is not clear or specific enough to provide a detailed solution. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific question that might be part of a larger set or database.

Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's consider a hypothetical reasoning problem and work through it step by step. I'll create a sample reasoning problem and solve it:

**Sample Reasoning Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 120 miles, at a constant speed. On the return trip, the train travels at a speed that is 20 miles per hour faster and takes 1 hour less to complete the journey. What is the speed of the train on the way to City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the speed of the train from City A to City B in miles per hour.
   - The speed of the train on the return trip is \( x + 20 \) miles per hour.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{120}{x}
     \]
   - The time taken for the return trip is:
     \[
     \frac{120}{x + 20}
     \]
   - According to the problem, the return trip takes 1 hour less than the trip to City B:
     \[
     \frac{120}{x} - \frac{120}{x + 20} = 1
     \]

3. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To solve the equation, first find a common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{120(x + 20) - 120x}{x(x + 20)} = 1
     \]
   - Simplify the numerator:
     \[
     120x + 2400 - 120x = 2400
     \]
   - So the equation becomes:
     \[
     \frac{2400}{x(x + 20)} = 1
     \]
   - Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     2400 = x(x + 20)
     \]
     \[
     2400 = x^2 + 20x
     \]
   - Rearrange into a standard quadratic equation:
     \[
     x^2 + 20x - 2400 = 0
     \]

4. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 20 \), and \( c = -2400 \):
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{20^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-2400)}}{2 \cdot 1}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{400 + 9600}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{10000}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm 100}{2}
     \]
   - This gives two potential solutions:
     \[
     x = \frac{80}{2} = 40
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-120}{2} = -60
     \]

5. **Interpret the Solution:**
   - Since speed cannot be negative, the only feasible solution is \( x = 40 \).

**Final Answer:**

The speed of the train on the way to City B is 40 miles per hour.
