Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 329" entails. Since the problem statement is not clear, let's assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. Without specific details, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by using a hypothetical example.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true. The equation is a simple linear equation in one variable.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. The equation is:

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

First, subtract 3 from both sides to get rid of the constant term on the left side:

\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 3: Solve for the Variable**

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

Calculate the left side:

\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This approach demonstrates a systematic method for solving a basic linear equation. If "Sample reasoning question 329" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details for a more specific solution.
