Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many math questions each girl completed in one hour and then calculate the total number of questions completed by all three girls in two hours.

1. **Determine the number of questions each girl completed in one hour:**

   - **Fiona:** Fiona completed 36 math questions in one hour.

   - **Shirley:** Shirley completed twice as many questions as Fiona. Therefore, the number of questions Shirley completed is:
     \[
     2 \times 36 = 72
     \]

   - **Kiana:** Kiana completed half of the sum of Fiona's and Shirley's questions. First, we find the sum of Fiona's and Shirley's questions:
     \[
     36 + 72 = 108
     \]
     Kiana completed half of this sum:
     \[
     \frac{108}{2} = 54
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of questions completed by all three girls in one hour:**

   Add the number of questions completed by Fiona, Shirley, and Kiana:
   \[
   36 + 72 + 54 = 162
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of questions completed by all three girls in two hours:**

   Since they each completed the same number of questions in the second hour as they did in the first hour, the total number of questions completed in two hours is:
   \[
   2 \times 162 = 324
   \]

Therefore, the total number of math questions completed by all three girls in 2 hours is \(\boxed{324}\).
