Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of questions completed by each girl in the first hour:**
   - Fiona completed 36 math questions in one hour.
   - Shirley completed twice as many questions as Fiona. Therefore, we calculate Shirley's total:
     \[
     \text{Shirley's questions} = 2 \times \text{Fiona's questions} = 2 \times 36 = 72
     \]
   - Kiana completed half of the sum of Fiona and Shirley's math questions. First, we need to find the sum of Fiona's and Shirley's questions:
     \[
     \text{Sum of Fiona's and Shirley's questions} = 36 + 72 = 108
     \]
     Now, we calculate Kiana's total:
     \[
     \text{Kiana's questions} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sum of Fiona's and Shirley's questions} = \frac{1}{2} \times 108 = 54
     \]

2. **Summarize the number of questions completed by each girl in the first hour:**
   - Fiona: 36 questions
   - Shirley: 72 questions
   - Kiana: 54 questions

3. **Calculate the total number of questions completed by all three girls in the first hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total questions in the first hour} = \text{Fiona's questions} + \text{Shirley's questions} + \text{Kiana's questions} = 36 + 72 + 54
   \]
   Performing the addition:
   \[
   36 + 72 = 108
   \]
   \[
   108 + 54 = 162
   \]
   So, the total number of questions completed in the first hour is 162.

4. **Determine the number of questions completed by each girl in the second hour:**
   Since they each did the same number of questions in the second hour as they did in the first hour, we can conclude:
   - Fiona: 36 questions
   - Shirley: 72 questions
   - Kiana: 54 questions

5. **Calculate the total number of questions completed by all three girls in the second hour:**
   The total for the second hour is the same as the first hour:
   \[
   \text{Total questions in the second hour} = 36 + 72 + 54 = 162
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of questions completed by all three girls in 2 hours:**
   \[
   \text{Total questions in 2 hours} = \text{Total questions in the first hour} + \text{Total questions in the second hour} = 162 + 162
   \]
   Performing the addition:
   \[
   162 + 162 = 324
   \]

Therefore, the total number of math questions completed by all three girls in 2 hours is \(\boxed{324}\).
