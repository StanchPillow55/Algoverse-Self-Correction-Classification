Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Count of Fairies**: Katelyn saw 50 fairies flying above the forest. So, we start with:
   \[
   \text{Initial fairies} = 50
   \]

2. **Fairies Joining from the East**: Katelyn's friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw. Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies, half of that is:
   \[
   \text{Fairies seen by friend} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
   \]
   These 25 fairies then joined the initial count of fairies. Therefore, the new total of fairies after the friend saw the fairies join is:
   \[
   \text{Total fairies after joining} = 50 + 25 = 75
   \]

3. **Fairies Flying Away**: Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. We need to subtract these from the current total:
   \[
   \text{Total fairies remaining} = 75 - 30 = 45
   \]

4. **Final Count of Fairies**: After all the calculations, the final count of fairies remaining is:
   \[
   \text{Final answer} = 45
   \]

Thus, the number of fairies remaining after all the events is \( \boxed{45} \).
