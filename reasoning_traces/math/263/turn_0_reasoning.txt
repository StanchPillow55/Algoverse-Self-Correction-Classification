==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of trees**: 
   John has a plot of 3 trees by 4 trees. This means he has:
   \[
   \text{Total trees} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ trees}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of apples produced**:
   Each tree gives 5 apples. Therefore, the total number of apples produced by all the trees is:
   \[
   \text{Total apples} = \text{Total trees} \times \text{Apples per tree} = 12 \times 5 = 60 \text{ apples}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the apples**:
   John sells each apple for $0.5. Thus, the total money he makes from selling all the apples is:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \text{Total apples} \times \text{Price per apple} = 60 \times 0.5
   \]
   Now we calculate:
   \[
   60 \times 0.5 = 30
   \]

4. **State the final answer**:
   Therefore, the total amount of money John makes from selling the apples is:
   \[
   \boxed{30} \text{ dollars}
   \]
