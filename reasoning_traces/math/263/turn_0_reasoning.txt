==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of trees**: John plants a plot of trees arranged in a grid of 3 trees by 4 trees. To find the total number of trees, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns:

   \[
   \text{Total number of trees} = 3 \times 4 = 12
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of apples**: Each tree gives 5 apples. To find the total number of apples produced by all the trees, we multiply the total number of trees by the number of apples each tree gives:

   \[
   \text{Total number of apples} = 12 \times 5 = 60
   \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the apples**: John sells each apple for $0.5. To find the total revenue, we multiply the total number of apples by the price per apple:

   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 60 \times 0.5 = 30
   \]

Thus, John makes a total of $30 from selling the apples.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{30}
\]
