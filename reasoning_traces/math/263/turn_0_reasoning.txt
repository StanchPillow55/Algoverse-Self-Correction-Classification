==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of trees Chris has:**
   Chris has 6 trees.

2. **Calculate the number of trees Ferdinand has:**
   According to the problem, Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. Therefore, we can calculate Ferdinand's trees as follows:
   \[
   \text{Ferdinand's trees} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Chris's trees} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of trees Harry has:**
   The problem states that Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. First, we need to find twice the number of trees Ferdinand has:
   \[
   \text{Twice Ferdinand's trees} = 2 \times \text{Ferdinand's trees} = 2 \times 3 = 6
   \]
   Now, we add 5 to this amount to find out how many trees Harry has:
   \[
   \text{Harry's trees} = 6 + 5 = 11
   \]

4. **Calculate how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard:**
   To find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's trees} - \text{Ferdinand's trees} = 11 - 3 = 8
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]
