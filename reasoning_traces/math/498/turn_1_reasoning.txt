Question ID: 498
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weight of the luggage that the 6 people are bringing and then see how much additional luggage weight the airplane can accommodate.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Bags:**
   Each of the 6 people has 5 bags. Therefore, the total number of bags is:
   \[
   6 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bags per person} = 30 \text{ bags}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Total Weight of the Bags:**
   Each bag weighs 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of the 30 bags is:
   \[
   30 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 1500 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine the Maximum Luggage Capacity of the Airplane:**
   The airplane can hold a total luggage weight of 6000 pounds.

4. **Calculate the Remaining Capacity for Additional Bags:**
   Subtract the total weight of the current luggage from the airplane's maximum capacity to find out how much more weight it can hold:
   \[
   6000 \text{ pounds} - 1500 \text{ pounds} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Determine How Many More Bags Can Be Added:**
   Since each additional bag weighs 50 pounds, we need to find out how many 50-pound bags can fit into the remaining 4500 pounds:
   \[
   \frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds per bag}} = 90 \text{ bags}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The airplane can hold 90 more bags at the maximum weight of 50 pounds each.
