Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much luggage weight the 6 people are bringing onto the airplane and then compare it to the airplane's total luggage capacity. Finally, we'll calculate how many more bags at the maximum weight the plane can accommodate.

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the luggage from the 6 people.**

Each person has 5 bags, and there are 6 people. Therefore, the total number of bags is:

\[ 6 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bags/person} = 30 \text{ bags} \]

Each bag weighs 50 pounds, so the total weight of these bags is:

\[ 30 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds/bag} = 1500 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 2: Determine the airplane's total luggage capacity and calculate the remaining capacity.**

The airplane can hold a total luggage weight of 6000 pounds. We already calculated that the 6 people are bringing 1500 pounds of luggage. Therefore, the remaining capacity for additional luggage is:

\[ 6000 \text{ pounds} - 1500 \text{ pounds} = 4500 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many more bags at maximum weight the plane can hold.**

Each additional bag weighs 50 pounds. To find out how many more bags can be accommodated, we divide the remaining capacity by the weight of one bag:

\[ \frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 90 \text{ bags} \]

**Conclusion:**

The airplane can hold 90 more bags at the maximum weight of 50 pounds each. Therefore, the final answer is:

90 bags.
