==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weight of the luggage that the 6 people are bringing and then see how much more weight the airplane can accommodate.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of bags.**

Each person has 5 bags, and there are 6 people. Therefore, the total number of bags is:

\[
6 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bags per person} = 30 \text{ bags}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total weight of these bags.**

Each bag weighs 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of the 30 bags is:

\[
30 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 1500 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the total luggage capacity of the airplane.**

The airplane can hold a total luggage weight of 6000 pounds.

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the airplane.**

Subtract the total weight of the passengers' luggage from the airplane's total luggage capacity:

\[
6000 \text{ pounds} - 1500 \text{ pounds} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 5: Determine how many more bags at maximum weight the plane can hold.**

Each additional bag weighs 50 pounds. To find out how many more bags can be accommodated, divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one bag:

\[
\frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds per bag}} = 90 \text{ bags}
\]

Therefore, the airplane can hold 90 more bags at the maximum weight of 50 pounds each.

**Final Answer:**

The plane can hold 90 more bags at maximum weight.
