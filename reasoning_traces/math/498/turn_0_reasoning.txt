==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much luggage weight the 6 people are bringing and how much additional weight the airplane can still accommodate.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of bags.**

Each of the 6 people has 5 bags. Therefore, the total number of bags is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total bags} = \text{Number of people} \times \text{Bags per person} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ bags}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the luggage.**

Each bag weighs the maximum allowed weight of 50 pounds. Thus, the total weight of all the bags can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Total bags} \times \text{Weight per bag} = 30 \times 50 = 1500 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the maximum weight capacity of the airplane.**

The airplane can hold a total luggage weight of 6000 pounds.

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the airplane.**

To find out how much more weight the airplane can hold, we subtract the total weight of the luggage from the maximum weight capacity of the airplane:

\[
\text{Remaining weight capacity} = \text{Maximum weight capacity} - \text{Total weight} = 6000 - 1500 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate how many additional bags can be added.**

Since each additional bag also weighs 50 pounds, we can determine how many more bags can be accommodated by dividing the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each bag:

\[
\text{Additional bags} = \frac{\text{Remaining weight capacity}}{\text{Weight per bag}} = \frac{4500}{50} = 90 \text{ bags}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The airplane can hold **90 more bags** at maximum weight.
