To solve the problem, we need to determine the percentage of the bonus that John received last year and then apply that same percentage to his current salary to find out how much he will make this year when adding both his total pay and bonus together.

### Step 1: Calculate the bonus percentage from last year

Last year, John made $100,000 and received a $10,000 bonus. We can find the bonus percentage by using the formula:

\[
\text{Bonus Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Bonus}}{\text{Salary}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Bonus Percentage} = \left( \frac{10,000}{100,000} \right) \times 100
\]

Calculating the fraction:

\[
\frac{10,000}{100,000} = 0.1
\]

Now, multiplying by 100 to convert to a percentage:

\[
0.1 \times 100 = 10\%
\]

So, John received a bonus of **10%** of his salary last year.

### Step 2: Calculate this year's bonus based on the current salary

This year, John makes $200,000. To find out how much his bonus will be this year, we apply the same bonus percentage (10%) to his current salary:

\[
\text{Bonus} = \text{Salary} \times \text{Bonus Percentage}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Bonus} = 200,000 \times 0.10
\]

Calculating the bonus:

\[
\text{Bonus} = 20,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total pay for this year

Now, we need to find out how much John will make this year when adding both his total pay and bonus together:

\[
\text{Total Pay} = \text{Salary} + \text{Bonus}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Pay} = 200,000 + 20,000
\]

Calculating the total pay:

\[
\text{Total Pay} = 220,000
\]

### Final Answer

John will make a total of **$220,000** this year when adding both his salary and bonus together.
