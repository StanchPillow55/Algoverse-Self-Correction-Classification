To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the weekly earnings from recycling**:
   - First, we need to find out how much Grayson earns from the aluminum cans and the plastic bottles she consumes each week.
   
   - **Earnings from aluminum cans**:
     - Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda each week.
     - Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
     - Therefore, the total earnings from aluminum cans in one week can be calculated as follows:
       \[
       \text{Earnings from aluminum cans} = \text{Number of cans} \times \text{Value per can} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ cents}
       \]

   - **Earnings from plastic bottles**:
     - Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water each week.
     - Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
     - Therefore, the total earnings from plastic bottles in one week can be calculated as follows:
       \[
       \text{Earnings from plastic bottles} = \text{Number of bottles} \times \text{Value per bottle} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ cents}
       \]

   - **Total weekly earnings**:
     - Now, we can find the total earnings from both aluminum cans and plastic bottles:
       \[
       \text{Total weekly earnings} = \text{Earnings from aluminum cans} + \text{Earnings from plastic bottles} = 6 + 15 = 21 \text{ cents}
       \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings for a four-week month**:
   - Since Grayson recycles every week, we need to multiply her weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a month (4 weeks):
     \[
     \text{Total monthly earnings} = \text{Total weekly earnings} \times \text{Number of weeks} = 21 \times 4 = 84 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Grayson earns a total of **84 cents** from recycling in a four-week month.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{84}
\]
