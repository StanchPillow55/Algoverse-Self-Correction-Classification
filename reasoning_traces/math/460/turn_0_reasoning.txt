To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage of John's bonus based on last year's figures and then apply that same percentage to this year's salary to find out how much his bonus will be this year. Finally, we'll add this year's salary and bonus to find his total earnings for the year.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Bonus Percentage from Last Year:**

   Last year, John's salary was $100,000, and his bonus was $10,000. To find the bonus percentage, we use the formula for percentage:

   \[
   \text{Bonus Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Bonus}}{\text{Salary}} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Plugging in the values from last year:

   \[
   \text{Bonus Percentage} = \left( \frac{10,000}{100,000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

   So, John's bonus percentage is 10%.

2. **Calculate This Year's Bonus:**

   This year, John's salary is $200,000. We will apply the same bonus percentage (10%) to this year's salary to find the bonus amount:

   \[
   \text{This Year's Bonus} = \left( \frac{10}{100} \right) \times 200,000 = 0.10 \times 200,000 = 20,000
   \]

   Therefore, John's bonus for this year is $20,000.

3. **Calculate Total Earnings for This Year:**

   To find John's total earnings for this year, we add his salary and his bonus:

   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Salary} + \text{Bonus} = 200,000 + 20,000 = 220,000
   \]

### Final Answer:

John will make $220,000 this year when adding both his total pay and bonus together.
