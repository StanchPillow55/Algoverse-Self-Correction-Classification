To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage of John's bonus based on last year's figures and then apply that same percentage to this year's salary to find out his bonus for this year. Finally, we'll add this year's salary and bonus to find his total earnings for this year.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Last Year's Bonus Percentage:**

   Last year, John's salary was $100,000, and he received a $10,000 bonus. To find the bonus percentage, we use the formula for percentage:

   \[
   \text{Bonus Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Bonus}}{\text{Salary}} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Plugging in the values from last year:

   \[
   \text{Bonus Percentage} = \left( \frac{10,000}{100,000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

   So, John's bonus was 10% of his salary last year.

2. **Calculate This Year's Bonus:**

   This year, John's salary is $200,000. Since the bonus percentage remains the same at 10%, we calculate this year's bonus as follows:

   \[
   \text{This Year's Bonus} = \left( \frac{10}{100} \right) \times 200,000 = 0.10 \times 200,000 = 20,000
   \]

   Therefore, John's bonus for this year is $20,000.

3. **Calculate Total Earnings for This Year:**

   To find John's total earnings for this year, we add his salary and his bonus:

   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Salary} + \text{Bonus} = 200,000 + 20,000 = 220,000
   \]

### Final Answer:

John will make $220,000 this year when adding both his total pay and bonus together.
