==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much John will make this year when we add his total pay and bonus together.

1. **Identify the bonus percentage from last year**:
   - Last year, John made $100,000 and received a $10,000 bonus.
   - To find the bonus percentage, we can use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Bonus Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Bonus}}{\text{Salary}}\right) \times 100
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Bonus Percentage} = \left(\frac{10,000}{100,000}\right) \times 100 = 10\%
     \]

2. **Calculate this year's bonus**:
   - This year, Johnâ€™s salary is $200,000.
   - Since the bonus percentage remains the same (10%), we can calculate this year's bonus:
     \[
     \text{Bonus} = \text{Salary} \times \text{Bonus Percentage}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Bonus} = 200,000 \times 0.10 = 20,000
     \]

3. **Calculate total earnings for this year**:
   - To find John's total earnings this year, we add his salary and his bonus:
     \[
     \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Salary} + \text{Bonus}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Total Earnings} = 200,000 + 20,000 = 220,000
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, John will make a total of **$220,000** this year when adding both his total pay and bonus together.

\[
\text{Final Answer: } 220,000
\]
