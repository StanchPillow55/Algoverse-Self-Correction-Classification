==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the percentage of John's bonus relative to his salary from last year and then apply that same percentage to this year's salary to find out how much he will make in total this year.

### Step 1: Calculate the bonus percentage from last year

Last year, John made $100,000 and received a $10,000 bonus. To find the bonus percentage, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Bonus Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Bonus}}{\text{Salary}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting in the values:

\[
\text{Bonus Percentage} = \left( \frac{10,000}{100,000} \right) \times 100
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Bonus Percentage} = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\%
\]

### Step 2: Apply the bonus percentage to this year's salary

This year, John makes $200,000. We will calculate his bonus for this year using the same percentage (10%).

\[
\text{Bonus for this year} = \left( \text{Bonus Percentage} \times \text{This Year's Salary} \right)
\]

Substituting in the values:

\[
\text{Bonus for this year} = 0.10 \times 200,000
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Bonus for this year} = 20,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total pay for this year

Now, we need to add John's salary and his bonus for this year to find his total pay.

\[
\text{Total Pay} = \text{This Year's Salary} + \text{Bonus for this year}
\]

Substituting in the values:

\[
\text{Total Pay} = 200,000 + 20,000
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total Pay} = 220,000
\]

### Final Answer

John will make a total of **$220,000** this year when adding both his total pay and bonus together.
