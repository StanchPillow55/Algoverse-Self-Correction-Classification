To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage of John's bonus and then apply that percentage to his current year's salary to find out how much he will make this year, including his bonus.

### Step 1: Determine the Bonus Percentage from Last Year

Last year, John's salary was $100,000, and he received a $10,000 bonus. To find the bonus percentage, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Bonus Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Bonus Amount}}{\text{Salary}}\right) \times 100
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
\text{Bonus Percentage} = \left(\frac{10,000}{100,000}\right) \times 100 = 10\%
\]

So, John's bonus is 10% of his salary.

### Step 2: Calculate This Year's Bonus

This year, John's salary is $200,000. To find his bonus for this year, we apply the 10% bonus percentage to his current salary:

\[
\text{Bonus for This Year} = 200,000 \times \frac{10}{100} = 200,000 \times 0.10 = 20,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Earnings for This Year

To find out how much John will make this year including his bonus, we add his salary and his bonus:

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Salary} + \text{Bonus} = 200,000 + 20,000 = 220,000
\]

### Final Answer

John will make $220,000 this year when adding both his total pay and bonus together.
