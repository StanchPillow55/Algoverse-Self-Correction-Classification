==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 455," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem 455:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to move the constant term to the right side:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   The value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

Thus, the final answer to the hypothetical problem is \( x = 5 \). If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 455," please provide the details, and I will solve it accordingly.
