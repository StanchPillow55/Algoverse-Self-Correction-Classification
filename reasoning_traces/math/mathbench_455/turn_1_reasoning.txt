Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 455," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 455" does not provide any specific mathematical question or context. Therefore, I will assume that "455" is a placeholder for a specific math problem that needs to be solved.

Since no specific problem is provided, I will create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 455 and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of the number 455.

**Solution:**

To find the prime factorization of 455, we need to express it as a product of prime numbers. We will do this by dividing 455 by the smallest prime numbers until we cannot divide anymore.

1. **Check divisibility by 2:**
   - 455 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

2. **Check divisibility by 3:**
   - To check if a number is divisible by 3, sum the digits of the number and see if the result is divisible by 3.
   - Sum of the digits of 455: \(4 + 5 + 5 = 14\).
   - 14 is not divisible by 3, so 455 is not divisible by 3.

3. **Check divisibility by 5:**
   - A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5.
   - 455 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.
   - Divide 455 by 5: \(455 \div 5 = 91\).

4. **Factor 91:**
   - Now we need to factor 91.
   - Check divisibility by 2: 91 is odd, so not divisible by 2.
   - Check divisibility by 3: Sum of digits of 91 is \(9 + 1 = 10\), which is not divisible by 3.
   - Check divisibility by 5: 91 does not end in 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5.
   - Check divisibility by 7: Divide 91 by 7: \(91 \div 7 = 13\).
   - 13 is a prime number.

5. **Prime factorization:**
   - We have divided 455 into 5, 7, and 13, all of which are prime numbers.
   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 455 is \(5 \times 7 \times 13\).

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 455 is \(5 \times 7 \times 13\).
