Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 455" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 455" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual content of the problem, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 455" is the following:

**Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Solution:**

Step 1: Understand the equation.
- The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).
- We need to solve for \( x \).

Step 2: Isolate the variable \( x \).
- To isolate \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.

\[
3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
\]

- Simplifying both sides gives:

\[
3x = 15
\]

Step 3: Solve for \( x \).
- Now, we need to isolate \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.

\[
\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
\]

- Simplifying both sides gives:

\[
x = 5
\]

Step 4: Verify the solution.
- Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]

- Simplifying the left side:

\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]

- Which simplifies to:

\[
20 = 20
\]

- Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 5.
