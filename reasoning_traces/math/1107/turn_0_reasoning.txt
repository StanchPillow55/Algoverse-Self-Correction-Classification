To find out how many girls are in the school, we first need to determine the total school population based on the information given about the boys.

1. **Understanding the percentage**: We know that 40% of the total school population is made up of boys. We are given that this 40% corresponds to 240 boys.

2. **Setting up the equation**: Let \( P \) represent the total school population. According to the problem, we can express the number of boys as:
   \[
   0.40P = 240
   \]

3. **Solving for \( P \)**: To find \( P \), we can rearrange the equation:
   \[
   P = \frac{240}{0.40}
   \]

4. **Calculating \( P \)**:
   \[
   P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 240 \div 0.40
   \]
   To divide by 0.40, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimal:
   \[
   P = \frac{240 \times 100}{40} = \frac{24000}{40} = 600
   \]

5. **Finding the number of girls**: Now that we know the total school population \( P \) is 600, we can find the number of girls. Since we know that 40% of the population are boys, the remaining percentage (which represents the girls) is:
   \[
   100\% - 40\% = 60\%
   \]

6. **Calculating the number of girls**: We can find the number of girls by calculating 60% of the total population:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times P = 0.60 \times 600
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 360
   \]

Thus, the total number of girls in the school is \( \boxed{360} \).
