Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve a problem effectively, it's important to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the question "Sample reasoning question 102" does not provide specific details or context about the problem to be solved. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem:** Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - Base (\(b\)) = 10 units
   - Height (\(h\)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   - Plug the values into the area formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

### Conclusion:
By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle to be 25 square units. This process demonstrates how to approach a math problem by understanding the problem, identifying given values, substituting into the appropriate formula, performing calculations, and stating the final answer. If you have a specific problem or additional context, please provide it, and I can assist further.
