==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I'll need more specific details about "Sample reasoning question 102" as it is not a standard or universally recognized problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving reasoning problems, which often involve logical thinking, pattern recognition, or mathematical calculations.

### General Approach to Solving Reasoning Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given information or constraints.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - Determine if it is a logical reasoning problem, a mathematical calculation, a pattern recognition task, or another type.

3. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Divide the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.
   - Solve each part step by step.

4. **Apply Relevant Techniques:**
   - Use logical deduction for reasoning problems.
   - Apply mathematical formulas or operations for calculation problems.
   - Look for sequences or patterns for pattern recognition tasks.

5. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that your solution satisfies all given conditions.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present your final answer.
   - Ensure it directly addresses the question asked.

### Example Problem and Solution:

Let's create a hypothetical reasoning problem to demonstrate the process:

**Problem:** 
A sequence of numbers is given as follows: 2, 4, 8, 16, ... What is the 7th term in this sequence?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the 7th term in the sequence.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - This is a pattern recognition problem involving a sequence of numbers.

3. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Observe the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
   - Notice that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2.

4. **Apply Relevant Techniques:**
   - The sequence is a geometric progression where each term is twice the previous term.
   - The first term (a) is 2, and the common ratio (r) is 2.
   - The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is: \( a_n = a \cdot r^{(n-1)} \).

5. **Calculate the 7th Term:**
   - Using the formula: \( a_7 = 2 \cdot 2^{(7-1)} = 2 \cdot 2^6 \).
   - Calculate \( 2^6 = 64 \).
   - Therefore, \( a_7 = 2 \cdot 64 = 128 \).

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The 7th term in the sequence is 128.
