==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 102" entails. Since the question is not specific, I will assume it is a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is twice its width. The perimeter of the field is 300 meters. What are the dimensions of the field?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 300 meters.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know \( P = 300 \) meters and \( L = 2W \).
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     300 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     300 = 4W + 2W
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     300 = 6W
     \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{300}{6} = 50
     \]

6. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute \( W = 50 \) into the equation for L:
     \[
     L = 2 \times 50 = 100
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the calculated dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(100) + 2(50) = 200 + 100 = 300
     \]
   - The perimeter is indeed 300 meters, which confirms our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the field are 100 meters in length and 50 meters in width.
