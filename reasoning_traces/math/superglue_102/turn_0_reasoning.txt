To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 102." Since the question is not provided, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving a math problem using logical reasoning. If you can provide the specific details of the problem, I can tailor the solution to that particular question.

### General Approach to Solving a Math Problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate strategy based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Once a solution is found, review the steps taken to ensure they are logical and correct.
   - Verify that the solution answers the question posed in the problem.
   - Check the calculations for any possible errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly state the final answer, ensuring it is in the correct form and includes appropriate units if necessary.

### Example Problem and Solution:

**Example Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the dimensions (length and width) of the rectangle.
   - The perimeter is given as 36 units.
   - The length is twice the width.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
   - Let the width be \( w \).
   - Then the length is \( 2w \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the expressions for length and width into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times 3w
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find the length:
     \[
     \text{length} = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are correct, and the perimeter matches the given value.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the rectangle are: width = 6 units, length = 12 units.

If you provide the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 102," I can offer a detailed solution tailored to that problem.
