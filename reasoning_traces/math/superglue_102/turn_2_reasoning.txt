Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand the context and the specific question being asked. However, the problem statement "Sample reasoning question 102" is not providing any specific mathematical problem or context to work with. Therefore, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step-by-step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends a total of $25, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( o \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we have two conditions:
     1. The total number of fruits is 10:  
        \[
        a + o = 10
        \]
     2. The total cost is $25:  
        \[
        2a + 3o = 25
        \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   a + o &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   2a + 3o &= 25 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution Method:**

   - Solve Equation 1 for \( a \):
     \[
     a = 10 - o
     \]

   - Substitute \( a = 10 - o \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     2(10 - o) + 3o = 25
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( o \):
     \[
     20 - 2o + 3o = 25
     \]
     \[
     20 + o = 25
     \]
     \[
     o = 25 - 20
     \]
     \[
     o = 5
     \]

   - Substitute \( o = 5 \) back into the expression for \( a \):
     \[
     a = 10 - o = 10 - 5 = 5
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Check the total number of fruits:
     \[
     a + o = 5 + 5 = 10
     \]
     This satisfies the first condition.

   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     2a + 3o = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25
     \]
     This satisfies the second condition.

5. **Conclusion:**

   The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.

### Final Answer:
The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.
