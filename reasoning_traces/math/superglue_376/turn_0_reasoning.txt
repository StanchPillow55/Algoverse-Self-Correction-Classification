To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 376." Since the question is not provided in detail, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving a math problem, which you can apply once you have the specific details of the question.

### General Approach to Solving a Math Problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the information given.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution:

**Example Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - We know the perimeter is 36 units and the length is twice the width.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2L + 2W \).
   - Let \( W \) be the width. Then \( L = 2W \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( W \):
     \[
     36 = 4W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6W
     \]
     \[
     W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find \( L \) using \( L = 2W \):
     \[
     L = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the rectangle are: Length = 12 units, Width = 6 units.

Once you have the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 376," you can apply this structured approach to find the solution. If you can provide the specific problem, I'd be happy to help solve it!
