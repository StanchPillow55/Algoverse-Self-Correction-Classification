==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 376" might entail. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. I'll create a hypothetical problem and demonstrate the step-by-step reasoning and solution process.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of gadgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $50 per unit, and for Type B, it is $70 per unit. The company sells Type A for $80 per unit and Type B for $100 per unit. If the company produces 200 units of Type A and 150 units of Type B, what is the total profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the total profit from selling two types of gadgets.
   - Profit is calculated as the difference between total revenue and total cost.

2. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Production cost for Type A = $50 per unit
   - Selling price for Type A = $80 per unit
   - Production cost for Type B = $70 per unit
   - Selling price for Type B = $100 per unit
   - Units produced for Type A = 200
   - Units produced for Type B = 150

3. **Calculate Total Revenue:**
   - Revenue from Type A = Selling price per unit * Number of units
     \[
     \text{Revenue from Type A} = 80 \times 200 = 16,000
     \]
   - Revenue from Type B = Selling price per unit * Number of units
     \[
     \text{Revenue from Type B} = 100 \times 150 = 15,000
     \]
   - Total Revenue = Revenue from Type A + Revenue from Type B
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = 16,000 + 15,000 = 31,000
     \]

4. **Calculate Total Cost:**
   - Cost for Type A = Production cost per unit * Number of units
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type A} = 50 \times 200 = 10,000
     \]
   - Cost for Type B = Production cost per unit * Number of units
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type B} = 70 \times 150 = 10,500
     \]
   - Total Cost = Cost for Type A + Cost for Type B
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 10,000 + 10,500 = 20,500
     \]

5. **Calculate Total Profit:**
   - Total Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = 31,000 - 20,500 = 10,500
     \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The total profit from producing and selling the gadgets is $10,500.

This step-by-step approach ensures that all calculations are clear and logical, leading to the final answer.
