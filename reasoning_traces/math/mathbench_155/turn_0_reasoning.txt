==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 155," I need to know the specific details or content of the problem. Since "Sample math problem 155" is not provided with any context or specific details, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - We are given:
     - Base (\(b\)) = 10 units
     - Height (\(h\)) = 5 units

2. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

3. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - First, multiply the base and height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

**Final Answer:**
The area of the triangle is 25 square units.
