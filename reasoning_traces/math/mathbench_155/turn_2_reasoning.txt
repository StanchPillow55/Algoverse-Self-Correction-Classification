Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 155," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 155" is not a specific math problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 155" is the following:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 155 positive integers.

**Solution:**

To find the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers.

In this case, \( n = 155 \). Plugging this value into the formula gives:

\[
S_{155} = \frac{155(155 + 1)}{2}
\]

First, calculate \( 155 + 1 \):

\[
155 + 1 = 156
\]

Next, multiply 155 by 156:

\[
155 \times 156 = 24180
\]

Now, divide 24180 by 2 to find the sum:

\[
S_{155} = \frac{24180}{2} = 12090
\]

Therefore, the sum of the first 155 positive integers is 12,090.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 155 positive integers is 12,090.
