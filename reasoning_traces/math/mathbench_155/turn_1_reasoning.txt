==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 155," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only mentions "Sample math problem 155" without providing any specific details or context. 

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 155" refers to a typical math problem that might involve basic arithmetic, algebra, geometry, or another area of mathematics. Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Sample math problem 155" could be a problem like this:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If "Sample math problem 155" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context so I can solve it accurately.
