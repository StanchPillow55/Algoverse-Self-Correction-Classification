To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of a head start the turtle needs in order to finish the 20-foot race at the same time as the hare.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the time it takes for the hare to finish the race:**

   The hare runs at a speed of 10 feet/second. To find out how long it takes the hare to run 20 feet, we use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]

   Substituting the given values:

   \[
   \text{Time for hare} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/second}} = 2 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. **Determine the time it takes for the turtle to finish the race without a head start:**

   The turtle crawls at a speed of 1 foot/second. Using the same formula:

   \[
   \text{Time for turtle} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ foot/second}} = 20 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the head start needed for the turtle:**

   To finish the race at the same time as the hare, the turtle needs to complete the race in the same 2 seconds that the hare does. Therefore, we need to find out how much of the race the turtle can complete in 2 seconds:

   \[
   \text{Distance turtle covers in 2 seconds} = 1 \text{ foot/second} \times 2 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ feet}
   \]

   Since the turtle needs to cover 20 feet in total, the remaining distance is:

   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}
   \]

   The turtle needs to cover these 18 feet before the hare starts. Since the turtle moves at 1 foot/second, the head start in time is:

   \[
   \text{Head start in seconds} = \frac{18 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ foot/second}} = 18 \text{ seconds}
   \]

### Final Answer:

The turtle needs a head start of **18 seconds** to finish the race in a tie with the hare.
