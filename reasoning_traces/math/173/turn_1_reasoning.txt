==================================================

To determine how much of a head start the turtle needs to finish in a tie with the hare in a 20-foot race, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the speeds of the pets**:
   - The hare runs at a speed of 10 feet/second.
   - The turtle crawls at a speed of 1 foot/second.

2. **Calculate the time it takes for the hare to finish the race**:
   The distance of the race is 20 feet. We can use the formula for time, which is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   For the hare:
   \[
   \text{Time}_{\text{hare}} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/second}} = 2 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Determine how far the turtle can crawl in the same time**:
   We need to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 2 seconds:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_{\text{turtle}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{turtle}} \times \text{Time} = 1 \text{ foot/second} \times 2 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Calculate the distance the turtle needs to cover**:
   Since the turtle can only cover 2 feet in the time it takes the hare to finish the race, it needs to cover the remaining distance to reach 20 feet:
   \[
   \text{Distance remaining for turtle} = 20 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}
   \]

5. **Calculate the time it takes for the turtle to cover the remaining distance**:
   Now we need to find out how long it will take the turtle to cover the remaining 18 feet at its speed of 1 foot/second:
   \[
   \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{18 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ foot/second}} = 18 \text{ seconds}
   \]

6. **Determine the head start needed**:
   Since the hare takes 2 seconds to finish the race, and the turtle needs a total of 18 seconds to finish after the hare has already started, we can find the head start time:
   \[
   \text{Head start} = \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} - \text{Time}_{\text{hare}} = 18 \text{ seconds} - 2 \text{ seconds} = 16 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Thus, the turtle needs a head start of **16 seconds** to finish in a tie with the hare.

Final answer: **16 seconds**.
