Question ID: 173
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much of a head start the turtle needs in seconds to finish the race in a tie with the hare, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the speeds of the animals**:
   - The hare runs at a speed of 10 feet/second.
   - The turtle crawls at a speed of 1 foot/second.

2. **Determine the distance of the race**:
   - The race is 20 feet long.

3. **Calculate the time it takes for the hare to finish the race**:
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - For the hare:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{hare}} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/second}} = 2 \text{ seconds}
     \]

4. **Calculate the time it takes for the turtle to finish the race without a head start**:
   - For the turtle:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ foot/second}} = 20 \text{ seconds}
     \]

5. **Determine the difference in time between the hare and the turtle**:
   - The hare finishes the race in 2 seconds, while the turtle finishes in 20 seconds. The difference in time is:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} - \text{Time}_{\text{hare}} = 20 \text{ seconds} - 2 \text{ seconds} = 18 \text{ seconds}
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - To finish in a tie, the turtle needs a head start of 18 seconds. This means that the turtle can start the race 18 seconds before the hare starts running.

Thus, the final answer is that the turtle needs a head start of **18 seconds** to finish in a tie with the hare.
