==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of a head start in seconds the turtle needs to finish a 20-foot race at the same time as the hare.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the time it takes for each animal to finish the race without a head start:**

   - **Hare's speed:** 10 feet/second
   - **Distance of the race:** 20 feet

   The time it takes for the hare to finish the race is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time for hare} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/second}} = 2 \text{ seconds}
   \]

   - **Turtle's speed:** 1 foot/second

   The time it takes for the turtle to finish the race is:
   \[
   \text{Time for turtle} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ foot/second}} = 20 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the head start needed for the turtle:**

   Since the hare takes 2 seconds to finish the race, we want the turtle to also finish in 2 seconds. However, without a head start, the turtle takes 20 seconds. Therefore, the turtle needs a head start that reduces its race time from 20 seconds to 2 seconds.

   The head start in seconds is:
   \[
   \text{Head start needed} = \text{Time for turtle} - \text{Time for hare} = 20 \text{ seconds} - 2 \text{ seconds} = 18 \text{ seconds}
   \]

### Final Answer:

The turtle needs a head start of 18 seconds to finish the race in a tie with the hare.
