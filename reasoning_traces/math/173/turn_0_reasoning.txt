==================================================

To determine how much of a head start the turtle needs to finish in a tie with the hare in a 20-foot race, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the speeds of the animals**:
   - The hare runs at a speed of 10 feet/second.
   - The turtle crawls at a speed of 1 foot/second.

2. **Calculate the time it takes for the hare to finish the race**:
   The distance of the race is 20 feet. We can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   For the hare:
   \[
   \text{Time}_{\text{hare}} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/second}} = 2 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Determine how far the turtle can crawl in the same time**:
   In 2 seconds, the turtle will crawl:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_{\text{turtle}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{turtle}} \times \text{Time} = 1 \text{ foot/second} \times 2 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Calculate the distance the turtle needs to cover**:
   Since the turtle can only cover 2 feet in the time it takes the hare to finish the race, the turtle still needs to cover:
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance for turtle} = 20 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}
   \]

5. **Calculate the time it takes for the turtle to cover the remaining distance**:
   We can again use the time formula:
   \[
   \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{18 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ foot/second}} = 18 \text{ seconds}
   \]

6. **Determine the total time the turtle needs to finish the race**:
   The turtle needs 18 seconds to cover the remaining distance after the hare has finished. However, since the hare finishes in 2 seconds, we need to calculate how much earlier the turtle should start to finish at the same time as the hare.

7. **Calculate the head start time**:
   The turtle needs to start 18 seconds before the hare finishes. Since the hare finishes in 2 seconds, the head start time for the turtle is:
   \[
   \text{Head start} = \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} - \text{Time}_{\text{hare}} = 18 \text{ seconds} - 2 \text{ seconds} = 16 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Thus, the turtle needs a head start of **16 seconds** to finish the race in a tie with the hare.

**Final Answer**: The turtle needs a head start of **16 seconds**.
