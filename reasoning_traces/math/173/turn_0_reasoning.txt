To determine how much Jessica will pay in a year on her debts, we first need to calculate the total minimum payments for each of her debts and then find out how much she will pay if she decides to pay 50% more than the minimum.

1. **Identify the minimum payments:**
   - Student loans: $300/month
   - Credit card: $200/month
   - Mortgage: $500/month

2. **Calculate the total minimum payment per month:**
   \[
   \text{Total minimum payment} = \text{Student loans} + \text{Credit card} + \text{Mortgage}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total minimum payment} = 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \text{ dollars/month}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount Jessica wants to pay each month:**
   Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first calculate 50% of the total minimum payment:
   \[
   50\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.5 \times 1000 = 500 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Now, we add this amount to the total minimum payment to find out how much she will pay each month:
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \text{Total minimum payment} + 50\% \text{ of Total minimum payment}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = 1000 + 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars/month}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total payment in a year:**
   To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by the number of months in a year (12):
   \[
   \text{Total payment in a year} = \text{Monthly payment} \times 12
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total payment in a year} = 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Jessica will pay on all her debts in a year is \(\boxed{18000}\) dollars.
