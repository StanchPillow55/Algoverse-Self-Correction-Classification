To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of a head start, in seconds, the turtle needs in order to finish the race at the same time as the hare.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine the time it takes for each animal to finish the race without any head start:**

   - **Hare:**
     - Speed of the hare = 10 feet/second
     - Distance of the race = 20 feet
     - Time taken by the hare to finish the race = Distance / Speed
     \[
     \text{Time for hare} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/second}} = 2 \text{ seconds}
     \]

   - **Turtle:**
     - Speed of the turtle = 1 foot/second
     - Distance of the race = 20 feet
     - Time taken by the turtle to finish the race = Distance / Speed
     \[
     \text{Time for turtle} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ foot/second}} = 20 \text{ seconds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the head start needed for the turtle:**

   The goal is for both the hare and the turtle to finish the race at the same time. Since the hare takes 2 seconds to finish the race, we need to determine how much time the turtle should start before the hare so that both finish simultaneously.

   - The turtle takes 20 seconds to finish the race, while the hare takes 2 seconds. Therefore, the turtle needs to start earlier by the difference in their times to finish the race.

   \[
   \text{Head start for turtle} = \text{Time for turtle} - \text{Time for hare} = 20 \text{ seconds} - 2 \text{ seconds} = 18 \text{ seconds}
   \]

### Final Answer:

The turtle needs a head start of 18 seconds to finish the race in a tie with the hare.
