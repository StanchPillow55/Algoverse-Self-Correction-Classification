==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 7," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume a generic math problem and solve it step-by-step. For this example, let's consider a problem involving solving a linear equation:

**Problem:** Solve the equation \(3x + 5 = 20\).

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**

The equation given is \(3x + 5 = 20\). This is a linear equation in one variable, \(x\). Our goal is to find the value of \(x\) that makes this equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \(x\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

1. **Subtract 5 from both sides:**  
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \(x\):**  
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

**Step 3: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \(x = 5\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

Substitute \(x = 5\) into \(3x + 5 = 20\):
\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]
Calculate the left side:
\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]
Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \(x = 5\) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \(3x + 5 = 20\) is \(x = 5\).
