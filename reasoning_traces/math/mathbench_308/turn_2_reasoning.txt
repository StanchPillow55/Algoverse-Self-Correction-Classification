==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 308" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 308" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 308" is the following:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the type of equation:**
   The given equation is a quadratic equation in the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a = 3 \), \( b = -12 \), and \( c = 9 \).

2. **Simplify the equation:**
   First, check if the equation can be simplified by dividing all terms by a common factor. Here, all coefficients are divisible by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x^2}{3} - \frac{12x}{3} + \frac{9}{3} = 0 \implies x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0
   \]

3. **Factor the quadratic equation:**
   We need to find two numbers that multiply to \( c = 3 \) and add to \( b = -4 \). The numbers \(-1\) and \(-3\) satisfy these conditions:
   \[
   (x - 1)(x - 3) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x - 1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 1
   \]
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3
   \]

5. **Verify the solutions:**
   Substitute \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   - For \( x = 1 \):
     \[
     3(1)^2 - 12(1) + 9 = 3 - 12 + 9 = 0
     \]
   - For \( x = 3 \):
     \[
     3(3)^2 - 12(3) + 9 = 27 - 36 + 9 = 0
     \]

Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the equation \( 3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0 \) are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \).
