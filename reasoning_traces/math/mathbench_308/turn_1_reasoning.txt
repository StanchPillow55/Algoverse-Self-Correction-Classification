==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 308" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem scenario. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem 308:**
A rectangular garden has a length that is 3 meters longer than its width. The area of the garden is 70 square meters. What are the dimensions of the garden?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the garden in meters.
   - Then the length of the garden will be \( w + 3 \) meters.

2. **Write the Equation for Area:**
   - The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values, we have:
     \[
     70 = (w + 3) \times w
     \]

3. **Expand the Equation:**
   - Distribute \( w \) in the equation:
     \[
     70 = w^2 + 3w
     \]

4. **Rearrange the Equation:**
   - Move all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:
     \[
     w^2 + 3w - 70 = 0
     \]

5. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = -70 \).

6. **Calculate the Discriminant:**
   - The discriminant \( \Delta \) is:
     \[
     \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 3^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-70) = 9 + 280 = 289
     \]

7. **Find the Roots:**
   - Since the discriminant is positive, there are two real roots:
     \[
     w = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{289}}{2 \times 1}
     \]
   - Calculate the square root of 289:
     \[
     \sqrt{289} = 17
     \]
   - So the roots are:
     \[
     w = \frac{-3 + 17}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7
     \]
     \[
     w = \frac{-3 - 17}{2} = \frac{-20}{2} = -10
     \]

8. **Select the Valid Solution:**
   - Since width cannot be negative, we take \( w = 7 \).

9. **Find the Length:**
   - The length is \( w + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10 \).

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the garden are 7 meters in width and 10 meters in length.
