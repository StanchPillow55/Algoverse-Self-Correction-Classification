==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 308," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 308" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 48 units, so:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 48
     \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for L:**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute \( L \) in the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(2W) + 2W = 48
     \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the left side:
     \[
     4W + 2W = 48
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     6W = 48
     \]

6. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to find W:
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{6} = 8
     \]

7. **Find L Using the Relationship Between L and W:**
   - Since \( L = 2W \):
     \[
     L = 2 \times 8 = 16
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the perimeter is indeed 48 with these dimensions:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 2(16) + 2(8) = 32 + 16 = 48
     \]
   - The calculation is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 8 units
- Length (L) = 16 units
