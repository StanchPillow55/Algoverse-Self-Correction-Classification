==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many shells Robert collected on Monday:**
   - According to the problem, Robert collects 20 shells on Monday.

2. **Calculate how many shells Kylie collected on Monday:**
   - The problem states that Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert.
   - Therefore, we can calculate Kylie's collection as follows:
     \[
     \text{Kylie's shells on Monday} = \text{Robert's shells} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
     \]

3. **Determine how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday:**
   - The problem states that Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday.
   - To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2:
     \[
     \text{Kylie's shells on Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Kylie's shells on Monday} = 2 \times 25 = 50
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday is:
     \[
     \boxed{50}
     \]
