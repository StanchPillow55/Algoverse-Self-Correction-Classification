==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many beakers without copper ions were tested before all 8 beakers with copper ions were found. 

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - There are 22 beakers in total.
   - 8 of these beakers contain copper ions.
   - Each test requires 3 drops of solution.
   - A total of 45 drops are used to find all 8 beakers with copper ions.

2. **Calculate the Number of Tests Conducted:**
   - Since each test uses 3 drops, we can find the total number of tests conducted by dividing the total number of drops by the number of drops per test:
     \[
     \text{Number of tests} = \frac{45 \text{ drops}}{3 \text{ drops/test}} = 15 \text{ tests}
     \]

3. **Determine the Number of Beakers with Copper Ions Found:**
   - All 8 beakers with copper ions are found after 15 tests.

4. **Determine the Number of Beakers without Copper Ions Tested:**
   - Out of the 15 tests conducted, 8 tests resulted in finding beakers with copper ions. Therefore, the remaining tests must have been conducted on beakers without copper ions.
   - The number of beakers without copper ions tested is:
     \[
     \text{Number of beakers without copper ions tested} = 15 \text{ tests} - 8 \text{ tests with copper ions} = 7 \text{ tests}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, 7 beakers without copper ions were tested before all 8 beakers with copper ions were found.

The final answer is that 7 beakers without copper ions were tested.
