==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many beakers without copper ions were tested before all 8 beakers with copper ions were found.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - There are a total of 22 beakers.
   - Out of these, 8 beakers contain copper ions.
   - This means that there are \( 22 - 8 = 14 \) beakers that do not contain copper ions.
   - Each test on a beaker uses 3 drops of the solution.
   - A total of 45 drops were used in testing the beakers.

2. **Calculating the Number of Beakers Tested**:
   - Since each test uses 3 drops, we can find out how many tests were conducted by dividing the total number of drops by the number of drops per test:
   \[
   \text{Number of tests} = \frac{45 \text{ drops}}{3 \text{ drops/test}} = 15 \text{ tests}
   \]

3. **Finding the Number of Beakers with Copper Ions Found**:
   - We know that there are 8 beakers with copper ions. The problem states that all 8 beakers with copper ions were found during the testing.
   - Therefore, out of the 15 tests conducted, 8 tests correspond to the beakers with copper ions.

4. **Calculating the Number of Beakers without Copper Ions Tested**:
   - Since 8 tests were for beakers with copper ions, the remaining tests must have been for beakers without copper ions:
   \[
   \text{Number of tests for beakers without copper ions} = 15 \text{ tests} - 8 \text{ tests} = 7 \text{ tests}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - The number of beakers without copper ions that were tested is 7.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]
