To solve the problem, we need to calculate the cost of two different mixtures of almonds and walnuts and then find the difference in cost between them.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts).**

1. **Cost of almonds:**
   - The cost of almonds is $10 per pound.
   - For 1/2 pound of almonds:
     \[
     \text{Cost of almonds} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ pound} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pound} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of walnuts:**
   - The cost of walnuts is $15 per pound.
   - For 1/3 pound of walnuts:
     \[
     \text{Cost of walnuts} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ pound} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pound} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total cost of the first mixture:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of almonds} + \text{Cost of walnuts} = 5 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts).**

1. **Cost of almonds:**
   - For 1/5 pound of almonds:
     \[
     \text{Cost of almonds} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ pound} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pound} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of walnuts:**
   - For 1/3 pound of walnuts (same as before):
     \[
     \text{Cost of walnuts} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ pound} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pound} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total cost of the second mixture:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of almonds} + \text{Cost of walnuts} = 2 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 7 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Step 3: Find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.**
\[
\text{Difference in cost} = \text{Cost of first mixture} - \text{Cost of second mixture} = 10 \text{ dollars} - 7 \text{ dollars} = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**
The mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs **$3 more** than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.
