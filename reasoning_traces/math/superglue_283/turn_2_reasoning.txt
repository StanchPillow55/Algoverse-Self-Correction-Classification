==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first break down the question and understand what is being asked. However, the question "Sample reasoning question 283" is not specific or detailed enough to provide a direct solution. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here. 

To proceed, I'll assume that this is a hypothetical math problem and demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning question step by step. Let's consider a common type of math problem and solve it:

**Example Problem:**

"Find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 4 \).
