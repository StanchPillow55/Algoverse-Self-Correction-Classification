==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 283" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $50, and the profit from each unit of product B is $70. The company can produce a maximum of 200 units of product A and 150 units of product B per month. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 300 units per month. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Write the Objective Function:**
   - The objective is to maximize the total profit, \( P \).
   - Profit from product A = \( 50x \).
   - Profit from product B = \( 70y \).
   - Total profit, \( P = 50x + 70y \).

3. **Write the Constraints:**
   - \( x \leq 200 \) (maximum units of product A).
   - \( y \leq 150 \) (maximum units of product B).
   - \( x + y \leq 300 \) (total production constraint).

4. **Set Up the Linear Programming Problem:**
   - Maximize \( P = 50x + 70y \)
   - Subject to:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x & \leq 200, \\
     y & \leq 150, \\
     x + y & \leq 300, \\
     x, y & \geq 0.
     \end{align*}
     \]

5. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the lines \( x = 200 \), \( y = 150 \), and \( x + y = 300 \) on a graph.
   - Identify the feasible region that satisfies all constraints.

6. **Find the Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are where the lines intersect:
     - Intersection of \( x = 200 \) and \( x + y = 300 \): \( (200, 100) \).
     - Intersection of \( y = 150 \) and \( x + y = 300 \): \( (150, 150) \).
     - Intersection of \( x = 200 \) and \( y = 150 \): \( (200, 150) \).

7. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - At \( (200, 100) \): \( P = 50(200) + 70(100) = 10000 + 7000 = 17000 \).
   - At \( (150, 150) \): \( P = 50(150) + 70(150) = 7500 + 10500 = 18000 \).
   - At \( (200, 150) \): \( P = 50(200) + 70(150) = 10000 + 10500 = 20500 \).

8. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 20500 \) at the point \( (200, 150) \).

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 200 units of product A and 150 units of product B to maximize its profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $20,500.
