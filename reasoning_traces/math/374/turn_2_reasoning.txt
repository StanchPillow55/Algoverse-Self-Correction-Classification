==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much milk Mary collects from her sheep each day. Let's break down the information given step by step.

1. **Total number of sheep**: Mary has 30 sheep.

2. **Dividing the sheep into two groups**: 
   - Half of the sheep produce 1 kg of milk each day.
   - The other half produce 2 kg of milk each day.

   Since Mary has 30 sheep, we can calculate how many sheep are in each group:
   \[
   \text{Number of sheep in each group} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]
   So, there are 15 sheep that produce 1 kg of milk and 15 sheep that produce 2 kg of milk.

3. **Calculating the milk from the first group**:
   - The first group has 15 sheep, each producing 1 kg of milk.
   \[
   \text{Total milk from the first group} = 15 \text{ sheep} \times 1 \text{ kg/sheep} = 15 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Calculating the milk from the second group**:
   - The second group also has 15 sheep, each producing 2 kg of milk.
   \[
   \text{Total milk from the second group} = 15 \text{ sheep} \times 2 \text{ kg/sheep} = 30 \text{ kg}
   \]

5. **Calculating the total milk collected**:
   - Now, we add the milk collected from both groups to find the total amount of milk Mary collects each day.
   \[
   \text{Total milk collected} = \text{Total milk from the first group} + \text{Total milk from the second group}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total milk collected} = 15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is **45 kg**.

Final answer: **45 kg**.
