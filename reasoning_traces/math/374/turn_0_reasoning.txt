To solve the problem, we need to determine how much milk Mary collects from her 30 sheep each day. 

1. **Identify the number of sheep in each group**:
   - Mary has a total of 30 sheep.
   - The problem states that she gets 1 kg of milk from half of them and 2 kg of milk from the other half.
   - Half of 30 sheep is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Half of 30} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 15 sheep that produce 1 kg of milk each and 15 sheep that produce 2 kg of milk each.

2. **Calculate the milk collected from the first group of sheep**:
   - The first group consists of 15 sheep, each producing 1 kg of milk.
   - The total milk from this group is:
     \[
     \text{Milk from first group} = 15 \text{ sheep} \times 1 \text{ kg/sheep} = 15 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Calculate the milk collected from the second group of sheep**:
   - The second group also consists of 15 sheep, each producing 2 kg of milk.
   - The total milk from this group is:
     \[
     \text{Milk from second group} = 15 \text{ sheep} \times 2 \text{ kg/sheep} = 30 \text{ kg}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total milk collected each day**:
   - To find the total amount of milk collected from both groups, we add the milk from the first group and the second group:
     \[
     \text{Total milk} = \text{Milk from first group} + \text{Milk from second group}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total milk} = 15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg}
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is:
     \[
     \boxed{45 \text{ kg}}
     \]
