To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step and calculate the number of buyers for each day based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the number of buyers on the day before yesterday:**
   - We are told that the day before yesterday had 50 buyers.

   \[
   \text{Buyers on the day before yesterday} = 50
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of buyers yesterday:**
   - The problem states that there were half the number of buyers yesterday as there were the day before. Therefore, we can calculate the number of buyers yesterday as follows:

   \[
   \text{Buyers yesterday} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Buyers on the day before yesterday} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of buyers today:**
   - We are informed that there are 40 more buyers today than there were yesterday. Thus, we can find the number of buyers today:

   \[
   \text{Buyers today} = \text{Buyers yesterday} + 40 = 25 + 40 = 65
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of buyers over the three days:**
   - Now that we have the number of buyers for each day, we can sum them up to find the total number of buyers who visited the store over the three days.

   \[
   \text{Total buyers} = \text{Buyers on the day before yesterday} + \text{Buyers yesterday} + \text{Buyers today}
   \]

   Substituting the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Total buyers} = 50 + 25 + 65
   \]

   Now, performing the addition:

   \[
   50 + 25 = 75
   \]
   \[
   75 + 65 = 140
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total number of buyers who have visited the store in the three days is:

   \[
   \boxed{140}
   \]
