==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of buyers for each of the three days and then sum them up to find the total number of buyers over the three days.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of buyers on the first day:**

   According to the problem, the day before yesterday had 50 buyers. Let's denote the number of buyers on the first day as \( B_1 \).

   \[
   B_1 = 50
   \]

2. **Determine the number of buyers on the second day:**

   The problem states that there were half the number of buyers yesterday as there were the day before. This means the number of buyers on the second day, \( B_2 \), is half of the number of buyers on the first day.

   \[
   B_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times B_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

3. **Determine the number of buyers on the third day:**

   The problem states that there are 40 more buyers today than yesterday. This means the number of buyers on the third day, \( B_3 \), is 40 more than the number of buyers on the second day.

   \[
   B_3 = B_2 + 40 = 25 + 40 = 65
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of buyers over the three days:**

   To find the total number of buyers over the three days, we sum the number of buyers for each day:

   \[
   \text{Total buyers} = B_1 + B_2 + B_3 = 50 + 25 + 65
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total buyers} = 140
   \]

Therefore, the total number of buyers who visited the store over the three days is \(\boxed{140}\).
