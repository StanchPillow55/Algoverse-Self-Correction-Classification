==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much milk Mary collects from her sheep each day based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the total number of sheep**: Mary has a total of 30 sheep.

2. **Divide the sheep into two groups**: The problem states that half of the sheep produce 1 kg of milk each day, and the other half produce 2 kg of milk each day. Since Mary has 30 sheep, we can calculate how many sheep are in each group:
   \[
   \text{Number of sheep in each group} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]
   So, there are 15 sheep that produce 1 kg of milk and 15 sheep that produce 2 kg of milk.

3. **Calculate the total milk from the first group**: The first group of 15 sheep produces 1 kg of milk each. Therefore, the total milk from this group is:
   \[
   \text{Total milk from first group} = 15 \text{ sheep} \times 1 \text{ kg/sheep} = 15 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total milk from the second group**: The second group of 15 sheep produces 2 kg of milk each. Therefore, the total milk from this group is:
   \[
   \text{Total milk from second group} = 15 \text{ sheep} \times 2 \text{ kg/sheep} = 30 \text{ kg}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total milk collected each day**: To find the total amount of milk Mary collects each day, we add the milk from both groups together:
   \[
   \text{Total milk collected} = \text{Total milk from first group} + \text{Total milk from second group}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total milk collected} = 15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is **45 kg**.

Final answer: **45 kg**
