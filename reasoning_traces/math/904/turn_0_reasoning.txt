==================================================

To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we first need to determine the total number of tickets she purchased and then use that information to calculate the average ticket price.

1. **Determine the total number of movies**: 
   Deepa has seen 9 Fast and the Furious movies.

2. **Determine how many times she saw each movie**: 
   She has seen each movie 3 times.

3. **Calculate the total number of tickets purchased**:
   \[
   \text{Total tickets} = \text{Number of movies} \times \text{Number of times per movie}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total tickets} = 9 \times 3 = 27
   \]

4. **Determine the total amount spent**: 
   Deepa has spent a total of $216 on tickets.

5. **Calculate the average price per ticket**:
   The average price per ticket can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Total tickets}}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27}
   \]

6. **Perform the division**:
   \[
   \text{Average price per ticket} = 8
   \]

Thus, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is **$8**.

Final answer:
\[
\text{Average price per ticket} = \boxed{8}
\]
