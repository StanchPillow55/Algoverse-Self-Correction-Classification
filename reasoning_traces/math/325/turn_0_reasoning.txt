==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers.**
2. **Calculate the number of senior programmers.**
3. **Calculate the monthly salary for senior programmers.**
4. **Calculate the total salary for all programmers.**

### Step 1: Determine the number of junior programmers

We know that the total number of employees in the company is 100. According to the problem, the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of senior programmers

Since there are 100 employees in total and 40 of them are junior programmers, we can find the number of senior programmers by subtracting the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees.

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the monthly salary for senior programmers

We know that junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. The problem states that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.

\[
\text{Salary of senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total salary for all programmers

Now we can calculate the total salary for junior programmers and senior programmers separately, and then sum them up.

**Total salary for junior programmers:**

\[
\text{Total salary for junior programmers} = \text{Number of junior programmers} \times \text{Salary of junior programmers}
\]
\[
= 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

**Total salary for senior programmers:**

\[
\text{Total salary for senior programmers} = \text{Number of senior programmers} \times \text{Salary of senior programmers}
\]
\[
= 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

**Total salary for all programmers:**

\[
\text{Total salary for all programmers} = \text{Total salary for junior programmers} + \text{Total salary for senior programmers}
\]
\[
= 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is **$224,000**.
