==================================================

To solve the problem, we will calculate the number of questions Bob created in each hour based on the information provided.

1. **First Hour:**
   - Bob created 13 questions in the first hour.
   - Questions created in the first hour = 13.

2. **Second Hour:**
   - Bob doubled his rate from the first hour. 
   - Therefore, the number of questions created in the second hour = 2 × 13 = 26.

3. **Third Hour:**
   - Bob doubled his second hour rate.
   - Therefore, the number of questions created in the third hour = 2 × 26 = 52.

Now, we will sum the number of questions created in all three hours:

\[
\text{Total questions} = \text{Questions in first hour} + \text{Questions in second hour} + \text{Questions in third hour}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total questions} = 13 + 26 + 52
\]

Now, we will perform the addition step by step:

- First, add the questions from the first and second hours:
  \[
  13 + 26 = 39
  \]

- Next, add the result to the questions from the third hour:
  \[
  39 + 52 = 91
  \]

Thus, the total number of questions Bob created in the three hours is:

\[
\boxed{91}
\]
