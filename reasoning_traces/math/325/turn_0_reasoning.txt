Question ID: 325
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many questions Bob created in each of the three hours and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Determine the number of questions created in the first hour.**

Bob created 13 questions in the first hour.

\[
\text{Questions in the first hour} = 13
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of questions created in the second hour.**

Bob doubled his rate from the first hour for the second hour. This means he created twice as many questions in the second hour as he did in the first hour.

\[
\text{Questions in the second hour} = 2 \times 13 = 26
\]

**Step 3: Determine the number of questions created in the third hour.**

Bob doubled his rate again for the third hour, meaning he created twice as many questions in the third hour as he did in the second hour.

\[
\text{Questions in the third hour} = 2 \times 26 = 52
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of questions created in the three hours.**

To find the total number of questions Bob created, we sum the questions from each hour:

\[
\text{Total questions} = \text{Questions in the first hour} + \text{Questions in the second hour} + \text{Questions in the third hour}
\]

\[
\text{Total questions} = 13 + 26 + 52
\]

\[
\text{Total questions} = 91
\]

Therefore, the total number of questions Bob created in the three hours is \(\boxed{91}\).
