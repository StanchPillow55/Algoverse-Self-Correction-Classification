Question ID: 66
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the down payment**: 
   The laptop costs $1000, and the shop requires a 20% down payment. 

   \[
   \text{Down payment} = 20\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = 200
   \]

2. **Determine Tara's total initial payment**: 
   Tara wants to pay an additional $20 for the down payment. Thus, her total initial payment will be:

   \[
   \text{Total initial payment} = \text{Down payment} + \text{Additional payment} = 200 + 20 = 220
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining balance after the down payment**: 
   After making the down payment, we need to find out how much Tara still owes on the laptop.

   \[
   \text{Remaining balance} = \text{Cost of laptop} - \text{Total initial payment} = 1000 - 220 = 780
   \]

4. **Calculate the monthly installment payments**: 
   Tara will pay $65 per month. We need to find out how much she will have paid after 4 months.

   \[
   \text{Total paid after 4 months} = 4 \times 65 = 260
   \]

5. **Determine the balance after 4 months of payments**: 
   To find the remaining balance after 4 months of payments, we subtract the total amount paid from the remaining balance.

   \[
   \text{Balance after 4 months} = \text{Remaining balance} - \text{Total paid after 4 months} = 780 - 260 = 520
   \]

Thus, after paying for 4 months, Tara's balance will be:

\[
\boxed{520}
\]
