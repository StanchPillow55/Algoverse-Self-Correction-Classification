==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the down payment**: The laptop costs $1000, and a 20% down payment is required.
2. **Determine the total amount paid after 4 months**: We will calculate how much Tara pays in installments over 4 months.
3. **Calculate the remaining balance after 4 months**: We will subtract the total amount paid from the initial cost of the laptop.

### Step 1: Calculate the Down Payment

The down payment is 20% of the total cost of the laptop.

\[
\text{Down Payment} = 20\% \times 1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = 200
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Total Amount Paid After 4 Months

Tara will pay $65 per month for 4 months. We can calculate the total amount paid in installments:

\[
\text{Total Paid in 4 Months} = 65 \times 4 = 260
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Remaining Balance

First, we need to find out how much Tara has paid in total after the down payment and the installments. The total amount paid includes the down payment and the installments:

\[
\text{Total Paid} = \text{Down Payment} + \text{Total Paid in 4 Months}
\]
\[
\text{Total Paid} = 200 + 260 = 460
\]

Now, we will calculate the remaining balance after Tara has made these payments:

\[
\text{Remaining Balance} = \text{Cost of Laptop} - \text{Total Paid}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining Balance} = 1000 - 460 = 540
\]

### Final Answer

After paying for 4 months, Tara's balance will be **$540**.
