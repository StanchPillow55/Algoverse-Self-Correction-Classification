==================================================

First, let's calculate the down payment. The down payment is 20% of the total cost of the laptop. 

20% of $1000 is (20/100) * $1000 = $200.

Tara wants to pay an additional $20 for the down payment, so her total down payment will be $200 + $20 = $220.

After making the down payment, the remaining balance on the laptop will be the total cost of the laptop minus the down payment. 

So, $1000 - $220 = $780.

This is the amount Tara will need to pay in installments of $65 per month. 

After paying for 4 months, Tara will have paid 4 * $65 = $260.

To find out how much her balance will be after paying for 4 months, we subtract the amount she has paid from the remaining balance after the down payment.

So, $780 - $260 = $520.

Therefore, Tara's balance after paying for 4 months will be $520.
