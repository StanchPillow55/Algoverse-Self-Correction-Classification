To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of people sent by the four schools to the basketball tournament. We will break down the components of the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of teams per school**:
   - Each school has sent a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team.
   - Therefore, each school has a total of:
     \[
     2 \text{ teams (1 girls' team + 1 boys' team)}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of players per team**:
   - Each team consists of 5 players.
   - Thus, for each school, the total number of players is:
     \[
     2 \text{ teams} \times 5 \text{ players/team} = 10 \text{ players}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of players for all schools**:
   - There are 4 schools participating in the tournament.
   - Therefore, the total number of players from all schools is:
     \[
     4 \text{ schools} \times 10 \text{ players/school} = 40 \text{ players}
     \]

4. **Count the number of coaches**:
   - Each school has sent a coach for each team, which means each school has:
     \[
     2 \text{ coaches (1 for girls' team + 1 for boys' team)}
     \]
   - For 4 schools, the total number of coaches is:
     \[
     4 \text{ schools} \times 2 \text{ coaches/school} = 8 \text{ coaches}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of people sent by all schools**:
   - Now, we need to add the total number of players and coaches together:
     \[
     40 \text{ players} + 8 \text{ coaches} = 48 \text{ people}
     \]

Thus, the total number of people sent by all of the schools to the basketball tournament is:

\[
\boxed{48}
\]
