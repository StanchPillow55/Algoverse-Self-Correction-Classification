Question ID: 66
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the down payment**: The laptop costs $1000, and the down payment is 20% of this amount.
2. **Determine the total amount paid after 4 months**: We will calculate how much Tara pays in installments over 4 months.
3. **Calculate the remaining balance**: We will subtract the total amount paid (down payment + installments) from the total cost of the laptop.

### Step 1: Calculate the Down Payment
The down payment is 20% of the total cost of the laptop.

\[
\text{Down Payment} = 20\% \times 1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = 200
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Total Amount Paid After 4 Months
Tara pays $65 per month for 4 months. We will calculate the total amount paid in installments.

\[
\text{Total Installments Paid} = 65 \times 4 = 260
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Amount Paid
Now, we will add the down payment to the total installments paid to find the total amount Tara has paid after 4 months.

\[
\text{Total Amount Paid} = \text{Down Payment} + \text{Total Installments Paid}
\]
\[
\text{Total Amount Paid} = 200 + 260 = 460
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Remaining Balance
Finally, we will subtract the total amount paid from the total cost of the laptop to find the remaining balance.

\[
\text{Remaining Balance} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Total Amount Paid}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining Balance} = 1000 - 460 = 540
\]

### Final Answer
After paying for 4 months, Tara's balance will be **$540**.
