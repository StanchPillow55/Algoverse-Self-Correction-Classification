==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Cows**: 
   - There are 10 stalls, and each stall has 20 cows.
   - Therefore, the total number of cows in all stalls is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cows} = \text{Number of stalls} \times \text{Cows per stall} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ cows}
     \]

2. **New Cows Purchased**:
   - Mr. Sylas buys 40 additional cows.

3. **Total Cows After Purchase**:
   - We need to find the new total number of cows after Mr. Sylas adds the 40 cows:
     \[
     \text{New total cows} = \text{Initial total cows} + \text{New cows} = 200 + 40 = 240 \text{ cows}
     \]

4. **Dividing New Cows Among Stalls**:
   - Mr. Sylas divides the 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls.
   - To find out how many new cows go into each stall, we perform the following calculation:
     \[
     \text{New cows per stall} = \frac{\text{Total new cows}}{\text{Number of stalls}} = \frac{40}{20} = 2 \text{ cows per stall}
     \]

5. **Total Cows in Each Stall**:
   - Each stall originally had 20 cows. After adding the 2 new cows, the total number of cows in each stall becomes:
     \[
     \text{Total cows per stall} = \text{Original cows per stall} + \text{New cows per stall} = 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ cows per stall}
     \]

6. **Calculating Cows in 8 Stalls**:
   - Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls:
     \[
     \text{Cows in 8 stalls} = \text{Cows per stall} \times \text{Number of stalls} = 22 \times 8 = 176 \text{ cows}
     \]

Finally, the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
\[
\boxed{176}
\]
