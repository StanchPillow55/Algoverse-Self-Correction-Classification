Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of cows in the stalls.**
   - There are 10 stalls, and each stall has 20 cows.
   - Total initial cows = Number of stalls × Cows per stall
   \[
   \text{Total initial cows} = 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of new cows Mr. Sylas buys.**
   - Mr. Sylas buys 40 new cows.

3. **Calculate the total number of cows after the purchase.**
   - Total cows after purchase = Initial cows + New cows
   \[
   \text{Total cows after purchase} = 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows}
   \]

4. **Determine how many cows are placed in each stall after dividing the new cows.**
   - The 40 new cows are to be divided equally among the 20 stalls.
   - Cows per stall from new cows = Total new cows / Number of stalls
   \[
   \text{Cows per stall from new cows} = \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of cows in each stall after the new cows are added.**
   - Each stall originally had 20 cows, and now each stall receives an additional 2 cows.
   \[
   \text{Total cows per stall} = \text{Original cows per stall} + \text{Cows per stall from new cows}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cows per stall} = 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows/stall}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls.**
   - Total cows in 8 stalls = Cows per stall × Number of stalls
   \[
   \text{Total cows in 8 stalls} = 22 \text{ cows/stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows}
   \]

Finally, the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
\[
\boxed{176}
\]
