==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine Matt's current age and then calculate what his age will be 10 years from now.

1. **Determine Bush's Current Age:**
   - According to the problem, Bush will be 12 years old this year. Therefore, Bush's current age is 12 years.

2. **Determine Matt's Current Age:**
   - The problem states that Bush is younger than Matt by 3 years. This means Matt is 3 years older than Bush.
   - Since Bush is currently 12 years old, we can calculate Matt's current age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Matt's current age} = \text{Bush's current age} + 3 = 12 + 3 = 15
     \]
   - Therefore, Matt is currently 15 years old.

3. **Calculate Matt's Age 10 Years from Now:**
   - To find out how old Matt will be 10 years from now, we simply add 10 years to his current age:
     \[
     \text{Matt's age 10 years from now} = \text{Matt's current age} + 10 = 15 + 10 = 25
     \]

Thus, Matt will be 25 years old 10 years from now.

**Final Answer:**
Matt will be 25 years old 10 years from now.
