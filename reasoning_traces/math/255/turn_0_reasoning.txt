==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine Matt's current age based on the information given about Bush's age.

1. **Identify Bush's current age**: 
   We know from the problem that Bush is currently 12 years old.

2. **Determine Matt's current age**: 
   The problem states that Bush is younger than Matt by 3 years. Therefore, we can find Matt's age by adding 3 years to Bush's age:
   \[
   \text{Matt's age} = \text{Bush's age} + 3
   \]
   Substituting Bush's age:
   \[
   \text{Matt's age} = 12 + 3 = 15
   \]
   So, Matt is currently 15 years old.

3. **Calculate Matt's age 10 years from now**: 
   To find out how old Matt will be in 10 years, we simply add 10 years to his current age:
   \[
   \text{Matt's age in 10 years} = \text{Matt's current age} + 10
   \]
   Substituting Matt's current age:
   \[
   \text{Matt's age in 10 years} = 15 + 10 = 25
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, Matt will be 25 years old 10 years from now.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]
