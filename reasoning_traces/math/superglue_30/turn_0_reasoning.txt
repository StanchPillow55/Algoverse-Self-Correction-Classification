==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about what "Sample reasoning question 30" entails. Since the question is not fully provided, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. In one month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and earned $28,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we will set up a system of equations based on the information provided.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of widgets sold is 500. This gives us our first equation:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue from selling the widgets is $28,000. This gives us our second equation:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 28,000
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**

   We will use the substitution or elimination method. Here, I'll use the substitution method:

   - Solve the first equation for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 500 - y
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 500 - y \) into the second equation:
     \[
     50(500 - y) + 70y = 28,000
     \]

   - Distribute the 50:
     \[
     25,000 - 50y + 70y = 28,000
     \]

   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     25,000 + 20y = 28,000
     \]

   - Subtract 25,000 from both sides:
     \[
     20y = 3,000
     \]

   - Divide both sides by 20:
     \[
     y = 150
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 150 \) back into the equation \( x = 500 - y \):
     \[
     x = 500 - 150 = 350
     \]

4. **Check the solution:**

   - Verify the total number of widgets:
     \[
     x + y = 350 + 150 = 500
     \]
     This matches the given total.

   - Verify the total revenue:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 50(350) + 70(150) = 17,500 + 10,500 = 28,000
     \]
     This matches the given revenue.

5. **State the final answer:**

The company sold 350 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets.
