==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 30" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that involves reasoning and calculations. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of products, A and B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 150 units of product B per day. The profit from each unit of product A is $5, and the profit from each unit of product B is $3. The company wants to maximize its profit, but it cannot produce more than 200 units in total per day due to labor constraints. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of inequalities and use linear programming to find the optimal solution.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced per day.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced per day.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The objective is to maximize the profit, \( P \).
   - Profit from product A = \( 5x \).
   - Profit from product B = \( 3y \).
   - Therefore, the objective function is: 
     \[
     P = 5x + 3y
     \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A:
     \[
     x \leq 100
     \]
   - The company can produce a maximum of 150 units of product B:
     \[
     y \leq 150
     \]
   - The total production cannot exceed 200 units:
     \[
     x + y \leq 200
     \]
   - Non-negativity constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is determined by the intersection of the half-planes defined by the inequalities.

5. **Find the vertices of the feasible region:**
   - Intersection of \( x + y = 200 \) and \( x = 100 \):
     \[
     100 + y = 200 \implies y = 100 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (100, 100)
     \]
   - Intersection of \( x + y = 200 \) and \( y = 150 \):
     \[
     x + 150 = 200 \implies x = 50 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (50, 150)
     \]
   - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 150 \):
     \[
     (0, 150)
     \]
   - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( y = 0 \):
     \[
     (100, 0)
     \]

6. **Evaluate the objective function at each vertex:**
   - At \( (100, 100) \): \( P = 5(100) + 3(100) = 500 + 300 = 800 \)
   - At \( (50, 150) \): \( P = 5(50) + 3(150) = 250 + 450 = 700 \)
   - At \( (0, 150) \): \( P = 5(0) + 3(150) = 0 + 450 = 450 \)
   - At \( (100, 0) \): \( P = 5(100) + 3(0) = 500 + 0 = 500 \)

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 800 \), which occurs when the company produces 100 units of product A and 100 units of product B.

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 100 units of product A and 100 units of product B to maximize its profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $800 per day.
