==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 30" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume a typical math problem scenario and demonstrate a step-by-step reasoning process.

### Assumed Problem Statement:
Let's assume the problem is as follows: 

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 30 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 30 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 30 units, so:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 30
     \]

4. **Substitute the Relationship Between Length and Width:**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute \( L \) in the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(2W) + 2W = 30
     \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     4W + 2W = 30
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     6W = 30
     \]

6. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{30}{6} = 5
     \]

7. **Find the Length Using the Relationship:**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute \( W = 5 \) into the equation for \( L \):
     \[
     L = 2 \times 5 = 10
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 2(10) + 2(5) = 20 + 10 = 30
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 5 units
- Length (L) = 10 units

This completes the solution to the assumed problem based on the given instructions. If the actual problem differs, please provide more details for a specific solution.
