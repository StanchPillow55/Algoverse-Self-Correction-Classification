==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 30" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical problem and work through it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels the first half of the distance at a speed of 60 miles per hour and the second half at a speed of 40 miles per hour. What is the average speed of the train for the entire journey?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Total distance = 300 miles.
   - Distance for the first half = 300 miles / 2 = 150 miles.
   - Distance for the second half = 150 miles.
   - Speed for the first half = 60 mph.
   - Speed for the second half = 40 mph.

2. **Calculate the Time for Each Half:**
   - Time for the first half = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 60 mph = 2.5 hours.
   - Time for the second half = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 40 mph = 3.75 hours.

3. **Calculate the Total Time:**
   - Total time = Time for the first half + Time for the second half
   - Total time = 2.5 hours + 3.75 hours = 6.25 hours.

4. **Calculate the Average Speed:**
   - Average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Average speed = 300 miles / 6.25 hours = 48 mph.

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the calculations for time and speed are consistent with the given data.
   - Ensure that the units are consistent (miles and hours).

**Final Answer:**

The average speed of the train for the entire journey is 48 miles per hour.

This step-by-step approach ensures that we thoroughly understand and solve the problem, checking each part of the calculation for accuracy.
