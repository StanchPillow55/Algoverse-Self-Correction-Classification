==================================================

To solve the sample math problem labeled as "340," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 340" does not provide specific details or context, I'll create a hypothetical math problem with the number 340 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Find the prime factorization of the number 340."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify if 340 is even or odd:**
   - Since 340 ends in a 0, it is an even number. Therefore, it is divisible by 2.

2. **Divide 340 by 2:**
   \[
   340 \div 2 = 170
   \]
   - So, 340 can be expressed as \(2 \times 170\).

3. **Check if 170 is divisible by 2:**
   - 170 is also an even number (it ends in 0), so it is divisible by 2.

4. **Divide 170 by 2:**
   \[
   170 \div 2 = 85
   \]
   - Now, 340 can be expressed as \(2 \times 2 \times 85\).

5. **Check if 85 is divisible by 2:**
   - 85 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2. We move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

6. **Check if 85 is divisible by 3:**
   - To check divisibility by 3, sum the digits of 85: \(8 + 5 = 13\). Since 13 is not divisible by 3, 85 is not divisible by 3.

7. **Check if 85 is divisible by 5:**
   - Since 85 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5.

8. **Divide 85 by 5:**
   \[
   85 \div 5 = 17
   \]
   - Now, 340 can be expressed as \(2 \times 2 \times 5 \times 17\).

9. **Check if 17 is a prime number:**
   - A prime number has no divisors other than 1 and itself. The numbers less than 17 are 2, 3, 4, and so on. 17 is not divisible by any of these numbers, so 17 is a prime number.

10. **Write the complete prime factorization:**
    - The prime factorization of 340 is \(2^2 \times 5 \times 17\).

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 340 is \(2^2 \times 5 \times 17\).
