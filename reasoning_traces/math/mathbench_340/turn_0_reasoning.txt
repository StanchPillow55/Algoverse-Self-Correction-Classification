==================================================

To solve the problem, I'll first need to understand what "Sample math problem 340" refers to. Since I don't have the specific details of this problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 340" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 340" is the following:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 15 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Equation:**
   We have the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 = 2x + 15
   \]

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side.

   - Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides to start isolating \( x \):
     \[
     3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 15 - 2x
     \]
     Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     x + 5 = 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 5 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
     \]
     Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     x = 10
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 10 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(10) + 5 = 2(10) + 15
   \]
   Simplifying both sides:
   \[
   30 + 5 = 20 + 15
   \]
   \[
   35 = 35
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 10 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 15 \) is \( x = 10 \).
