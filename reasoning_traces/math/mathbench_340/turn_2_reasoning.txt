==================================================

To solve the problem, "Sample math problem 340," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 340" is not specific and does not provide any details about what needs to be solved. 

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 340" refers to a typical math problem that might involve basic arithmetic, algebra, geometry, or another area of mathematics. Since no specific details are provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Math Problem:
Let's assume "Sample math problem 340" is an algebra problem involving solving a linear equation. Here's the problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 13 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 5 = 13
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 340," please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
