Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 340" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 15 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 5 = 15
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant:

   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 10
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{10}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   2(5) + 5 = 15
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   10 + 5 = 15
   \]

   \[
   15 = 15
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 5.
