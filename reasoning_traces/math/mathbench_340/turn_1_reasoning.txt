==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 340," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 340" without any specific details or questions. 

Since there is no specific math problem given, I will create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 340 and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Find the prime factorization of the number 340.

**Solution:**

To find the prime factorization of 340, we need to break it down into its prime factors. A prime factor is a factor that is a prime number.

**Step 1: Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.**

340 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2. We divide 340 by 2:

\[ 340 \div 2 = 170 \]

So, 2 is a prime factor, and we are left with 170.

**Step 2: Continue with 170.**

170 is also an even number, so it is divisible by 2. We divide 170 by 2:

\[ 170 \div 2 = 85 \]

So, another 2 is a prime factor, and we are left with 85.

**Step 3: Check 85 for divisibility by the next smallest prime number, which is 3.**

To check if 85 is divisible by 3, we add the digits of 85: \( 8 + 5 = 13 \). Since 13 is not divisible by 3, 85 is not divisible by 3.

**Step 4: Check 85 for divisibility by the next smallest prime number, which is 5.**

The last digit of 85 is 5, which means 85 is divisible by 5. We divide 85 by 5:

\[ 85 \div 5 = 17 \]

So, 5 is a prime factor, and we are left with 17.

**Step 5: Check if 17 is a prime number.**

17 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and itself.

**Conclusion:**

The prime factorization of 340 is:

\[ 340 = 2 \times 2 \times 5 \times 17 \]

Or, using exponents to express repeated factors:

\[ 340 = 2^2 \times 5 \times 17 \]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 340 is \( 2^2 \times 5 \times 17 \).
