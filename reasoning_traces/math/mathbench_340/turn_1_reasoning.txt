==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 340," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 340" is not specific and doesn't provide any details about what the problem entails. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem that needs to be solved.

Since there is no specific problem given, let's create a hypothetical math problem with the number 340 and solve it. Here's a possible problem:

**Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of the number 340.

**Solution:**

To find the prime factorization of 340, we need to break it down into its prime factors. Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of prime numbers.

1. **Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2:**

   - Check if 340 is divisible by 2. Since 340 is an even number, it is divisible by 2.
   - Divide 340 by 2: 
     \[
     340 \div 2 = 170
     \]

2. **Continue with 170:**

   - Check if 170 is divisible by 2. Since 170 is also an even number, it is divisible by 2.
   - Divide 170 by 2:
     \[
     170 \div 2 = 85
     \]

3. **Continue with 85:**

   - Check if 85 is divisible by 2. Since 85 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.
   - Move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Check if 85 is divisible by 3 by adding its digits (8 + 5 = 13). Since 13 is not divisible by 3, 85 is not divisible by 3.
   - Move to the next prime number, which is 5. Check if 85 is divisible by 5. Since 85 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5.
   - Divide 85 by 5:
     \[
     85 \div 5 = 17
     \]

4. **Continue with 17:**

   - Check if 17 is a prime number. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself. Since 17 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than itself (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13), it is a prime number.

Now we have expressed 340 as a product of prime numbers:

\[
340 = 2 \times 2 \times 5 \times 17
\]

5. **Write the prime factorization:**

The prime factorization of 340 is \(2^2 \times 5 \times 17\).

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 340 is \(2^2 \times 5 \times 17\).
