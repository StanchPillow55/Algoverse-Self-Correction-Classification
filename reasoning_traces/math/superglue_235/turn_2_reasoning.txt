==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. The phrase "Sample reasoning question 235" doesn't provide specific details about the mathematical problem to be solved. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems using logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help solve it.

Here's a general approach to solving a math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully to understand what is being asked.
   - Identify the key information and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Determine the mathematical concepts or formulas that apply to the problem.
   - Consider different strategies, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work and reasoning.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Double-check calculations and ensure that all parts of the problem have been addressed.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
