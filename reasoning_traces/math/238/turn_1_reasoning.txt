Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cookies Jack needs to sell to reach his goal of making $50, given the sales he has already made.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount Jack has already made.**

1. **Brownies:**
   - Jack sold 4 brownies at $3 each.
   - Total from brownies = 4 brownies × $3/brownie = $12.

2. **Lemon Squares:**
   - Jack sold 5 lemon squares at $2 each.
   - Total from lemon squares = 5 lemon squares × $2/lemon square = $10.

3. **Total from brownies and lemon squares:**
   - Total = $12 (from brownies) + $10 (from lemon squares) = $22.

**Step 2: Determine how much more money Jack needs to reach his goal.**

- Jack's goal is to make $50.
- Amount needed = Goal - Amount already made = $50 - $22 = $28.

**Step 3: Calculate how many cookies Jack needs to sell to make the remaining $28.**

- Each cookie sells for $4.
- Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Jack needs to sell.
- The equation to find \( x \) is: \( 4x = 28 \).

**Step 4: Solve for \( x \).**

- Divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = \frac{28}{4} = 7
  \]

**Conclusion:**

Jack needs to sell 7 cookies to reach his goal of making $50.
