To determine how many cookies Jack needs to sell to reach his goal of $50, we first need to calculate how much money he has already made from selling brownies and lemon squares.

1. **Calculate the revenue from brownies:**
   - Jack sold 4 brownies for $3 each.
   - Revenue from brownies = Number of brownies × Price per brownie
   \[
   \text{Revenue from brownies} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the revenue from lemon squares:**
   - Jack sold 5 lemon squares for $2 each.
   - Revenue from lemon squares = Number of lemon squares × Price per lemon square
   \[
   \text{Revenue from lemon squares} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate total revenue from brownies and lemon squares:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from brownies + Revenue from lemon squares
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 12 + 10 = 22 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how much more money Jack needs to reach his goal:**
   - Jack's goal is $50.
   - Amount needed = Goal - Total revenue
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = 50 - 22 = 28 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate how many cookies Jack needs to sell:**
   - Jack sells cookies for $4 each.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Jack needs to sell.
   - Revenue from cookies = Number of cookies × Price per cookie
   \[
   \text{Revenue from cookies} = x \times 4
   \]
   - To find \( x \), we set up the equation:
   \[
   4x = 28
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{28}{4} = 7
   \]

Thus, Jack needs to sell **7 cookies** to reach his goal of $50.

**Final Answer: 7 cookies**
