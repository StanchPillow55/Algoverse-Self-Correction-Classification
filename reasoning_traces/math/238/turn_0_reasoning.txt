==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa based on the relationships given in the question.

1. **Identify Jessa's age**: 
   We are told that Jessa is 20 years old. 
   \[
   \text{Jessa's age} = 20
   \]

2. **Determine Joan's age**: 
   The problem states that Joan is five years older than Jessa. Therefore, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Determine Mary's age**: 
   Next, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan. We can find Mary's age using the following calculation:
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
   \]

4. **Calculate the sum of their ages**: 
   Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages:
   \[
   \text{Sum of ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Sum of ages} = 23 + 25 + 20
   \]

5. **Perform the addition**:
   \[
   23 + 25 = 48
   \]
   \[
   48 + 20 = 68
   \]

Thus, the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa is:
\[
\boxed{68}
\]
