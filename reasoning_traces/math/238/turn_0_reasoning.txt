To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cookies Jack needs to sell to reach his goal of making $50, given the sales he has already made.

First, let's calculate how much money Jack has already made from selling brownies and lemon squares.

1. **Calculate the revenue from brownies:**
   - Jack sold 4 brownies at $3 each.
   - Revenue from brownies = Number of brownies × Price per brownie
   - Revenue from brownies = 4 × $3 = $12

2. **Calculate the revenue from lemon squares:**
   - Jack sold 5 lemon squares at $2 each.
   - Revenue from lemon squares = Number of lemon squares × Price per lemon square
   - Revenue from lemon squares = 5 × $2 = $10

3. **Calculate the total revenue from brownies and lemon squares:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from brownies + Revenue from lemon squares
   - Total revenue = $12 + $10 = $22

Now, we know Jack has already made $22. His goal is to make $50, so we need to find out how much more money he needs to make.

4. **Calculate the remaining amount needed to reach the goal:**
   - Remaining amount needed = Goal amount - Total revenue so far
   - Remaining amount needed = $50 - $22 = $28

Jack sells cookies for $4 each, so we need to determine how many cookies he needs to sell to make the remaining $28.

5. **Calculate the number of cookies needed:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Jack needs to sell.
   - Revenue from cookies = Number of cookies × Price per cookie
   - Revenue from cookies = \( x \times 4 \)
   - We need this revenue to equal the remaining amount needed: \( x \times 4 = 28 \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x \times 4 = 28 \)
   - Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
   - \( x = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \)

Therefore, Jack needs to sell 7 cookies to reach his goal of making $50.

**Final Answer: Jack needs to sell 7 cookies.**
