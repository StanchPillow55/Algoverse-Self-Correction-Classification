==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 97" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 97:**

Solve the quadratic equation: \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

### Step 1: Identify the coefficients

The given quadratic equation is in the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

### Step 2: Calculate the discriminant

The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by the formula:
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]

Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6)
\]
\[
\Delta = 16 + 48
\]
\[
\Delta = 64
\]

### Step 3: Determine the nature of the roots

Since the discriminant \(\Delta = 64\) is greater than zero, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

### Step 4: Use the quadratic formula to find the roots

The quadratic formula is:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
\]

Substitute the values of \(b\), \(\Delta\), and \(a\):
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

Calculate the two possible values for \(x\):

1. \(x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3\)

2. \(x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1\)

### Step 5: State the final answer

The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

**Final Answer:**
The roots of the equation are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
