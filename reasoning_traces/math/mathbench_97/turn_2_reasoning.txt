==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 97," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 97" is not specific and does not provide any details or context. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder and create a sample math problem for us to solve.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 96 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

Step 1: Define the variables.
- Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
- Since the length is 3 times the width, let \( l = 3w \).

Step 2: Write the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle.
- The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
  \[
  P = 2l + 2w
  \]

Step 3: Substitute the known values into the perimeter formula.
- We know the perimeter is 96 units, so:
  \[
  96 = 2(3w) + 2w
  \]

Step 4: Simplify and solve for \( w \).
- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  96 = 6w + 2w
  \]
  \[
  96 = 8w
  \]

- Solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides by 8:
  \[
  w = \frac{96}{8} = 12
  \]

Step 5: Find the length using the relationship between length and width.
- Since \( l = 3w \):
  \[
  l = 3 \times 12 = 36
  \]

Step 6: Verify the solution.
- Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
  \[
  P = 2l + 2w = 2(36) + 2(12) = 72 + 24 = 96
  \]
- The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width: 12 units
- Length: 36 units
