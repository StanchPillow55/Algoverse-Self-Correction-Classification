==================================================

Certainly! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

### Understanding the Problem
The problem is titled "Sample math problem 97," but it doesn't provide specific details about what the problem entails. Since no specific mathematical question is given, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. To demonstrate the process of solving a math problem, I'll create a sample problem and solve it.

### Sample Problem
Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This is a complete step-by-step solution to the sample problem I created. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 97," please provide the details, and I can solve that specific problem for you.
