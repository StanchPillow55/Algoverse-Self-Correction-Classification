==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 97," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample math problem 97" is a typical algebra problem:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides results in:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a basic algebraic equation by isolating the variable, performing arithmetic operations, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 97," please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem.
