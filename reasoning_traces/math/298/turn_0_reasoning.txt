==================================================

To solve this problem, let's define the initial number of sweets on the table as \( x \).

1. **Jack's Action:**
   - Jack took half of all the candies and 4 more candies.
   - The number of candies Jack took can be expressed as: \(\frac{x}{2} + 4\).

2. **Paul's Action:**
   - After Jack took his share, Paul took the remaining 7 sweets.
   - This means that after Jack took his share, there were exactly 7 sweets left on the table.

3. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - After Jack took \(\frac{x}{2} + 4\) candies, the number of candies left on the table was \( x - \left(\frac{x}{2} + 4\right) \).
   - According to the problem, Paul took these remaining 7 sweets, so we set up the equation:
     \[
     x - \left(\frac{x}{2} + 4\right) = 7
     \]

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Simplify the left side of the equation:
     \[
     x - \frac{x}{2} - 4 = 7
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     \frac{x}{2} - 4 = 7
     \]
   - Add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{x}{2} = 11
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 22
     \]

5. **Verification:**
   - Initially, there were 22 sweets.
   - Jack took half of 22, which is 11, plus 4 more, totaling 15 sweets.
   - After Jack took 15 sweets, there were \( 22 - 15 = 7 \) sweets left.
   - Paul then took these 7 sweets, which matches the problem statement.

Thus, the initial number of sweets on the table was \(\boxed{22}\).
