Let \( x \) be the initial number of sweets on the table.

1. **Jack's Action**: 
   - Jack took half of the candies and 4 more candies. 
   - The amount Jack took can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Candies taken by Jack} = \frac{x}{2} + 4
     \]
   - After Jack took his share, the number of sweets left on the table is:
     \[
     \text{Sweets left} = x - \left(\frac{x}{2} + 4\right)
     \]

2. **Simplifying the Sweets Left**:
   - We can simplify the expression for the sweets left:
     \[
     \text{Sweets left} = x - \frac{x}{2} - 4
     \]
   - This can be rewritten as:
     \[
     \text{Sweets left} = \frac{2x}{2} - \frac{x}{2} - 4 = \frac{x}{2} - 4
     \]

3. **Paul's Action**:
   - Paul then came and took the remaining 7 sweets. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{x}{2} - 4 = 7
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - To solve for \( x \), we first add 4 to both sides of the equation:
     \[
     \frac{x}{2} = 7 + 4
     \]
     \[
     \frac{x}{2} = 11
     \]
   - Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     x = 11 \times 2
     \]
     \[
     x = 22
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the initial number of sweets on the table was \( \boxed{22} \).

6. **Verification**:
   - If there were 22 sweets initially:
     - Jack took half (11) plus 4, which totals 15 sweets. 
     - Sweets left after Jack: \( 22 - 15 = 7 \).
     - Paul took the remaining 7 sweets, which matches the problem statement.
   - Thus, the solution is verified. The initial number of sweets was indeed \( \boxed{22} \).
