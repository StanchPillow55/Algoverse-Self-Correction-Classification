To determine how much Carmen pays for the antique desk, we need to analyze the bidding process step by step.

1. **Opening Bid**: The auction starts with an opening bid of $200.

2. **Bidding Process**: The bids increase by $50 each time. There are 3 other people bidding before Carmen places her final bid.

3. **Bidding Sequence**:
   - Let's denote the bids as follows:
     - **Initial Bid**: $200
     - **1st Bidder**: The first person bids $50 more than the current bid of $200.
     - **2nd Bidder**: The second person bids $50 more than the previous bid.
     - **3rd Bidder**: The third person bids $50 more than the last bid.
     - **Carmen's Bid**: Finally, Carmen bids $50 more than the last bid made by the third bidder.

4. **Calculating Each Bid**:
   - **Initial Bid**: $200
   - **1st Bidder**: $200 + $50 = $250
   - **2nd Bidder**: $250 + $50 = $300
   - **3rd Bidder**: $300 + $50 = $350
   - **Carmen's Bid**: $350 + $50 = $400

5. **Final Calculation**: After Carmen places her bid, she wins the desk at the final bid amount of $400.

Thus, the total amount of money Carmen spends on the desk is:

\[
\text{Final Amount} = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the desk costs Carmen **$400**.

Final answer: **400**
