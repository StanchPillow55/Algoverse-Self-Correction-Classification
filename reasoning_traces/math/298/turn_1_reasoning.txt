==================================================

To determine how much Carmen pays for the antique desk, we need to analyze the bidding process step by step.

1. **Opening Bid**: The auction starts with an opening bid of $200.

2. **Bidding Increments**: Each bid increases by $50.

3. **Number of Other Bidders**: There are 3 other people bidding before Carmen places her final bid.

Now, let's outline the bidding sequence:

- **Carmen's Bid**: She starts with the opening bid of $200.
- **Bids from Other Bidders**: Each of the 3 other bidders will place a bid after Carmen's initial bid.

Let's denote the bids as follows:
- **Carmen's initial bid**: $200
- **Bidder 1**: $200 + $50 = $250
- **Bidder 2**: $250 + $50 = $300
- **Bidder 3**: $300 + $50 = $350

After the 3 other bidders have placed their bids, Carmen will place her final bid. Since she bids after each of the 3 other bidders, her final bid will be the next increment after the last bid made by the third bidder.

4. **Carmen's Final Bid**: After Bidder 3 bids $350, Carmen will place her bid:
   - Carmen's final bid = $350 + $50 = $400

Thus, the sequence of bids is as follows:
- Carmen: $200
- Bidder 1: $250
- Bidder 2: $300
- Bidder 3: $350
- Carmen's final bid: $400

Therefore, the total amount Carmen pays for the antique desk is **$400**.

Final Answer: **$400**
