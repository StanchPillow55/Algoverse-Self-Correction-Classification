Question ID: 298
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much Carmen pays for the antique desk, we need to analyze the bidding process step by step.

1. **Opening Bid**: The auction starts with an opening bid of $200.

2. **Bidding Process**: The bids increase by $50 each time. Carmen is bidding after 3 other people, which means there are 3 rounds of bidding before Carmen places her final bid.

3. **Bids from Other People**:
   - Let's denote the bids made by the other 3 people as follows:
     - **First Bidder**: The first person bids $200 + $50 = $250.
     - **Second Bidder**: The second person bids $250 + $50 = $300.
     - **Third Bidder**: The third person bids $300 + $50 = $350.

4. **Carmen's Bids**: After each of the 3 other bidders, Carmen places her bid:
   - After the first bidder, Carmen bids $250 + $50 = $300.
   - After the second bidder, Carmen bids $300 + $50 = $350.
   - After the third bidder, Carmen bids $350 + $50 = $400.

5. **Final Bid**: Carmen wins the auction with her final bid of $400.

Now, we can summarize the bidding sequence:
- Opening bid: $200
- First bidder: $250
- Carmen's bid: $300
- Second bidder: $300
- Carmen's bid: $350
- Third bidder: $350
- Carmen's bid: $400 (winning bid)

Thus, the final amount Carmen pays for the desk is **$400**.

**Final Answer**: Carmen pays $400 for the desk.
