==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests.**
2. **Determine how many cookies were given to the church.**
3. **Calculate how many people were in the church based on the number of cookies each received.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies

Dylan attended a wedding with 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cookies} = \text{Number of guests} \times \text{Cookies per guest}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total cookies} = 100 \times 15 = 1500
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many cookies were given to the church

The bride decided to give half of the total cookies to the church. We can calculate the number of cookies given to the church as follows:

\[
\text{Cookies to church} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Total cookies}
\]

Substituting the total cookies:

\[
\text{Cookies to church} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many people were in the church

Each person in the church received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we can use the following formula:

\[
\text{Number of people in church} = \frac{\text{Cookies to church}}{\text{Cookies per person}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of people in church} = \frac{750}{15}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Number of people in church} = 50
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]
