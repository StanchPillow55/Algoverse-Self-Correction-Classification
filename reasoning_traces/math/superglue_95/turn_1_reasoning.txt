==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 95" refers to. However, since the problem statement does not provide any specific details about the question, we will need to make some assumptions or create a hypothetical problem to solve.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 95" is a math problem involving basic arithmetic or algebra. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A store sells apples and oranges. An apple costs $2, and an orange costs $3. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends $25, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of fruits is 10: 
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
   - The total cost is $25:
     \[
     2x + 3y = 25
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   2x + 3y &= 25 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution Method:**

   From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 10 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 10 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   2x + 3(10 - x) = 25
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 30 - 3x = 25
   \]
   \[
   -x + 30 = 25
   \]
   \[
   -x = 25 - 30
   \]
   \[
   -x = -5
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the expression for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 10 - x = 10 - 5 = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check if the solution satisfies both original equations:
   - For Equation 1: \( x + y = 5 + 5 = 10 \), which is correct.
   - For Equation 2: \( 2x + 3y = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25 \), which is also correct.

5. **Conclusion:**

   The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.
