==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify the task at hand. The question provided is "Sample reasoning question 95," which seems to be a placeholder or an incomplete problem statement. Without specific details or numerical data, it's challenging to provide a precise solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving reasoning questions, particularly if they involve mathematical reasoning or logic.

### General Approach to Solving Reasoning Questions:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given data or conditions.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - Determine if it's a numerical problem, a logic puzzle, or a word problem.
   - This will guide the method of solution.

3. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - If the problem involves multiple steps, break it down into smaller, manageable parts.
   - Solve each part step by step.

4. **Apply Relevant Concepts:**
   - Use mathematical formulas, logical reasoning, or problem-solving strategies relevant to the problem type.
   - For numerical problems, ensure calculations are accurate.

5. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Verify that the solution satisfies all conditions of the problem.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, ensuring it addresses the question asked.

### Example of a Reasoning Problem:

Since "Sample reasoning question 95" is not specific, let's consider a hypothetical reasoning problem:

**Problem:** If a train travels 60 miles in 1.5 hours, what is its average speed in miles per hour?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the average speed of the train.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - This is a straightforward calculation problem involving distance, time, and speed.

3. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Use the formula for average speed: \(\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}\).

4. **Apply Relevant Concepts:**
   - Total Distance = 60 miles
   - Total Time = 1.5 hours
   - Calculate the average speed: 
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{1.5 \text{ hours}} = 40 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

5. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify the calculation: \(60 \div 1.5 = 40\).

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The average speed of the train is 40 miles per hour.

### Conclusion:

Without specific details for "Sample reasoning question 95," this example illustrates a general approach to solving reasoning problems. If you have a specific problem or additional details, please provide them for a more tailored solution.
