==================================================

It seems like there might be some confusion with the phrase "Sample math problem 86." This doesn't provide a specific math problem to solve. Instead, it looks like a placeholder or a reference to a problem that isn't fully described here. 

To assist you effectively, I need a specific math problem or question to work through. If you have a particular problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help you solve it step by step.
