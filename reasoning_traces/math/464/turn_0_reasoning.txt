Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the number of games that Carla won as \( C \) and the number of games that Frankie won as \( F \).

According to the problem, we know two things:

1. The total number of games played is 30:
   \[
   C + F = 30
   \]

2. Frankie won half as many games as Carla:
   \[
   F = \frac{1}{2}C
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( F \) from the second equation into the first equation. This gives us:
\[
C + \frac{1}{2}C = 30
\]

To combine the terms on the left side, we can express \( C \) as \( \frac{2}{2}C \):
\[
\frac{2}{2}C + \frac{1}{2}C = 30
\]
\[
\frac{3}{2}C = 30
\]

Next, we solve for \( C \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{2}{3} \):
\[
C = 30 \times \frac{2}{3}
\]
\[
C = 20
\]

Now that we have found \( C \), we can find \( F \) using the equation \( F = \frac{1}{2}C \):
\[
F = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
\]

To verify, we check if the total number of games adds up to 30:
\[
C + F = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
This is correct.

Thus, the number of games that Carla won is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]
