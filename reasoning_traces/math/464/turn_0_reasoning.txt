==================================================

To solve this problem, let's define some variables and set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( F \) represent the number of games Frankie won.
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of games Carla won.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know from the problem that the total number of games played is 30. Therefore, the sum of the games won by Frankie and Carla is:
     \[
     F + C = 30
     \]
   - The problem also states that Frankie won half as many games as Carla. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     F = \frac{1}{2}C
     \]

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute the expression for \( F \) from the second equation into the first equation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2}C + C = 30
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     \frac{3}{2}C = 30
     \]
   - To solve for \( C \), multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{2}{3}\):
     \[
     C = 30 \times \frac{2}{3}
     \]
   - Calculate the right side:
     \[
     C = 20
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - If \( C = 20 \), then using the equation \( F = \frac{1}{2}C \), we find:
     \[
     F = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
     \]
   - Check the total number of games:
     \[
     F + C = 10 + 20 = 30
     \]
   - The calculations are consistent with the problem statement.

Thus, the number of games Carla won is \(\boxed{20}\).
