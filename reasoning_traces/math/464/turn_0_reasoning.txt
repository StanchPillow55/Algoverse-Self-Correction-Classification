==================================================

To determine Finley's final position in the race, we will track her movements step by step, starting from her initial position.

1. **Starting Position**: Finley starts in **1st place**.

2. **Fell Back 5 Spots**: 
   - If she falls back 5 spots from 1st place, we calculate her new position as follows:
   \[
   1 - 5 = -4
   \]
   Since there is no negative position in a race, we interpret this as moving to the last position. However, we need to consider the total number of participants. For this problem, let's assume there are at least 6 participants (since she fell back 5 spots). Thus, she would be in **6th place**.

3. **Moved Ahead 2 Spots**: 
   - Now, moving ahead 2 spots from 6th place:
   \[
   6 - 2 = 4
   \]
   So, she is now in **4th place**.

4. **Fell Behind 3 Spots**: 
   - Next, if she falls behind 3 spots from 4th place:
   \[
   4 + 3 = 7
   \]
   This means she is now in **7th place**.

5. **Jumped Ahead 1 Spot**: 
   - Finally, she jumps ahead 1 spot from 7th place:
   \[
   7 - 1 = 6
   \]
   Therefore, she finishes the race in **6th place**.

Now, let's summarize the steps:
- Started at 1st place.
- Fell back to 6th place.
- Moved ahead to 4th place.
- Fell behind to 7th place.
- Jumped ahead to 6th place.

Thus, Finley finished the race in **6th place**.

**Final Answer**: 6th place.
