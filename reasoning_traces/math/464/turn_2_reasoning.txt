Question ID: 464
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let \( C \) represent the number of games Carla won, and \( F \) represent the number of games Frankie won. According to the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:

1. The total number of games played is 30:
   \[
   F + C = 30
   \]

2. Frankie won half as many games as Carla:
   \[
   F = \frac{1}{2}C
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( F \) from the second equation into the first equation.

Substituting \( F \) in the total games equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2}C + C = 30
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2}C + \frac{2}{2}C = 30
\]
\[
\frac{3}{2}C = 30
\]

To solve for \( C \), multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{3} \):
\[
C = 30 \times \frac{2}{3}
\]
\[
C = 20
\]

Now that we have \( C \), we can find \( F \):
\[
F = \frac{1}{2}C = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
\]

Finally, we can verify our solution:
- Total games: \( F + C = 10 + 20 = 30 \) (correct)
- Frankie won half as many as Carla: \( F = \frac{1}{2}C = 10 \) (correct)

Thus, the number of games Carla won is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]
