Question ID: 464
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many games Carla won given the information about the total number of games and the relationship between the number of games Frankie and Carla won.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( F \) represent the number of games Frankie won.
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of games Carla won.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know from the problem that the total number of games played is 30. Therefore, the sum of the games won by Frankie and Carla is:
     \[
     F + C = 30
     \]
   - We are also told that Frankie won half as many games as Carla. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     F = \frac{1}{2}C
     \]

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute the expression for \( F \) from the second equation into the first equation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2}C + C = 30
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     \frac{3}{2}C = 30
     \]
   - To solve for \( C \), multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{2}{3}\):
     \[
     C = 30 \times \frac{2}{3}
     \]
   - Calculate the right-hand side:
     \[
     C = 20
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Carla won 20 games.

Therefore, the final answer is that Carla won 20 games.
