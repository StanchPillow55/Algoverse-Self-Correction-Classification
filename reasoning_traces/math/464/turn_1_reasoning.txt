Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let \( C \) represent the number of games Carla won. According to the problem, Frankie won half as many games as Carla. Therefore, we can express the number of games Frankie won as \( \frac{1}{2}C \).

Since they played a total of 30 games, we can set up the following equation:

\[
C + \frac{1}{2}C = 30
\]

To combine the terms on the left side, we can rewrite \( C \) as \( \frac{2}{2}C \):

\[
\frac{2}{2}C + \frac{1}{2}C = 30
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{3}{2}C = 30
\]

Next, we solve for \( C \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{2}{3} \):

\[
C = 30 \times \frac{2}{3}
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
C = 20
\]

Thus, Carla won \( \boxed{20} \) games.

To verify, if Carla won 20 games, then Frankie won:

\[
\frac{1}{2}C = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
\]

Adding both wins together:

\[
20 + 10 = 30
\]

This confirms that the total number of games played is correct. Therefore, Carla won \( \boxed{20} \) games.
