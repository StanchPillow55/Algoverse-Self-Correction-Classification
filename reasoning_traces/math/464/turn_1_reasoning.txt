To solve this problem, we need to determine how many games Carla won out of the 30 games they played.

Let's define:
- \( F \) as the number of games Frankie won.
- \( C \) as the number of games Carla won.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 30. Therefore, the sum of the games won by Frankie and Carla is:
   \[
   F + C = 30
   \]

2. Frankie won half as many games as Carla. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   F = \frac{1}{2}C
   \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( F + C = 30 \)
2. \( F = \frac{1}{2}C \)

We can substitute the expression for \( F \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2}C + C = 30
\]

Combine the terms on the left side:
\[
\frac{1}{2}C + \frac{2}{2}C = 30
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{3}{2}C = 30
\]

To solve for \( C \), multiply both sides by \(\frac{2}{3}\):
\[
C = 30 \times \frac{2}{3}
\]

Calculate the right side:
\[
C = 20
\]

Thus, Carla won 20 games.

To verify, if Carla won 20 games, then Frankie won half as many, which is:
\[
F = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
\]

Checking the total:
\[
F + C = 10 + 20 = 30
\]

The calculations are consistent with the problem statement. Therefore, the final answer is:

Carla won 20 games.
