==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 497" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 497:**

Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even numbers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   The first positive even numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., up to the 20th even number.

2. **General Formula for Even Numbers:**
   The nth positive even number can be expressed as:
   \[
   a_n = 2n
   \]
   where \( n \) is the position in the sequence.

3. **List the First 20 Even Numbers:**
   Using the formula \( a_n = 2n \), we can list the first 20 even numbers:
   \[
   2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40
   \]

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   We need to find the sum of these numbers. The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a_1 \) is the first term, and \( a_n \) is the last term.

5. **Apply the Formula:**
   Here, \( n = 20 \), \( a_1 = 2 \), and \( a_{20} = 40 \).
   \[
   S_{20} = \frac{20}{2} \times (2 + 40)
   \]
   \[
   S_{20} = 10 \times 42
   \]
   \[
   S_{20} = 420
   \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   The sum of the first 20 positive even numbers is 420.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{420}
\]
