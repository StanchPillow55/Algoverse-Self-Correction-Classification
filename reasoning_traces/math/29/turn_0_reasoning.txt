==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.

1. **Identify the costs of the high heels**:
   - Let the cost of the first pair of heels be \( H_1 = 33 \) dollars.
   - The second pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so:
     \[
     H_2 = 2 \times H_1 = 2 \times 33 = 66 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the two pairs of heels**:
   - The total cost of the two pairs of heels is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of heels} = H_1 + H_2 = 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Relate the cost of the boots to the cost of the heels**:
   - Let \( B \) represent the cost of the boots. According to the problem, the total cost of the heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots:
     \[
     B = \text{Total cost of heels} + 5
     \]
   - Substituting the total cost of the heels:
     \[
     B = 99 + 5 = 104 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the cost of the boots is:
     \[
     \boxed{104} \text{ dollars}
     \]
