Let's denote Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income as X. 

According to the problem, 40% of her previous income was spent on rent and utilities. This can be represented as 0.40X.

After her salary was increased by $600, the cost of her rent and utilities became 25% of her new income. Since her new income is X + $600, this can be represented as 0.25(X + $600).

Given that the cost of rent and utilities didn't change, we can set these two expressions equal to each other and solve for X:

0.40X = 0.25(X + $600)

To solve for X, first distribute the 0.25 to both terms inside the parentheses:

0.40X = 0.25X + $150

Next, subtract 0.25X from both sides of the equation to isolate X on one side:

0.40X - 0.25X = $150

0.15X = $150

Finally, divide both sides by 0.15 to solve for X:

X = $150 / 0.15

X = $1000

So, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was $1000.
