Let \( x \) be Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income. According to the problem, she used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Therefore, the amount she spent on rent and utilities can be expressed as:

\[
0.40x
\]

After her salary was increased by $600, her new monthly income becomes:

\[
x + 600
\]

Now, with the new income, her rent and utilities amount to 25% of her monthly income. Thus, the amount she spends on rent and utilities after the increase can be expressed as:

\[
0.25(x + 600)
\]

Since the amount spent on rent and utilities remains the same before and after the salary increase, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:

\[
0.40x = 0.25(x + 600)
\]

Now, we will solve for \( x \). First, we will distribute the right side of the equation:

\[
0.40x = 0.25x + 0.25 \cdot 600
\]

Calculating \( 0.25 \cdot 600 \):

\[
0.25 \cdot 600 = 150
\]

So the equation now looks like:

\[
0.40x = 0.25x + 150
\]

Next, we will isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.25x \) from both sides:

\[
0.40x - 0.25x = 150
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
0.15x = 150
\]

Now, we will solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by \( 0.15 \):

\[
x = \frac{150}{0.15}
\]

Calculating \( \frac{150}{0.15} \):

\[
x = 1000
\]

Thus, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was:

\[
\boxed{1000}
\]

To verify, we can check the calculations:

1. Previous income: \( 1000 \)
2. Rent and utilities at 40%: \( 0.40 \times 1000 = 400 \)
3. New income after increase: \( 1000 + 600 = 1600 \)
4. Rent and utilities at 25% of new income: \( 0.25 \times 1600 = 400 \)

Since both amounts for rent and utilities are equal, our solution is confirmed. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1000}
\]
