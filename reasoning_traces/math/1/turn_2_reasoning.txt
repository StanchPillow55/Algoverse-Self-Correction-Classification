Question ID: 1
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert the babysitting time from minutes to hours since Weng's rate is given per hour. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 50 minutes is 50/60 = 0.833 hours.

Next, we multiply the time Weng spent babysitting by her hourly rate to find out how much she earned.

0.833 hours * $12/hour = $10

So, Weng earned $10 for 50 minutes of babysitting.
