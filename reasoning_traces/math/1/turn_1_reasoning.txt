Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert the minutes Weng babysat into hours since her pay rate is given in dollars per hour. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 50 minutes is 50/60 = 0.833 hours.

Weng earns $12 per hour. So, for 0.833 hours of work, she would earn 0.833 * $12 = $10.

Therefore, Weng earned $10 for 50 minutes of babysitting.
