==================================================

To determine how much Weng earned for babysitting for 50 minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the hourly rate and time worked**:  
   Weng earns $12 per hour. However, she worked for only 50 minutes, not a full hour.

2. **Convert minutes to a fraction of an hour**:  
   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to express 50 minutes as a fraction of an hour.  
   \[
   \text{Fraction of an hour} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ of an hour}
   \]

3. **Calculate earnings for 50 minutes**:  
   Now, we multiply the fraction of the hour by Weng's hourly rate to find out how much she earned for 50 minutes of work.  
   \[
   \text{Earnings} = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right) \times 12 \text{ dollars/hour}
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication**:  
   \[
   \text{Earnings} = \frac{5}{6} \times 12 = \frac{5 \times 12}{6} = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Weng earned $10 for babysitting for 50 minutes.

**Final Answer**: Weng earned $10.
