To determine how much Weng earned for babysitting for 50 minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the time worked from minutes to hours**: Since Weng earns $12 per hour, we need to express 50 minutes in terms of hours. 

   There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert 50 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

   \[
   \text{Hours worked} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{50}{60} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the earnings**: Now that we know Weng worked \(\frac{5}{6}\) of an hour, we can calculate her earnings by multiplying the number of hours worked by her hourly rate.

   \[
   \text{Earnings} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours Worked}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Earnings} = 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \times \frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}
   \]

   To perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Earnings} = 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{12 \times 5}{6} = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Final Answer**: Weng earned $10 for babysitting for 50 minutes.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]
