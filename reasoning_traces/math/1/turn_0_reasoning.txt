==================================================

First, we need to understand that Weng's pay is calculated on an hourly basis. This means that she earns $12 for every 60 minutes of work, as there are 60 minutes in an hour.

Next, we need to determine how much she earns per minute. We can do this by dividing her hourly wage by the number of minutes in an hour. 

So, $12 รท 60 minutes = $0.20 per minute.

Yesterday, Weng babysat for 50 minutes. To find out how much she earned, we multiply the number of minutes she worked by her per-minute wage.

So, 50 minutes ร $0.20 per minute = $10.

Therefore, Weng earned $10 for 50 minutes of babysitting.
