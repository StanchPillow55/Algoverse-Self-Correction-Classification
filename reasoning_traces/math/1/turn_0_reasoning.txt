To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount of fiber (both blue and white) required to make one robe.

1. **Identify the amount of blue fiber needed:**
   The problem states that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.

   \[
   \text{Blue fiber} = 2 \text{ bolts}
   \]

2. **Identify the amount of white fiber needed:**
   The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since we have 2 bolts of blue fiber, we need to calculate half of that amount for the white fiber.

   \[
   \text{White fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Blue fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \text{ bolts} = 1 \text{ bolt}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of fiber:**
   Now, we need to find the total amount of fiber by adding the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together.

   \[
   \text{Total fiber} = \text{Blue fiber} + \text{White fiber} = 2 \text{ bolts} + 1 \text{ bolt} = 3 \text{ bolts}
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed to make one robe is:

   \[
   \boxed{3}
   \]
