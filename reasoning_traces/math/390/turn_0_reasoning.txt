==================================================

To determine how many weeks Oscar should train before the marathon, we need to calculate how many additional miles he needs to run to reach his goal of 20 miles, starting from the 2 miles he has already run.

1. **Calculate the total distance Oscar needs to run:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance to run} = 20 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Determine the weekly increase in distance:**
   Oscar plans to add \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a mile each week.

3. **Set up the equation to find the number of weeks:**
   Let \( w \) be the number of weeks he trains. The total distance he will run after \( w \) weeks can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Distance after } w \text{ weeks} = 2 \text{ miles} + w \times \frac{2}{3} \text{ miles}
   \]
   We want this distance to equal 20 miles:
   \[
   2 + w \times \frac{2}{3} = 20
   \]

4. **Solve for \( w \):**
   First, subtract 2 from both sides:
   \[
   w \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 - 2
   \]
   \[
   w \times \frac{2}{3} = 18
   \]

   Next, multiply both sides by \( \frac{3}{2} \) to isolate \( w \):
   \[
   w = 18 \times \frac{3}{2}
   \]
   \[
   w = 27
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   Oscar should start training 27 weeks before the marathon to reach his goal of running 20 miles.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{27}
\]
