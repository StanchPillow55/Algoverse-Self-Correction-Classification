==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for Oscar to increase his running distance from 2 miles to 20 miles, given that he plans to add \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a mile each week.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Initial and Target Distances:**
   - Initial distance: 2 miles
   - Target distance: 20 miles

2. **Determine the Total Increase Needed:**
   - Total increase in distance needed = Target distance - Initial distance
   \[
   20 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Determine the Weekly Increase:**
   - Oscar plans to increase his running distance by \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a mile each week.

4. **Calculate the Number of Weeks Required:**
   - To find out how many weeks it will take to increase his running distance by 18 miles, we divide the total increase needed by the weekly increase:
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{18 \text{ miles}}{\frac{2}{3} \text{ miles/week}}
   \]

5. **Perform the Division:**
   - Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{18}{\frac{2}{3}} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2}
   \]

6. **Calculate the Product:**
   - Perform the multiplication:
   \[
   18 \times \frac{3}{2} = \frac{18 \times 3}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
   \]

Thus, Oscar needs 27 weeks to increase his running distance from 2 miles to 20 miles by adding \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a mile each week.

**Final Answer:**
Oscar should start training 27 weeks before the marathon.
