==================================================

To solve the problem step by step, we need to determine how much money Roy has based on the information provided about his brother Anthony and sister Eva.

1. **Identify how much Eva has saved:**
   - According to the problem, Eva has saved $20.00.

2. **Determine how much Anthony has saved:**
   - The problem states that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva.
   - Therefore, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:
     \[
     \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
     \]
   - So, Anthony has saved $30.00.

3. **Calculate how much Roy has saved:**
   - The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony.
   - First, we need to calculate 40% of Anthony's savings:
     \[
     40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12
     \]
   - Now, we add this amount to Anthony's savings to find out how much Roy has saved:
     \[
     \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 30 + 12 = 42
     \]

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - Therefore, Roy has saved $42.00.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Roy has } \boxed{42} \text{ dollars.}
\]
