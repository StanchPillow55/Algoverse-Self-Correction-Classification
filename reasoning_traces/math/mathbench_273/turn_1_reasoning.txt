==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample math problem 273" might entail. Since the problem isn't specified, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "273" and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem 273:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 7 = 2x + 10 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Start by getting all terms containing \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side. We can do this by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides:

   \[
   3x + 7 - 2x = 2x + 10 - 2x
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x + 7 = 10
   \]

3. **Isolate \( x \):**
   Next, we need to isolate \( x \) by getting rid of the constant term on the left side. Subtract 7 from both sides:

   \[
   x + 7 - 7 = 10 - 7
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 3
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   It's always a good practice to verify the solution by substituting the value of \( x \) back into the original equation to ensure both sides are equal.

   Substitute \( x = 3 \) into the original equation:

   \[
   3(3) + 7 = 2(3) + 10
   \]

   Calculate both sides:

   \[
   9 + 7 = 6 + 10
   \]

   \[
   16 = 16
   \]

   Since both sides are equal, our solution \( x = 3 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 7 = 2x + 10 \) is \( x = 3 \).
