==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 273," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 273" is not specific enough to provide any details or context. Therefore, I will assume that this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. 

Since I do not have the details of the problem, I will create a hypothetical math problem with the number 273 and solve it. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** 
Find the sum of the digits of the number 273.

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to break down the number 273 into its individual digits and then add those digits together.

1. **Identify the digits of the number 273:**
   - The number 273 consists of three digits: 2, 7, and 3.

2. **Add the digits together:**
   - Sum = 2 + 7 + 3

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add 2 and 7: 
     \[
     2 + 7 = 9
     \]
   - Next, add the result to 3:
     \[
     9 + 3 = 12
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sum of the digits of the number 273 is 12.

Therefore, the final answer is 12.
