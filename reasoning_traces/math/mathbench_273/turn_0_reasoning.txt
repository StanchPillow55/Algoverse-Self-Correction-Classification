==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample math problem 273" does not provide enough information to determine what the problem is asking. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems if you have a specific type of problem in mind, such as algebra, geometry, calculus, etc.

If you can provide more details or clarify the problem, I would be happy to help solve it. For now, I'll outline a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation, using a formula).
   - Think about similar problems you have solved before.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Review calculations for accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present your final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

If you provide a specific math problem or more context, I can apply this approach to solve it for you.
