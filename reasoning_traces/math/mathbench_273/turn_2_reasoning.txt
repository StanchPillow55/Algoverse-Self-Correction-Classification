==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 273," I need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 273" refers to a specific math problem that needs to be solved. Without the actual problem, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 273" is the following:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) by itself.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation. Subtract 3 from both sides:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \):**
   The next step is to get \( x \) alone by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides results in:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If "Sample math problem 273" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or text of the problem so I can solve it accurately.
