==================================================

To solve a problem effectively, it's important to understand the context and details of the question. However, the question provided, "Sample reasoning question 196," lacks specific details or context. Therefore, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by walking through a sample problem step by step.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a rectangle with a length that is 3 times its width.
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.
   - We need to find the dimensions of the rectangle (i.e., the length and the width).

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( l \) is \( 3w \) (since the length is 3 times the width).

3. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substitute the given perimeter and expressions for length and width:
     \[
     48 = 2 \times (3w + w)
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     48 = 2 \times 4w
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     48 = 8w
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length \( l \) is 3 times the width:
     \[
     l = 3w = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (18 + 6) = 2 \times 24 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the rectangle are:
     - Width = 6 units
     - Length = 18 units

This approach demonstrates how to systematically solve a math problem by defining variables, using known formulas, solving equations, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details or context.
