==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 196" entails. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 196" is a typical math problem involving logical reasoning and calculations. Hereâ€™s how we might approach it:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read Carefully:** Ensure you understand what the problem is asking. Identify key information and what is required as the final answer.
- **Identify Known and Unknowns:** List out what information is given and what needs to be found.

### Step 2: Plan a Strategy
- **Choose a Method:** Decide on the best approach to solve the problem. This could involve algebraic manipulation, drawing diagrams, logical deduction, or other mathematical techniques.
- **Break Down the Problem:** If the problem is complex, break it down into smaller, more manageable parts.

### Step 3: Execute the Plan
- **Perform Calculations:** Carry out the necessary calculations step by step. Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one.
- **Check Each Step:** Verify that each step is correct before moving on to the next.

### Step 4: Review and Conclude
- **Check the Solution:** Once you have a solution, go back and check that it makes sense in the context of the problem.
- **State the Final Answer:** Clearly write down the final answer, ensuring it addresses the question asked.

### Example Problem and Solution
Since we don't have specifics for "Sample reasoning question 196," let's solve a sample reasoning problem:

**Example Problem:** A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 km/h and returns at a speed of 40 km/h. What is the average speed for the entire journey?

#### Solution:
1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The train travels two distances: from City A to City B and back.
   - We need to find the average speed for the entire journey.

2. **Plan a Strategy:**
   - Use the formula for average speed: \(\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}\).

3. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Let the distance from City A to City B be \(D\).
   - Time taken to travel from A to B: \(t_1 = \frac{D}{60}\).
   - Time taken to travel from B to A: \(t_2 = \frac{D}{40}\).
   - Total distance for the round trip: \(2D\).
   - Total time for the round trip: \(t_1 + t_2 = \frac{D}{60} + \frac{D}{40}\).

   To add the times, find a common denominator:
   \[
   t_1 + t_2 = \frac{D}{60} + \frac{D}{40} = \frac{2D}{120} + \frac{3D}{120} = \frac{5D}{120} = \frac{D}{24}
   \]

   - Average speed: 
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{2D}{\frac{D}{24}} = 2D \times \frac{24}{D} = 48 \text{ km/h}
   \]

4. **Review and Conclude:**
   - The calculations are correct, and the average speed for the entire journey is 48 km/h.

**Final Answer:** The average speed for the entire journey is 48 km/h.

This example illustrates a structured approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. If you have specific details for "Sample reasoning question 196," please provide them, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
