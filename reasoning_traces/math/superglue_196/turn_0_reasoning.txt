==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 196" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

### Sample Problem:
Let's consider the following math problem:

**Problem:**  
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know the perimeter \( P = 48 \) and \( L = 3W \).
   - Substitute these into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     48 = 2(3W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Distribute and combine like terms:
     \[
     48 = 6W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     48 = 8W
     \]

5. **Solve for W (Width):**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

6. **Find L (Length):**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute \( W = 6 \) into the equation:
     \[
     L = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the calculated dimensions satisfy the original perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The perimeter is indeed 48, confirming our solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width \( W = 6 \) units
- Length \( L = 18 \) units

This approach demonstrates how to systematically solve a math problem by understanding the problem, using relevant formulas, substituting known values, simplifying, solving, and verifying the solution.
