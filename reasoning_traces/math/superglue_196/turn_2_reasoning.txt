Question ID: superglue_196
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 196." Since the question itself is not provided, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning problem by creating a hypothetical example.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Question:** A train travels from Station A to Station B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. It returns from Station B to Station A at a speed of 40 miles per hour. What is the average speed for the entire journey?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The train travels two legs of a journey: from A to B and back from B to A.
   - The speeds are different for each leg: 60 mph to B and 40 mph back to A.
   - We need to find the average speed for the entire journey.

2. **Define Average Speed:**
   - Average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

3. **Assign Variables:**
   - Let the distance from A to B (and B to A) be \( D \) miles.

4. **Calculate Time for Each Leg:**
   - Time from A to B: \( \text{Time}_{AB} = \frac{D}{60} \) hours.
   - Time from B to A: \( \text{Time}_{BA} = \frac{D}{40} \) hours.

5. **Calculate Total Distance:**
   - Total distance for the round trip is \( 2D \).

6. **Calculate Total Time:**
   - Total time for the journey is:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = \frac{D}{60} + \frac{D}{40}
     \]

7. **Find a Common Denominator:**
   - The common denominator for 60 and 40 is 120.
   - Convert each fraction:
     \[
     \frac{D}{60} = \frac{2D}{120}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{D}{40} = \frac{3D}{120}
     \]

8. **Add the Times:**
   - Total time:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = \frac{2D}{120} + \frac{3D}{120} = \frac{5D}{120} = \frac{D}{24}
     \]

9. **Calculate Average Speed:**
   - Average speed is:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{2D}{\frac{D}{24}} = 2D \times \frac{24}{D} = 48 \text{ mph}
     \]

10. **Conclusion:**
    - The average speed for the entire journey is 48 miles per hour.

### Final Answer:
The average speed for the entire journey is 48 miles per hour.
