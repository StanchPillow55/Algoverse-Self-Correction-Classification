To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget after shopping, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and then subtract that from her budget.

1. **Calculate the cost of the bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   - Therefore, the cost of the bacon is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of bacon} = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. 
   - Since the total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of one packet of chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for the chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the strawberries:**
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the strawberries is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since each pack of strawberries costs $4, the cost of one pack of apples is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for the apples is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of all items:**
   - Now we sum up the costs of all the items:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget:**
   - Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much she has left after her purchases, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
     \[
     \text{Money left} = \text{Budget} - \text{Total cost}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Money left} = 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Kelly has **$5** left in her budget.
