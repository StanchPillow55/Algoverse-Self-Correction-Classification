==================================================

To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and then subtract that from her budget of $65.

1. **Cost of Bacon**:
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   - Total cost of bacon = $10.

2. **Cost of Chicken**:
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Since 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of one packet of chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries**:
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4.
   - Total cost of strawberries:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of Apples**:
   - Each pack of apples is priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, the cost of one pack of apples is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total Cost of All Items**:
   - Now we sum up the costs of all items:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Calculating Remaining Budget**:
   - Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left:
     \[
     \text{Remaining budget} = \text{Budget} - \text{Total cost}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Remaining budget} = 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget is **$5**.
