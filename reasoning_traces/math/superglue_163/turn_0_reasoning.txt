To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific details about the "Sample reasoning question 163." Since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels the first 100 miles at a speed of 50 miles per hour and the remaining 200 miles at a speed of 75 miles per hour. What is the total time taken for the journey?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the total time taken for the train to travel from City A to City B.
   - The journey is divided into two segments with different speeds.

2. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Distance for the first segment = 100 miles
   - Speed for the first segment = 50 miles per hour
   - Distance for the second segment = 200 miles
   - Speed for the second segment = 75 miles per hour

3. **Calculate the Time for Each Segment:**
   - Time is calculated using the formula: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}\).

   - **First Segment:**
     \[
     \text{Time for first segment} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{50 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

   - **Second Segment:**
     \[
     \text{Time for second segment} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{200}{75} \text{ hours}
     \]

     Simplifying \(\frac{200}{75}\):
     \[
     \frac{200}{75} = \frac{8}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 2.67 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Time:**
   - Add the time for both segments to find the total time:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 2 \text{ hours} + \frac{8}{3} \text{ hours} = 2 + 2.67 = 4.67 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The total time taken for the journey from City A to City B is approximately 4.67 hours.

This step-by-step approach ensures that all calculations are clear and logical, leading to the correct solution. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that problem in a similar manner.
