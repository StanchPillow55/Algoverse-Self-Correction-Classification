Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 163" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it involves a typical math reasoning problem. Let's consider a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. After reaching City B, it immediately returns to City A at a speed of 40 miles per hour. Calculate the total time taken for the round trip.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the time taken from City A to City B:**

   The formula to calculate time is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]

   For the journey from City A to City B:
   \[
   \text{Time}_{AB} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken from City B back to City A:**

   For the return journey from City B to City A:
   \[
   \text{Time}_{BA} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ miles per hour}} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time for the round trip:**

   Add the time taken for both legs of the journey:
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{AB} + \text{Time}_{BA} = 5 \text{ hours} + 7.5 \text{ hours} = 12.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The total time taken for the round trip is 12.5 hours.

This solution involves understanding the basic concepts of speed, distance, and time, and applying them to calculate the total time for a round trip with different speeds in each direction.
