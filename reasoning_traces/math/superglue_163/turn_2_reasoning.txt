==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 163" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving math problems by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step-by-step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 163" is a math problem involving algebra. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This is a demonstration of how to approach and solve a basic algebraic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 163" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details or context for a specific solution.
