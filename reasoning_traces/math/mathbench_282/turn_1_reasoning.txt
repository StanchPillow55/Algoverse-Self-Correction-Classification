==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 282" refers to. Since I don't have access to specific problem sets or external databases, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 282" is the following:

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the equation:**  
   We start with the equation:  
   \[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \]

2. **Isolate the variable \( x \):**  
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side. Let's move the term \( 2x \) from the right side to the left side by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides:  
   \[ 3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 9 - 2x \]  
   Simplifying both sides gives:  
   \[ x + 5 = 9 \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**  
   Next, we need to isolate \( x \) by removing the constant term on the left side. Subtract 5 from both sides:  
   \[ x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5 \]  
   Simplifying both sides gives:  
   \[ x = 4 \]

4. **Verify the solution:**  
   To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:  
   \[ 3(4) + 5 = 2(4) + 9 \]  
   Calculate both sides:  
   \[ 12 + 5 = 8 + 9 \]  
   \[ 17 = 17 \]  
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**  
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \) is \( x = 4 \).
