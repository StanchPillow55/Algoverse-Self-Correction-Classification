Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 282" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic approach to solving a math problem and demonstrate the process of solving a typical math problem step-by-step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 282" is a simple algebra problem. For instance, let's solve the following equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

### Step 2: Isolate the Variable
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

1. **Subtract 5 from both sides**: This will help us eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 3**: This will isolate \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

### Step 3: Verify the Solution
To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]

Calculating the left side:

\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

### Step 4: State the Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This process demonstrates a typical approach to solving a linear equation in algebra. If "Sample math problem 282" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details or context so I can assist you more accurately.
