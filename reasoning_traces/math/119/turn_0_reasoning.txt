To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.**
2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.**
3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.**
4. **Sum the two salaries to find the total salary four years later.**

### Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.

We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let Lylah's salary four years ago be denoted as \( L \).

According to the problem:
\[
A = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
\]
where \( A \) is Adrien's salary four years ago. We also know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000:
\[
A = 40000
\]

Now we can set up the equation:
\[
1.3L = 40000
\]

To find Lylah's salary \( L \), we divide both sides by 1.3:
\[
L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.

Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years. Thus, his salary four years later \( A' \) can be calculated as:
\[
A' = A + 0.4A = 1.4A
\]
Substituting \( A = 40000 \):
\[
A' = 1.4 \times 40000 = 56000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.

Since both Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, we need to find out how much Lylah's salary increased. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary four years ago. Therefore, we can assume that Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, which is 40%.

Thus, Lylah's salary four years later \( L' \) can be calculated as:
\[
L' = L + 0.4L = 1.4L
\]
Substituting \( L \approx 30769.23 \):
\[
L' = 1.4 \times 30769.23 \approx 43076.92
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total salary four years later.

Now we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:
\[
\text{Total Salary} = A' + L' = 56000 + 43076.92 \approx 99076.92
\]

### Final Answer

The total salary that Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later is approximately **$99,076.92**.
