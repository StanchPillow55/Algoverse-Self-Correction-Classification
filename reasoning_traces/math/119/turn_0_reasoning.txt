==================================================

To determine the total number of cupcakes Jessa needs to make, we need to consider both the fourth-grade classes and the P.E. class separately and then sum the totals.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of cupcakes needed for the fourth-grade classes

There are 3 fourth-grade classes, and each class has 30 students. To find the total number of students in the fourth-grade classes, we multiply the number of classes by the number of students per class:

\[
3 \text{ classes} \times 30 \text{ students per class} = 90 \text{ students}
\]

Therefore, Jessa needs to make 90 cupcakes for the fourth-grade classes.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of cupcakes needed for the P.E. class

The P.E. class has 50 students. Therefore, Jessa needs to make 50 cupcakes for the P.E. class.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of cupcakes needed

To find the total number of cupcakes Jessa needs to make, we add the number of cupcakes needed for the fourth-grade classes to the number of cupcakes needed for the P.E. class:

\[
90 \text{ cupcakes (fourth-grade classes)} + 50 \text{ cupcakes (P.E. class)} = 140 \text{ cupcakes}
\]

### Final Answer

Jessa needs to make a total of 140 cupcakes.
