==================================================

To determine how many cupcakes Jessa needs to make, we will first calculate the total number of students in the fourth-grade classes and then add the number of students in the P.E. class.

1. **Calculate the number of students in the fourth-grade classes:**
   - Jessa has 3 fourth-grade classes.
   - Each class has 30 students.
   - To find the total number of students in the fourth-grade classes, we multiply the number of classes by the number of students per class:

   \[
   \text{Total students in fourth-grade classes} = \text{Number of classes} \times \text{Students per class}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total students in fourth-grade classes} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of students in the P.E. class:**
   - The P.E. class has 50 students.

3. **Calculate the total number of students:**
   - Now, we need to add the total number of students from the fourth-grade classes to the number of students in the P.E. class:

   \[
   \text{Total students} = \text{Total students in fourth-grade classes} + \text{Students in P.E. class}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total students} = 90 + 50 = 140
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Jessa needs to make a total of 140 cupcakes, one for each student.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{140}
\]
