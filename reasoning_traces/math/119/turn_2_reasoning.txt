==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.**
2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.**
3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.**
4. **Sum the two salaries to find the total salary four years later.**

### Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.

We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let Lylah's salary four years ago be denoted as \( L \).

According to the problem:
\[
A = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
\]
where \( A \) is Adrien's salary four years ago. We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000:
\[
A = 40000
\]
Now we can set up the equation:
\[
1.3L = 40000
\]
To find Lylah's salary \( L \), we can solve for \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.

We know that Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years. Therefore, his salary four years later \( A' \) can be calculated as follows:
\[
A' = A + 0.4A = 1.4A
\]
Substituting Adrien's salary four years ago:
\[
A' = 1.4 \times 40000 = 56000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.

Since both Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, we need to determine the percentage increase in Lylah's salary. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary four years ago. Assuming Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage (which we will assume is the same as Adrien's for simplicity), we can calculate Lylah's salary four years later.

Letâ€™s assume Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, which is 40%. Thus, Lylah's salary four years later \( L' \) can be calculated as:
\[
L' = L + 0.4L = 1.4L
\]
Substituting Lylah's salary four years ago:
\[
L' = 1.4 \times 30769.23 \approx 43076.92
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total salary four years later.

Now we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:
\[
\text{Total Salary} = A' + L' = 56000 + 43076.92 \approx 99076.92
\]

### Final Answer

The total salary that Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later is approximately **$99,076.92**.
