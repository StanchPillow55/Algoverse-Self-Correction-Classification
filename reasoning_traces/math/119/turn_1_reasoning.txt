==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.**
2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.**
3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later.**
4. **Calculate the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later.**

### Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.

We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let Lylah's salary four years ago be denoted as \( L \).

According to the problem:
\[
A = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
\]
where \( A \) is Adrien's salary four years ago. We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Therefore:
\[
1.3L = 40000
\]

To find Lylah's salary \( L \), we can rearrange the equation:
\[
L = \frac{40000}{1.3}
\]

Calculating \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23
\]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

### Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.

We know that Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years. Therefore, his salary four years later \( A' \) can be calculated as:
\[
A' = A + 0.4A = 1.4A
\]
Substituting \( A = 40000 \):
\[
A' = 1.4 \times 40000 = 56000
\]

So, Adrien's salary four years later is $56,000.

### Step 3: Determine Lylah's salary four years later.

Since both Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, we need to find out how much Lylah's salary increased. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary four years ago. Thus, Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage as Adrien's salary increase.

Lylah's salary four years later \( L' \) can be calculated as:
\[
L' = L + 0.4L = 1.4L
\]
Substituting \( L \approx 30769.23 \):
\[
L' = 1.4 \times 30769.23 \approx 43076.92
\]

So, Lylah's salary four years later is approximately $43,076.92.

### Step 4: Calculate the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later.

Now we can find the total salary \( T \) of both Adrien and Lylah four years later:
\[
T = A' + L' = 56000 + 43076.92
\]
Calculating \( T \):
\[
T \approx 56000 + 43076.92 \approx 99076.92
\]

### Final Answer

The total salary that Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later is approximately **$99,076.92**.
