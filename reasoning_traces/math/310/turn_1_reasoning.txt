==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total wages for all employees and then add the FICA taxes that Janet has to pay.

### Step 1: Calculate the total hours worked by each type of employee in a month.

Each employee works 25 days a month and 8 hours a day. Therefore, the total hours worked by each employee in a month is:

\[ 
25 \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 200 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total wages for warehouse workers.

There are four warehouse workers, and each makes $15/hour. The total wages for all warehouse workers is calculated as follows:

1. Calculate the monthly wage for one warehouse worker:
   \[
   200 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 3000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate the total wages for all four warehouse workers:
   \[
   4 \text{ workers} \times 3000 \text{ dollars/worker} = 12000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total wages for managers.

There are two managers, and each makes $20/hour. The total wages for all managers is calculated as follows:

1. Calculate the monthly wage for one manager:
   \[
   200 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 4000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate the total wages for both managers:
   \[
   2 \text{ managers} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/manager} = 8000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total wages for all employees.

Add the total wages for warehouse workers and managers:
\[
12000 \text{ dollars} + 8000 \text{ dollars} = 20000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the FICA taxes.

Janet has to pay 10% of the total wages in FICA taxes. Calculate the FICA taxes as follows:
\[
0.10 \times 20000 \text{ dollars} = 2000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total amount Janet owes for wages and taxes.

Add the total wages and the FICA taxes:
\[
20000 \text{ dollars} + 2000 \text{ dollars} = 22000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer:

Janet owes a total of $22,000 for the wages and taxes for one month.
