==================================================

To calculate how much Janet owes for her employees' wages and taxes for one month, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total wages for the warehouse workers.**
2. **Calculate the total wages for the managers.**
3. **Calculate the total wages for all employees.**
4. **Calculate the FICA taxes based on the total wages.**
5. **Calculate the total amount owed (wages + FICA taxes).**

### Step 1: Calculate the total wages for the warehouse workers

Janet has 4 warehouse workers, and each makes $15/hour. They work 8 hours a day for 25 days a month.

- Daily wage for one warehouse worker:
  \[
  \text{Daily wage} = 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{dollars}
  \]

- Monthly wage for one warehouse worker:
  \[
  \text{Monthly wage} = 120 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 25 \, \text{days} = 3000 \, \text{dollars}
  \]

- Total monthly wages for all warehouse workers:
  \[
  \text{Total wages for warehouse workers} = 3000 \, \text{dollars/worker} \times 4 \, \text{workers} = 12000 \, \text{dollars}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total wages for the managers

Janet has 2 managers, and each makes $20/hour. They also work 8 hours a day for 25 days a month.

- Daily wage for one manager:
  \[
  \text{Daily wage} = 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 160 \, \text{dollars}
  \]

- Monthly wage for one manager:
  \[
  \text{Monthly wage} = 160 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 25 \, \text{days} = 4000 \, \text{dollars}
  \]

- Total monthly wages for all managers:
  \[
  \text{Total wages for managers} = 4000 \, \text{dollars/manager} \times 2 \, \text{managers} = 8000 \, \text{dollars}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total wages for all employees

Now we add the total wages for warehouse workers and managers:
\[
\text{Total wages} = \text{Total wages for warehouse workers} + \text{Total wages for managers}
\]
\[
\text{Total wages} = 12000 \, \text{dollars} + 8000 \, \text{dollars} = 20000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the FICA taxes

FICA taxes are 10% of the total wages:
\[
\text{FICA taxes} = 0.10 \times \text{Total wages}
\]
\[
\text{FICA taxes} = 0.10 \times 20000 \, \text{dollars} = 2000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total amount owed

Finally, we add the total wages and the FICA taxes to find out how much Janet owes in total:
\[
\text{Total amount owed} = \text{Total wages} + \text{FICA taxes}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount owed} = 20000 \, \text{dollars} + 2000 \, \text{dollars} = 22000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Janet owes a total of **$22,000** for her employees' wages and taxes for one month.
