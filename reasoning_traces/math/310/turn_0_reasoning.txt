To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the total expenses Theo incurs and then determining how much he has left to spend on gifts.

1. **Calculate the cost of business suits:**
   - Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of business suits} = 6 \times 100 = 600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of suitcases:**
   - Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of suitcases} = 3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the flight ticket:**
   - The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of one business suit is $100, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of flight ticket} = 5 \times 100 + 700 = 500 + 700 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total expenses:**
   - Now we sum the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = \text{Cost of business suits} + \text{Cost of suitcases} + \text{Cost of flight ticket}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine how much Theo wants to save:**
   - Theo wishes to save $2000 for his trip.

6. **Calculate the total amount Theo can spend:**
   - Theo has a total of $6000, and he wants to save $2000. Therefore, the amount he can spend is:
   \[
   \text{Amount available for spending} = 6000 - 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Calculate how much Theo has left for gifts:**
   - To find out how much he can spend on gifts, we subtract his total expenses from the amount available for spending:
   \[
   \text{Amount available for gifts} = \text{Amount available for spending} - \text{Total expenses}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount available for gifts} = 4000 - 1950 = 2050 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Theo has **$2050** to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.
