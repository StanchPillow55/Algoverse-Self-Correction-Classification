To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total wages for all employees and then determine the amount Janet owes in FICA taxes. We'll break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total hours worked by each type of employee

Each employee works 25 days a month and 8 hours a day. Therefore, the total number of hours worked by each employee in a month is:

\[
25 \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 200 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total wages for warehouse workers

There are four warehouse workers, each earning $15 per hour. The total wages for all warehouse workers can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total hours for all warehouse workers} = 4 \text{ workers} \times 200 \text{ hours/worker} = 800 \text{ hours}
\]

\[
\text{Total wages for warehouse workers} = 800 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$12,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total wages for managers

There are two managers, each earning $20 per hour. The total wages for all managers can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total hours for all managers} = 2 \text{ managers} \times 200 \text{ hours/manager} = 400 \text{ hours}
\]

\[
\text{Total wages for managers} = 400 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$8,000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total wages for all employees

The total wages for all employees is the sum of the wages for the warehouse workers and the managers:

\[
\text{Total wages} = \$12,000 + \$8,000 = \$20,000
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the FICA taxes

Janet has to pay 10% of her workers' salaries in FICA taxes. Therefore, the FICA taxes can be calculated as:

\[
\text{FICA taxes} = 10\% \times \$20,000 = 0.10 \times \$20,000 = \$2,000
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total amount Janet owes

The total amount Janet owes for wages and taxes is the sum of the total wages and the FICA taxes:

\[
\text{Total amount owed} = \$20,000 + \$2,000 = \$22,000
\]

### Final Answer

Janet owes a total of \$22,000 for the wages and FICA taxes for one month.
