Question ID: 310
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total wages for Janet's employees and then add the FICA taxes she has to pay. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total hours worked by each type of employee.

Each employee works:
- 25 days/month
- 8 hours/day

So, each employee works:
\[ 25 \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 200 \text{ hours/month} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total wages for warehouse workers.

There are 4 warehouse workers, each making $15/hour. Therefore, the total wages for all warehouse workers is:
\[ 4 \text{ workers} \times 200 \text{ hours/month} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 200 \times 15 = \$12,000 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total wages for managers.

There are 2 managers, each making $20/hour. Therefore, the total wages for all managers is:
\[ 2 \text{ managers} \times 200 \text{ hours/month} \times \$20/\text{hour} = 2 \times 200 \times 20 = \$8,000 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total wages for all employees.

Add the total wages for warehouse workers and managers:
\[ \$12,000 + \$8,000 = \$20,000 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the FICA taxes.

Janet has to pay 10% of the total wages in FICA taxes. Therefore, the FICA taxes are:
\[ 0.10 \times \$20,000 = \$2,000 \]

### Step 6: Calculate the total amount Janet owes for wages and taxes.

Add the total wages and the FICA taxes:
\[ \$20,000 + \$2,000 = \$22,000 \]

### Final Answer

Janet owes a total of \$22,000 for her employees' wages and FICA taxes for one month.
