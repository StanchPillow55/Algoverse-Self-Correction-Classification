==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate Linus's total profit from selling the mobile devices he bought.

1. **Determine the cost of the devices:**
   - Linus buys each mobile device for $20.
   - Last Monday, he bought 2 devices:
     \[
     \text{Cost on Monday} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Last Tuesday, he bought 4 devices:
     \[
     \text{Cost on Tuesday} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of all devices:**
   - Total cost for all devices:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost on Monday} + \text{Cost on Tuesday} = 40 + 80 = 120 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the selling price of the devices:**
   - Linus sells each device for twice the purchase price:
     \[
     \text{Selling Price per device} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all devices:**
   - Total number of devices bought:
     \[
     \text{Total Devices} = 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices}
     \]
   - Total revenue from selling all devices:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Total Devices} \times \text{Selling Price per device} = 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Linus earned a profit of **$120** after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday. 

Final answer: **$120**.
