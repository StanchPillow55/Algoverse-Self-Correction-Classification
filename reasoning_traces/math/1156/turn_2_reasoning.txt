Question ID: 1156
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the cost of the devices Linus bought.**
2. **Calculate the selling price of each device.**
3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all devices.**
4. **Calculate the total profit.**

### Step 1: Cost of the Devices
Linus buys each mobile device for $20. 

- On Monday, he bought 2 devices:
  \[
  \text{Cost on Monday} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- On Tuesday, he bought 4 devices:
  \[
  \text{Cost on Tuesday} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- **Total cost for all devices:**
  \[
  \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost on Monday} + \text{Cost on Tuesday} = 40 + 80 = 120 \text{ dollars}
  \]

### Step 2: Selling Price of Each Device
Linus sells each device for twice the amount he bought it for:
\[
\text{Selling Price} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Total Revenue from Selling All Devices
Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the devices he bought.

- Total devices bought:
  \[
  \text{Total Devices} = 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices}
  \]

- Total revenue from selling all devices:
  \[
  \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Total Devices} \times \text{Selling Price} = 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Profit
Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Linus earned a profit of **$120** after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday.
