To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total profit Linus earns from buying and selling mobile devices. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the devices:**
   - Linus buys each mobile device for $20.
   - He bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday.

   First, we calculate the total cost for the devices he bought:

   \[
   \text{Total cost for Monday} = 2 \text{ devices} \times 20 \text{ dollars/device} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total cost for Tuesday} = 4 \text{ devices} \times 20 \text{ dollars/device} = 80 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Now, we add the costs from both days:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 40 \text{ dollars} + 80 \text{ dollars} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the selling price of the devices:**
   - Linus sells each device for twice the amount he bought it for.

   The selling price per device is:

   \[
   \text{Selling price per device} = 2 \times 20 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the devices:

   Linus bought a total of:

   \[
   \text{Total devices} = 2 \text{ devices (Monday)} + 4 \text{ devices (Tuesday)} = 6 \text{ devices}
   \]

   The total revenue from selling all devices is:

   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 6 \text{ devices} \times 40 \text{ dollars/device} = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost.

   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost}
   \]

   Substituting the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Profit} = 240 \text{ dollars} - 120 \text{ dollars} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Linus was able to earn a profit of **$120** after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday.

**Final Answer: $120**
