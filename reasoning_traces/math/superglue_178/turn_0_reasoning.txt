==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 178" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $30, and the profit from each unit of product B is $50. The company can produce a maximum of 200 units of product A and 150 units of product B per week. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 300 units per week. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit \( P \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     P = 30x + 50y
     \]
   - We want to maximize this profit.

3. **Constraints:**
   - The company can produce a maximum of 200 units of product A:
     \[
     x \leq 200
     \]
   - The company can produce a maximum of 150 units of product B:
     \[
     y \leq 150
     \]
   - The total production of products A and B cannot exceed 300 units:
     \[
     x + y \leq 300
     \]
   - Non-negativity constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines \( x = 200 \), \( y = 150 \), and \( x + y = 300 \).

5. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are where the constraints intersect:
     - \( (0, 0) \)
     - \( (200, 0) \)
     - \( (150, 150) \)
     - \( (0, 150) \)
     - \( (200, 100) \) (intersection of \( x = 200 \) and \( x + y = 300 \))

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(0, 0) = 30(0) + 50(0) = 0 \)
   - \( P(200, 0) = 30(200) + 50(0) = 6000 \)
   - \( P(150, 150) = 30(150) + 50(150) = 4500 + 7500 = 12000 \)
   - \( P(0, 150) = 30(0) + 50(150) = 7500 \)
   - \( P(200, 100) = 30(200) + 50(100) = 6000 + 5000 = 11000 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the point \( (150, 150) \) with a profit of $12,000.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 150 units of product A and 150 units of product B, resulting in a maximum profit of $12,000.
