==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 178" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, let's assume a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 54 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given that the length \( L \) of the rectangle is twice its width \( W \).
   - The perimeter \( P \) of the rectangle is 54 units.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]
   - We know \( L = 2W \) (since the length is twice the width).
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     54 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]

3. **Simplify and Solve for \( W \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     54 = 4W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     54 = 6W
     \]
   - Solve for \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{54}{6} = 9
     \]

4. **Find the Length \( L \):**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute \( W = 9 \) into the equation:
     \[
     L = 2 \times 9 = 18
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(9) = 36 + 18 = 54
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width \( W = 9 \) units
- Length \( L = 18 \) units
