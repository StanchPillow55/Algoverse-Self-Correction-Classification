==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon, given that the shadows stretch an extra 5 feet for each hour past noon.

### Step 1: Determine the length of the shadows in feet

At noon, the length of the shadows is 0 feet. According to the problem, for each hour past noon, the shadows increase in length by 5 feet. 

We can calculate the total increase in shadow length after 6 hours:

\[
\text{Increase in shadow length} = \text{Number of hours} \times \text{Increase per hour}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Increase in shadow length} = 6 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ feet/hour} = 30 \text{ feet}
\]

### Step 2: Total length of the shadows

Since the shadows start at 0 feet at noon, the total length of the shadows 6 hours past noon is simply the increase we calculated:

\[
\text{Total length of shadows} = 30 \text{ feet}
\]

### Step 3: Convert the length from feet to inches

We need to convert the length of the shadows from feet to inches. We know that:

\[
1 \text{ foot} = 12 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert 30 feet to inches, we multiply by 12:

\[
\text{Total length in inches} = 30 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 360 \text{ inches}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the length of the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon is:

\[
\boxed{360} \text{ inches}
\]
