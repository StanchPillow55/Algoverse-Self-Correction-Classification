==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon, given that the shadows stretch an extra 5 feet every hour starting from zero at noon.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the rate of shadow growth:**
   - At noon, the shadow length is 0 feet.
   - Every hour past noon, the shadow grows by 5 feet.

2. **Calculate the shadow length 6 hours past noon:**
   - Since the shadow grows by 5 feet each hour, after 6 hours, the shadow will have grown by:
     \[
     5 \text{ feet/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Convert the shadow length from feet to inches:**
   - We know that 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches.
   - Therefore, to convert 30 feet to inches, we multiply by 12:
     \[
     30 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 360 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The length of the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon is 360 inches.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{360 \text{ inches}}
\]
