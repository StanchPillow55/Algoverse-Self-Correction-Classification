==================================================

To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we first need to find out how much material is required for each type of mask.

### Step 1: Calculate the material needed for small masks

Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. Therefore, the material needed for one small mask is:

\[
\text{Material per small mask} = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per small mask}
\]

Now, to find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks:

\[
\text{Material for 20 small masks} = 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the material needed for large masks

Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. Therefore, the material needed for one large mask is:

\[
\text{Material per large mask} = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per large mask}
\]

Now, to find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks:

\[
\text{Material for 8 large masks} = 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total material needed

Now we add the material needed for both small and large masks:

\[
\text{Total material} = \text{Material for small masks} + \text{Material for large masks}
\]
\[
\text{Total material} = 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
\]

### Final Answer

Jo needs a total of **16 yards** of material to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks.
