==================================================

To solve a problem effectively, it's important to first understand the question and identify the key components involved. However, the problem statement you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 134," does not contain specific details or numerical data to work with. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical scenario.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A store sells apples and oranges. The price of an apple is $0.50, and the price of an orange is $0.75. If a customer buys a total of 20 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends $12.00, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of fruits is 20: 
     \[
     x + y = 20
     \]
   - The total cost is $12.00:
     \[
     0.50x + 0.75y = 12.00
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - First, solve the first equation for one variable. Let's solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 20 - y
     \]
   - Substitute \( x = 20 - y \) into the second equation:
     \[
     0.50(20 - y) + 0.75y = 12.00
     \]
   - Distribute and simplify:
     \[
     10 - 0.50y + 0.75y = 12.00
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     10 + 0.25y = 12.00
     \]
   - Solve for \( y \):
     \[
     0.25y = 2.00
     \]
     \[
     y = \frac{2.00}{0.25} = 8
     \]

4. **Find the Value of \( x \):**
   - Substitute \( y = 8 \) back into the equation \( x = 20 - y \):
     \[
     x = 20 - 8 = 12
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The customer bought 12 apples and 8 oranges.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 12 apples and 8 oranges.
