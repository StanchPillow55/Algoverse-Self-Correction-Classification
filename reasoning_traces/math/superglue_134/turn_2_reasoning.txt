Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 134" entails. Since the question is not specified, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 134" is the following problem:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $30, and the profit from each unit of product B is $50. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 150 units per day. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit \( P \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     P = 30x + 50y
     \]
   - We want to maximize \( P \).

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 100 \quad \text{(maximum units of A)}
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 80 \quad \text{(maximum units of B)}
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 150 \quad \text{(total production limit)}
     \]
   - Non-negativity constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines \( x = 100 \), \( y = 80 \), and \( x + y = 150 \).

5. **Vertices of the Feasible Region:**
   - The vertices of the feasible region are found by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraint lines:
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \):
       \[
       100 + y = 150 \implies y = 50 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (100, 50)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \):
       \[
       x + 80 = 150 \implies x = 70 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (70, 80)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 80 \):
       \[
       (0, 80)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( y = 0 \) and \( x = 100 \):
       \[
       (100, 0)
       \]

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - \( P(100, 50) = 30(100) + 50(50) = 3000 + 2500 = 5500 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 30(70) + 50(80) = 2100 + 4000 = 6100 \)
   - \( P(0, 80) = 30(0) + 50(80) = 0 + 4000 = 4000 \)
   - \( P(100, 0) = 30(100) + 50(0) = 3000 + 0 = 3000 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 6100 \) at the point \( (70, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 70 units of product A and 80 units of product B, resulting in a maximum profit of $6100.
