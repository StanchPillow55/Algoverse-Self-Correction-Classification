==================================================

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or missing information in your request. "Sample reasoning question 134" doesn't provide enough context or detail for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by outlining a step-by-step method. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what is missing.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that could be used to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning).
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of your work to avoid mistakes.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
