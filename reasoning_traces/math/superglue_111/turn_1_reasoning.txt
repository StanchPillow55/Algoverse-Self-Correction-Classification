Question ID: superglue_111
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 111" refers to. However, without additional context or specific details about the problem, it's challenging to provide a precise solution. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 111" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Since no specific problem is given, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem using logical reasoning and calculations.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

Without a specific problem, let's consider a common type of math problem: solving a linear equation. For example, let's solve the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

The goal is to solve for \( x \). To do this, we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

1. Subtract 3 from both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left side:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 3: Verify the Solution**

Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

\[ 
2(4) + 3 = 11 
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 
8 + 3 = 11 
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
