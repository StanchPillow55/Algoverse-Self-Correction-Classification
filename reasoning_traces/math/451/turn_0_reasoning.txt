==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps described in the question and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Initial Quantity of Light Bulbs:**
   John starts with a box of 40 light bulbs.

2. **Light Bulbs Used by John:**
   John uses 16 of these light bulbs. To find out how many light bulbs he has left after using some, we subtract the number of light bulbs he used from the initial quantity:
   \[
   40 - 16 = 24
   \]
   So, John has 24 light bulbs remaining after using 16.

3. **Light Bulbs Given to a Friend:**
   John gives half of the remaining light bulbs to a friend. To find out how many light bulbs he gives away, we calculate half of the remaining 24 light bulbs:
   \[
   \frac{24}{2} = 12
   \]
   John gives 12 light bulbs to his friend.

4. **Light Bulbs Left with John:**
   To find out how many light bulbs John has left after giving some to his friend, we subtract the number of light bulbs given away from the number he had after using some:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]
   Therefore, John has 12 light bulbs left.

**Final Answer:**
John has 12 light bulbs left.
