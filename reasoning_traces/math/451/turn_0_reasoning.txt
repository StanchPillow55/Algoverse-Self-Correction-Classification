To solve the problem, we will go through it step by step.

1. **Initial Quantity of Light Bulbs**: John starts with a box of 40 light bulbs.

   \[
   \text{Initial light bulbs} = 40
   \]

2. **Light Bulbs Used**: John uses 16 light bulbs.

   \[
   \text{Light bulbs used} = 16
   \]

3. **Calculating Remaining Light Bulbs**: To find out how many light bulbs John has left after using some, we subtract the number of bulbs used from the initial quantity.

   \[
   \text{Remaining light bulbs} = \text{Initial light bulbs} - \text{Light bulbs used}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining light bulbs} = 40 - 16 = 24
   \]

4. **Giving Half to a Friend**: John then gives half of the remaining light bulbs to a friend. To find out how many he gives away, we calculate half of the remaining light bulbs.

   \[
   \text{Light bulbs given to friend} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Remaining light bulbs}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Light bulbs given to friend} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12
   \]

5. **Calculating Final Quantity of Light Bulbs**: Now, we need to find out how many light bulbs John has left after giving some to his friend. We subtract the number of bulbs given away from the remaining light bulbs.

   \[
   \text{Final light bulbs left} = \text{Remaining light bulbs} - \text{Light bulbs given to friend}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final light bulbs left} = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Thus, after using 16 light bulbs and giving half of the remaining ones to a friend, John has **12 light bulbs left**.

Final answer:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
