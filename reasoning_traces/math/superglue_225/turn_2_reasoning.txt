Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 225" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I will assume a generic approach to solving a typical math problem. Let's consider a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3, to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify the solution.

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side gives:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).

This completes the problem-solving process for the hypothetical problem. If "Sample reasoning question 225" refers to a specific problem, please provide additional details or context for a more accurate solution.
