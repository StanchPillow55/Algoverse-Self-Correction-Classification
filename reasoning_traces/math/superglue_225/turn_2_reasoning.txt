==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 225" entails. Since the problem statement is not clear, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of gadgets: Gadget A and Gadget B. The company sells Gadget A for $50 each and Gadget B for $70 each. The production cost for Gadget A is $30, and for Gadget B, it is $40. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 gadgets and made a total revenue of $28,000. How many of each type of gadget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Gadget A sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Gadget B sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of gadgets sold is 500:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - The total revenue from selling the gadgets is $28,000. The revenue from Gadget A is \( 50x \) and from Gadget B is \( 70y \):
     \[
     50x + 70y = 28000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 500 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   50x + 70y &= 28000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 500 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   50x + 70(500 - x) = 28000
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   50x + 35000 - 70x = 28000
   \]

   \[
   -20x + 35000 = 28000
   \]

   \[
   -20x = 28000 - 35000
   \]

   \[
   -20x = -7000
   \]

   \[
   x = \frac{-7000}{-20} = 350
   \]

4. **Find \( y \):**

   Substitute \( x = 350 \) back into the equation \( y = 500 - x \):
   \[
   y = 500 - 350 = 150
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the total revenue:
   \[
   50(350) + 70(150) = 17500 + 10500 = 28000
   \]

   The calculations are correct.

**Final Answer:**

The company sold 350 units of Gadget A and 150 units of Gadget B.
