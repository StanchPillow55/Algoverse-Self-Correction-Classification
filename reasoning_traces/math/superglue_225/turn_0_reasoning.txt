==================================================

It seems like the question "Sample reasoning question 225" is not providing enough specific information or context for me to solve a particular math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving a math problem by demonstrating a step-by-step reasoning process. Let's assume a sample math problem and solve it.

**Sample Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to solve for \( x \) in the linear equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]
   - By subtracting 5 from both sides, we have simplified the equation to \( 3x = 15 \).

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]
   - By dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we have isolated \( x \) and found that \( x = 5 \).

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
