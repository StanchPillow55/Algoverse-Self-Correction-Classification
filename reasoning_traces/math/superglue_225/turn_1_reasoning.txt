Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 225" refers to. However, without additional context or specific details about the problem, it's not possible to provide a direct solution. Instead, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 225" is a math problem involving basic arithmetic or algebra. Here's how we might approach solving such a problem:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully.** Identify what is being asked and what information is provided.
- **Identify the type of problem.** Is it algebraic, geometric, arithmetic, etc.?

### Step 2: Plan a Solution
- **Determine the method needed to solve the problem.** This could involve setting up an equation, drawing a diagram, or using a formula.
- **Consider similar problems.** Think about how similar problems were solved and if those methods can be applied here.

### Step 3: Execute the Plan
- **Carry out the calculations.** Follow the steps you planned to solve the problem.
- **Show all work.** Write down each step clearly to avoid mistakes and to make it easier to review.

### Step 4: Review and Check
- **Verify the solution.** Check if the answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
- **Recalculate if necessary.** If the answer seems incorrect, go through the steps again to find any errors.

### Example Problem
Let's create an example problem to illustrate these steps:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

#### Step 2: Plan a Solution
- We will isolate \( x \) by performing inverse operations.

#### Step 3: Execute the Plan
1. Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Review and Check
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This example demonstrates a structured approach to solving a math problem. If "Sample reasoning question 225" refers to a specific problem, please provide more details so I can offer a precise solution.
