==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost James paid for the beef. We can do this by following these steps:

1. **Determine the total weight of the beef:**
   - James buys 5 packs of beef, and each pack weighs 4 pounds.
   - To find the total weight, multiply the number of packs by the weight of each pack:
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = 5 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ pounds per pack} = 20 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the beef:**
   - The price of beef is $5.50 per pound.
   - To find the total cost, multiply the total weight of the beef by the price per pound:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 20 \text{ pounds} \times 5.50 \text{ dollars per pound}
     \]

3. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - First, multiply 20 by 5.50:
     \[
     20 \times 5.50 = 110.00
     \]

4. **State the final answer:**
   - James paid a total of $110.00 for the beef.

Therefore, the final answer is that James paid **$110.00**.
