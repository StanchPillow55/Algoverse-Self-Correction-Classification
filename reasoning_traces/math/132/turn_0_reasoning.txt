==================================================

To determine how much James paid for the beef, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the beef**:
   James buys 5 packs of beef, and each pack weighs 4 pounds. Therefore, the total weight can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Weight per pack}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 5 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ pounds/pack} = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the beef**:
   The price of beef is $5.50 per pound. To find the total cost, we multiply the total weight by the price per pound:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total weight} \times \text{Price per pound}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 20 \text{ pounds} \times 5.50 \text{ dollars/pound}
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   20 \times 5.50 = 110
   \]

3. **Final calculation**:
   Therefore, the total cost that James paid for the beef is $110.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{110}
\]
