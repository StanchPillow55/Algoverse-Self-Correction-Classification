Question ID: mathbench_390
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 390" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 390" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 390:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[ 3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5 \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[ 3x = 15 \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now that we have \( 3x = 15 \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:

   \[ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3} \]

   Simplifying both sides results in:

   \[ x = 5 \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

   \[ 3(5) + 5 = 20 \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
