Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I first need to understand what "Sample math problem 419" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 419" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 419:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 2(x + 4) + 3 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Expand the Equation:**

   Start by expanding the right side of the equation:

   \[
   2(x + 4) = 2x + 8
   \]

   Substitute back into the equation:

   \[
   3x + 5 = 2x + 8 + 3
   \]

2. **Simplify the Equation:**

   Combine like terms on the right side:

   \[
   3x + 5 = 2x + 11
   \]

3. **Isolate \( x \):**

   To isolate \( x \), first subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:

   \[
   3x - 2x + 5 = 11
   \]

   Simplify:

   \[
   x + 5 = 11
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**

   Subtract 5 from both sides to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   x = 11 - 5
   \]

   \[
   x = 6
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**

   Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation to verify:

   \[
   3(6) + 5 = 2(6 + 4) + 3
   \]

   Simplify both sides:

   Left side: \( 18 + 5 = 23 \)

   Right side: \( 2(10) + 3 = 20 + 3 = 23 \)

   Since both sides are equal, the solution \( x = 6 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 6 \).
