==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 379" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a sample math problem using the number 379 and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Find the sum of the digits of the number 379 and determine if the sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Digits of the Number:**
   The number 379 consists of three digits: 3, 7, and 9.

2. **Calculate the Sum of the Digits:**
   To find the sum of the digits, we add them together:
   \[
   3 + 7 + 9 = 19
   \]

3. **Determine if the Sum is a Prime Number:**
   A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. We need to check if 19 is a prime number.

   - Check divisibility by 2: 19 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - Check divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 19 is \(1 + 9 = 10\), which is not divisible by 3.
   - Check divisibility by 5: 19 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

   Since 19 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root (approximately 4.36), 19 is a prime number.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the digits of the number 379 is 19, and 19 is a prime number.
