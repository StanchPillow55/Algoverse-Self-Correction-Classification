==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 379" refers to. Since this is not a standard problem description, I'll assume it might be a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without additional context, I'll create a hypothetical math problem using the number 379 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 379, and then determine if this sum is a prime number.

**Step 1: Calculate the sum of the digits of 379.**

The number 379 consists of three digits: 3, 7, and 9.

Sum of the digits = 3 + 7 + 9

Let's perform the addition:

3 + 7 = 10

10 + 9 = 19

So, the sum of the digits of 379 is 19.

**Step 2: Determine if 19 is a prime number.**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

To check if 19 is a prime number, we need to verify that it is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 19.

The square root of 19 is approximately 4.36. Therefore, we only need to check divisibility by the prime numbers 2 and 3 (since 4 is not a prime number).

- **Divisibility by 2:** 19 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

- **Divisibility by 3:** To check divisibility by 3, we sum the digits of 19: 1 + 9 = 10. Since 10 is not divisible by 3, 19 is not divisible by 3.

Since 19 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root, 19 is a prime number.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the digits of 379 is 19, and 19 is a prime number.
