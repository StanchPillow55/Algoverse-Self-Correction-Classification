==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 379," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 379" is not specific and does not provide any details about what the problem entails. Therefore, I will assume that this is a placeholder for a specific math problem that needs to be solved.

Since no specific details are provided, I will create a hypothetical math problem based on the number 379 and solve it. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Find the sum of the digits of the number 379 and determine if the sum is a prime number.

**Step 1: Find the sum of the digits of 379.**

The number 379 consists of three digits: 3, 7, and 9.

To find the sum of these digits, we add them together:

\[ 3 + 7 + 9 = 19 \]

**Step 2: Determine if the sum (19) is a prime number.**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To determine if 19 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and 19.

The numbers we need to check are those less than the square root of 19. The square root of 19 is approximately 4.36, so we check divisibility by the prime numbers less than or equal to 4, which are 2 and 3.

- **Divisibility by 2:** 19 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
- **Divisibility by 3:** To check if 19 is divisible by 3, we sum its digits (1 + 9 = 10) and check if the result is divisible by 3. Since 10 is not divisible by 3, 19 is not divisible by 3.

Since 19 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself, it is a prime number.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the digits of 379 is 19, and 19 is a prime number.
