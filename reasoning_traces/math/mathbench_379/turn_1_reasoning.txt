Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 379," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 379" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact question or what calculations are needed. Without additional context or details, it's impossible to provide a specific solution.

However, let's assume "Sample math problem 379" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Math Problem 379:
**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
