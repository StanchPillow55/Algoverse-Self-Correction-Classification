==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 173" entails. Since the specific details of the problem are not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume this is a problem involving logical reasoning and mathematical calculations.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement to identify what is being asked.
   - Determine the type of problem: Is it algebraic, geometric, arithmetic, or a logical puzzle?

2. **Identify Known and Unknown Variables:**
   - List out what information is given.
   - Identify what needs to be found or solved.

3. **Formulate a Plan:**
   - Decide on the best approach to solve the problem. This could involve setting up equations, drawing diagrams, or using logical reasoning.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out the necessary calculations or logical steps.
   - Be meticulous with each step to avoid errors.

5. **Review and Verify:**
   - Check the solution to ensure it makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Verify calculations and logic to confirm accuracy.

### Hypothetical Problem Example:

**Problem Statement:**
"Two numbers add up to 10, and their product is 21. What are the numbers?"

**Solution:**

1. **Identify Known and Unknowns:**
   - Let the two numbers be \( x \) and \( y \).
   - We know:
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
     \[
     xy = 21
     \]

2. **Formulate a Plan:**
   - Use the system of equations to find \( x \) and \( y \).

3. **Execute the Plan:**
   - From the first equation, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 10 - x
     \]
   - Substitute \( y \) in the second equation:
     \[
     x(10 - x) = 21
     \]
     \[
     10x - x^2 = 21
     \]
     \[
     x^2 - 10x + 21 = 0
     \]
   - Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
     where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -10 \), \( c = 21 \).
     \[
     x = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{(-10)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 21}}{2 \cdot 1}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{100 - 84}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{16}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{10 \pm 4}{2}
     \]
   - This gives two solutions for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{10 + 4}{2} = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{10 - 4}{2} = 3
     \]

4. **Find Corresponding \( y \) Values:**
   - If \( x = 7 \), then \( y = 10 - 7 = 3 \).
   - If \( x = 3 \), then \( y = 10 - 3 = 7 \).

5. **Review and Verify:**
   - Check the product: \( 7 \times 3 = 21 \) and \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).
   - Both conditions of the problem are satisfied.

**Final Answer:**
The two numbers are 7 and 3.
