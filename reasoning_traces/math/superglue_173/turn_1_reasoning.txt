==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 173" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem by creating a hypothetical question and solving it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A for $10 per unit and Type B for $15 per unit. Last month, the company produced a total of 1,000 widgets and made a total profit of $6,000. How many of each type of widget did the company produce?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Total widgets produced: 
     \[
     x + y = 1000
     \]
   - Profit from Type A: \( (10 - 5)x = 5x \)
   - Profit from Type B: \( (15 - 8)y = 7y \)
   - Total profit equation:
     \[
     5x + 7y = 6000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 1000 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   5x + 7y &= 6000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   - From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 1000 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 1000 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     5x + 7(1000 - x) = 6000
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     5x + 7000 - 7x = 6000
     \]
     \[
     -2x + 7000 = 6000
     \]
     \[
     -2x = 6000 - 7000
     \]
     \[
     -2x = -1000
     \]
     \[
     x = 500
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 500 \) back into the expression for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 1000 - 500 = 500
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Check the total number of widgets:
     \[
     x + y = 500 + 500 = 1000 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]

   - Check the total profit:
     \[
     5x + 7y = 5(500) + 7(500) = 2500 + 3500 = 6000 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**

   The company produced 500 Type A widgets and 500 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company produced 500 Type A widgets and 500 Type B widgets.
