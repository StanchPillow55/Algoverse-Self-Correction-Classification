==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 173." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by solving a sample problem. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A car travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour and returns from City B to City A at a speed of 40 miles per hour. If the total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours, what is the distance between City A and City B?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B in miles.
   - The speed from City A to City B is 60 mph.
   - The speed from City B to City A is 40 mph.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B is \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - The time taken to travel from City B to City A is \( \frac{d}{40} \) hours.
   - The total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours.

3. **Equation for Total Time:**
   \[
   \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = 5
   \]

4. **Find a Common Denominator:**
   - The common denominator for 60 and 40 is 120.

5. **Rewrite the Equation:**
   \[
   \frac{d}{60} = \frac{d \times 2}{120} = \frac{2d}{120}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{d}{40} = \frac{d \times 3}{120} = \frac{3d}{120}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = 5
   \]

6. **Combine the Fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{2d + 3d}{120} = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{5d}{120} = 5
   \]

7. **Solve for \( d \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 120 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   5d = 5 \times 120
   \]
   \[
   5d = 600
   \]
   - Divide both sides by 5:
   \[
   d = \frac{600}{5}
   \]
   \[
   d = 120
   \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.

**Final Answer:**
The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.
