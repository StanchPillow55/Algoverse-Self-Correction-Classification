==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 173" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume a hypothetical math problem and demonstrate how to solve it step-by-step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. A customer buys a total of 10 fruits, spending exactly $25. How many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( o \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The total number of fruits bought is 10. Therefore, the first equation is:
     \[
     a + o = 10
     \]
   - The total cost of the fruits is $25. Since apples cost $2 each and oranges cost $3 each, the second equation is:
     \[
     2a + 3o = 25
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   a + o &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   2a + 3o &= 25 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Step 1: Solve Equation 1 for one variable:**

   From Equation 1, solve for \( a \):
   \[
   a = 10 - o
   \]

   **Step 2: Substitute into Equation 2:**

   Substitute \( a = 10 - o \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   2(10 - o) + 3o = 25
   \]

   **Step 3: Simplify and solve for \( o \):**

   Distribute the 2:
   \[
   20 - 2o + 3o = 25
   \]

   Combine like terms:
   \[
   20 + o = 25
   \]

   Subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   o = 5
   \]

   **Step 4: Solve for \( a \):**

   Substitute \( o = 5 \) back into the equation \( a = 10 - o \):
   \[
   a = 10 - 5 = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the solution in both original equations:
   - Equation 1: \( a + o = 5 + 5 = 10 \) (Correct)
   - Equation 2: \( 2a + 3o = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25 \) (Correct)

Both equations are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.
