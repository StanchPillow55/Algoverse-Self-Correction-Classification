==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 173" might entail. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. If the company produces 100 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets, what is the total profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Determine the Total Production Cost:**

   - For Type A widgets:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type A} = \text{Number of Type A widgets} \times \text{Cost per Type A widget} = 100 \times 5 = 500
     \]

   - For Type B widgets:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type B} = \text{Number of Type B widgets} \times \text{Cost per Type B widget} = 150 \times 8 = 1200
     \]

   - Total production cost:
     \[
     \text{Total Production Cost} = \text{Cost for Type A} + \text{Cost for Type B} = 500 + 1200 = 1700
     \]

2. **Determine the Total Revenue:**

   - For Type A widgets:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from Type A} = \text{Number of Type A widgets} \times \text{Selling price per Type A widget} = 100 \times 10 = 1000
     \]

   - For Type B widgets:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from Type B} = \text{Number of Type B widgets} \times \text{Selling price per Type B widget} = 150 \times 15 = 2250
     \]

   - Total revenue:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Revenue from Type A} + \text{Revenue from Type B} = 1000 + 2250 = 3250
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Profit:**

   - Profit is defined as the total revenue minus the total production cost:
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Production Cost} = 3250 - 1700 = 1550
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The total profit from producing and selling the widgets is $1550.
