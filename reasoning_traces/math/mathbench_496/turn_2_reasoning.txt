Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 496" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't explicitly stated, let's assume a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 496" and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume "Sample math problem 496" is the following:

**Problem:**  
Calculate the sum of the first 496 positive integers.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) integers.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify \( n \):**  
   In this problem, \( n = 496 \).

2. **Apply the formula:**  
   Substitute \( n = 496 \) into the formula:

   \[
   S_{496} = \frac{496(496 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( 496 + 1 \):**  
   \[
   496 + 1 = 497
   \]

4. **Calculate the product \( 496 \times 497 \):**  
   To find \( 496 \times 497 \), we can use the distributive property:

   \[
   496 \times 497 = 496 \times (500 - 3) = 496 \times 500 - 496 \times 3
   \]

   - Calculate \( 496 \times 500 \):

     \[
     496 \times 500 = 248000
     \]

   - Calculate \( 496 \times 3 \):

     \[
     496 \times 3 = 1488
     \]

   - Subtract the two results:

     \[
     248000 - 1488 = 246512
     \]

5. **Divide by 2 to find the sum:**  
   \[
   S_{496} = \frac{246512}{2} = 123256
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 496 positive integers is \( \boxed{123256} \).
