Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 496" refers to. Without specific details about the problem, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires a step-by-step solution. Since the problem isn't specified, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. The constant term here is \( 5 \).

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract \( 5 \) from both sides of the equation to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is \( 3 \).

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
