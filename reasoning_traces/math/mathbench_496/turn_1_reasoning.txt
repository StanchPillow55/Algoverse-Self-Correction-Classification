==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 496," I need more specific information about what the problem entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem based on the number 496 and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Determine whether the number 496 is a perfect number.

**Step 1: Understand the Definition of a Perfect Number**

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. Proper divisors are all the divisors of a number except the number itself.

**Step 2: Find the Proper Divisors of 496**

To find the proper divisors of 496, we need to find all the numbers less than 496 that divide 496 evenly.

1. Start with 1, which is a divisor of every integer.
2. Check divisibility by 2: 496 is even, so 2 is a divisor.
3. Continue checking divisibility by integers up to the square root of 496, which is approximately 22.27. We only need to check up to 22 because any factor larger than this would pair with a smaller factor already checked.

Let's list the divisors:

- 1 is a divisor.
- 2 is a divisor (496 ÷ 2 = 248).
- 4 is a divisor (496 ÷ 4 = 124).
- 8 is a divisor (496 ÷ 8 = 62).
- 16 is a divisor (496 ÷ 16 = 31).
- 31 is a divisor (496 ÷ 31 = 16).
- 62 is a divisor (496 ÷ 62 = 8).
- 124 is a divisor (496 ÷ 124 = 4).
- 248 is a divisor (496 ÷ 248 = 2).

The proper divisors of 496 are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124, and 248.

**Step 3: Sum the Proper Divisors**

Add the proper divisors together:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 31 + 62 + 124 + 248 = 496 \]

**Step 4: Compare the Sum to the Original Number**

The sum of the proper divisors of 496 is 496, which is equal to the original number.

**Conclusion:**

Since the sum of the proper divisors of 496 equals the number itself, 496 is a perfect number.

**Final Answer:**

496 is a perfect number.
