==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 279" refers to. Since no specific details about the problem are provided, I will assume a generic math problem for the sake of demonstration. Let's assume the problem involves solving a quadratic equation, as this is a common type of math problem.

**Problem: Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the standard form of a quadratic equation:**
   A quadratic equation is generally in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). Here, \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

2. **Use the quadratic formula:**
   The quadratic formula is given by:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   We will use this formula to find the roots of the equation.

3. **Calculate the discriminant (\(b^2 - 4ac\)):**
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6)
   \]
   \[
   = 16 + 48
   \]
   \[
   = 64
   \]

4. **Substitute the values into the quadratic formula:**
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

5. **Calculate the two possible values for \(x\):**
   - For the positive square root:
     \[
     x = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   - For the negative square root:
     \[
     x = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

6. **Verify the solutions:**
   Substitute \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\) back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it.

   - For \(x = 3\):
     \[
     2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
     \]
     This is correct.

   - For \(x = -1\):
     \[
     2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
     \]
     This is also correct.

### Final Answer:
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
