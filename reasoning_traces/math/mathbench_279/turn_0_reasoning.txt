To solve "Sample math problem 279," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 279" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle where the length (L) is 3 times the width (W).
   - The perimeter (P) of the rectangle is given as 48 units.
   - We need to find the dimensions of the rectangle, i.e., the length and the width.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]
   - We know \( P = 48 \), so:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 48
     \]
   - We also know that the length is 3 times the width:
     \[
     L = 3W
     \]

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(3W) + 2W = 48
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     6W + 2W = 48
     \]
     \[
     8W = 48
     \]
   - Solve for \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

4. **Find the Length:**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 3W \) to find the length:
     \[
     L = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 6 units
- Length = 18 units
