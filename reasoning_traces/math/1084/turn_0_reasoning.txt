To solve the problem, we need to determine how much fence Sam and Harry each receive, given that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam and together they have 100 feet of fence.

Let's denote the amount of fence Sam receives as \( S \) (in feet). According to the problem, Harry receives 60 feet more than Sam, so we can express the amount of fence Harry receives as:

\[
H = S + 60
\]

We know that the total amount of fence they have together is 100 feet. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
S + H = 100
\]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) into the equation gives us:

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

Now, we can simplify this equation:

\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]

Next, we will isolate \( S \) by first subtracting 60 from both sides:

\[
2S = 100 - 60
\]
\[
2S = 40
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):

\[
S = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now that we have found \( S \), we can find \( H \) using the expression we derived earlier:

\[
H = S + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80
\]

Now we have:

- Sam receives \( S = 20 \) feet of fence.
- Harry receives \( H = 80 \) feet of fence.

To answer the question of how much is left over for Sam, we note that the problem states they are splitting the 100 feet of fence, and there is no leftover fence since they have divided it all. 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Sam has } 20 \text{ feet of fence.}
\] 

There is no leftover fence for Sam. 

Final answer: **20 feet** (for Sam).
