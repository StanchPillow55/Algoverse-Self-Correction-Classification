Question ID: 1084
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the amount of fence that Sam gets as \( S \) feet and the amount that Harry gets as \( H \) feet. According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total amount of fence is 100 feet:
   \[
   S + H = 100
   \]

2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam:
   \[
   H = S + 60
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. Replacing \( H \) in the first equation gives us:
\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

Now, simplify this equation:
\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]

Next, we will isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides:
\[
2S = 100 - 60
\]
\[
2S = 40
\]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):
\[
S = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now that we have \( S \), we can find \( H \) using the equation \( H = S + 60 \):
\[
H = 20 + 60 = 80
\]

Now, we have:
- Sam gets \( S = 20 \) feet of fence.
- Harry gets \( H = 80 \) feet of fence.

Finally, the problem asks how much is left over for Sam. Since the total fence is 100 feet and Sam has 20 feet, there is no leftover fence. Therefore, the amount left over for Sam is:

\[
\text{Left over for Sam} = 0 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]
