Question ID: 1084
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the amount of fence that Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can express the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H = S + 60 \) feet.

We know that the total amount of fence they have is 100 feet. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
S + H = 100
\]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) into the equation gives us:

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

Now, we can combine like terms:

\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]

Next, we will isolate \( S \) by first subtracting 60 from both sides:

\[
2S = 100 - 60
\]
\[
2S = 40
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):

\[
S = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now that we have found \( S \), we can find \( H \) using the expression \( H = S + 60 \):

\[
H = 20 + 60 = 80
\]

Now we can check our work by verifying that the total length of the fence adds up to 100 feet:

\[
S + H = 20 + 80 = 100
\]

This confirms that our calculations are correct. 

Finally, the question asks how much is left over for Sam. Since Sam is getting 20 feet of fence, there is no leftover fence; he simply has 20 feet.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Sam has } 20 \text{ feet of fence.}
\]
