Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles to cross the same distance.

### Step 1: Determine the distance traveled by the kangaroos

We know that 3 kangaroos take a total of 18 hours to cross the highway. Since they are traveling together, we can assume they are covering the same distance. 

Letâ€™s denote the speed of one kangaroo as \( v_k \) (in some units of distance per hour). The total time taken by the 3 kangaroos is 18 hours. The distance \( d \) they travel can be calculated using the formula:

\[
d = \text{speed} \times \text{time}
\]

Since all 3 kangaroos are traveling together, the distance they cover can be expressed as:

\[
d = 3 \times v_k \times 18
\]

However, since we are interested in the distance covered by one kangaroo, we can simplify this to:

\[
d = v_k \times 18
\]

### Step 2: Find the speed of the turtles

The problem states that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, the speed of one turtle \( v_t \) can be expressed as:

\[
v_t = \frac{1}{2} v_k
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the time it takes for the turtles to cross the same distance

Now we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cover the same distance \( d \). The time \( t \) taken by the turtles to cover the distance can be calculated using the formula:

\[
t = \frac{d}{\text{speed}}
\]

Substituting the distance \( d \) and the speed of the turtles \( v_t \):

\[
t = \frac{d}{4 \times v_t}
\]

Substituting \( v_t = \frac{1}{2} v_k \):

\[
t = \frac{d}{4 \times \left(\frac{1}{2} v_k\right)} = \frac{d}{2 v_k}
\]

### Step 4: Substitute the expression for distance \( d \)

We already have \( d = v_k \times 18 \). Now we can substitute this into our equation for \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{v_k \times 18}{2 v_k}
\]

The \( v_k \) terms cancel out:

\[
t = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

It will take 4 turtles a total of **9 hours** to travel across the highway.
