To solve the problem, we need to first determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles to cross the same distance.

### Step 1: Determine the distance traveled by the kangaroos

We know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. Since they are all traveling at the same speed, we can calculate the total distance traveled by the kangaroos.

Let \( v \) be the speed of one kangaroo. The distance \( d \) that the kangaroos travel can be calculated using the formula:

\[
d = \text{speed} \times \text{time}
\]

Since there are 3 kangaroos traveling for 18 hours, the distance can be expressed as:

\[
d = 3v \times 18
\]

However, since we are interested in the distance that needs to be crossed, we can simplify this to:

\[
d = v \times 18
\]

### Step 2: Determine the speed of the turtles

The turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, the speed of one turtle \( v_t \) is:

\[
v_t = \frac{v}{2}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the time it takes for the turtles to cross the same distance

Now we need to find out how long it will take for the 4 turtles to cross the same distance \( d \). The time \( t \) taken by the turtles can be calculated using the formula:

\[
t = \frac{d}{\text{speed}}
\]

Substituting the distance \( d \) and the speed of the turtles \( v_t \):

\[
t = \frac{d}{4v_t}
\]

Substituting \( v_t = \frac{v}{2} \):

\[
t = \frac{d}{4 \times \frac{v}{2}} = \frac{d}{2v}
\]

### Step 4: Substitute the expression for distance \( d \)

We already established that \( d = 18v \). Now we substitute this into the equation for time \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{18v}{2v}
\]

### Step 5: Simplify the expression

Now we can simplify:

\[
t = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

It will take 4 turtles a total of **9 hours** to travel across the highway.
