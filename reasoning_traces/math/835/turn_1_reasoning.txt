Question ID: 835
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the same distance that three kangaroos can cross in 18 hours.

### Step 1: Determine the distance traveled by the kangaroos

Let \( d \) be the distance across the highway. Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel this distance, we can calculate the speed of the kangaroos.

Let \( v \) be the speed of one kangaroo. The total speed of 3 kangaroos is \( 3v \).

Using the formula for distance:
\[
d = \text{speed} \times \text{time}
\]
we have:
\[
d = 3v \times 18
\]
\[
d = 54v
\]

### Step 2: Determine the speed of the turtles

Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
\[
\frac{v}{2}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the time it takes for the turtles to cross the same distance

The total speed of 4 turtles is:
\[
4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
\]

Now we can use the distance formula again to find the time \( t \) it takes for the turtles to cross the distance \( d \):
\[
d = \text{speed} \times \text{time}
\]
Substituting in the values we have:
\[
54v = 2v \times t
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( t \)

To isolate \( t \), we can divide both sides by \( 2v \):
\[
t = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27
\]

### Final Answer

It will take the four turtles a total of **27 hours** to travel across the highway.
