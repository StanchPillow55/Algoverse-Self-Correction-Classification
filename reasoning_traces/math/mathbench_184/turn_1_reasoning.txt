==================================================

To address the problem "Sample math problem 184," we need to first understand what the problem entails. However, since "Sample math problem 184" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 184 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of a rectangle.
   - The length (L) is 3 times the width (W).
   - The perimeter (P) of the rectangle is given as 184 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   P = 2L + 2W
   \]

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   Substitute the given perimeter into the formula:
   \[
   2L + 2W = 184
   \]

4. **Express Length in Terms of Width:**
   Since the length is 3 times the width, we can express L as:
   \[
   L = 3W
   \]

5. **Substitute L in the Perimeter Equation:**
   Replace L with 3W in the perimeter equation:
   \[
   2(3W) + 2W = 184
   \]

6. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   6W + 2W = 184
   \]
   \[
   8W = 184
   \]

7. **Solve for W (Width):**
   Divide both sides by 8 to solve for W:
   \[
   W = \frac{184}{8} = 23
   \]

8. **Find L (Length) Using W:**
   Substitute W back into the expression for L:
   \[
   L = 3W = 3 \times 23 = 69
   \]

9. **Verify the Solution:**
   Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
   \[
   2L + 2W = 2(69) + 2(23) = 138 + 46 = 184
   \]
   The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 23 units
- Length (L) = 69 units
