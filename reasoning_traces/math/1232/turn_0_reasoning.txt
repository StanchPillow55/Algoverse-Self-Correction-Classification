==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pomelos Eve gave away after she was left with 1/4 of her original amount.

1. **Identify the original amount of pomelos**: 
   Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos.

2. **Calculate how many pomelos are left**:
   According to the problem, after giving some pomelos to her friend, Eve is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Pomelos left} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Pomelos left} = 5
   \]

3. **Determine how many pomelos Eve gave away**:
   To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original amount:
   \[
   \text{Pomelos given away} = \text{Original pomelos} - \text{Pomelos left}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Pomelos given away} = 20 - 5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Pomelos given away} = 15
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the number of pomelos Eve gave away is \( \boxed{15} \).
