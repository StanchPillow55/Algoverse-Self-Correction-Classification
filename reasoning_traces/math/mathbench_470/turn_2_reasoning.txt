Question ID: mathbench_470
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 470" refers to. Since no specific details about the problem are provided, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem and create a sample problem to solve.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 470" is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 470 positive integers.

**Solution:**

To find the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

In this case, \( n = 470 \). Plugging this value into the formula gives:

\[
S_{470} = \frac{470 \times (470 + 1)}{2}
\]

First, calculate \( 470 + 1 \):

\[
470 + 1 = 471
\]

Next, multiply 470 by 471:

\[
470 \times 471 = 221,370
\]

Now, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:

\[
S_{470} = \frac{221,370}{2} = 110,685
\]

Thus, the sum of the first 470 positive integers is \( 110,685 \).

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 470 positive integers is \( 110,685 \).
