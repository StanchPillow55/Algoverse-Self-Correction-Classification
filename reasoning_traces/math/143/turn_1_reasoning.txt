==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many goldfish are below the surface of the pond, given that Toby can only see 25% of them at the surface.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Toby can see 25% of the total number of goldfish because they are at the surface.
   - He counts 15 goldfish at the surface.

2. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( T \) be the total number of goldfish in the pond.
   - According to the problem, 25% of these goldfish are at the surface.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Since 25% of the total goldfish are at the surface, we can express this as:
     \[
     0.25 \times T = 15
     \]
   - This equation states that 25% of the total number of goldfish equals the 15 goldfish Toby counted.

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - To find the total number of goldfish, solve the equation for \( T \):
     \[
     T = \frac{15}{0.25}
     \]
   - Calculate the division:
     \[
     T = 15 \div 0.25 = 15 \times 4 = 60
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 60 goldfish in total in the pond.

5. **Calculate the Number of Goldfish Below the Surface:**
   - Since Toby can see 15 goldfish at the surface, the rest are below the surface.
   - Subtract the number of goldfish at the surface from the total number of goldfish:
     \[
     \text{Goldfish below the surface} = T - 15 = 60 - 15 = 45
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - There are 45 goldfish below the surface of the pond.

### Final Answer:
There are 45 goldfish below the surface.
