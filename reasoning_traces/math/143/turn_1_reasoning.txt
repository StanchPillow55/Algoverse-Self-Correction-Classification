==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of goldfish in the pond and then find out how many are below the surface.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Toby can only see 25% of the goldfish because they are at the surface.
   - He counts 15 goldfish at the surface.

2. **Determine the Total Number of Goldfish:**
   - If 15 goldfish represent 25% of the total number of goldfish, we can set up an equation to find the total number of goldfish, \( T \).
   - The equation based on the percentage is:
     \[
     0.25 \times T = 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - To find \( T \), divide both sides of the equation by 0.25:
     \[
     T = \frac{15}{0.25}
     \]
   - Calculate \( \frac{15}{0.25} \):
     \[
     T = 15 \div 0.25 = 15 \times 4 = 60
     \]
   - So, the total number of goldfish in the pond is 60.

4. **Find the Number of Goldfish Below the Surface:**
   - Since 25% of the goldfish are at the surface, 75% must be below the surface.
   - Calculate 75% of the total number of goldfish:
     \[
     \text{Goldfish below the surface} = 0.75 \times 60
     \]
   - Perform the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Goldfish below the surface} = 0.75 \times 60 = 45
     \]

### Final Answer:
There are 45 goldfish below the surface of the pond.
