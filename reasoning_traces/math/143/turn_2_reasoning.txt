Question ID: 143
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many goldfish are below the surface of the pond based on the information given.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Toby can see only 25% of the goldfish because they are at the surface.
   - He counts 15 goldfish at the surface.

2. **Determine the Total Number of Goldfish:**
   - If 25% of the goldfish are at the surface, then the 15 goldfish Toby sees represent 25% of the total goldfish population.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of goldfish in the pond.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Since 25% of the total goldfish are at the surface, we can write the equation:
     \[
     0.25x = 15
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 0.25:
     \[
     x = \frac{15}{0.25}
     \]
   - Calculate the division:
     \[
     x = 15 \div 0.25 = 60
     \]

5. **Determine the Number of Goldfish Below the Surface:**
   - If the total number of goldfish is 60 and 15 are at the surface, then the number of goldfish below the surface is:
     \[
     60 - 15 = 45
     \]

### Conclusion:
The number of goldfish below the surface is 45.

**Final Answer: 45 goldfish are below the surface.**
