Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of goldfish in the pond based on the information that only 25% of them are visible at the surface. Toby counted 15 goldfish at the surface, which represents 25% of the total goldfish population. We will use this information to find the total number of goldfish and then calculate how many are below the surface.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the percentage of goldfish at the surface:**
   - We are given that 25% of the goldfish are at the surface.

2. **Determine the total number of goldfish:**
   - Let \( T \) be the total number of goldfish in the pond.
   - Since 25% of the goldfish are at the surface, we can express this as:
     \[
     0.25 \times T = 15
     \]
   - To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
     \[
     T = \frac{15}{0.25}
     \]

3. **Calculate \( T \):**
   - Dividing 15 by 0.25:
     \[
     T = \frac{15}{0.25} = 15 \div 0.25
     \]
   - To divide by 0.25, we can multiply by 4 (since \( \frac{1}{0.25} = 4 \)):
     \[
     T = 15 \times 4 = 60
     \]

4. **Determine the number of goldfish below the surface:**
   - If the total number of goldfish is 60, and 15 are at the surface, the number below the surface is:
     \[
     60 - 15 = 45
     \]

### Conclusion:

The number of goldfish below the surface is 45.

**Final Answer: 45 goldfish are below the surface.**
