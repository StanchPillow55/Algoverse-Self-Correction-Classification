To solve the problem, we need to determine how many goldfish are below the surface given that Toby counts 15 goldfish and that only 25% of the goldfish are visible at the surface.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Toby counts a total of 15 goldfish.
   - Only 25% of the total goldfish are at the surface.
   - This means that the remaining 75% of the goldfish are below the surface.

2. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of goldfish in the pond.
   - According to the problem, 25% of \( x \) is equal to the number of goldfish Toby counts, which is 15.
   - We can express this mathematically as:
     \[
     0.25x = 15
     \]

3. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we need to isolate it. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.25:
     \[
     x = \frac{15}{0.25}
     \]
   - Calculating the right side:
     \[
     x = 15 \div 0.25 = 15 \times 4 = 60
     \]
   - So, the total number of goldfish in the pond is \( x = 60 \).

4. **Finding the Number of Goldfish Below the Surface**:
   - Since 25% of the goldfish are at the surface, the remaining 75% are below the surface.
   - We can calculate the number of goldfish below the surface as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of goldfish below the surface} = 0.75x
     \]
   - Substituting \( x = 60 \):
     \[
     \text{Number of goldfish below the surface} = 0.75 \times 60 = 45
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of goldfish that are below the surface is \( \boxed{45} \).
