==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of goldfish in the pond based on the information given, and then calculate how many of those goldfish are below the surface.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Toby can only see 25% of the goldfish because they are at the surface.
   - He counts 15 goldfish at the surface.

2. **Determine the Total Number of Goldfish:**
   - If 15 goldfish represent 25% of the total number of goldfish, we can set up an equation to find the total number of goldfish.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of goldfish in the pond.
   - Since 25% of the goldfish are at the surface, we have:
     \[
     0.25x = 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 0.25:
     \[
     x = \frac{15}{0.25}
     \]
   - Calculate the division:
     \[
     x = 15 \div 0.25 = 60
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of goldfish in the pond is 60.

4. **Calculate the Number of Goldfish Below the Surface:**
   - If the total number of goldfish is 60 and 15 are at the surface, the number of goldfish below the surface is:
     \[
     60 - 15 = 45
     \]

### Final Answer:
There are 45 goldfish below the surface.
