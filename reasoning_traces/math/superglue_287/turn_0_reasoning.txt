==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 287" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 60 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Since the length is twice the width, the length \( l \) can be expressed as \( l = 2w \).

2. **Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 60 units, so:
     \[
     2l + 2w = 60
     \]

3. **Substitute the Expression for Length:**
   - Substitute \( l = 2w \) into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(2w) + 2w = 60
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the left side of the equation:
     \[
     4w + 2w = 60
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     6w = 60
     \]

5. **Solve for Width:**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{60}{6} = 10
     \]

6. **Find the Length:**
   - Since \( l = 2w \), substitute \( w = 10 \) into the expression for \( l \):
     \[
     l = 2 \times 10 = 20
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(20) + 2(10) = 40 + 20 = 60
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 10 units and a length of 20 units.
