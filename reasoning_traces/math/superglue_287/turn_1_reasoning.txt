==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 287" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such plots can he create, and what will be the dimensions of each plot if they are all identical?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**

   The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
   \]
   For the farmer's field:
   \[
   A = 100 \, \text{m} \times 60 \, \text{m} = 6000 \, \text{m}^2
   \]

2. **Determine the Number of Plots:**

   Each plot has an area of 150 square meters. To find the number of plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
   \[
   \text{Number of plots} = \frac{6000 \, \text{m}^2}{150 \, \text{m}^2} = 40
   \]

3. **Determine the Dimensions of Each Plot:**

   We need to find the dimensions of each plot such that the area is 150 square meters. Let's assume the dimensions are \( x \) meters by \( y \) meters. Then:
   \[
   x \times y = 150
   \]
   Since the plots are identical and the field is divided evenly, let's assume the plots are arranged in a way that fits perfectly into the field dimensions. 

   One possible arrangement is to have the plots aligned along the length and width of the field. If we choose \( x \) to be a factor of the field's width (60 meters), we can try different values for \( x \) that are factors of 150.

   Let's try \( x = 10 \) meters:
   \[
   y = \frac{150}{10} = 15 \, \text{meters}
   \]

   Check if this arrangement fits within the field:
   - Along the 100-meter length, we can fit \( \frac{100}{10} = 10 \) plots.
   - Along the 60-meter width, we can fit \( \frac{60}{15} = 4 \) plots.

   Total plots = \( 10 \times 4 = 40 \), which matches our earlier calculation.

**Final Answer:**

The farmer can create 40 plots, each with dimensions 10 meters by 15 meters.
