==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 287" might entail. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. Let's create a sample problem and solve it.

**Sample Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A for $10 per unit and Type B for $15 per unit. If the company produces 100 units of Type A and 150 units of Type B, what is the total profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total production cost:**
   - For Type A: 
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type A} = 100 \text{ units} \times \$5/\text{unit} = \$500
     \]
   - For Type B:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type B} = 150 \text{ units} \times \$8/\text{unit} = \$1200
     \]
   - Total production cost:
     \[
     \text{Total Production Cost} = \$500 + \$1200 = \$1700
     \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - For Type A:
     \[
     \text{Revenue for Type A} = 100 \text{ units} \times \$10/\text{unit} = \$1000
     \]
   - For Type B:
     \[
     \text{Revenue for Type B} = 150 \text{ units} \times \$15/\text{unit} = \$2250
     \]
   - Total revenue:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = \$1000 + \$2250 = \$3250
     \]

3. **Calculate the total profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total production cost:
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Production Cost} = \$3250 - \$1700 = \$1550
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The total profit from producing and selling 100 units of Type A and 150 units of Type B is \$1550.
