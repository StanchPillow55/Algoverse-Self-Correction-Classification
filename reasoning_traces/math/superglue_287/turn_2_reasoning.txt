Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 287" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not specific, I will assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a generic math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. The constant term here is \( 3 \).

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to isolate \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is \( 2 \).
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   11 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
