To determine how much Tommy spends on flour to make 12 loaves of bread, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of flour needed**:
   - Tommy needs 4 pounds of flour per loaf.
   - For 12 loaves, the total flour needed is:
     \[
     \text{Total flour needed} = 12 \text{ loaves} \times 4 \text{ pounds/loaf} = 48 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of flour bags**:
   - A 10-pound bag of flour costs $10.
   - A 12-pound bag of flour costs $13.

3. **Calculate how many bags are needed**:
   - We need to find the combination of bags that will give at least 48 pounds of flour at the lowest cost.
   - Let's calculate how many bags of each type would be needed to reach or exceed 48 pounds.

   **Using 10-pound bags**:
   - To find out how many 10-pound bags are needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of 10-pound bags} = \frac{48 \text{ pounds}}{10 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4.8
     \]
   - Since Tommy cannot buy a fraction of a bag, he needs to round up to 5 bags.
   - Total flour from 5 bags:
     \[
     5 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ pounds/bag} = 50 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Cost for 5 bags:
     \[
     5 \text{ bags} \times \$10/\text{bag} = \$50
     \]

   **Using 12-pound bags**:
   - To find out how many 12-pound bags are needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of 12-pound bags} = \frac{48 \text{ pounds}}{12 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4
     \]
   - Total flour from 4 bags:
     \[
     4 \text{ bags} \times 12 \text{ pounds/bag} = 48 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Cost for 4 bags:
     \[
     4 \text{ bags} \times \$13/\text{bag} = \$52
     \]

4. **Compare costs**:
   - Cost using 10-pound bags: \$50
   - Cost using 12-pound bags: \$52

5. **Determine the cheapest option**:
   - The cheapest option is to buy 5 bags of 10-pound flour for a total cost of \$50.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]
