To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of books sold**: 
   - Elise has a total of 250 books.
   - She currently has 50 unsold books.
   - Therefore, the total number of books sold is:
     \[
     \text{Total books sold} = \text{Total books} - \text{Unsold books} = 250 - 50 = 200
     \]

2. **Identify the number of books sold this year**:
   - According to the problem, Elise sold 45 books this year.

3. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year**:
   - The problem states that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she sold this year.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:
     \[
     \text{Books sold in the first year} = 2 \times \text{Books sold this year} = 2 \times 45 = 90
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of books sold in the second year**:
   - We know the total number of books sold over the three years is 200.
   - We can set up the equation for the total books sold:
     \[
     \text{Books sold in the first year} + \text{Books sold in the second year} + \text{Books sold this year} = 200
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     90 + \text{Books sold in the second year} + 45 = 200
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     135 + \text{Books sold in the second year} = 200
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is:
     \[
     \text{Books sold in the second year} = 200 - 135 = 65
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year**:
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - The total earnings from the books sold in the second year is:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings in the second year} = \text{Books sold in the second year} \times \text{Price per book} = 65 \times 20
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     65 \times 20 = 1300
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \(\boxed{1300}\).
