To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of flour Tommy needs and then calculate the cost of purchasing the flour using the cheapest option available.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Amount of Flour Needed
Tommy is making 12 loaves of bread, and each loaf requires 4 pounds of flour. Therefore, the total amount of flour needed is:

\[
12 \text{ loaves} \times 4 \text{ pounds per loaf} = 48 \text{ pounds of flour}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Best Way to Purchase 48 Pounds of Flour
Tommy has two options for purchasing flour:
- A 10-pound bag costs $10.
- A 12-pound bag costs $13.

We need to find the cheapest combination of these bags to get at least 48 pounds of flour.

#### Option 1: Using Only 12-Pound Bags
First, let's see how many 12-pound bags are needed to meet or exceed 48 pounds:

\[
\frac{48 \text{ pounds}}{12 \text{ pounds per bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}
\]

The cost for 4 bags of 12 pounds each is:

\[
4 \text{ bags} \times 13 \text{ dollars per bag} = 52 \text{ dollars}
\]

#### Option 2: Using Only 10-Pound Bags
Next, let's see how many 10-pound bags are needed to meet or exceed 48 pounds:

\[
\frac{48 \text{ pounds}}{10 \text{ pounds per bag}} = 4.8 \text{ bags}
\]

Since Tommy cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, he would need to buy 5 bags. The cost for 5 bags of 10 pounds each is:

\[
5 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ dollars per bag} = 50 \text{ dollars}
\]

#### Option 3: Combination of 10-Pound and 12-Pound Bags
Let's consider a combination of both types of bags. We aim to minimize the cost while reaching at least 48 pounds.

- If Tommy buys three 12-pound bags, he gets:

\[
3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ pounds}
\]

He would then need an additional:

\[
48 - 36 = 12 \text{ pounds}
\]

He can buy one more 12-pound bag to cover this, making it a total of 4 bags of 12 pounds, which costs $52, as calculated earlier.

- Alternatively, if Tommy buys four 10-pound bags, he gets:

\[
4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ pounds}
\]

He would then need an additional:

\[
48 - 40 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

He can buy one 12-pound bag to cover this, making it a total of 4 bags of 10 pounds and 1 bag of 12 pounds, which costs:

\[
4 \times 10 + 1 \times 13 = 40 + 13 = 53 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Conclusion
The cheapest option is to buy five 10-pound bags, which costs $50. This option provides exactly 50 pounds of flour, which is more than enough to meet the 48-pound requirement.

Therefore, the minimum amount Tommy spends on flour is \(\boxed{50}\) dollars.
