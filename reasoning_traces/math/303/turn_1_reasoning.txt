Question ID: 303
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much Tommy spends on flour, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of flour needed**:
   - Tommy is making 12 loaves of bread.
   - Each loaf requires 4 pounds of flour.
   - Total flour needed = Number of loaves Ã— Flour per loaf
   \[
   \text{Total flour needed} = 12 \text{ loaves} \times 4 \text{ pounds/loaf} = 48 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine the flour bag options**:
   - A 10-pound bag costs $10.
   - A 12-pound bag costs $13.

3. **Calculate how many bags are needed**:
   - For the 10-pound bags:
     \[
     \text{Number of 10-pound bags needed} = \frac{48 \text{ pounds}}{10 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4.8 \text{ bags}
     \]
     Since Tommy can't buy a fraction of a bag, he needs to buy 5 bags.
     - Total weight from 5 bags = \(5 \times 10 = 50\) pounds.
     - Total cost for 5 bags = \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.

   - For the 12-pound bags:
     \[
     \text{Number of 12-pound bags needed} = \frac{48 \text{ pounds}}{12 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}
     \]
     - Total weight from 4 bags = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.
     - Total cost for 4 bags = \(4 \times 13 = 52\) dollars.

4. **Compare the costs**:
   - Cost using 10-pound bags: $50
   - Cost using 12-pound bags: $52

5. **Choose the cheapest option**:
   - The cheapest option is to buy 5 bags of the 10-pound flour, costing $50.

Thus, the total amount Tommy spends on flour is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]
