To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time Jim spends watching TV and reading over a period of 4 weeks. We will break this down step by step.

1. **Determine the time spent watching TV and reading in one session:**
   - Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
   - He then reads for half as long as he watched TV. Since he watched TV for 2 hours, the reading time is:
     \[
     \text{Reading time} = \frac{2 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time spent in one session (watching TV + reading):**
   - Total time for one session:
     \[
     \text{Total time per session} = \text{TV time} + \text{Reading time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Determine how many sessions Jim has in one week:**
   - Jim does this activity 3 times a week.

4. **Calculate the total time spent in one week:**
   - Total time spent in one week:
     \[
     \text{Total time per week} = \text{Total time per session} \times \text{Number of sessions per week} = 3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total time spent in 4 weeks:**
   - Total time spent in 4 weeks:
     \[
     \text{Total time in 4 weeks} = \text{Total time per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, the total time Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{36} \text{ hours}
\]
