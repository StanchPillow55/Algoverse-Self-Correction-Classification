Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much Lee earned from mowing the lawns without considering the tips. He charges $33 per lawn and he mowed 16 lawns, so he earned 33 * 16 = $<<33*16=528>>528.

Next, let's calculate how much he earned from tips. Three customers each gave him a $10 tip, so he earned 3 * 10 = $<<3*10=30>>30 from tips.

Finally, let's add the amount he earned from mowing the lawns to the amount he earned from tips to find the total amount he earned. He earned $528 from mowing the lawns and $30 from tips, so he earned 528 + 30 = $<<528+30=558>>558 in total.

Therefore, Lee earned $558 mowing lawns last week.
