To find out how much Lee earned mowing lawns last week, we need to calculate his earnings from mowing the lawns and the tips he received.

1. **Calculate the earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Lee charges $33 for each lawn he mows.
   - Last week, he mowed 16 lawns.
   - To find the total earnings from mowing, we multiply the number of lawns by the charge per lawn:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from mowing} = \text{Number of lawns} \times \text{Charge per lawn}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Earnings from mowing} = 16 \times 33
     \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   16 \times 33 = 528
   \]
   So, Lee earned $528 from mowing lawns.

2. **Calculate the earnings from tips:**
   - Lee received tips from three customers, and each customer gave him a $10 tip.
   - To find the total tips, we multiply the number of customers by the tip amount:
     \[
     \text{Total tips} = \text{Number of customers} \times \text{Tip per customer}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total tips} = 3 \times 10
     \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   3 \times 10 = 30
   \]
   So, Lee earned $30 in tips.

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - To find Lee's total earnings for the week, we add his earnings from mowing lawns and his tips:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from mowing} + \text{Total tips}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = 528 + 30
     \]

   Now, we perform the addition:
   \[
   528 + 30 = 558
   \]

Thus, Lee earned a total of **$558** mowing lawns last week.

Final answer: **$558**
