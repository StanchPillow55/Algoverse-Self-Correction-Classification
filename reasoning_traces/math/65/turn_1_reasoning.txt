Question ID: 65
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much Lee earns from mowing the lawns without considering the tips. He charges $33 for mowing one lawn, and last week he mowed 16 lawns. So, the total amount he earned from mowing the lawns is 33 * 16 = $528.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of tips he received. He received a $10 tip from three customers, so the total amount of tips is 10 * 3 = $30.

Finally, we add the amount he earned from mowing the lawns and the amount of tips to find the total amount he earned last week. So, 528 + 30 = $558.

Therefore, Lee earned $558 mowing lawns last week.
