Question ID: 65
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Lee earned from mowing lawns and from the tips he received.

First, let's calculate how much Lee earned from mowing the lawns. He charges $33 for each lawn, and he mowed 16 lawns last week. Therefore, the total amount he earned from mowing lawns is:

33 (dollars per lawn) * 16 (lawns) = $528

Next, let's calculate how much Lee earned from tips. He received a $10 tip from three customers. Therefore, the total amount he earned from tips is:

10 (dollars per tip) * 3 (tips) = $30

Finally, to find out how much Lee earned in total last week, we add the amount he earned from mowing the lawns to the amount he earned from tips:

528 (dollars from mowing) + 30 (dollars from tips) = $558

So, Lee earned $558 mowing lawns last week.
