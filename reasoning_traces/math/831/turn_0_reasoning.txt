==================================================

To determine the total cost for Angela's installation, we need to break down the costs based on the items she has and the services provided by the interior design firm.

1. **Base Installation Cost**: The firm charges a flat rate of $129.00 for the installation of the first set of items, which includes:
   - 4 mirrors
   - 2 shelves
   - 1 chandelier
   - 10 pictures

2. **Items Angela Needs Installed**:
   - Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.

3. **Calculating Additional Items**:
   - **Mirrors**: Angela has 6 mirrors. The base installation includes 4 mirrors, so she needs to install:
     \[
     6 \text{ mirrors} - 4 \text{ mirrors} = 2 \text{ additional mirrors}
     \]
   - **Chandeliers**: Angela has 2 chandeliers. The base installation includes 1 chandelier, so she needs to install:
     \[
     2 \text{ chandeliers} - 1 \text{ chandelier} = 1 \text{ additional chandelier}
     \]
   - **Pictures**: Angela has 20 pictures. The base installation includes 10 pictures, so she needs to install:
     \[
     20 \text{ pictures} - 10 \text{ pictures} = 10 \text{ additional pictures}
     \]

4. **Total Additional Items**:
   - Total additional items Angela needs installed:
     \[
     2 \text{ (mirrors)} + 1 \text{ (chandelier)} + 10 \text{ (pictures)} = 13 \text{ additional items}
     \]

5. **Cost of Additional Items**:
   - The cost for each additional item is $15.00. Therefore, the total cost for the additional items is:
     \[
     13 \text{ additional items} \times 15 \text{ dollars/item} = 195 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Total Cost Calculation**:
   - Now, we add the base installation cost to the cost of the additional items:
     \[
     129 \text{ dollars (base cost)} + 195 \text{ dollars (additional items)} = 324 \text{ dollars}
     \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   - The total cost for Angela's installation will be:
     \[
     \boxed{324}
     \] 

Thus, Angela will pay a total of $324.00 for the installation of her mirrors, chandeliers, and pictures.
