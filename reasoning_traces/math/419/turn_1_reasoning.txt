Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Kenny practiced on the trumpet last week, given the information about his basketball and running activities.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Basketball Hours:**
   - Kenny played basketball for 10 hours last week.

2. **Running Hours:**
   - The problem states that Kenny ran for twice as long as he played basketball.
   - Therefore, the number of hours he ran is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) hours.

3. **Trumpet Practice Hours:**
   - Kenny practiced on the trumpet for twice as long as he ran.
   - Therefore, the number of hours he practiced on the trumpet is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) hours.

By following these steps, we have calculated the number of hours Kenny practiced on the trumpet.

**Final Answer:**
Kenny practiced on the trumpet for 40 hours last week.
