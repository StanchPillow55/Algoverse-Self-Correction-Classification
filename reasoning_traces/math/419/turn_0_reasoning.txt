To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the time Kenny played basketball:**
   - Kenny played basketball for 10 hours last week.

2. **Calculate the time he ran:**
   - According to the problem, he ran for twice as long as he played basketball. 
   - Therefore, the time he ran can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Time ran} = 2 \times \text{Time played basketball} = 2 \times 10 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time he practiced on the trumpet:**
   - The problem states that he practiced on the trumpet for twice as long as he ran.
   - Thus, the time he practiced on the trumpet can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Time practiced on trumpet} = 2 \times \text{Time ran} = 2 \times 20 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total time Kenny practiced on the trumpet last week is:
     \[
     \boxed{40} \text{ hours}
     \]
