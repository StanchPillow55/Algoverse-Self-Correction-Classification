To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Kenny practiced on the trumpet last week, given the information about his activities.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Kenny played basketball for 10 hours last week.
   - He ran for twice as long as he played basketball.
   - He practiced on the trumpet for twice as long as he ran.

2. **Calculate the time Kenny spent running:**
   - Since Kenny ran for twice as long as he played basketball, we multiply the hours he played basketball by 2.
   - Hours spent running = 2 × (hours spent playing basketball)
   - Hours spent running = 2 × 10 hours = 20 hours

3. **Calculate the time Kenny spent practicing on the trumpet:**
   - Kenny practiced on the trumpet for twice as long as he ran.
   - Hours spent practicing on the trumpet = 2 × (hours spent running)
   - Hours spent practicing on the trumpet = 2 × 20 hours = 40 hours

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Kenny practiced on the trumpet for 40 hours last week.

Therefore, the final answer is that Kenny practiced on the trumpet for **40 hours** last week.
