Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 80," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 80" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. It could refer to a problem labeled as number 80 in a textbook or a specific type of math problem involving the number 80.

Since the problem is not explicitly defined, I'll assume a common type of math problem involving the number 80. Let's consider a problem where we need to find the factors of 80, as this is a typical math exercise.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding Factors:**
   - Factors of a number are integers that can be multiplied together to produce the original number. For example, if \( a \times b = 80 \), then \( a \) and \( b \) are factors of 80.

2. **Finding Factors of 80:**
   - Start by testing small integers to see if they divide 80 without leaving a remainder.
   - **1:** \( 80 \div 1 = 80 \). So, 1 and 80 are factors.
   - **2:** \( 80 \div 2 = 40 \). So, 2 and 40 are factors.
   - **3:** \( 80 \div 3 \approx 26.67 \). Not a factor since it does not divide evenly.
   - **4:** \( 80 \div 4 = 20 \). So, 4 and 20 are factors.
   - **5:** \( 80 \div 5 = 16 \). So, 5 and 16 are factors.
   - **6:** \( 80 \div 6 \approx 13.33 \). Not a factor since it does not divide evenly.
   - **7:** \( 80 \div 7 \approx 11.43 \). Not a factor since it does not divide evenly.
   - **8:** \( 80 \div 8 = 10 \). So, 8 and 10 are factors.
   - **9:** \( 80 \div 9 \approx 8.89 \). Not a factor since it does not divide evenly.

3. **Listing All Factors:**
   - From the calculations above, the factors of 80 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40, and 80.

4. **Verification:**
   - To ensure all factors are correct, multiply each pair to check if they result in 80:
     - \( 1 \times 80 = 80 \)
     - \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \)
     - \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \)
     - \( 5 \times 16 = 80 \)
     - \( 8 \times 10 = 80 \)

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The complete set of factors of 80 is: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40, 80.

### Final Answer:
The factors of 80 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40, and 80.
