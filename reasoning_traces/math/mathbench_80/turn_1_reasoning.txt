Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 80" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem that could be associated with the number 80. Let's consider a problem involving basic arithmetic operations with the number 80.

**Problem:**  
Calculate the result of the following expression:  
\[ 80 + 15 \times 2 - 40 \div 5 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Order of Operations:**  
   According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we need to perform calculations in the following order:
   - Parentheses/Brackets
   - Exponents/Orders (i.e., powers and roots, etc.)
   - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
   - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

2. **Identify Operations in the Expression:**  
   The expression is:  
   \[ 80 + 15 \times 2 - 40 \div 5 \]

3. **Perform Multiplication and Division First:**  
   - Calculate \( 15 \times 2 \):  
     \[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \]
   - Calculate \( 40 \div 5 \):  
     \[ 40 \div 5 = 8 \]

   Now substitute these values back into the expression:  
   \[ 80 + 30 - 8 \]

4. **Perform Addition and Subtraction from Left to Right:**  
   - First, perform the addition:  
     \[ 80 + 30 = 110 \]
   - Then, perform the subtraction:  
     \[ 110 - 8 = 102 \]

**Final Answer:**  
The result of the expression \( 80 + 15 \times 2 - 40 \div 5 \) is \( 102 \).
