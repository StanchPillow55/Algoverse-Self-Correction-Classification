==================================================

It seems like the problem statement "Sample math problem 80" is not clear or complete. To provide a detailed solution, I need a specific math problem or question to work through. However, I can create a sample math problem involving the number 80 and solve it step by step. Let's consider the following problem:

**Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of 80 and determine the number of divisors it has.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 80**

To find the prime factorization of 80, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by 2 until it is no longer divisible by 2.

1. \( 80 \div 2 = 40 \)
2. \( 40 \div 2 = 20 \)
3. \( 20 \div 2 = 10 \)
4. \( 10 \div 2 = 5 \)

Now, 5 is a prime number and cannot be divided by 2. The next smallest prime number is 5 itself.

5. \( 5 \div 5 = 1 \)

So, the prime factorization of 80 is:
\[ 80 = 2^4 \times 5^1 \]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number given its prime factorization, we use the formula:

If the prime factorization of a number \( n \) is \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of divisors \( D(n) \) is given by:
\[ D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1) \]

For 80, the prime factorization is \( 2^4 \times 5^1 \).

- The exponent of 2 is 4, so we add 1 to get 5.
- The exponent of 5 is 1, so we add 1 to get 2.

Thus, the number of divisors is:
\[ D(80) = (4 + 1)(1 + 1) = 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 80 is \( 2^4 \times 5^1 \), and the number of divisors of 80 is 10.
