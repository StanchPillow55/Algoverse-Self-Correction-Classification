==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample math problem 80" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a common type of math problem. Let's consider a typical algebra problem involving solving for \( x \) in an equation. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details.

For now, let's solve the following algebraic equation as an example:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step 1: Isolate the variable term**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate the term containing \( x \) on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 3x = 15 \]

**Step 2: Solve for the variable**

Now that we have isolated the term with \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3:

\[ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = 5 \]

**Step 3: Verify the solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to check if it satisfies the equation:

Original equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)

Substitute \( x = 5 \):

\[ 3(5) + 5 = 20 \]

\[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]

\[ 20 = 20 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
