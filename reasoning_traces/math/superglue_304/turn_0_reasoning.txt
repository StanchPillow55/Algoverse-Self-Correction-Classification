==================================================

It seems like there might be some confusion with the question "Sample reasoning question 304," as it doesn't provide specific details or numbers to work with. To effectively solve a math problem, I need more context or specific information about what the problem entails. 

However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by breaking down the process into clear steps. Let's assume we have a generic math problem to solve:

### Problem-Solving Steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might apply.
   - Consider formulas or theorems that could be useful.
   - Plan the steps needed to solve the problem.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you’ve planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Recalculate if necessary to confirm accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem:

Let's create a sample problem to illustrate these steps:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
- Given: Perimeter = 36 units, Length = 2 × Width.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \).
- Substitute the given relationships into the formula.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Let the width be \( w \).
- Then the length is \( 2w \).
- Substitute into the perimeter formula: 
  \[
  36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
  \]
  \[
  36 = 2 \times 3w
  \]
  \[
  36 = 6w
  \]
  \[
  w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, the width is 6 units, and the length is \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) units.

**Step 4: Review/Check Your Work**
- Check the perimeter with these dimensions:
  \[
  P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
  \]
- The calculations confirm the perimeter is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The dimensions of the rectangle are: Width = 6 units, Length = 12 units.
