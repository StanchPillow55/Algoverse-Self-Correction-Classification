==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 304" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear and does not provide specific details or numbers to work with, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 304" is a problem about finding the sum of an arithmetic series. The problem could be stated as follows:

"Find the sum of the first 20 terms of an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 5 and the common difference is 3."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the first term and the common difference:**
   - First term (\(a_1\)) = 5
   - Common difference (\(d\)) = 3

2. **Write the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:**
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
   \]
   For this sequence, the \(n\)-th term is:
   \[
   a_n = 5 + (n-1) \cdot 3
   \]

3. **Calculate the 20th term (\(a_{20}\)):**
   \[
   a_{20} = 5 + (20-1) \cdot 3 = 5 + 19 \cdot 3 = 5 + 57 = 62
   \]

4. **Use the formula for the sum of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence:**
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   For the first 20 terms:
   \[
   S_{20} = \frac{20}{2} \cdot (5 + 62) = 10 \cdot 67 = 670
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   The sum of the first 20 terms of the arithmetic sequence is 670.

This solution assumes a specific type of problem based on the placeholder "Sample reasoning question 304." If there are specific details or a different type of problem you intended, please provide more information, and I can adjust the solution accordingly.
