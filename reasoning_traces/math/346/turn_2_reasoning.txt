==================================================

To determine how many cans of paint Lucille needs, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls she is painting.

1. **Calculate the area of each wall:**
   - For the two walls that are 3 meters wide and 2 meters tall:
     \[
     \text{Area of one wall} = \text{width} \times \text{height} = 3 \, \text{m} \times 2 \, \text{m} = 6 \, \text{m}^2
     \]
     Since there are two of these walls:
     \[
     \text{Total area for two walls} = 2 \times 6 \, \text{m}^2 = 12 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

   - For the third wall that is 5 meters wide and 2 meters tall:
     \[
     \text{Area of the third wall} = 5 \, \text{m} \times 2 \, \text{m} = 10 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

   - For the final wall that is 4 meters wide and 2 meters tall:
     \[
     \text{Area of the final wall} = 4 \, \text{m} \times 2 \, \text{m} = 8 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

2. **Calculate the total area of all walls:**
   \[
   \text{Total area} = \text{Area of two walls} + \text{Area of third wall} + \text{Area of final wall}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total area} = 12 \, \text{m}^2 + 10 \, \text{m}^2 + 8 \, \text{m}^2 = 30 \, \text{m}^2
   \]

3. **Determine how many cans of paint are needed:**
   Each can of paint covers 2 square meters. To find out how many cans are needed, we divide the total area by the coverage of one can:
   \[
   \text{Number of cans needed} = \frac{\text{Total area}}{\text{Coverage per can}} = \frac{30 \, \text{m}^2}{2 \, \text{m}^2/\text{can}} = 15 \, \text{cans}
   \]

Thus, Lucille needs a total of **15 cans of paint** to cover all the walls in her room. 

Final answer: **15 cans of paint**.
