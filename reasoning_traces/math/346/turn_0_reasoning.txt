To determine how many cans of paint Lucille needs, we need to calculate the total area of the walls she plans to paint and then determine how many cans are required to cover that area.

**Step 1: Calculate the area of each wall.**

- **Wall 1 and Wall 2:** Both of these walls are 3 meters wide and 2 meters tall. The area of one wall is calculated as follows:
  \[
  \text{Area of one wall} = \text{width} \times \text{height} = 3 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{meters} = 6 \, \text{square meters}
  \]
  Since there are two walls of this size, the total area for these two walls is:
  \[
  \text{Total area for Wall 1 and Wall 2} = 2 \times 6 \, \text{square meters} = 12 \, \text{square meters}
  \]

- **Wall 3:** This wall is 5 meters wide and 2 meters tall. The area is calculated as follows:
  \[
  \text{Area of Wall 3} = 5 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{meters} = 10 \, \text{square meters}
  \]

- **Wall 4:** This wall is 4 meters wide and 2 meters tall. The area is calculated as follows:
  \[
  \text{Area of Wall 4} = 4 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{meters} = 8 \, \text{square meters}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total area to be painted.**

Add the areas of all the walls together:
\[
\text{Total area} = 12 \, \text{square meters} + 10 \, \text{square meters} + 8 \, \text{square meters} = 30 \, \text{square meters}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the number of cans of paint needed.**

Each can of paint covers 2 square meters. To find out how many cans are needed, divide the total area by the coverage of one can:
\[
\text{Number of cans needed} = \frac{\text{Total area}}{\text{Coverage per can}} = \frac{30 \, \text{square meters}}{2 \, \text{square meters per can}} = 15 \, \text{cans}
\]

Lucille needs 15 cans of paint to cover all the walls in her room.

**Final Answer: Lucille needs 15 cans of paint.**
