To determine how many cans of paint Lucille needs, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls she is painting. 

**Step 1: Calculate the area of each wall.**

1. **For the two walls that are 3 meters wide and 2 meters tall:**
   \[
   \text{Area of one wall} = \text{width} \times \text{height} = 3 \, \text{m} \times 2 \, \text{m} = 6 \, \text{m}^2
   \]
   Since there are two of these walls:
   \[
   \text{Total area of two walls} = 2 \times 6 \, \text{m}^2 = 12 \, \text{m}^2
   \]

2. **For the third wall that is 5 meters wide and 2 meters tall:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the third wall} = 5 \, \text{m} \times 2 \, \text{m} = 10 \, \text{m}^2
   \]

3. **For the final wall that is 4 meters wide and 2 meters tall:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the final wall} = 4 \, \text{m} \times 2 \, \text{m} = 8 \, \text{m}^2
   \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total area of all the walls.**
Now, we add the areas of all the walls together:
\[
\text{Total area} = \text{Area of two 3m walls} + \text{Area of 5m wall} + \text{Area of 4m wall}
\]
\[
\text{Total area} = 12 \, \text{m}^2 + 10 \, \text{m}^2 + 8 \, \text{m}^2 = 30 \, \text{m}^2
\]

**Step 3: Determine how many cans of paint are needed.**
Each can of paint covers 2 square meters. To find out how many cans Lucille needs, we divide the total area by the coverage of one can:
\[
\text{Number of cans needed} = \frac{\text{Total area}}{\text{Coverage per can}} = \frac{30 \, \text{m}^2}{2 \, \text{m}^2/\text{can}} = 15 \, \text{cans}
\]

**Final Answer:**
Lucille needs **15 cans of paint** to paint her room.
