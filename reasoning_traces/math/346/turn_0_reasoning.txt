To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of cookies in a bag:**
   Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies each week, and each bag contains 36 cookies.

   \[
   \text{Total cookies in a bag} = 36
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box:**
   Jenny puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box for 5 days a week. We can calculate the total number of cookies she puts in the lunch box as follows:

   \[
   \text{Cookies in lunch box} = 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of cookies her husband eats:**
   Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days. We can calculate the total number of cookies he eats as follows:

   \[
   \text{Cookies eaten by husband} = 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband:**
   Now, we will add the cookies consumed by her son and her husband:

   \[
   \text{Total cookies consumed by son and husband} = 20 \text{ cookies} + 7 \text{ cookies} = 27 \text{ cookies}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of cookies left for Jenny:**
   To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the total cookies consumed by her son and husband from the total cookies in the bag:

   \[
   \text{Cookies eaten by Jenny} = \text{Total cookies in bag} - \text{Total cookies consumed by son and husband}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Cookies eaten by Jenny} = 36 \text{ cookies} - 27 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{9}
\]

Jenny eats 9 cookies.
