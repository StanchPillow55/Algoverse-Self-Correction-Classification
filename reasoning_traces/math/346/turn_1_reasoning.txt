==================================================

To determine how many cookies Jenny eats, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Cookies in a Bag**: 
   Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies each week, and each bag contains 36 cookies.

   \[
   \text{Total cookies} = 36
   \]

2. **Cookies for Son's Lunch**: 
   Jenny puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box for 5 days a week. We need to calculate the total number of cookies she uses for her son's lunch.

   \[
   \text{Cookies for son} = 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. **Cookies for Husband**: 
   Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days. We will calculate the total number of cookies he consumes.

   \[
   \text{Cookies for husband} = 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies}
   \]

4. **Total Cookies Consumed by Son and Husband**: 
   Now we will add the cookies consumed by her son and her husband.

   \[
   \text{Total cookies consumed} = \text{Cookies for son} + \text{Cookies for husband} = 20 + 7 = 27 \text{ cookies}
   \]

5. **Cookies Left for Jenny**: 
   To find out how many cookies are left for Jenny, we subtract the total cookies consumed by her son and husband from the total cookies in the bag.

   \[
   \text{Cookies for Jenny} = \text{Total cookies} - \text{Total cookies consumed} = 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ cookies}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Jenny eats **9 cookies**.
