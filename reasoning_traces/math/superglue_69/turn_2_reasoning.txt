==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 69." Since the question is not provided, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving math problems, which you can apply to your specific question once you have it.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Recalculate if necessary to ensure accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's apply this approach to a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
- We know the perimeter is 36 units.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
- Let width = \( w \).
- Then length = \( 2w \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Substitute the expressions for length and width into the perimeter formula:
  \[
  36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
  \]
- Simplify and solve for \( w \):
  \[
  36 = 2 \times 3w
  \]
  \[
  36 = 6w
  \]
  \[
  w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
  \]
- Find the length:
  \[
  \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12
  \]

**Step 4: Review/Check Your Work**
- Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
  \[
  P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
  \]
- The calculations are correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.

Once you have the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 69," you can apply this structured approach to solve it. If you provide the exact question, I can offer a more tailored solution.
