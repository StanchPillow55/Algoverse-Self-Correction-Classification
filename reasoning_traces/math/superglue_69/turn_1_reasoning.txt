Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 69" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem, which typically involves logical deduction, pattern recognition, or mathematical calculations.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Without specific details, let's assume this is a typical reasoning problem that might involve numerical patterns, logical sequences, or word problems. The first step is to carefully read and understand the problem statement, identifying key information and what is being asked.

### Step 2: Identify the Type of Problem
Reasoning questions can be of various types:
- **Numerical Patterns**: Identify a sequence or pattern in numbers.
- **Logical Deduction**: Use given statements to deduce new information.
- **Word Problems**: Translate a real-world scenario into mathematical expressions.

### Step 3: Develop a Strategy
Depending on the type of problem, develop a strategy:
- For numerical patterns, look for common differences, ratios, or other relationships.
- For logical deduction, use known facts to infer unknowns.
- For word problems, define variables and set up equations.

### Step 4: Execute the Plan
Carry out the necessary calculations or logical steps. This might involve:
- Calculating differences or ratios for sequences.
- Applying logical rules or syllogisms.
- Solving equations for word problems.

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
Check the solution against the problem statement to ensure it satisfies all conditions. If necessary, revise the approach and calculations.

### Step 6: State the Final Answer
Clearly state the final answer, ensuring it directly addresses the question.

Since the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 69" are not provided, this general framework can be applied to approach and solve reasoning problems effectively. If you have a specific problem or details, please provide them, and I can offer a more tailored solution.
