==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 69" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

*Question 69: A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by building a fence parallel to the shorter side. How long will the fence be?*

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The field needs to be divided into two equal parts by a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - Imagine the rectangle with the longer side (100 meters) as the base.
   - The shorter side (60 meters) is the height.
   - The fence will run parallel to the 60-meter side, effectively dividing the field into two equal rectangles.

3. **Determine the Length of the Fence:**
   - Since the fence is parallel to the shorter side, it will span the entire length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the fence will be equal to the length of the field.

4. **Calculate the Length of the Fence:**
   - The length of the field is 100 meters.
   - Thus, the fence will also be 100 meters long.

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Dividing the field into two equal parts means each part will have an area of half the total area.
   - Total area of the field = Length × Width = 100 meters × 60 meters = 6000 square meters.
   - Area of each part = 6000 square meters / 2 = 3000 square meters.
   - Each part will have dimensions of 100 meters (length) and 30 meters (width), confirming the division is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The length of the fence required to divide the field into two equal parts is 100 meters.
