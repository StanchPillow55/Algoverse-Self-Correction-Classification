Question ID: 13
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out the cost of each item.

The cheddar cheese costs $10 for 2 pounds. 

The cream cheese costs half the price of the cheddar cheese. Since the cheddar cheese costs $10, the cream cheese costs $10 / 2 = $5.

The cold cuts cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese. Since the cheddar cheese costs $10, the cold cuts cost $10 * 2 = $20.

To find out how much Jasper spends on the ingredients, we add up the cost of the cheddar cheese, the cream cheese, and the cold cuts. 

So, the total cost is $10 (cheddar cheese) + $5 (cream cheese) + $20 (cold cuts) = $35.

Therefore, Jasper spends $35 on the ingredients for his charcuterie.
