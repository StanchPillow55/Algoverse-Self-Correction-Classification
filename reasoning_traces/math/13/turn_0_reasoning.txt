Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. **Sales at the Green House**: 
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she sold:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3}
   \]
   After this sale, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{3x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. **Sales at the Red House**: 
   Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. **Sales at the Orange House**: 
   At the orange house, she sold half of what was left after the red house. The amount left after the red house is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \). Therefore, the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

   To simplify this, we first calculate \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]

   Now, substituting this back into the equation for the number of vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right)
   \]
   Simplifying this expression:
   \[
   = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{2x - x}{3} - 2 + 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]

4. **Final Count of Vacuum Cleaners**: 
   We know that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]

   To solve for \( x \), we first add 1 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6
   \]

   Then, we multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Thus, the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with is \( \boxed{18} \).
