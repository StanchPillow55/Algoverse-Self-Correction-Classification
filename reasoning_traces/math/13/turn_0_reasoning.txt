==================================================

To determine how much Jasper spends on the ingredients for his charcuterie, we will break down the costs of each item he purchases step by step.

1. **Cost of Cheddar Cheese**:
   - Jasper buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10.
   - Therefore, the cost of cheddar cheese is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of cheddar cheese} = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of Cream Cheese**:
   - The problem states that the cost of cream cheese is half the price of the cheddar cheese.
   - Since the cheddar cheese costs $10, the cost of cream cheese is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of cream cheese} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of Cold Cuts**:
   - The cost of cold cuts is twice the price of the cheddar cheese.
   - Therefore, the cost of cold cuts is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of cold cuts} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total Cost**:
   - Now, we will sum the costs of all the ingredients to find the total amount Jasper spends:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of cheddar cheese} + \text{Cost of cream cheese} + \text{Cost of cold cuts}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 10 + 5 + 20
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 35 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Jasper spends on the ingredients for his charcuterie is \(\boxed{35}\) dollars.
