Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out the price of the cream cheese and the cold cuts.

The cream cheese costs half the price of the cheddar cheese. Since the cheddar cheese costs $10 for 2 pounds, it means that 1 pound of cheddar cheese costs $10 / 2 = $5.

So, the cream cheese costs $5 / 2 = $2.5.

The cold cuts cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese. Since 1 pound of cheddar cheese costs $5, the cold cuts cost $5 * 2 = $10.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the ingredients to find out how much Jasper spends in total.

He spends $10 on the cheddar cheese, $2.5 on the cream cheese, and $10 on the cold cuts, for a total of $10 + $2.5 + $10 = $22.5.

So, Jasper spends $22.5 on the ingredients for his charcuterie.
