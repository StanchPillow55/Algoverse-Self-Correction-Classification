==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 175" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such plots can he create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters.
   - The total area of the field is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Area of the field} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 100 \, \text{m} \times 60 \, \text{m} = 6000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]
   - Each smaller plot should have an area of 150 square meters.

2. **Determine the Number of Plots:**
   - To find out how many 150 square meter plots can fit into the 6000 square meter field, we divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
     \[
     \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{6000 \, \text{m}^2}{150 \, \text{m}^2}
     \]
   - Perform the division:
     \[
     \frac{6000}{150} = 40
     \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 40 smaller plots, each with an area of 150 square meters, from the original field.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 150 square meters, from the field.

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to break down a problem, perform calculations, and arrive at a logical conclusion. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide additional details or context.
