Question ID: superglue_175
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's break it down step by step and ensure we understand the context and requirements.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
The problem statement is "Sample reasoning question 175." However, this does not provide any specific mathematical problem or context. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific question that might be found in a textbook or a database. Without additional information, we cannot proceed with solving a specific math problem.

### Step 2: Clarify the Problem
Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's consider what "Sample reasoning question 175" might imply. It could be a reference to a reasoning or logic problem, possibly involving numbers or patterns. However, without further details, we cannot assume the nature of the problem.

### Step 3: Hypothetical Problem Solving
In the absence of specific details, let's create a hypothetical problem that could be labeled as "Sample reasoning question 175." For example, let's assume it involves a sequence or pattern recognition task.

#### Hypothetical Problem:
Suppose "Sample reasoning question 175" involves finding the next number in the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...

#### Solution:
1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - The sequence given is 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
   - Each number in the sequence is obtained by multiplying the previous number by 2.

2. **Verify the Pattern:**
   - \(2 \times 2 = 4\)
   - \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
   - \(8 \times 2 = 16\)

3. **Find the Next Number:**
   - Following the pattern, the next number is \(16 \times 2 = 32\).

### Step 4: Conclusion
Based on the hypothetical problem we created, the next number in the sequence is 32.

### Final Answer
Since the original problem was not specified, we created a hypothetical sequence problem. The next number in the sequence 2, 4, 8, 16 is 32.

If "Sample reasoning question 175" refers to a specific problem, please provide additional details or context for a precise solution.
