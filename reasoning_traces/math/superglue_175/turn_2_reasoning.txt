==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 175" might entail. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step. Let's assume the problem involves basic algebra.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 

\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 10 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation with one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Simplify the Equation:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to get all terms containing \( x \) on one side and constant terms on the other side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 2x + 10
   \]

3. **Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:**
   This will help us move all terms with \( x \) to one side.

   \[
   3x - 2x + 5 = 2x - 2x + 10
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x + 5 = 10
   \]

4. **Subtract 5 from both sides:**
   This will isolate \( x \) on one side.

   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 10 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 2(5) + 10
   \]

   Calculate both sides:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 10 + 10
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 10 \) is \( x = 5 \).
