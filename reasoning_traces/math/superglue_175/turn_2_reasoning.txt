==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 175" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking down the steps and showing the reasoning process.

Let's assume a hypothetical math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

The equation given is a linear equation in one variable. Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

- The equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
- Subtract 3 from both sides to get rid of the constant term on the left:
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]

**Step 3: Solve for the Variable**

Now that we have \( 2x = 8 \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.

- Divide both sides by 2:
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to check if it satisfies the equation.

- Substitute \( x = 4 \) into the original equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \):
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 11
  \]
  Simplifying the left side gives:
  \[
  8 + 3 = 11
  \]
  Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This process demonstrates a systematic approach to solving a linear equation, ensuring that each step is clear and logical. If you have a specific problem or question number 175, please provide the details, and I can apply a similar step-by-step approach to solve it.
