Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating how many math problems Chris has completed each day and how many he has left.

1. **Total Problems**: Chris starts with a total of 100 math problems.

2. **Problems Completed on Monday**: 
   - Chris completes 12 problems on Monday.
   - Remaining problems after Monday:
     \[
     100 - 12 = 88
     \]

3. **Problems Completed on Tuesday**: 
   - On Tuesday, Chris completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. Since he completed 12 problems on Monday:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36
   \]
   - Remaining problems after Tuesday:
   \[
   88 - 36 = 52
   \]

4. **Problems Completed on Wednesday**: 
   - On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. He has 52 problems left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13
   \]
   - Remaining problems after Wednesday:
   \[
   52 - 13 = 39
   \]

5. **Final Calculation**: 
   - After completing problems on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, Chris has 39 problems left to complete on Thursday.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{39}
\]
