==================================================

To find the total distance Micheal rode his bike, we will break the problem into two parts: the distance he rode during the first four weeks and the distance he rode during the next three weeks.

### Part 1: First Four Weeks
Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week for 4 weeks, making 25 kilometers each time.

1. **Calculate the number of rides in the first four weeks:**
   \[
   \text{Number of rides} = 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 20 \text{ rides}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total distance for the first four weeks:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Number of rides} \times \text{Distance per ride}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 20 \text{ rides} \times 25 \text{ kilometers/ride} = 500 \text{ kilometers}
   \]

### Part 2: Next Three Weeks
Micheal then rode his bike 2 times a week for 3 weeks, making 60 kilometers each time.

1. **Calculate the number of rides in the next three weeks:**
   \[
   \text{Number of rides} = 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 6 \text{ rides}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total distance for the next three weeks:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Number of rides} \times \text{Distance per ride}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 6 \text{ rides} \times 60 \text{ kilometers/ride} = 360 \text{ kilometers}
   \]

### Final Calculation: Total Distance
Now, we will add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Micheal rode his bike.

\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance from first four weeks} + \text{Distance from next three weeks}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance} = 500 \text{ kilometers} + 360 \text{ kilometers} = 860 \text{ kilometers}
\]

### Conclusion
Micheal rode a total of **860 kilometers**.
