==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the initial number of lions in Londolozi given the birth and death rates of lions over a period of one year.

### Step 1: Understand the rates of change
- **Birth rate**: 5 lion cubs are born per month.
- **Death rate**: 1 lion dies per month.

### Step 2: Calculate the net change in the lion population per month
The net change in the lion population per month can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Net change per month} = \text{Births} - \text{Deaths} = 5 - 1 = 4 \text{ lions per month}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total change over one year
Since there are 12 months in a year, the total change in the lion population over one year is:

\[
\text{Total change in one year} = \text{Net change per month} \times \text{Number of months} = 4 \text{ lions/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 48 \text{ lions}
\]

### Step 4: Set up the equation for the initial population
Let \( x \) be the initial number of lions in Londolozi. After one year, the total number of lions is given as 148. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + \text{Total change} = 148
\]

Substituting the total change we calculated:

\[
x + 48 = 148
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
To find \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[
x = 148 - 48
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
x = 100
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the initial number of lions in Londolozi was \( \boxed{100} \).
