==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial number of lions in Londolozi, given the birth and death rates and the total number of lions after one year.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( L_0 \) be the initial number of lions in Londolozi.
   - The birth rate is 5 lion cubs per month.
   - The death rate is 1 lion per month.
   - After 1 year (12 months), the total number of lions is 148.

2. **Calculate the Net Change in Lions per Month:**
   - Each month, the number of lions increases by the birth rate and decreases by the death rate.
   - Net change per month = Birth rate - Death rate = 5 - 1 = 4 lions per month.

3. **Calculate the Total Change in Lions Over One Year:**
   - Over 12 months, the total change in the number of lions is:
   \[
   \text{Total change} = 4 \text{ lions/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 48 \text{ lions}
   \]

4. **Set Up the Equation for the Final Number of Lions:**
   - The final number of lions after 1 year is the initial number plus the total change over the year:
   \[
   L_0 + 48 = 148
   \]

5. **Solve for the Initial Number of Lions \( L_0 \):**
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \( L_0 \):
   \[
   L_0 = 148 - 48 = 100
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The initial number of lions in Londolozi was 100.

Therefore, the final answer is that there were initially 100 lions in Londolozi.
