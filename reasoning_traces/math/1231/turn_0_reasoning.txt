Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find Sally's mean score from her math quizzes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **List the Scores**: First, we will list all of Sally's quiz scores:
   - 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, 60

2. **Count the Number of Scores**: Next, we will count how many scores there are. In this case, there are 9 scores.

3. **Calculate the Sum of the Scores**: We will add all the scores together to find the total score.
   \[
   50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60
   \]

   Let's calculate this step by step:
   - \(50 + 80 = 130\)
   - \(130 + 80 = 210\)
   - \(210 + 60 = 270\)
   - \(270 + 40 = 310\)
   - \(310 + 90 = 400\)
   - \(400 + 100 = 500\)
   - \(500 + 70 = 570\)
   - \(570 + 60 = 630\)

   So, the total sum of the scores is \(630\).

4. **Calculate the Mean**: The mean (average) score is calculated by dividing the total sum of the scores by the number of scores.
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Total Sum of Scores}}{\text{Number of Scores}} = \frac{630}{9}
   \]

   Now, we perform the division:
   \[
   630 \div 9 = 70
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: Therefore, Sally's mean score is \(70\).

In conclusion, after calculating the total sum of her quiz scores and dividing by the number of quizzes, we find that Sally's mean score is \( \boxed{70} \).
