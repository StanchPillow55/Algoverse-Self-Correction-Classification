==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 310." However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math reasoning problem step by step. Let's assume a sample problem and work through it.

**Sample Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles, at a speed of 60 miles per hour. It then travels from City B to City C, a distance of 180 miles, at a speed of 45 miles per hour. What is the total time taken for the journey from City A to City C?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The train travels two segments: 
     - Segment 1: City A to City B (300 miles at 60 mph)
     - Segment 2: City B to City C (180 miles at 45 mph)
   - We need to find the total time taken for the entire journey.

2. **Calculate Time for Each Segment:**
   - **Segment 1:**
     - Distance = 300 miles
     - Speed = 60 miles per hour
     - Time = Distance / Speed = 300 miles / 60 mph = 5 hours

   - **Segment 2:**
     - Distance = 180 miles
     - Speed = 45 miles per hour
     - Time = Distance / Speed = 180 miles / 45 mph = 4 hours

3. **Calculate Total Time:**
   - Total time = Time for Segment 1 + Time for Segment 2
   - Total time = 5 hours + 4 hours = 9 hours

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check calculations for each segment to ensure accuracy.
   - Ensure that the units are consistent (miles and hours).

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The total time taken for the journey from City A to City C is 9 hours.

This approach demonstrates how to break down a problem into manageable steps, perform calculations, and verify the solution. If you have a specific problem or question number, please provide more details, and I can work through that specific problem for you.
