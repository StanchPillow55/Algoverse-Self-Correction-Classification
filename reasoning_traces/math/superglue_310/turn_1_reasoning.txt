==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 310" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A for $10 per unit and Type B for $15 per unit. Last month, the company produced 200 units of Type A and 150 units of Type B. Calculate the total profit the company made last month.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Total Revenue:**

   - Revenue from Type A:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from Type A} = \text{Number of Type A units} \times \text{Selling price per Type A unit}
     \]
     \[
     = 200 \times 10 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - Revenue from Type B:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from Type B} = \text{Number of Type B units} \times \text{Selling price per Type B unit}
     \]
     \[
     = 150 \times 15 = 2250 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - Total Revenue:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Revenue from Type A} + \text{Revenue from Type B}
     \]
     \[
     = 2000 + 2250 = 4250 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Total Cost:**

   - Cost for Type A:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type A} = \text{Number of Type A units} \times \text{Production cost per Type A unit}
     \]
     \[
     = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - Cost for Type B:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type B} = \text{Number of Type B units} \times \text{Production cost per Type B unit}
     \]
     \[
     = 150 \times 8 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - Total Cost:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost for Type A} + \text{Cost for Type B}
     \]
     \[
     = 1000 + 1200 = 2200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Profit:**

   - Profit is calculated as the difference between total revenue and total cost.
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
     \]
     \[
     = 4250 - 2200 = 2050 \text{ dollars}
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The total profit the company made last month is $2050.
