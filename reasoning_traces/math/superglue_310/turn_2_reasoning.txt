==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 310" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem, which involves understanding the problem, devising a plan, carrying out the plan, and then reviewing the solution.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Since the problem statement is not provided, let's assume a generic math problem. For example, let's solve a quadratic equation:
\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
To solve a quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
Let's assume specific values for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) to illustrate the process. Suppose \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = 2 \). The equation becomes:
\[ x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0 \]

Using the quadratic formula:
1. Calculate the discriminant: 
   \[ b^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 = 9 - 8 = 1 \]

2. Calculate the roots using the quadratic formula:
   \[ x = \frac{-(-3) \pm \sqrt{1}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
   \[ x = \frac{3 \pm 1}{2} \]

3. Solve for the two possible values of \( x \):
   - \( x_1 = \frac{3 + 1}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \)
   - \( x_2 = \frac{3 - 1}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

### Step 4: Review the Solution
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0 \) are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 1 \). We can verify by substituting these values back into the original equation:

- For \( x = 2 \):
  \[ (2)^2 - 3(2) + 2 = 4 - 6 + 2 = 0 \]

- For \( x = 1 \):
  \[ (1)^2 - 3(1) + 2 = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0 \]

Both solutions satisfy the equation, confirming they are correct.

### Final Answer
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0 \) are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 1 \).
