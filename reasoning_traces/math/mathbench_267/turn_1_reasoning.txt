Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 267" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I can't provide a solution. However, I can guide you on how to approach solving a math problem step by step.

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note down the given information and any constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that apply to the problem.
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.
   - Decide on a strategy to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, using a formula).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of your work to avoid mistakes.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Recalculate if necessary to ensure accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

If you have a specific math problem you'd like help with, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to assist you with a step-by-step solution.
