==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 291" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 291" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 291" is as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a rectangle with a specific relationship between its length and width.
   - The length \( L \) is 3 times the width \( W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]
   - We know \( L = 3W \) and \( P = 48 \).

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     48 = 2(3W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     48 = 6W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     48 = 8W
     \]

5. **Solve for \( W \):**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

6. **Find \( L \):**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute \( W = 6 \) into the equation for \( L \):
     \[
     L = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width \( W = 6 \) units
- Length \( L = 18 \) units
