==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 291" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Let's say "Sample math problem 291" is the following:

**Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 15 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Equation:**

   We have the equation:

   \[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 15 \]

2. **Isolate the Variable:**

   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all the terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side.

   Start by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides to get the \( x \)-terms on one side:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 15 - 2x
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x + 5 = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**

   Next, subtract 5 from both sides to isolate \( x \):

   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 10
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Substitute \( x = 10 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   3(10) + 5 = 2(10) + 15
   \]

   Calculate both sides:

   \[
   30 + 5 = 20 + 15
   \]

   \[
   35 = 35
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 10 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 15 \) is \( x = 10 \).
