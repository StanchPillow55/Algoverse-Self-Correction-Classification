==================================================

To determine how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings to dry with the new varnish compared to the old varnish, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total drying time with the old varnish:**
   - The drying time for one painting with the old varnish is 7 minutes.
   - For 6 paintings, the total drying time would be:
     \[
     \text{Total time with old varnish} = 6 \text{ paintings} \times 7 \text{ minutes/painting} = 42 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total drying time with the new varnish:**
   - The drying time for one painting with the new varnish is 12 minutes.
   - For 6 paintings, the total drying time would be:
     \[
     \text{Total time with new varnish} = 6 \text{ paintings} \times 12 \text{ minutes/painting} = 72 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Determine the difference in drying times:**
   - To find out how much longer it takes with the new varnish compared to the old varnish, we subtract the total drying time with the old varnish from the total drying time with the new varnish:
     \[
     \text{Difference in time} = \text{Total time with new varnish} - \text{Total time with old varnish}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference in time} = 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, it will take **30 minutes longer** for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings to dry with the new varnish compared to the old varnish.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30 \text{ minutes}}
\]
