==================================================

To determine the cost per individual razor after discounts, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of one pack of razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors and costs $4.00.

2. **Calculate the cost for 2 packs:**
   - If one pack costs $4.00, then 2 packs will cost:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4.00 \text{ dollars/pack} = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Apply the buy one get one free offer:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, when Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack. Therefore, she only needs to pay for the first pack:
     \[
     \text{Cost after BOGO} = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Apply the $2.00 coupon:**
   - Now, we subtract the $2.00 coupon from the cost:
     \[
     4.00 \text{ dollars} - 2.00 \text{ dollars} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of razors:**
   - Since Heather bought 2 packs and each pack contains 4 razors, the total number of razors is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors/pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]

6. **Determine the cost per individual razor:**
   - Now, we find the cost per razor by dividing the total cost after discounts by the total number of razors:
     \[
     \text{Cost per razor} = \frac{2.00 \text{ dollars}}{8 \text{ razors}} = 0.25 \text{ dollars/razor}
     \]

7. **Convert the cost per razor to cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we convert the cost:
     \[
     0.25 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 25 \text{ cents}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that each individual razor costs **25 cents** after the discount.
