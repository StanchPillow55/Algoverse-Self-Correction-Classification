==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total expenses for the party based on the information given.

1. **Calculate the Total Contributions:**
   Each attendee paid $100 to attend the party. There were 50 attendees.

   \[
   \text{Total Contributions} = \text{Number of Attendees} \times \text{Contribution per Attendee}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total Contributions} = 50 \times 100 = 5000
   \]

   So, the total contributions from all attendees were $5000.

2. **Determine the Total Expenses:**
   We are told that the total expenses were $500 less than the total contributions. Therefore, we can express the total expenses as:

   \[
   \text{Total Expenses} = \text{Total Contributions} - 500
   \]

   Substituting the total contributions we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Total Expenses} = 5000 - 500 = 4500
   \]

   Thus, the total expenses for the party were $4500.

3. **Conclusion:**
   The amount of money used to pay for the party expenses was $4500.

Therefore, the final answer is that the total expenses for the party were **$4500**.
