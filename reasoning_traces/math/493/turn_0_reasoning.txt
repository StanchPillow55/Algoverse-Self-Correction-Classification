==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total contributions from all attendees.**
2. **Determine the total expenses based on the information given.**
3. **Find out how much money was used to pay for the party expenses.**

### Step 1: Calculate Total Contributions

Each attendee paid $100, and there were 50 people at the party. Therefore, the total contributions can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total Contributions} = \text{Number of Attendees} \times \text{Contribution per Attendee}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Contributions} = 50 \times 100 = 5000
\]

### Step 2: Determine Total Expenses

According to the problem, the total expenses were $500 less than the total contributions. We can express this mathematically as:

\[
\text{Total Expenses} = \text{Total Contributions} - 500
\]

Substituting the total contributions we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Expenses} = 5000 - 500 = 4500
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion

The amount of money used to pay for the party expenses is equal to the total expenses we calculated.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Total Expenses} = 4500
\]

Therefore, **$4500 was used to pay for the party expenses.**
