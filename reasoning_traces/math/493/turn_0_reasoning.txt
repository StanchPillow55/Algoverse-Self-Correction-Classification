To determine the cost per individual razor after applying the discounts, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors without discounts.**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4.00 \text{ dollars/pack} = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Apply the buy one get one free offer.**
   - Since Heather is buying 2 packs, she will only pay for 1 pack due to the buy one get one free offer.
   - Thus, the cost after this discount is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pack} \times 4.00 \text{ dollars/pack} = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Apply the $2.00 coupon.**
   - Now, we subtract the coupon value from the discounted price:
     \[
     4.00 \text{ dollars} - 2.00 \text{ dollars} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of razors.**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors, and since Heather is effectively getting 2 packs (due to the buy one get one free offer), the total number of razors is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors/pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]

5. **Determine the cost per individual razor.**
   - Now, we divide the total cost after discounts by the total number of razors:
     \[
     \frac{2.00 \text{ dollars}}{8 \text{ razors}} = 0.25 \text{ dollars/razor}
     \]

6. **Convert the cost per razor to cents.**
   - Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we convert the cost:
     \[
     0.25 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 25 \text{ cents/razor}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that each individual razor costs **25 cents** after applying the discounts.
