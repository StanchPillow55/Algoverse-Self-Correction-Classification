To determine the cost per individual razor after discounts, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of One Pack of Razors**: 
   - Each pack contains 4 razors and costs $4.00.

2. **Cost of Two Packs**: 
   - If Heather buys 2 packs, the total cost before any discounts is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4.00 \text{ dollars/pack} = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Buy One Get One Free Sale**: 
   - Since the sale is buy one get one free, when Heather buys 2 packs, she effectively pays for only 1 pack. Therefore, the cost after the sale is:
     \[
     4.00 \text{ dollars} \text{ (cost of one pack)}
     \]

4. **Applying the $2.00 Coupon**: 
   - Now, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the cost of one pack:
     \[
     4.00 \text{ dollars} - 2.00 \text{ dollars} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total Number of Razors**: 
   - Since Heather bought 2 packs and each pack contains 4 razors, the total number of razors is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors/pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]

6. **Cost Per Individual Razor**: 
   - To find the cost per individual razor, we divide the total cost after discounts by the total number of razors:
     \[
     \frac{2.00 \text{ dollars}}{8 \text{ razors}} = 0.25 \text{ dollars/razor}
     \]

7. **Convert to Cents**: 
   - Since the final answer needs to be in cents, we convert dollars to cents:
     \[
     0.25 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 25 \text{ cents}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that each individual razor costs **25 cents** after the discount.
