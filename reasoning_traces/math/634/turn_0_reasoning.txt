==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of fish caught by Tommy, Darren, and Naomi based on the information given.

1. **Identify the number of fish caught by Naomi:**
   - We know from the problem that Naomi caught 17 fish.
   \[
   \text{Naomi's fish} = 17
   \]

2. **Determine how many fish Darren caught:**
   - The problem states that Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi. Therefore, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from the number of fish Naomi caught.
   \[
   \text{Darren's fish} = \text{Naomi's fish} - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11
   \]

3. **Determine how many fish Tommy caught:**
   - According to the problem, Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. We can find the number of fish Tommy caught by adding 3 to the number of fish Darren caught.
   \[
   \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14
   \]

Now that we have calculated the number of fish caught by each person, we can summarize our findings:

- Naomi caught 17 fish.
- Darren caught 11 fish.
- Tommy caught 14 fish.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Tommy caught } 14 \text{ fish.}
\]
