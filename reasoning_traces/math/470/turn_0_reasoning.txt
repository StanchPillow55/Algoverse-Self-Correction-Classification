To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Gary worked in total, given that he earns overtime pay for hours worked beyond 40 hours in a week. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Identify the normal and overtime pay rates:**
   - Gary's normal hourly wage is $12 per hour.
   - For overtime, he earns 1.5 times his normal wage. Therefore, his overtime wage is:
     \[
     1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]

2. **Set up the equation for total earnings:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of hours Gary worked in the week.
   - If \( x \leq 40 \), then all hours are at the normal rate, but since he earned overtime, \( x \) must be greater than 40.
   - For hours up to 40, he earns at the normal rate, and for hours beyond 40, he earns at the overtime rate.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of overtime hours worked. Then, \( y = x - 40 \).

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Earnings from the first 40 hours at the normal rate:
     \[
     40 \times 12 = 480 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Earnings from overtime hours:
     \[
     y \times 18 = (x - 40) \times 18
     \]
   - Total earnings equation:
     \[
     480 + (x - 40) \times 18 = 696
     \]

4. **Solve the equation for \( x \):**
   \[
   480 + 18(x - 40) = 696
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   480 + 18x - 720 = 696
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   18x - 240 = 696
   \]
   Add 240 to both sides:
   \[
   18x = 936
   \]
   Divide both sides by 18 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{936}{18} = 52
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Gary worked a total of 52 hours that week.

Therefore, the final answer is that Gary worked **52 hours** that week.
