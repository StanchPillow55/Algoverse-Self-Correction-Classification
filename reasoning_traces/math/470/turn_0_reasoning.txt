==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total cost of the items Theo bought and then calculate the change she received after paying with $10.

1. **Identify the cost of the pen**:
   - The pen costs $2.

2. **Determine the cost of the piece of paper**:
   - The problem states that the piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen.
   - First, we calculate three times the price of the pen:
     \[
     3 \times 2 = 6
     \]
   - Now, we subtract $1 from this amount to find the cost of the piece of paper:
     \[
     6 - 1 = 5
     \]
   - Therefore, the piece of paper costs $5.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the items**:
   - Now we add the cost of the pen and the cost of the piece of paper:
     \[
     2 + 5 = 7
     \]
   - The total cost of the pen and the piece of paper is $7.

4. **Determine the amount of change Theo received**:
   - Theo gave the cashier $10. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid:
     \[
     10 - 7 = 3
     \]
   - Therefore, the amount of change Theo received is $3.

5. **Final answer**:
   - The amount of change Theo received is \(\boxed{3}\).
