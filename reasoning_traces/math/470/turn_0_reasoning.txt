To determine how many hours Gary worked that week, we need to break down his earnings into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Identify the normal wage and overtime rate:**
   - Gary's normal wage is $12 per hour.
   - The overtime rate is 1.5 times the normal wage: 
     \[
     \text{Overtime Rate} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]

2. **Define the number of hours worked:**
   - Let \( h \) be the total number of hours Gary worked that week.
   - If \( h \) is greater than 40 hours, then he worked \( h - 40 \) hours of overtime.

3. **Calculate the earnings based on hours worked:**
   - If Gary worked 40 hours or less, his total earnings would be:
     \[
     \text{Earnings} = 12h
     \]
   - If he worked more than 40 hours, his earnings would be:
     \[
     \text{Earnings} = 12 \times 40 + 18 \times (h - 40)
     \]
   - Simplifying the overtime earnings:
     \[
     \text{Earnings} = 480 + 18(h - 40)
     \]
     \[
     = 480 + 18h - 720
     \]
     \[
     = 18h - 240
     \]

4. **Set up the equation based on his paycheck:**
   - We know Gary's total earnings for the week is $696. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     18h - 240 = 696
     \]

5. **Solve for \( h \):**
   - First, add 240 to both sides:
     \[
     18h = 696 + 240
     \]
     \[
     18h = 936
     \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 18:
     \[
     h = \frac{936}{18}
     \]
     \[
     h = 52
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Gary worked a total of 52 hours that week.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{52}
\]
