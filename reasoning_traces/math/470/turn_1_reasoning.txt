Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Gary worked in total, given his normal hourly wage, his overtime rate, and his total earnings for the week.

1. **Identify the normal and overtime pay rates:**
   - Normal hourly wage = $12 per hour
   - Overtime hourly wage = 1.5 times normal wage = 1.5 Ã— $12 = $18 per hour

2. **Set up the equation for total earnings:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of hours Gary worked.
   - If Gary worked more than 40 hours, the first 40 hours are paid at the normal rate, and the remaining hours are paid at the overtime rate.
   - Total earnings = Earnings from normal hours + Earnings from overtime hours

3. **Express the earnings in terms of hours worked:**
   - If Gary worked \( x \) hours in total, then:
     - Normal hours = 40
     - Overtime hours = \( x - 40 \) (only if \( x > 40 \))

4. **Write the equation for total earnings:**
   \[
   12 \times 40 + 18 \times (x - 40) = 696
   \]

5. **Simplify and solve the equation:**
   - Calculate earnings from normal hours:
     \[
     12 \times 40 = 480
     \]
   - Substitute into the equation:
     \[
     480 + 18 \times (x - 40) = 696
     \]
   - Subtract 480 from both sides:
     \[
     18 \times (x - 40) = 216
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 18:
     \[
     x - 40 = 12
     \]
   - Add 40 to both sides to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 52
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   Gary worked a total of 52 hours that week.

**Final Answer:** Gary worked 52 hours that week.
