==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or not specific enough for me to provide a detailed solution. However, I can guide you on how to approach a typical math problem by outlining a general problem-solving strategy. If you have a specific math problem, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help solve it.

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might apply (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.
   - Decide on a strategy to solve the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of your work to avoid mistakes.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Consider if there is another way to solve the problem or verify the solution.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Ensure it answers the question posed in the problem.

If you provide a specific math problem, I can apply this approach to solve it and show all the work and reasoning involved.
