==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I'll need more specific information about "Sample math problem 131" as the description provided is not sufficient to determine the exact nature of the problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by using a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample math problem 131" is a typical algebra problem. Here's how I would approach it:

### Hypothetical Problem:
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - The goal is to get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation. We start with the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 = 11
     \]

3. **Eliminate the Constant Term:**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to remove the constant term on the left side:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Simplifying the left side gives:
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can tailor the solution to that particular problem.
