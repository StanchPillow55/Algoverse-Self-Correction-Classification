==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific details about "Sample math problem 131." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by outlining a structured problem-solving process. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

### Generic Problem-Solving Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given information or constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning).
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify each step of the calculation.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Re-evaluate the problem if necessary.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's consider a simple example problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use algebraic manipulation to isolate \( x \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).
