To solve the problem, we need to determine how many white fish Bob bought at the store. Let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count**:
   - Bob initially has 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond.
   - Therefore, the total number of fish he starts with is:
     \[
     3 \text{ (orange)} + 4 \text{ (white)} = 7 \text{ fish}
     \]

2. **Fish Bought from the Store**:
   - Bob buys a total of 17 fish from the pet store. We need to denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( x \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( y \).
   - From the problem, we know:
     \[
     x + y = 17
     \]

3. **Final Fish Count**:
   - After adding the fish from the store to his pond, Bob's total number of orange fish becomes \( 3 + x \) and his total number of white fish becomes \( 4 + y \).

4. **Condition Given**:
   - The problem states that after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:
     \[
     3 + x = 2(4 + y)
     \]

5. **Expanding the Equation**:
   - We can expand the equation \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \):
     \[
     3 + x = 8 + 2y
     \]

6. **Rearranging the Equation**:
   - Rearranging gives us:
     \[
     x - 2y = 8 - 3
     \]
     \[
     x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]

7. **System of Equations**:
   - Now we have a system of two equations:
     1. \( x + y = 17 \) (Equation 2)
     2. \( x - 2y = 5 \) (Equation 1)

8. **Substituting Equation 2 into Equation 1**:
   - From Equation 2, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
     \[
     x = 17 - y
     \]
   - Substituting this into Equation 1:
     \[
     (17 - y) - 2y = 5
     \]
     \[
     17 - 3y = 5
     \]

9. **Solving for \( y \)**:
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     -3y = 5 - 17
     \]
     \[
     -3y = -12
     \]
     \[
     y = 4
     \]

10. **Finding \( x \)**:
    - Now substituting \( y = 4 \) back into Equation 2 to find \( x \):
      \[
      x + 4 = 17
      \]
      \[
      x = 17 - 4 = 13
      \]

11. **Conclusion**:
    - Bob bought \( y = 4 \) white fish from the store.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
