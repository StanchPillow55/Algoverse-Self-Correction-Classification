Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many white fish Bob bought at the store. Let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count**:
   - Bob initially has 7 fish in total: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Bought**:
   - Bob buys a total of 17 fish from the pet store. We need to denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( x \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( y \).

   From the information given, we can set up the following equation based on the total number of fish bought:
   \[
   x + y = 17
   \]

3. **Final Fish Count**:
   - After adding the fish from the store, Bob's total number of orange fish becomes \( 3 + x \) and his total number of white fish becomes \( 4 + y \).

4. **Condition Given**:
   - After adding the new fish, Bob finds that he has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us another equation:
   \[
   3 + x = 2(4 + y)
   \]

5. **Expanding the Second Equation**:
   Let's expand the second equation:
   \[
   3 + x = 8 + 2y
   \]
   Rearranging this gives:
   \[
   x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

6. **Solving the System of Equations**:
   Now we have a system of two equations:
   1. \( x + y = 17 \) (Equation 2)
   2. \( x - 2y = 5 \) (Equation 1)

   We can solve these equations simultaneously. From Equation 2, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
   \[
   x = 17 - y
   \]

   Now, substitute \( x \) into Equation 1:
   \[
   (17 - y) - 2y = 5
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   17 - 3y = 5
   \]
   \[
   -3y = 5 - 17
   \]
   \[
   -3y = -12
   \]
   \[
   y = 4
   \]

7. **Finding \( x \)**:
   Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \):
   \[
   x = 17 - y = 17 - 4 = 13
   \]

8. **Conclusion**:
   Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish from the store. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
