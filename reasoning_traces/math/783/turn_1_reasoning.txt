==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the information given step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count**:
   - Bob starts with 7 fish in total: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Bought from the Store**:
   - Bob buys 17 fish from the pet store. We need to determine how many of these are orange and how many are white.

3. **Final Fish Count**:
   - After adding the 17 fish to his original 7 fish, Bob finds that he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let:
- \( x \) = number of orange fish Bob bought from the store
- \( y \) = number of white fish Bob bought from the store

From the problem, we know:
- The total number of fish bought is 17:
  \[
  x + y = 17
  \]

- After adding the new fish to his original count, the total number of orange fish becomes \( 3 + x \) and the total number of white fish becomes \( 4 + y \).

According to the problem, the total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish:
\[
3 + x = 2(4 + y)
\]

4. **Setting Up the Equations**:
   We now have two equations:
   1. \( x + y = 17 \)
   2. \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \)

5. **Solving the Second Equation**:
   Let's simplify the second equation:
   \[
   3 + x = 8 + 2y
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

6. **Substituting from Equation 1 into Equation 2**:
   From Equation 1, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
   \[
   x = 17 - y
   \]

   Now substitute \( x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   (17 - y) - 2y = 5
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   17 - 3y = 5
   \]
   \[
   -3y = 5 - 17
   \]
   \[
   -3y = -12
   \]
   \[
   y = 4
   \]

7. **Finding \( x \)**:
   Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \):
   \[
   x = 17 - y = 17 - 4 = 13
   \]

8. **Conclusion**:
   Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish from the store.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Bob bought } 4 \text{ white fish.}
\]
