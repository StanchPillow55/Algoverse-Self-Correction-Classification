Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 105" refers to. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a generic math problem labeled as "105." Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem 105:**

"Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 105."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of all integers from 1 to 105. This is a classic arithmetic series problem.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the last integer in the series.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this problem, \( n = 105 \). Substitute 105 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{105(105 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Expression:**
   - First, calculate \( 105 + 1 \):
     \[
     105 + 1 = 106
     \]
   - Next, calculate the product \( 105 \times 106 \):
     \[
     105 \times 106 = 11130
     \]
   - Finally, divide by 2 to find the sum:
     \[
     S = \frac{11130}{2} = 5565
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of all integers from 1 to 105 is 5565.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all integers from 1 to 105 is 5565.
