==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 105," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not clear or complete. It seems like there might be a missing part of the problem or a specific question that needs to be addressed.

Since "Sample math problem 105" is not a standard problem statement, let's assume it might refer to a specific type of problem or a problem number in a textbook or worksheet. Without additional context or details, it's challenging to provide a specific solution.

However, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where "Sample math problem 105" could be a typical math problem involving basic arithmetic, algebra, or geometry. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
Let's assume "Sample math problem 105" is an algebra problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 15 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 10
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{10}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(5) + 5 = 15
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   10 + 5 = 15
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is \( x = 5 \).

If "Sample math problem 105" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details or context so that I can assist you more accurately.
