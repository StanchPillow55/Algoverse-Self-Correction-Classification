==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to understand what "Sample math problem 105" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll assume this is a generic math problem and create a sample problem based on the number 105. Let's solve a problem involving the number 105.

**Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of 105 and determine the number of positive divisors it has.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization**

To find the prime factorization of 105, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 105 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we try dividing by 3:
\[ 105 \div 3 = 35 \]
So, 3 is a factor, and we have:
\[ 105 = 3 \times 35 \]

Now, we need to factor 35. We try dividing by the next smallest prime number, which is 5:
\[ 35 \div 5 = 7 \]
So, 5 is a factor, and we have:
\[ 35 = 5 \times 7 \]

Now, 7 is a prime number, so we stop here. The prime factorization of 105 is:
\[ 105 = 3 \times 5 \times 7 \]

**Step 2: Number of Positive Divisors**

To find the number of positive divisors of a number, we use its prime factorization. If a number \( n \) has the prime factorization:
\[ n = p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \cdots \times p_k^{a_k} \]
then the number of positive divisors \( D(n) \) is given by:
\[ D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \cdots (a_k + 1) \]

For 105, the prime factorization is:
\[ 105 = 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 \]

Thus, the number of positive divisors is:
\[ D(105) = (1 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8 \]

**Conclusion:**

The prime factorization of 105 is \( 3 \times 5 \times 7 \), and it has 8 positive divisors.

**Final Answer:**
Prime factorization of 105: \( 3 \times 5 \times 7 \)
Number of positive divisors: 8
