==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 105" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 105. Let's consider a few possibilities and solve them step by step.

### Possibility 1: Prime Factorization of 105

One common math problem is to find the prime factorization of a number. Let's factor 105 into its prime components.

1. **Divide by the smallest prime number, 2**:  
   105 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.

2. **Next prime number, 3**:  
   Sum of the digits of 105 is \(1 + 0 + 5 = 6\), which is divisible by 3.  
   \[
   105 \div 3 = 35
   \]

3. **Factor 35**:  
   35 is not divisible by 3 (since \(3 + 5 = 8\) is not divisible by 3).  
   Next, try 5 (since 35 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5).  
   \[
   35 \div 5 = 7
   \]

4. **Factor 7**:  
   7 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 105 is:
\[
105 = 3 \times 5 \times 7
\]

### Possibility 2: Find the Divisors of 105

Another common problem is to find all divisors of a number.

1. Start with 1 and the number itself: 1, 105.
2. Check divisibility by each integer up to the square root of 105 (approximately 10.24).

- **2**: 105 is odd, not divisible.
- **3**: Already checked, 105 ÷ 3 = 35.
- **4**: 105 is not divisible by 4 (since 105 ÷ 4 is not an integer).
- **5**: Already checked, 105 ÷ 5 = 21.
- **6**: 105 is not divisible by 6 (since 105 ÷ 6 is not an integer).
- **7**: Already checked, 105 ÷ 7 = 15.
- **8**: 105 is not divisible by 8.
- **9**: 105 is not divisible by 9.
- **10**: 105 is not divisible by 10.

Thus, the divisors of 105 are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35, 105.

### Final Answer

Since the problem was not specified, I provided solutions to two common types of problems involving the number 105:

1. **Prime Factorization of 105**: \(3 \times 5 \times 7\)
2. **Divisors of 105**: 1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35, 105

If you have a specific problem in mind related to the number 105, please provide more details, and I can solve that specific problem for you.
