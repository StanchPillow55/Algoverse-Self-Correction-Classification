==================================================

To solve the sample math problem "36," we need to first understand the context or the specific question being asked. Since "36" alone is not a complete problem, let's assume a few possible scenarios involving the number 36 and solve them step by step.

### Scenario 1: Find the Square Root of 36

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are asked to find the square root of 36.

2. **Calculations:**
   - The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).
   - For 36, we need to find \( y \) such that \( y^2 = 36 \).

3. **Solution:**
   - \( 6^2 = 36 \), so \( y = 6 \).
   - Therefore, the square root of 36 is 6.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The square root of 36 is 6.

### Scenario 2: Determine if 36 is a Perfect Square

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if 36 is a perfect square.

2. **Definition:**
   - A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer.

3. **Calculations:**
   - We already know from Scenario 1 that \( 6^2 = 36 \).

4. **Solution:**
   - Since 36 can be expressed as \( 6^2 \), it is a perfect square.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Yes, 36 is a perfect square.

### Scenario 3: Factorize 36 into Prime Factors

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to express 36 as a product of its prime factors.

2. **Calculations:**
   - Start dividing 36 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
   - \( 36 \div 2 = 18 \)
   - \( 18 \div 2 = 9 \)
   - 9 is not divisible by 2, so move to the next prime number, which is 3.
   - \( 9 \div 3 = 3 \)
   - \( 3 \div 3 = 1 \)

3. **Solution:**
   - The prime factorization of 36 is \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The prime factors of 36 are \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \).

### Scenario 4: Calculate the Sum of the Divisors of 36

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the sum of all positive divisors of 36.

2. **List the Divisors:**
   - The divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36.

3. **Calculations:**
   - Sum these divisors: \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 + 36 = 91 \).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of the divisors of 36 is 91.

### Conclusion

Without a specific context, we explored multiple scenarios involving the number 36. Each scenario was solved step by step, and the final answers were provided for each case. If you have a specific question related to the number 36, please provide more details for a precise solution.
