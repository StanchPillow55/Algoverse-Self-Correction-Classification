==================================================

To solve the sample math problem "36," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is simply the number "36," it seems like there might be some context or additional information missing. However, let's explore some possibilities and mathematical operations involving the number 36 to provide a comprehensive answer.

### Possibility 1: Basic Properties of 36

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - The prime factorization of 36 is \( 36 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \).
   - This means 36 is composed of the prime numbers 2 and 3, raised to the powers of 2.

2. **Divisors**:
   - The divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36.
   - This is because these numbers divide 36 without leaving a remainder.

3. **Square Root**:
   - The square root of 36 is \( \sqrt{36} = 6 \).
   - This is because \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \).

4. **Perfect Square**:
   - 36 is a perfect square since it can be expressed as the square of an integer (6).

5. **Even Number**:
   - 36 is an even number because it is divisible by 2.

### Possibility 2: Arithmetic Operations Involving 36

1. **Addition/Subtraction**:
   - If we consider operations like \( 36 + x = y \) or \( 36 - x = y \), we can solve for \( y \) given any \( x \).

2. **Multiplication/Division**:
   - Multiplying or dividing 36 by another number will yield different results. For example:
     - \( 36 \times 2 = 72 \)
     - \( 36 \div 6 = 6 \)

### Possibility 3: Algebraic Context

If the problem involves solving an equation or expression where 36 is a part, we would need more information. For example:

- **Equation**: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( x + 36 = 50 \).
  - Subtract 36 from both sides: \( x = 50 - 36 \).
  - \( x = 14 \).

### Conclusion

Without additional context or specific instructions, the number 36 can be explored in various mathematical contexts. However, based on the information provided, the most we can do is analyze its properties and potential operations involving it.

If there is a specific operation or context you intended for the number 36, please provide more details. Otherwise, the exploration above covers the basic mathematical aspects of the number 36.
