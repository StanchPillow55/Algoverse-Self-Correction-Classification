Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 36," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not fully provided, I'll assume "Sample math problem 36" is a placeholder for an actual math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem to solve:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 36 positive integers.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify \( n \):**
   In this problem, \( n = 36 \).

2. **Apply the formula:**
   Plug \( n = 36 \) into the formula:

   \[
   S_{36} = \frac{36(36 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate inside the parentheses:**
   \[
   36 + 1 = 37
   \]

4. **Multiply 36 by 37:**
   \[
   36 \times 37 = 1332
   \]

5. **Divide by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{1332}{2} = 666
   \]

Thus, the sum of the first 36 positive integers is 666.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 36 positive integers is 666.
