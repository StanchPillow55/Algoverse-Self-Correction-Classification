==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 36" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I will assume it is a basic arithmetic or algebra problem involving the number 36. Let's consider a few possibilities and solve them:

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem
Let's assume the problem is to find the square of 36.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate \( 36^2 \).

2. **Calculation:**
   \[
   36 \times 36
   \]

3. **Step-by-Step Multiplication:**
   - Break it down into smaller parts using the distributive property:
   \[
   36 \times 36 = (30 + 6) \times (30 + 6)
   \]
   - Apply the distributive property (FOIL method):
   \[
   = 30 \times 30 + 30 \times 6 + 6 \times 30 + 6 \times 6
   \]
   - Calculate each term:
   \[
   = 900 + 180 + 180 + 36
   \]
   - Add them up:
   \[
   = 900 + 180 + 180 + 36 = 1296
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The square of 36 is 1296.

### Possibility 2: Algebraic Problem
Let's assume the problem is to solve for \( x \) in the equation \( x^2 = 36 \).

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) such that \( x^2 = 36 \).

2. **Calculation:**
   - Take the square root of both sides:
   \[
   x = \pm \sqrt{36}
   \]

3. **Simplification:**
   - Calculate the square root:
   \[
   x = \pm 6
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The solutions for \( x \) are \( x = 6 \) and \( x = -6 \).

### Final Answer
Since the problem "Sample math problem 36" is not explicitly defined, I've provided solutions for two possible interpretations:

1. If the problem is to find the square of 36, the answer is:
   \[
   1296
   \]

2. If the problem is to solve \( x^2 = 36 \), the solutions are:
   \[
   x = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -6
   \]

If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details, and I can offer a more targeted solution.
