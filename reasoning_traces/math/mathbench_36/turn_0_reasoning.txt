It seems like the problem statement is incomplete. However, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 36" refers to a problem involving the number 36. Let's consider a common type of problem involving the number 36, such as finding its factors, its prime factorization, or solving an equation involving 36. I'll choose to find the prime factorization of 36 and explain the process step by step.

### Problem: Find the prime factorization of 36.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of its prime factors. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Step 2: Start with the Smallest Prime Number**

Begin dividing 36 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

\[ 36 \div 2 = 18 \]

Since 36 is even, it is divisible by 2. We write:

\[ 36 = 2 \times 18 \]

**Step 3: Continue Factoring the Quotient**

Now, factor 18, the quotient from the previous division.

\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]

Again, 18 is even, so it is divisible by 2. We write:

\[ 18 = 2 \times 9 \]

Thus, we have:

\[ 36 = 2 \times 2 \times 9 \]

**Step 4: Factor the Remaining Quotient**

Now, factor 9, which is the remaining quotient.

Since 9 is not divisible by 2, we try the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

\[ 9 \div 3 = 3 \]

9 is divisible by 3, so we write:

\[ 9 = 3 \times 3 \]

Thus, we have:

\[ 36 = 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \]

**Step 5: Write the Prime Factorization**

Now that we have factored 36 completely into prime numbers, we can write the prime factorization:

\[ 36 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \]

**Step 6: Verify the Factorization**

To ensure the factorization is correct, multiply the prime factors back together:

\[ 2^2 \times 3^2 = (2 \times 2) \times (3 \times 3) = 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

The multiplication checks out, confirming that the prime factorization is correct.

### Final Answer

The prime factorization of 36 is \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \).
