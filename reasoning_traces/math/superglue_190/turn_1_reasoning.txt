Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 190." However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem by creating a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem involves a logical reasoning scenario with numbers.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A sequence of numbers is defined as follows: The first term is 2, and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous term and the number of letters in its English word representation. What is the 5th term in this sequence?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the first term:**
   - The first term is given as 2.

2. **Convert the first term to its word representation:**
   - The number 2 is written as "two."

3. **Count the number of letters in the word:**
   - "Two" has 3 letters.

4. **Calculate the second term:**
   - Add the number of letters to the first term: \(2 + 3 = 5\).

5. **Repeat the process for the second term:**
   - The second term is 5, which is written as "five."
   - "Five" has 4 letters.
   - Calculate the third term: \(5 + 4 = 9\).

6. **Repeat the process for the third term:**
   - The third term is 9, which is written as "nine."
   - "Nine" has 4 letters.
   - Calculate the fourth term: \(9 + 4 = 13\).

7. **Repeat the process for the fourth term:**
   - The fourth term is 13, which is written as "thirteen."
   - "Thirteen" has 8 letters.
   - Calculate the fifth term: \(13 + 8 = 21\).

8. **State the final answer:**
   - The 5th term in the sequence is 21.

**Final Answer:**
The 5th term in the sequence is 21.

This example demonstrates a logical reasoning approach to solving a sequence problem. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that problem step by step.
