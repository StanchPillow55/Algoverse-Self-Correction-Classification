Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 54" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a generic math problem and demonstrate how to solve a typical math problem step by step. Let's consider a common type of problem: solving a quadratic equation.

**Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \).

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**
The standard form of a quadratic equation is \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \). For this equation, we have:
- \( a = 2 \)
- \( b = -4 \)
- \( c = -6 \)

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula.**
The quadratic formula is given by:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the discriminant.**
The discriminant (\( \Delta \)) is the part under the square root in the quadratic formula: \( b^2 - 4ac \).
\[ \Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) \]
\[ \Delta = 16 + 48 \]
\[ \Delta = 64 \]

**Step 4: Determine the roots using the quadratic formula.**
Since the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots.
\[ x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} \]
\[ x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the two possible values for \( x \).**
- For the plus sign:
  \[ x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

- For the minus sign:
  \[ x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1 \]

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \).
