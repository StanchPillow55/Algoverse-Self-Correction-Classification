It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. However, I'll assume you want me to solve a math problem involving the number 70. Let's consider a problem that involves the number 70 and work through it step by step.

**Problem:**  
Find the prime factorization of 70 and determine the number of divisors it has.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 70**

To find the prime factorization of 70, we need to divide it by the smallest prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. **Divide by 2:**  
   70 is even, so it is divisible by 2.  
   \( 70 \div 2 = 35 \)  
   So, 2 is a prime factor.

2. **Divide by 3:**  
   35 is not divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 3 + 5 = 8, is not divisible by 3).

3. **Divide by 5:**  
   35 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.  
   \( 35 \div 5 = 7 \)  
   So, 5 is a prime factor.

4. **Divide by 7:**  
   7 is a prime number, and \( 7 \div 7 = 1 \).  
   So, 7 is a prime factor.

Thus, the prime factorization of 70 is \( 2 \times 5 \times 7 \).

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number, use its prime factorization. If a number \( n \) has the prime factorization \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), the number of divisors \( D(n) \) is given by:

\[ D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1) \]

For 70, the prime factorization is \( 2^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 \).

- The exponent of 2 is 1.
- The exponent of 5 is 1.
- The exponent of 7 is 1.

Using the formula:

\[ D(70) = (1 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8 \]

**Conclusion:**

The prime factorization of 70 is \( 2 \times 5 \times 7 \), and it has 8 divisors.

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 70 is \( 2 \times 5 \times 7 \), and the number of divisors is 8.
