==================================================

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or missing information in your request. "Sample math problem 70" doesn't specify a particular math problem to solve. Instead, it seems like you might be referring to a specific problem from a textbook or resource labeled as "70." Without the actual problem statement, I can't provide a solution.

However, I can guide you on how to approach solving a math problem step by step. If you provide the specific details of the problem, I can work through it with you. Here’s a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what is unknown.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you’ve planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Recalculate if necessary to ensure accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly state the solution to the problem.
   - Include units if applicable.

If you provide the specific details of the math problem labeled as "70," I can apply this approach to solve it for you.
