==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 70" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 10 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Start by getting all terms involving \( x \) on one side and constant terms on the other side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 2x + 10
   \]

   Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides to move the \( x \) terms to one side:

   \[
   3x - 2x + 5 = 10
   \]

   Simplify the left side:

   \[
   x + 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Isolate \( x \):**
   Subtract 5 from both sides to isolate \( x \):

   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 10 - 5
   \]

   Simplify:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 2(5) + 10
   \]

   Calculate both sides:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 10 + 10
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides are equal, \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
