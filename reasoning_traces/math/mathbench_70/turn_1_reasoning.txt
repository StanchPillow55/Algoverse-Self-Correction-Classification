Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 70, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 70" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. In a typical scenario, a math problem labeled with a number like "70" would be part of a larger set of problems, possibly from a textbook or worksheet, where each problem has its own specific question.

Since the problem statement is not provided, let's assume a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Problem 70" in a typical math context. I'll create a problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 70:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 70 positive integers."

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( n \) is the number of terms. In this case, \( n = 70 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the formula**: We use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, which is \( S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Substitute \( n = 70 \) into the formula**:

   \[
   S_{70} = \frac{70(70 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate inside the parentheses**:

   \[
   70 + 1 = 71
   \]

4. **Multiply 70 by 71**:

   \[
   70 \times 71 = 4970
   \]

5. **Divide the product by 2**:

   \[
   \frac{4970}{2} = 2485
   \]

Thus, the sum of the first 70 positive integers is 2485.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 70 positive integers is 2485.
