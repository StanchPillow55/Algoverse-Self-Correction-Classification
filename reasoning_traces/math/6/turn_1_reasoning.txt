==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices Albert can eat in one day by adding the slices from both the large and small pizzas he buys.

1. **Calculate the total number of slices from the large pizzas:**

   - Albert buys 2 large pizzas.
   - Each large pizza has 16 slices.
   - Therefore, the total number of slices from the large pizzas is:
     \[
     2 \text{ large pizzas} \times 16 \text{ slices per large pizza} = 32 \text{ slices}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of slices from the small pizzas:**

   - Albert buys 2 small pizzas.
   - Each small pizza has 8 slices.
   - Therefore, the total number of slices from the small pizzas is:
     \[
     2 \text{ small pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per small pizza} = 16 \text{ slices}
     \]

3. **Add the slices from both the large and small pizzas to find the total number of slices Albert eats:**

   - Total slices from large pizzas: 32 slices
   - Total slices from small pizzas: 16 slices
   - Therefore, the total number of slices Albert eats is:
     \[
     32 \text{ slices} + 16 \text{ slices} = 48 \text{ slices}
     \]

Thus, if Albert eats all the pizzas he buys, he will eat a total of 48 slices in one day.

**Final Answer: 48 slices**
