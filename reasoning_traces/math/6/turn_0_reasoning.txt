==================================================

To determine how many slices of pizza Albert can eat in one day, we need to calculate the total number of slices from the pizzas he bought.

1. **Identify the number of slices in each type of pizza:**
   - A large pizza has 16 slices.
   - A small pizza has 8 slices.

2. **Calculate the total number of slices from the large pizzas:**
   - Albert bought 2 large pizzas.
   - The total number of slices from the large pizzas is:
     \[
     2 \text{ large pizzas} \times 16 \text{ slices per large pizza} = 32 \text{ slices}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of slices from the small pizzas:**
   - Albert also bought 2 small pizzas.
   - The total number of slices from the small pizzas is:
     \[
     2 \text{ small pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per small pizza} = 16 \text{ slices}
     \]

4. **Add the total slices from both types of pizzas:**
   - Now, we combine the slices from the large and small pizzas:
     \[
     32 \text{ slices (from large pizzas)} + 16 \text{ slices (from small pizzas)} = 48 \text{ slices}
     \]

Thus, the total number of slices of pizza that Albert can eat in one day is **48 slices**.

Final answer: **48 slices**.
