==================================================

First, we need to calculate how many slices of pizza Albert has in total. 

We know that a large pizza has 16 slices and he has 2 of them. So, we multiply the number of large pizzas by the number of slices in each:

2 large pizzas * 16 slices/pizza = 32 slices

Next, we know that a small pizza has 8 slices and he has 2 of them. So, we multiply the number of small pizzas by the number of slices in each:

2 small pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 16 slices

Now, we add the total number of large pizza slices and small pizza slices to find out how many slices Albert has in total:

32 slices + 16 slices = 48 slices

So, if Albert eats all the pizza, he will eat 48 slices in one day.
