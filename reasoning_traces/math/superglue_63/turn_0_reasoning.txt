==================================================

To provide a complete solution, I need the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 63." Since I don't have access to external databases or documents, I can't see the content of this specific question. However, I can guide you on how to approach a typical reasoning or math problem step-by-step. If you provide the details of the question, I can give a more tailored solution. For now, here's a general approach:

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning).
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step-by-step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Re-calculate if necessary to confirm the result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution:

**Example Problem:**
A car travels 150 miles in 3 hours. What is the average speed of the car in miles per hour?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the average speed of the car.
   - Given: Distance = 150 miles, Time = 3 hours.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for average speed: \(\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}\).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the given values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Check the calculation: \(150 \div 3 = 50\).
   - The units are consistent (miles per hour).

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The average speed of the car is 50 miles per hour.

If you provide the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 63," I can apply this structured approach to solve it.
