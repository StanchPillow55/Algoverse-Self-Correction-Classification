==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific details about "Sample reasoning question 63." Since the question is not provided, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving reasoning questions, which often involve logical deduction, pattern recognition, or mathematical calculations.

### General Approach to Solving Reasoning Questions

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the question to understand what is being asked.
   - Identify key information and any constraints or conditions given in the problem.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - Determine if it's a logical reasoning problem, a pattern recognition task, a mathematical calculation, or another type of reasoning question.

3. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
   - Analyze each part separately to understand how they contribute to the overall solution.

4. **Apply Logical Reasoning or Mathematical Principles:**
   - Use logical deduction to eliminate impossible or unlikely options.
   - Apply relevant mathematical formulas or principles if the problem involves calculations.

5. **Check for Patterns or Relationships:**
   - Look for patterns or relationships between different elements of the problem.
   - Use these patterns to predict or deduce the solution.

6. **Verify Your Solution:**
   - Double-check your reasoning and calculations to ensure accuracy.
   - Consider alternative approaches to confirm your solution is correct.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present your final answer, ensuring it addresses the question asked.

### Example Problem and Solution

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 63," I'll provide an example problem and solution:

**Example Problem:**
A sequence of numbers is given as follows: 2, 4, 8, 16, ... What is the 6th term in this sequence?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the 6th term in the sequence.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - This is a pattern recognition problem involving a sequence of numbers.

3. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Observe the given terms: 2, 4, 8, 16.

4. **Apply Logical Reasoning or Mathematical Principles:**
   - Notice that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2.
   - This is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2.

5. **Check for Patterns or Relationships:**
   - The nth term of a geometric sequence can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 \times r^{(n-1)}
     \]
   - Here, \(a_1 = 2\) and \(r = 2\).

6. **Calculate the 6th Term:**
   \[
   a_6 = 2 \times 2^{(6-1)} = 2 \times 2^5 = 2 \times 32 = 64
   \]

7. **Verify Your Solution:**
   - Check the pattern: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. The 6th term is indeed 64.

8. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The 6th term in the sequence is 64.

If you provide the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 63," I can offer a more tailored solution.
