To determine how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of plays each DVD can handle**: Each DVD can be played a maximum of 1000 times before it breaks.

2. **Determine how many times each DVD has already been played**:
   - The first DVD has been played 356 times.
   - The second DVD has been played 135 times.

3. **Calculate the remaining plays for each DVD**:
   - For the first DVD:
     \[
     \text{Remaining plays for DVD 1} = 1000 - 356 = 644
     \]
   - For the second DVD:
     \[
     \text{Remaining plays for DVD 2} = 1000 - 135 = 865
     \]

4. **Calculate the total remaining plays for both DVDs**:
   - We add the remaining plays of both DVDs together:
     \[
     \text{Total remaining plays} = 644 + 865
     \]

5. **Perform the addition**:
   \[
   644 + 865 = 1509
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of plays before both DVDs break**:
   - Since each DVD can be played 1000 times, the total number of plays before both DVDs break is:
     \[
     \text{Total plays before breaking} = 1000 + 1000 = 2000
     \]

7. **Combine the total plays already used with the remaining plays**:
   - The total number of plays that can be made before both DVDs break is the sum of the plays already used and the remaining plays:
   \[
   \text{Total plays} = \text{Plays used} + \text{Remaining plays}
   \]
   - The total plays used is:
   \[
   \text{Plays used} = 356 + 135 = 491
   \]
   - Therefore, the total number of plays before both DVDs break is:
   \[
   \text{Total plays} = 491 + 1509 = 2000
   \]

Thus, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is:

\[
\boxed{2000}
\]
