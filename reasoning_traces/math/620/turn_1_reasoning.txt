Question ID: 620
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break. We know the following:

1. Each DVD can be played a maximum of 1000 times before it breaks.
2. The first DVD has already been played 356 times.
3. The second DVD has already been played 135 times.

### Step 1: Calculate Remaining Plays for Each DVD

**For the first DVD:**
- Total plays before breaking = 1000
- Plays already used = 356
- Remaining plays = Total plays - Plays already used

\[
\text{Remaining plays for the first DVD} = 1000 - 356 = 644
\]

**For the second DVD:**
- Total plays before breaking = 1000
- Plays already used = 135
- Remaining plays = Total plays - Plays already used

\[
\text{Remaining plays for the second DVD} = 1000 - 135 = 865
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Remaining Plays for Both DVDs

Now that we have the remaining plays for each DVD, we can find the total remaining plays by adding the remaining plays of both DVDs together.

\[
\text{Total remaining plays} = \text{Remaining plays for the first DVD} + \text{Remaining plays for the second DVD}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total remaining plays} = 644 + 865
\]

### Step 3: Perform the Addition

Now we perform the addition:

\[
644 + 865 = 1509
\]

### Final Answer

The total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is:

\[
\boxed{1509}
\]
