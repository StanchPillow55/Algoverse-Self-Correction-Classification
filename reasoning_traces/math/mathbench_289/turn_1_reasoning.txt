==================================================

To solve the math problem "Sample math problem 289," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 289" is not a specific question, I will assume you want me to solve the mathematical problem of finding the square root of 289, as this is a common interpretation.

Let's work through the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find the square root of 289. The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).

### Step 2: Identify the Method
To find the square root of 289, we can use several methods:
- Estimation and refinement
- Prime factorization
- Recognizing perfect squares

### Step 3: Recognize Perfect Squares
289 is a perfect square. We can determine this by recognizing that 289 is a relatively small number and checking perfect squares around it.

### Step 4: Calculation
Let's calculate the square root of 289 by recognizing perfect squares:

1. **Estimate**: We know that \( 15^2 = 225 \) and \( 20^2 = 400 \). Since 289 is between these two, the square root must be between 15 and 20.

2. **Check Perfect Squares**:
   - \( 16^2 = 256 \)
   - \( 17^2 = 289 \)

Since \( 17^2 = 289 \), we have found that the square root of 289 is 17.

### Step 5: Verify
To verify, we can multiply 17 by itself:
\[ 17 \times 17 = 289 \]

This confirms that our calculation is correct.

### Final Answer
The square root of 289 is \( \boxed{17} \).
