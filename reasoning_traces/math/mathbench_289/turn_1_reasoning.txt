Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 289," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 289" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. 

Let's assume that "Sample math problem 289" refers to finding the square root of 289, as this is a common type of math problem associated with numbers like 289.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the square root of 289.

2. **Recall the Definition of a Square Root:**
   - The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).

3. **Estimate the Square Root:**
   - Since 289 is a perfect square, we can find its square root by estimating or recalling perfect squares.
   - We know that \( 15^2 = 225 \) and \( 20^2 = 400 \). Therefore, the square root of 289 is between 15 and 20.

4. **Calculate the Exact Square Root:**
   - Let's try \( 17^2 \):
     \[
     17^2 = 17 \times 17 = 289
     \]
   - Therefore, \( \sqrt{289} = 17 \).

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - To ensure the calculation is correct, we can verify:
     \[
     17 \times 17 = 289
     \]
   - The multiplication confirms that 17 is indeed the square root of 289.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The square root of 289 is 17.

### Final Answer:
The square root of 289 is 17.
