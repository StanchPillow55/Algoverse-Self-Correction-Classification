Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 289," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, it seems like the problem statement is incomplete or not provided in detail. Given the information, "Sample math problem 289" could refer to a specific problem from a textbook or a set of problems, but without additional context, it's impossible to know what the problem is.

Let's assume that "Sample math problem 289" refers to a common type of math problem involving the number 289. One possible interpretation could be to find the square root of 289, as this is a common type of problem involving perfect squares.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Problem:**
   - We will assume the problem is to find the square root of 289.

2. **Understanding Perfect Squares:**
   - A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product of an integer with itself. For example, \(16\) is a perfect square because \(4 \times 4 = 16\).

3. **Finding the Square Root:**
   - We need to find an integer \(n\) such that \(n \times n = 289\).

4. **Calculating the Square Root:**
   - We can start by estimating. We know that \(15^2 = 225\) and \(20^2 = 400\). Since 289 is between 225 and 400, the square root should be between 15 and 20.
   - Let's try \(17\): 
     \[
     17 \times 17 = 289
     \]
   - Since \(17 \times 17 = 289\), we have found that the square root of 289 is 17.

5. **Verification:**
   - To ensure our calculation is correct, we can verify by squaring 17 again:
     \[
     17 \times 17 = 289
     \]
   - The calculation confirms that 17 is indeed the square root of 289.

### Final Answer:
The square root of 289 is 17.

If the problem "Sample math problem 289" refers to something else, please provide additional details or context so that I can assist you further.
