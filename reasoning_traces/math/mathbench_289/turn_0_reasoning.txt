==================================================

To solve the problem of finding the square root of 289, we will go through the following steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find the square root of 289. The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).

### Step 2: Estimate the Square Root
First, we estimate the square root by finding two perfect squares between which 289 lies. We know:
- \( 15^2 = 225 \)
- \( 16^2 = 256 \)
- \( 17^2 = 289 \)

Since 289 is exactly \( 17^2 \), we can see that the square root of 289 is 17.

### Step 3: Verify the Calculation
To ensure our calculation is correct, we will square 17 to check if it equals 289:
\[ 17 \times 17 = 289 \]

Breaking it down:
- \( 17 \times 17 = (10 + 7) \times (10 + 7) \)
- Using the distributive property (FOIL method):
  - \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \)
  - \( 10 \times 7 = 70 \)
  - \( 7 \times 10 = 70 \)
  - \( 7 \times 7 = 49 \)

Adding these results together:
\[ 100 + 70 + 70 + 49 = 289 \]

### Step 4: Conclusion
Since \( 17^2 = 289 \), the square root of 289 is indeed 17.

### Final Answer
The square root of 289 is \(\boxed{17}\).
