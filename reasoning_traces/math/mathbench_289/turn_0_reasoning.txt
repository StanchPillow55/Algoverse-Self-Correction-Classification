==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 289, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since "Sample math problem 289" is not specific, I'll assume you want to find the square root of 289, as this is a common mathematical operation associated with such numbers.

Let's solve the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We are tasked with finding the square root of 289. The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).

### Step 2: Estimate the Square Root
Before calculating, let's estimate. We know that:
- \( 15^2 = 225 \)
- \( 16^2 = 256 \)
- \( 17^2 = 289 \)

From this, we can see that 289 is a perfect square, and it lies between the squares of 16 and 17. Since \( 17^2 = 289 \), we can conclude that the square root of 289 is 17.

### Step 3: Verify the Calculation
To ensure our answer is correct, let's verify by squaring 17:
\[ 17 \times 17 = 289 \]

Breaking it down:
- \( 17 \times 10 = 170 \)
- \( 17 \times 7 = 119 \)

Adding these results:
\[ 170 + 119 = 289 \]

This confirms that our calculation is correct.

### Step 4: State the Final Answer
The square root of 289 is 17.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \sqrt{289} = 17 \]
