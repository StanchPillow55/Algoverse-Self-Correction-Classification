Question ID: mathbench_289
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 289" refers to. Since no specific problem is provided, I'll assume it involves the number 289 and explore a common mathematical question related to it, such as finding its square root.

**Step 1: Identify the problem**

Let's assume the problem is to find the square root of 289.

**Step 2: Understand the properties of 289**

289 is a perfect square, which means it is the square of an integer. To find its square root, we need to determine which integer, when multiplied by itself, equals 289.

**Step 3: Calculate the square root**

To find the square root of 289, we can use estimation or factorization. However, since 289 is a relatively small number, we can try to find its square root by recognizing patterns or using known squares:

1. Recognize that 289 is close to 300, and we know that \(17^2 = 289\).

2. Verify by calculation:
   \[
   17 \times 17 = 289
   \]

   Breaking it down:
   \[
   17 \times 17 = (10 + 7) \times (10 + 7)
   \]
   \[
   = 10 \times 10 + 2 \times 10 \times 7 + 7 \times 7
   \]
   \[
   = 100 + 140 + 49
   \]
   \[
   = 289
   \]

**Step 4: Conclusion**

The square root of 289 is 17.

**Final Answer:**

The square root of 289 is 17.
