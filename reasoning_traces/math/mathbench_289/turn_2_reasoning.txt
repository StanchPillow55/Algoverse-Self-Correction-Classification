Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what "Sample math problem 289" could imply. Since no specific problem is given, I'll assume that "289" refers to a mathematical operation or property related to the number 289. A common mathematical problem involving a number like 289 is finding its square root, checking if it's a perfect square, or performing some operation with it.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Problem:**
   - Let's assume the problem is to find the square root of 289. This is a common operation when dealing with numbers that are perfect squares.

2. **Check if 289 is a Perfect Square:**
   - A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. To determine if 289 is a perfect square, we need to find an integer \( n \) such that \( n^2 = 289 \).

3. **Estimate the Square Root:**
   - Start by estimating the square root. Since \( 15^2 = 225 \) and \( 20^2 = 400 \), the square root of 289 should be between 15 and 20.

4. **Calculate the Exact Square Root:**
   - Try \( 17^2 \):
     \[
     17^2 = 17 \times 17 = 289
     \]
   - Since \( 17^2 = 289 \), 289 is indeed a perfect square, and its square root is 17.

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - To ensure accuracy, let's verify by recalculating:
     \[
     17 \times 17 = (10 + 7) \times (10 + 7) = 10^2 + 2 \times 10 \times 7 + 7^2 = 100 + 140 + 49 = 289
     \]
   - The calculation confirms that \( 17^2 = 289 \).

### Conclusion:

The square root of 289 is 17. Therefore, if the problem was to find the square root of 289, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{17}
\]
