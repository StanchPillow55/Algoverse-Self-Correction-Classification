==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 289," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 289" is not specific enough to determine what calculations or reasoning are required. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 289" refers to a common mathematical problem involving the number 289. One such problem could be finding the square root of 289, as it is a perfect square.

Let's solve the problem of finding the square root of 289:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the square root of 289.

2. **Recall the Definition:**
   - The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).

3. **Identify Perfect Squares:**
   - We know that 289 is a perfect square. We need to find a number \( y \) such that \( y \times y = 289 \).

4. **Estimate and Calculate:**
   - We can start by estimating. Since \( 15^2 = 225 \) and \( 20^2 = 400 \), the square root of 289 should be between 15 and 20.
   - Let's try \( 17^2 \):
     \[
     17 \times 17 = 289
     \]

5. **Verification:**
   - Since \( 17 \times 17 = 289 \), we have verified that 17 is indeed the square root of 289.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The square root of 289 is 17.

### Final Answer:
The square root of 289 is 17.
