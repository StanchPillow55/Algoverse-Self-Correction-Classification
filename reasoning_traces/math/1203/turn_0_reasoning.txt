==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor in inches. We will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Mattison's height**:  
   Mattison is given to be 60 inches tall.

2. **Calculate the height of the two-story house**:  
   The height of the two-story house is 7 times Mattison's height.  
   \[
   \text{Height of the two-story house} = 7 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the height of the first floor**:  
   The height of the first floor is given to be thrice as high as Mattison.  
   \[
   \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Calculate the height of the second floor**:  
   The total height of the two-story house is the sum of the heights of the first floor and the second floor. Let \( h \) be the height of the second floor.  
   \[
   \text{Total height} = \text{Height of the first floor} + \text{Height of the second floor}
   \]
   Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   420 = 180 + h
   \]

5. **Solve for the height of the second floor**:  
   Rearranging the equation gives us:
   \[
   h = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches}
   \]

6. **Final answer**:  
   The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]
