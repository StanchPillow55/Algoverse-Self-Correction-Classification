To find out how much change Adam received after buying the candies, we first need to calculate the total cost of the candies he purchased.

1. **Calculate the cost of candies of type A:**
   - Adam bought 7 candies of type A.
   - The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5.
   - Therefore, the total cost for type A candies is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for type A} = \text{Number of candies} \times \text{Cost per candy} = 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of candies of type B:**
   - Adam bought 10 candies of type B.
   - The cost of one candy of type B is $0.75.
   - Therefore, the total cost for type B candies is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for type B} = \text{Number of candies} \times \text{Cost per candy} = 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of all candies:**
   - Now we add the total costs of type A and type B candies:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for type A} + \text{Total cost for type B} = 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the change Adam received:**
   - Adam paid the cashier $15.
   - To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
     \[
     \text{Change} = \text{Amount paid} - \text{Total cost} = 15 - 11 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Adam received **$4** in change.
