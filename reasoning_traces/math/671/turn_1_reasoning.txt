==================================================

To find out how much change Adam received after buying candies, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of candies of type A**:
   - Adam bought 7 candies of type A.
   - The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5.
   - Total cost for type A candies = Number of candies × Cost per candy
   \[
   \text{Total cost for type A} = 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of candies of type B**:
   - Adam bought 10 candies of type B.
   - The cost of one candy of type B is $0.75.
   - Total cost for type B candies = Number of candies × Cost per candy
   \[
   \text{Total cost for type B} = 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of all candies**:
   - Total cost = Total cost for type A + Total cost for type B
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the change Adam received**:
   - Adam paid the cashier $15.
   - Change = Amount paid - Total cost
   \[
   \text{Change} = 15 - 11 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Adam received **$4** in change.
