To solve this problem, we need to determine the original number of matchsticks Michael had before he decided to use only half of them for his project.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of matchsticks used:**
   - Michael creates 30 matchstick houses.
   - Each house uses 10 matchsticks.
   - Therefore, the total number of matchsticks used is calculated by multiplying the number of houses by the number of matchsticks per house:
     \[
     \text{Total matchsticks used} = 30 \times 10 = 300
     \]

2. **Relate the matchsticks used to the original pile:**
   - Michael decided to use only half of his original pile of matchsticks.
   - The 300 matchsticks used represent half of his original pile.

3. **Calculate the original number of matchsticks:**
   - If 300 matchsticks represent half of the original pile, then the original number of matchsticks is twice the number used:
     \[
     \text{Original number of matchsticks} = 2 \times 300 = 600
     \]

Thus, Michael originally had 600 matchsticks.

**Final Answer:**
Michael originally had 600 matchsticks.
