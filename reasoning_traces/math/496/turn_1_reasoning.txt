==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the original number of matchsticks Michael had before he decided to use only half of them for his project.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Michael decides to use only half of his matchsticks.
   - He uses these matchsticks to create 30 matchstick houses.
   - Each house requires 10 matchsticks.
   - He uses all the matchsticks he intended to use.

2. **Calculate the Total Number of Matchsticks Used:**
   - Since Michael creates 30 houses and each house uses 10 matchsticks, the total number of matchsticks used is:
     \[
     \text{Total matchsticks used} = 30 \text{ houses} \times 10 \text{ matchsticks per house} = 300 \text{ matchsticks}
     \]

3. **Determine the Intended Number of Matchsticks:**
   - Michael intended to use half of his original pile of matchsticks. Therefore, the 300 matchsticks he used represent half of his original pile.

4. **Calculate the Original Number of Matchsticks:**
   - If 300 matchsticks represent half of the original number, then the original number of matchsticks is twice this amount:
     \[
     \text{Original number of matchsticks} = 2 \times 300 = 600
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Michael originally had 600 matchsticks.

Thus, the final answer is that Michael originally had 600 matchsticks.
