==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of matchsticks Michael originally had. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Michael decides to use only half of his matchsticks to create miniature models.
   - He creates 30 matchstick houses.
   - Each house uses 10 matchsticks.
   - He uses all the matchsticks he intended to use.

2. **Calculate the Total Number of Matchsticks Used:**
   - Since each house uses 10 matchsticks and he creates 30 houses, the total number of matchsticks used is:
     \[
     30 \text{ houses} \times 10 \text{ matchsticks per house} = 300 \text{ matchsticks}
     \]

3. **Determine the Intended Number of Matchsticks:**
   - Michael used all the matchsticks he intended to use, which is half of his original pile. Therefore, the 300 matchsticks represent half of his original number of matchsticks.

4. **Calculate the Original Number of Matchsticks:**
   - Let \( x \) be the original number of matchsticks Michael had. Since he used half of them, we have:
     \[
     \frac{x}{2} = 300
     \]
   - To find \( x \), multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     x = 300 \times 2 = 600
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Michael originally had 600 matchsticks.

Therefore, the final answer is that Michael originally had 600 matchsticks.
