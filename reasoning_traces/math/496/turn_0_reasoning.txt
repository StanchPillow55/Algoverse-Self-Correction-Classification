==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many matchsticks Michael originally had based on the information provided.

1. **Understanding the problem**: 
   - Michael decides to use half of his matchsticks.
   - He builds 30 matchstick houses.
   - Each house uses 10 matchsticks.
   - We need to find out how many matchsticks he originally had.

2. **Calculating the total number of matchsticks used**:
   - Since each house uses 10 matchsticks and he builds 30 houses, we can calculate the total number of matchsticks used as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total matchsticks used} = \text{Number of houses} \times \text{Matchsticks per house}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total matchsticks used} = 30 \times 10 = 300
     \]

3. **Finding out how many matchsticks Michael originally had**:
   - We know that the 300 matchsticks used represent half of the total number of matchsticks Michael originally had. Let \( x \) be the total number of matchsticks he originally had. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{x}{2} = 300
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     x = 300 \times 2
     \]
     \[
     x = 600
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Michael originally had 600 matchsticks.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{600}
\]
