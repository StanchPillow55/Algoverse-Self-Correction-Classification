==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine Angela's current age based on the information given about Brett's age and the relationship between their ages in the future.

1. **Identify Brett's current age**: 
   - Brett is currently 14 years old.

2. **Determine Brett's age in four years**:
   - In four years, Brett will be:
     \[
     14 + 4 = 18 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Understand the relationship between Angela's age and Brett's current age**:
   - The problem states that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, we can express this relationship mathematically:
     \[
     \text{Angela's age in four years} = 3 \times \text{Brett's current age} = 3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Determine Angela's current age**:
   - If Angela will be 42 years old in four years, we can find her current age by subtracting 4 years from her age in four years:
     \[
     \text{Angela's current age} = 42 - 4 = 38 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Angela is currently **38 years old**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{38}
\]
