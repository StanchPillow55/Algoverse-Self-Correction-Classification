Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the original number of matchsticks Michael had before he decided to use only half of them.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Michael uses half of his matchsticks to make 30 matchstick houses.
   - Each house uses 10 matchsticks.
   - He uses all the matchsticks he intended to use.

2. **Calculate the Total Number of Matchsticks Used:**
   - Since each house uses 10 matchsticks, and he made 30 houses, the total number of matchsticks used is:
     \[
     30 \text{ houses} \times 10 \text{ matchsticks per house} = 300 \text{ matchsticks}
     \]

3. **Determine the Intended Number of Matchsticks:**
   - Michael decided to use half of his original pile of matchsticks. Therefore, the 300 matchsticks represent half of his original pile.

4. **Calculate the Original Number of Matchsticks:**
   - If 300 matchsticks represent half of the original number, then the original number of matchsticks is twice that amount:
     \[
     2 \times 300 = 600 \text{ matchsticks}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Originally, Michael had 600 matchsticks.
   - He decided to use half, which is 300 matchsticks.
   - He used these 300 matchsticks to make 30 houses, each requiring 10 matchsticks.
   - The calculations are consistent with the problem statement.

Therefore, the original number of matchsticks Michael had is \(\boxed{600}\).
