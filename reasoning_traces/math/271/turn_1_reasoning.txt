Question ID: 271
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and lilies that Nadia buys. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of roses:**
   - Nadia buys 20 roses.

2. **Determine the number of lilies:**
   - Nadia buys \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many lilies as roses.
   - Number of lilies = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 20 = 15\).

3. **Calculate the cost of the roses:**
   - Each rose costs $5.
   - Total cost for roses = Number of roses \(\times\) Cost per rose
   - Total cost for roses = \(20 \times 5 = 100\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the cost of the lilies:**
   - Each lily costs twice as much as a rose.
   - Cost per lily = \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
   - Total cost for lilies = Number of lilies \(\times\) Cost per lily
   - Total cost for lilies = \(15 \times 10 = 150\) dollars.

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Total cost for roses + Total cost for lilies
   - Total cost = \(100 + 150 = 250\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Nadia used to buy the flowers is $250.

**Final Answer: $250**
