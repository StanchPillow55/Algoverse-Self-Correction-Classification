==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and lilies Nadia buys. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of roses:**
   - Nadia buys 20 roses.

2. **Determine the number of lilies:**
   - Nadia buys \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many lilies as roses.
   - Number of lilies = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 20\).

   Let's calculate that:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 20 = \frac{3 \times 20}{4} = \frac{60}{4} = 15
   \]
   So, Nadia buys 15 lilies.

3. **Calculate the cost of the roses:**
   - Each rose costs $5.
   - Total cost for roses = 20 roses \(\times\) $5 per rose.

   Let's calculate that:
   \[
   20 \times 5 = 100
   \]
   So, the total cost for the roses is $100.

4. **Calculate the cost of the lilies:**
   - Each lily costs twice as much as a rose. Since each rose costs $5, each lily costs \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
   - Total cost for lilies = 15 lilies \(\times\) $10 per lily.

   Let's calculate that:
   \[
   15 \times 10 = 150
   \]
   So, the total cost for the lilies is $150.

5. **Calculate the total cost for all the flowers:**
   - Total cost = Cost of roses + Cost of lilies.

   Let's calculate that:
   \[
   100 + 150 = 250
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Nadia used to buy the flowers is $250.

**Final Answer: $250**
