To find the total number of windows in John's two houses, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of bedrooms in both houses:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - John has 2 houses.
   - Therefore, the total number of bedrooms is:
     \[
     \text{Total bedrooms} = 3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 6 \text{ bedrooms}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:**
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Since there are 6 bedrooms in total, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is:
     \[
     \text{Total bedroom windows} = 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} \times 6 \text{ bedrooms} = 12 \text{ windows}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of additional windows in each house:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:
     \[
     \text{Total additional windows} = 4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of windows in both houses:**
   - To find the total number of windows, we add the total number of bedroom windows to the total number of additional windows:
     \[
     \text{Total windows} = \text{Total bedroom windows} + \text{Total additional windows}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total windows} = 12 \text{ windows} + 8 \text{ windows} = 20 \text{ windows}
     \]

Thus, the total number of windows between the two houses is \( \boxed{20} \).
