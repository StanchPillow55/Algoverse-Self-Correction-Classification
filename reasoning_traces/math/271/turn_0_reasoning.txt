To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of lilies Nadia needs to buy.**
2. **Calculate the cost of the roses.**
3. **Calculate the cost of the lilies.**
4. **Find the total cost of the flowers.**

### Step 1: Calculate the number of lilies

Nadia needs to buy 20 roses. The problem states that she needs to buy \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many lilies as roses. 

To find the number of lilies:
\[
\text{Number of lilies} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Number of roses} = \frac{3}{4} \times 20
\]

Calculating this:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 20 = \frac{60}{4} = 15
\]

So, Nadia needs to buy 15 lilies.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the roses

The cost of each rose is $5. Therefore, the total cost for the roses is:
\[
\text{Cost of roses} = \text{Number of roses} \times \text{Cost per rose} = 20 \times 5
\]

Calculating this:
\[
20 \times 5 = 100
\]

So, the total cost for the roses is $100.

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the lilies

The problem states that lilies cost twice as much as roses. Since each rose costs $5, the cost of each lily is:
\[
\text{Cost per lily} = 2 \times \text{Cost per rose} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the lilies:
\[
\text{Cost of lilies} = \text{Number of lilies} \times \text{Cost per lily} = 15 \times 10
\]

Calculating this:
\[
15 \times 10 = 150
\]

So, the total cost for the lilies is $150.

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the flowers

Now, we can find the total amount of money Nadia used to buy the flowers by adding the cost of the roses and the cost of the lilies:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of roses} + \text{Cost of lilies} = 100 + 150
\]

Calculating this:
\[
100 + 150 = 250
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of money Nadia used to buy the flowers is **$250**.
