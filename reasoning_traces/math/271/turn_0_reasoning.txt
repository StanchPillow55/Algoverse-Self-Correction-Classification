==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and lilies that Nadia buys.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of lilies.**

Nadia buys 20 roses. According to the problem, she buys \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many lilies as roses. Therefore, the number of lilies she buys is:

\[
\text{Number of lilies} = \frac{3}{4} \times 20 = 15
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the roses.**

Each rose costs $5. Since Nadia buys 20 roses, the total cost for the roses is:

\[
\text{Cost of roses} = 20 \times 5 = 100 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the lilies.**

Each lily costs twice as much as a rose. Since each rose costs $5, each lily costs:

\[
\text{Cost per lily} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Nadia buys 15 lilies, the total cost for the lilies is:

\[
\text{Cost of lilies} = 15 \times 10 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of all the flowers.**

The total amount of money Nadia used to buy the flowers is the sum of the cost of the roses and the cost of the lilies:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of roses} + \text{Cost of lilies} = 100 + 150 = 250 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Nadia used to buy the flowers is \(\boxed{250}\) dollars.
