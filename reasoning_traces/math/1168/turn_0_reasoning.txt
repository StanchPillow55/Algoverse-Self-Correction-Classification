To solve the problem, we will define variables for the lengths of the ropes and set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be the length of the red rope.
   - Let \( b \) be the length of the blue rope.
   - Let \( y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
     \[
     r = 4b
     \]
   - The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
     \[
     b = y - 7
     \]
   - The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
     \[
     r + b + y = 37
     \]

3. **Substitute Variables:**
   - We can substitute \( r \) and \( b \) in terms of \( y \) into the combined length equation.
   - First, substitute \( b = y - 7 \) into the equation for \( r \):
     \[
     r = 4b = 4(y - 7)
     \]
   - Now substitute \( r \) and \( b \) into the combined length equation:
     \[
     4(y - 7) + (y - 7) + y = 37
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Distributing \( 4 \) in the equation:
     \[
     4y - 28 + y - 7 + y = 37
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     6y - 35 = 37
     \]

5. **Solve for \( y \):**
   - Add 35 to both sides:
     \[
     6y = 72
     \]
   - Divide by 6:
     \[
     y = 12
     \]

6. **Find \( b \) and \( r \):**
   - Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( b \):
     \[
     b = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5
     \]
   - Now find \( r \):
     \[
     r = 4b = 4 \times 5 = 20
     \]

7. **Final Answer:**
   - The length of the red rope is:
     \[
     \boxed{20} \text{ centimeters}
     \]

To verify:
- Lengths: \( r = 20 \), \( b = 5 \), \( y = 12 \)
- Combined length: \( 20 + 5 + 12 = 37 \) (correct)
- Blue rope is 7 cm shorter than yellow: \( 5 = 12 - 7 \) (correct)
- Red rope is four times the blue rope: \( 20 = 4 \times 5 \) (correct)

Thus, the calculations are consistent and the final answer is confirmed. The length of the red rope is \( \boxed{20} \) centimeters.
