Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how long Jason needs to walk each day to break in his new shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days Jason can walk in three weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - In three weeks, the total number of days is:
     \[
     3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
     \]

2. **Determine how many days Jason will actually walk:**
   - Jason plans to walk 4 days a week.
   - In three weeks, the total number of walking days is:
     \[
     3 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 12 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total walking time needed in minutes:**
   - It takes 240 minutes of walking to break in the new shoes.

4. **Determine how many minutes Jason needs to walk each day:**
   - To find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide the total walking time by the number of walking days:
     \[
     \text{Minutes per day} = \frac{\text{Total walking time}}{\text{Total walking days}} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day}
     \]

Thus, Jason needs to spend **20 minutes walking each day** to break in his new shoes before trying out for the track team.

**Final Answer: 20 minutes per day**
