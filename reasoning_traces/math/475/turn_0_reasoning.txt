==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many apples Layla picked given that the average number of apples picked by Maggie, Kelsey, and Layla is 30.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( M \) be the number of apples Maggie picked.
- Let \( K \) be the number of apples Kelsey picked.
- Let \( L \) be the number of apples Layla picked.

From the problem, we know:
- \( M = 40 \)
- \( K = 28 \)

We are also given that the average number of apples picked by the three is 30. The formula for the average of three numbers is:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{M + K + L}{3}
\]

Substituting the known values into the formula, we have:

\[
30 = \frac{40 + 28 + L}{3}
\]

To find \( L \), we first solve for the total number of apples picked by all three:

\[
30 \times 3 = 40 + 28 + L
\]

Calculate the left side:

\[
90 = 40 + 28 + L
\]

Next, combine the numbers on the right side:

\[
90 = 68 + L
\]

To isolate \( L \), subtract 68 from both sides:

\[
L = 90 - 68
\]

Calculate the result:

\[
L = 22
\]

Therefore, Layla picked 22 apples.

Final Answer: Layla picked 22 apples.
