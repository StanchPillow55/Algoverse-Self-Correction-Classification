To find out how many apples Layla picked, we can start by using the information given in the problem.

1. **Identify the known quantities**:
   - Maggie picked 40 apples.
   - Kelsey picked 28 apples.
   - Let \( L \) represent the number of apples Layla picked.

2. **Calculate the total number of apples picked by all three**:
   The average number of apples picked by the three girls is given as 30. The formula for the average is:

   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Number of girls}}
   \]

   Since there are three girls, we can express the total number of apples as:

   \[
   \text{Total number of apples} = \text{Average} \times \text{Number of girls}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   \text{Total number of apples} = 30 \times 3 = 90
   \]

3. **Set up the equation for the total number of apples**:
   The total number of apples picked by all three girls can also be expressed as the sum of the apples picked by each girl:

   \[
   40 + 28 + L = 90
   \]

4. **Combine the known quantities**:
   Now, we can combine the apples picked by Maggie and Kelsey:

   \[
   40 + 28 = 68
   \]

5. **Substitute back into the equation**:
   Now we substitute this sum back into the equation:

   \[
   68 + L = 90
   \]

6. **Solve for \( L \)**:
   To find \( L \), we subtract 68 from both sides:

   \[
   L = 90 - 68
   \]
   \[
   L = 22
   \]

Thus, Layla picked **22 apples**.

**Final Answer**: Layla picked 22 apples.
