==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 422" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't provided, I'll create a sample problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 422" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 422:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   - The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).
   - Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Term with \( x \):**
   - To isolate the term with \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides.
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it. Since \( x \) is multiplied by 3, we divide both sides of the equation by 3.
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation.
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   - Calculate the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
