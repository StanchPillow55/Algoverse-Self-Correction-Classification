==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 422" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. 

Let's create a sample math problem to solve:

**Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Solution:**

To find the area of a triangle, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

Given:
- Base (\(b\)) = 10 units
- Height (\(h\)) = 5 units

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
\]

Calculate the product of the base and height:

\[
10 \times 5 = 50
\]

Now, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
\]

Thus, the area of the triangle is 25 square units.

**Final Answer:**
The area of the triangle is 25 square units.
