==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 422," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 422" is not specific, and it does not provide any details or context about what needs to be solved. 

In order to proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 422" refers to a hypothetical math problem. Since no specific details are given, I'll create a sample math problem for demonstration purposes and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 422:**

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     48 = 2(3W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     48 = 6W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     48 = 8W
     \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 8 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

6. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute \( W = 6 \) into the equation for L:
     \[
     L = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that the perimeter is indeed 48 units with these dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculation is correct, confirming that the dimensions satisfy the given perimeter.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 6 units and a length of 18 units.
