==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 242" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated here, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 242" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 242" is as follows:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 11 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies this equation.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

   Start by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides of the equation to eliminate \( x \) from the right side:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 11 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = 11
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Next, subtract 5 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 11 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(6) + 5 = 2(6) + 11
   \]
   Calculate both sides:
   \[
   18 + 5 = 12 + 11
   \]
   \[
   23 = 23
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, \( x = 6 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 11 \) is \( x = 6 \).
