To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate John's earnings on Sunday:**
   - John earned $18 on Saturday.
   - He earned half of that amount on Sunday.
   \[
   \text{Earnings on Sunday} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate total earnings for the weekend:**
   - John earned $20 the previous weekend.
   - This weekend, he earned $18 on Saturday and $9 on Sunday.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings this weekend} = 18 + 9 = 27 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate total earnings including the previous weekend:**
   - Total earnings for both weekends:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 20 + 27 = 47 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how much more money John needs:**
   - John needs $60 to buy a new pogo stick.
   - We need to find out how much more he needs to earn.
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = 60 - 47 = 13 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, John needs to earn **$13 more** to have enough money to buy the pogo stick.

**Final Answer: John needs to earn $13 more.**
