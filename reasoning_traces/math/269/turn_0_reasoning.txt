==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money John has already earned and how much more he needs to reach his goal of $60.

1. **Calculate John's earnings on Saturday:**
   - John earned $18 on Saturday.

2. **Calculate John's earnings on Sunday:**
   - John earned half of what he earned on Saturday. 
   - Half of $18 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \frac{18}{2} = 9
     \]
   - So, John earned $9 on Sunday.

3. **Calculate John's earnings from the previous weekend:**
   - John earned $20 the previous weekend.

4. **Calculate John's total earnings so far:**
   - Add up all the amounts he has earned:
     \[
     18 \, (\text{Saturday}) + 9 \, (\text{Sunday}) + 20 \, (\text{previous weekend}) = 47
     \]
   - So, John has earned a total of $47.

5. **Determine how much more money John needs:**
   - John needs $60 to buy the pogo stick.
   - Subtract the total amount he has earned from the amount he needs:
     \[
     60 - 47 = 13
     \]
   - Therefore, John needs to earn an additional $13.

**Final Answer:**
John needs to earn $13 more to have enough money to buy the pogo stick.
