==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 137." However, since I don't have the specific details of this question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. If you have specific details or numbers from the question, please provide them, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.

### General Approach to Solving a Math Reasoning Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given information or constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Determine the type of problem (e.g., algebra, geometry, logic).
   - Consider possible strategies (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation, logical deduction).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify each step for accuracy.
   - Check if the solution answers the question.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm the result.

### Example Problem and Solution

**Example Problem:**
A farmer has a total of 100 animals consisting of chickens and cows. If the total number of legs is 280, how many chickens and how many cows does the farmer have?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have two types of animals: chickens and cows.
   - Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each.
   - Total animals = 100, total legs = 280.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens and \( w \) be the number of cows.
   - We have two equations:
     1. \( c + w = 100 \) (total animals)
     2. \( 2c + 4w = 280 \) (total legs)

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Solve the system of equations.
   - From equation 1: \( c = 100 - w \).
   - Substitute into equation 2:
     \[
     2(100 - w) + 4w = 280
     \]
     \[
     200 - 2w + 4w = 280
     \]
     \[
     2w = 80
     \]
     \[
     w = 40
     \]
   - Substitute \( w = 40 \) back into equation 1:
     \[
     c + 40 = 100
     \]
     \[
     c = 60
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Total animals: \( 60 + 40 = 100 \) (correct).
   - Total legs: \( 2(60) + 4(40) = 120 + 160 = 280 \) (correct).

**Final Answer:**
The farmer has 60 chickens and 40 cows.

If you provide the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 137," I can apply this structured approach to solve it.
