Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify the task at hand. The question provided is "Sample reasoning question 137," which doesn't specify any particular mathematical problem or context. Therefore, I'll interpret this as a prompt to demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem, using a hypothetical example.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   From the problem, we know:
   - Base \( b = 10 \) units
   - Height \( h = 5 \) units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   Substitute the given values for the base and height into the area formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   First, multiply the base and the height:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50
   \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   Now, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

**Final Answer:**
The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a basic geometry problem involving the calculation of the area of a triangle. Each step involves understanding the formula, substituting known values, performing arithmetic operations, and clearly stating the final result.
