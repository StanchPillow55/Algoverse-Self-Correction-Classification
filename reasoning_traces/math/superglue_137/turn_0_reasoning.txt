==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample reasoning question 137," I would need the specific details or context of the question. Since the question itself is not provided, I will outline a general approach to solving a typical math problem and provide an example of how to work through it.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given information and constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Determine the mathematical concepts or formulas that apply.
   - Consider drawing diagrams or making tables if necessary.
   - Plan the steps needed to solve the problem.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps methodically.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and signs.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step for accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Double-check calculations.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - The length \( L \) is 3 times the width \( W \).
   - The perimeter \( P \) is 48 units.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2L + 2W \).
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter formula.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     48 = 2(3W) + 2W
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     48 = 6W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     48 = 8W
     \]
   - Solve for \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]
   - Find \( L \) using \( L = 3W \):
     \[
     L = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculations are correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 18 units.
