==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 278" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by using a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Calculate the sum of the first 278 positive integers.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( n \) is the number of terms. In this case, \( n = 278 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the formula:** We use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, which is \( S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Substitute the value of \( n \):** Here, \( n = 278 \). Substitute this value into the formula:

   \[
   S = \frac{278(278 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( 278 + 1 \):**

   \[
   278 + 1 = 279
   \]

4. **Multiply \( 278 \) and \( 279 \):**

   \[
   278 \times 279
   \]

   To multiply these numbers, we can break it down:

   \[
   278 \times 279 = 278 \times (280 - 1) = 278 \times 280 - 278 \times 1
   \]

   Calculate \( 278 \times 280 \):

   \[
   278 \times 280 = 278 \times (280) = 278 \times (2 \times 140) = 556 \times 140
   \]

   Now calculate \( 556 \times 140 \):

   \[
   556 \times 140 = 556 \times (100 + 40) = 55600 + 22240 = 77840
   \]

   Now subtract \( 278 \times 1 \):

   \[
   77840 - 278 = 77562
   \]

5. **Divide by 2:**

   \[
   S = \frac{77562}{2} = 38781
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 278 positive integers is \( 38781 \).

This solution demonstrates how to approach a problem step-by-step, ensuring all calculations are shown and explained clearly. If "Sample reasoning question 278" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details for a more accurate solution.
