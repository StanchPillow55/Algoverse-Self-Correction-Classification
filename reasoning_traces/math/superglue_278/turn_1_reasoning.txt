Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 278" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, let's assume it is a typical math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. I will demonstrate a generic approach to solving a math problem by using a hypothetical example.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends $24, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step 1: Define Variables**
Let \( a \) be the number of apples and \( o \) be the number of oranges.

**Step 2: Set Up Equations**
We have two pieces of information that can be translated into equations:
1. The total number of fruits is 10: 
   \[
   a + o = 10
   \]
2. The total cost is $24:
   \[
   2a + 3o = 24
   \]

**Step 3: Solve the System of Equations**
We have the system of equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
1. & \quad a + o = 10 \\
2. & \quad 2a + 3o = 24
\end{align*}
\]

**Step 4: Solve for One Variable**
From equation 1, solve for \( a \):
\[
a = 10 - o
\]

**Step 5: Substitute into the Second Equation**
Substitute \( a = 10 - o \) into equation 2:
\[
2(10 - o) + 3o = 24
\]

**Step 6: Simplify and Solve for \( o \)**
\[
20 - 2o + 3o = 24
\]
\[
20 + o = 24
\]
\[
o = 24 - 20
\]
\[
o = 4
\]

**Step 7: Solve for \( a \)**
Substitute \( o = 4 \) back into the equation \( a = 10 - o \):
\[
a = 10 - 4
\]
\[
a = 6
\]

**Step 8: Verify the Solution**
Check the solution with the original equations:
- Total fruits: \( a + o = 6 + 4 = 10 \) (Correct)
- Total cost: \( 2a + 3o = 2(6) + 3(4) = 12 + 12 = 24 \) (Correct)

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 6 apples and 4 oranges.
