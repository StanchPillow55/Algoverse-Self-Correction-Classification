Question ID: mathbench_380
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 380," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 380" is not specific and does not provide any details about what needs to be solved. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder and create a sample math problem to solve.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 380 positive integers.

**Solution:**

To find the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) integers.

In this case, \( n = 380 \). Plugging this value into the formula, we get:

\[
S_{380} = \frac{380(380 + 1)}{2}
\]

First, calculate \( 380 + 1 \):

\[
380 + 1 = 381
\]

Next, multiply 380 by 381:

\[
380 \times 381 = 144780
\]

Now, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:

\[
S_{380} = \frac{144780}{2} = 72390
\]

Therefore, the sum of the first 380 positive integers is \( 72,390 \).

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 380 positive integers is \( 72,390 \).
