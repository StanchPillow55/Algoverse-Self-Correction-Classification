==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 380," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 380" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact question or the mathematical operations involved. Therefore, I will assume a hypothetical math problem for the purpose of this exercise and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
Calculate the sum of the first 380 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the sum of the first 380 positive integers. This is a common problem that can be solved using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

2. **Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Series:**
   - The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:
     \[
     S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - In this case, \( n = 380 \).

3. **Substitute the Value of \( n \):**
   - Substitute \( n = 380 \) into the formula:
     \[
     S = \frac{380(380 + 1)}{2}
     \]

4. **Calculate \( 380 + 1 \):**
   - \( 380 + 1 = 381 \)

5. **Calculate the Product \( 380 \times 381 \):**
   - To find \( 380 \times 381 \), we can use the distributive property:
     \[
     380 \times 381 = 380 \times (380 + 1) = 380 \times 380 + 380 \times 1
     \]
   - Calculate \( 380 \times 380 \):
     \[
     380 \times 380 = 144400
     \]
   - Calculate \( 380 \times 1 \):
     \[
     380 \times 1 = 380
     \]
   - Add the two results:
     \[
     144400 + 380 = 144780
     \]

6. **Divide by 2:**
   - Now, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:
     \[
     S = \frac{144780}{2} = 72390
     \]

7. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of the first 380 positive integers is \( 72390 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{72390} \]
