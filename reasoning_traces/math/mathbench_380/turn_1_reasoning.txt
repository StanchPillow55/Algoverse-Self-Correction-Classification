==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 380," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 380" is not a specific math problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 380, inclusive.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - The smallest even number in the range is 2.
   - The largest even number in the range is 380.

2. **Determine the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers between 1 and 380 is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 380.
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms in the Sequence:**
   - The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Set \( a_n = 380 \) to find \( n \):
     \[
     380 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     380 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     380 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{380}{2} = 190
     \]
   - There are 190 even numbers between 1 and 380.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{190} = \frac{190}{2} \cdot (2 + 380)
     \]
     \[
     S_{190} = 95 \cdot 382
     \]

5. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - Calculate \( 95 \times 382 \):
     \[
     95 \times 382 = 95 \times (380 + 2) = 95 \times 380 + 95 \times 2
     \]
     - First, calculate \( 95 \times 380 \):
       \[
       95 \times 380 = 95 \times (400 - 20) = 95 \times 400 - 95 \times 20
       \]
       \[
       95 \times 400 = 38000
       \]
       \[
       95 \times 20 = 1900
       \]
       \[
       95 \times 380 = 38000 - 1900 = 36100
       \]
     - Then, calculate \( 95 \times 2 \):
       \[
       95 \times 2 = 190
       \]
     - Add the results:
       \[
       36100 + 190 = 36290
       \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 380 is \( \boxed{36290} \).
