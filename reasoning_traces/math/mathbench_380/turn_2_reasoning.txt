Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 380," we need to first understand the context and details of the problem. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I will assume that "Sample math problem 380" refers to a generic math problem that involves typical mathematical operations or concepts. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is \( 2x + 5 = 15 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 5 = 15
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term:

   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 10
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{10}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify the solution:

   \[
   2(5) + 5 = 15
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   10 + 5 = 15
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 5.

This completes the solution to the hypothetical problem based on the given prompt "Sample math problem 380." If you have a specific problem or additional details, please provide them for a more accurate solution.
