To solve the problem, I need more information about what "Sample math problem 380" entails. Since the problem isn't specified, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem step by step. Let's assume a problem involving solving a quadratic equation, which is a common type of math problem.

**Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**

The standard form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). Here, the coefficients are:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula.**

The quadratic formula is given by:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the discriminant.**

The discriminant (\(D\)) is the part under the square root in the quadratic formula: \(b^2 - 4ac\).

\[
D = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
\]

**Step 4: Determine the roots using the quadratic formula.**

Since the discriminant is positive (\(D = 64\)), there are two real and distinct roots.

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
\]

Simplify the expression:

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

This gives us two solutions:

1. \(x = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3\)

2. \(x = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1\)

**Step 5: Verify the solutions.**

Substitute \(x = 3\) back into the original equation:

\[
2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
\]

Substitute \(x = -1\) back into the original equation:

\[
2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
\]

Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

**Final Answer:**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
