Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 370," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 370" is not a specific math problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "370" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 370:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 7 = 22 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 7 = 22 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will cancel out the other terms.

3. **Subtract 7 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 7 = 22
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 7 = 22
   \]
   \[
   22 = 22
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 5.
