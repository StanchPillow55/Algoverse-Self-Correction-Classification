Question ID: superglue_128
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify the task at hand. The problem statement is "Sample reasoning question 128," which is quite vague and doesn't provide specific details or numbers to work with. However, I will interpret this as a request to demonstrate a structured approach to solving a generic math problem, using logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations.

Since there is no specific math problem provided, I'll create a hypothetical problem to solve. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Calculate the sum of the first 128 positive integers.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:

\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

In this case, \( n = 128 \). Plugging this value into the formula, we get:

\[
S = \frac{128(128 + 1)}{2}
\]

First, calculate \( 128 + 1 \):

\[
128 + 1 = 129
\]

Next, multiply 128 by 129:

\[
128 \times 129 = 16512
\]

Now, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:

\[
S = \frac{16512}{2} = 8256
\]

Thus, the sum of the first 128 positive integers is 8256.

**Final Answer:** The sum of the first 128 positive integers is 8256.
