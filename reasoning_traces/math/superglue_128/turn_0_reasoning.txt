To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 128" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details or context, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem, assuming it involves basic arithmetic or algebra. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 128" is a math problem that involves solving a linear equation. Here is a step-by-step approach to solving a linear equation:

### Problem:
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is a linear equation where we need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to remove the constant term:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
