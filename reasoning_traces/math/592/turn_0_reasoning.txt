To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots from both platforms, including shipping.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost on Amazon.**

- Cost of boots on Amazon: $16
- Shipping cost on Amazon: $4

Total cost on Amazon:
\[
\text{Total cost on Amazon} = \text{Cost of boots} + \text{Shipping cost} = 16 + 4 = 20
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost on eBay.**

- Cost of boots on eBay: $13
- Shipping cost on eBay: twice the shipping cost on Amazon.

First, we calculate the shipping cost on eBay:
\[
\text{Shipping cost on eBay} = 2 \times \text{Shipping cost on Amazon} = 2 \times 4 = 8
\]

Now, we can find the total cost on eBay:
\[
\text{Total cost on eBay} = \text{Cost of boots} + \text{Shipping cost} = 13 + 8 = 21
\]

**Step 3: Compare the total costs.**

Now we will find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon:
\[
\text{Difference in cost} = \text{Total cost on eBay} - \text{Total cost on Amazon} = 21 - 20 = 1
\]

**Final Answer:**
The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay than on Amazon.
