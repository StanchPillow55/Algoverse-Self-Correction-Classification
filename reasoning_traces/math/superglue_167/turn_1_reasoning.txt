==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 167" might entail. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. Let's create a sample problem and solve it.

**Sample Problem 167:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels the first half of the distance at a speed of 60 miles per hour and the second half at a speed of 40 miles per hour. What is the average speed of the train for the entire trip?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The total distance from City A to City B is 300 miles.
   - The train travels the first 150 miles (half of 300 miles) at 60 mph.
   - The train travels the second 150 miles at 40 mph.
   - We need to find the average speed for the entire trip.

2. **Calculate the Time for Each Segment:**
   - **First Segment:**
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ mph}} = 2.5 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - **Second Segment:**
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ mph}} = 3.75 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Time for the Trip:**
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 2.5 \text{ hours} + 3.75 \text{ hours} = 6.25 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Average Speed:**
   - The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time.
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{6.25 \text{ hours}} = 48 \text{ mph}
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The average speed of the train for the entire trip is 48 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The average speed of the train for the entire trip is 48 mph.
