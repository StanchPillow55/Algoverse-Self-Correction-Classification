==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 167" might entail. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that involves reasoning and solving step-by-step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels the first half of the distance at a speed of 60 miles per hour and the second half at a speed of 40 miles per hour. What is the average speed of the train for the entire trip?

**Solution:**

To find the average speed of the train for the entire trip, we need to use the formula for average speed, which is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

1. **Calculate the distance for each half of the trip:**

   The total distance from City A to City B is 300 miles. Therefore, each half of the trip is:
   \[
   \text{Distance for each half} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken for each half of the trip:**

   - For the first half of the trip (150 miles at 60 mph):
     \[
     \text{Time for first half} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150}{60} = 2.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

   - For the second half of the trip (150 miles at 40 mph):
     \[
     \text{Time for second half} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150}{40} = 3.75 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time for the trip:**

   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time for first half} + \text{Time for second half} = 2.5 + 3.75 = 6.25 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the average speed for the entire trip:**

   \[
   \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{300}{6.25} = 48 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The average speed of the train for the entire trip is 48 miles per hour.
