To find out how much Scarlett spent in total, we will break down her purchases step by step.

1. **Cost of the aquarium**: 
   - Scarlett bought the aquarium for $10.00.

2. **Cost of the rocks**: 
   - She bought 2 bags of rocks, each costing $2.50.
   - Total cost for rocks = Number of bags × Cost per bag
   \[
   \text{Total cost for rocks} = 2 \times 2.50 = 5.00
   \]

3. **Cost of the coral**: 
   - She bought 3 pieces of coral, each costing $2.00.
   - Total cost for coral = Number of pieces × Cost per piece
   \[
   \text{Total cost for coral} = 3 \times 2.00 = 6.00
   \]

4. **Cost of the fish**: 
   - She bought 20 fish, each costing $0.50.
   - Total cost for fish = Number of fish × Cost per fish
   \[
   \text{Total cost for fish} = 20 \times 0.50 = 10.00
   \]

5. **Cost of the fish food**: 
   - The fish food cost $2.00.

Now, we will sum all these costs to find the total amount Scarlett spent:

- Total cost = Cost of aquarium + Cost of rocks + Cost of coral + Cost of fish + Cost of fish food
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10.00 + 5.00 + 6.00 + 10.00 + 2.00
\]

Now, we will calculate this step by step:

- First, add the cost of the aquarium and the rocks:
\[
10.00 + 5.00 = 15.00
\]

- Next, add the cost of the coral:
\[
15.00 + 6.00 = 21.00
\]

- Then, add the cost of the fish:
\[
21.00 + 10.00 = 31.00
\]

- Finally, add the cost of the fish food:
\[
31.00 + 2.00 = 33.00
\]

Thus, the total amount Scarlett spent is **$33.00**.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{33.00}
\]
