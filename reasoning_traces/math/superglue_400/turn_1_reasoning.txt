==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 400" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem using logical reasoning and calculations.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 400" is a typical math problem involving algebra. Here's a hypothetical problem and how we would solve it:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.
   - Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
     \]
     \[
     3x = 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
     \]
     \[
     x = 5
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     3(5) + 5 = 20
     \]
     \[
     15 + 5 = 20
     \]
     \[
     20 = 20
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is the correct solution.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This is a general approach to solving a basic algebraic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 400" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details or context, and I can adjust the solution accordingly.
