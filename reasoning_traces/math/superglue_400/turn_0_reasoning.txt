==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 400" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I will assume it is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company sells two products: Product A and Product B. The company sells Product A for $50 each and Product B for $30 each. In one week, the company sold a total of 400 products and made $16,000 in revenue. How many of each product did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Product A sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Product B sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of products sold is 400:
     \[
     x + y = 400
     \]
   - The total revenue from selling these products is $16,000:
     \[
     50x + 30y = 16,000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 400 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   50x + 30y &= 16,000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution or Elimination Method:**

   Let's use the substitution method. Solve Equation 1 for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 400 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 400 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   50x + 30(400 - x) = 16,000
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   50x + 12,000 - 30x = 16,000
   \]
   \[
   20x + 12,000 = 16,000
   \]
   \[
   20x = 4,000
   \]
   \[
   x = 200
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 200 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 400 - 200 = 200
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the total number of products:
   \[
   x + y = 200 + 200 = 400
   \]

   Check the total revenue:
   \[
   50x + 30y = 50(200) + 30(200) = 10,000 + 6,000 = 16,000
   \]

   Both conditions are satisfied.

**Final Answer:**

The company sold 200 units of Product A and 200 units of Product B.
