==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 400" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 400 widgets and made $24,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of widgets sold is 400:
     \[
     x + y = 400
     \]
   - The total revenue from selling these widgets is $24,000:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 24000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 400 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   50x + 70y &= 24000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution or Elimination Method:**

   Let's use the substitution method. Solve Equation 1 for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 400 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 400 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   50x + 70(400 - x) = 24000
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   50x + 28000 - 70x = 24000
   \]
   \[
   -20x + 28000 = 24000
   \]
   \[
   -20x = 24000 - 28000
   \]
   \[
   -20x = -4000
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{-4000}{-20}
   \]
   \[
   x = 200
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 200 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 400 - 200
   \]
   \[
   y = 200
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check if these values satisfy both original equations:
   - For Equation 1: \( x + y = 200 + 200 = 400 \) (Correct)
   - For Equation 2: \( 50(200) + 70(200) = 10000 + 14000 = 24000 \) (Correct)

Both equations are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The company sold 200 Type A widgets and 200 Type B widgets.
