It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. However, I will assume you want me to solve a math problem involving the number 50. Let's consider a problem involving basic arithmetic operations with the number 50. Here's a possible problem:

**Problem:**  
Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 2 to 50, inclusive.

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the even numbers in the sequence from 2 to 50. The even numbers in this range form an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the last term \( a_n = 50 \). The common difference \( d \) between consecutive terms is 2.

**Step 1: Determine the number of terms in the sequence.**

The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:

\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
\]

We know \( a_n = 50 \), \( a_1 = 2 \), and \( d = 2 \). Plug these values into the formula to find \( n \):

\[
50 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
\]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[
48 = (n-1) \cdot 2
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
24 = n-1
\]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[
n = 25
\]

So, there are 25 terms in the sequence.

**Step 2: Calculate the sum of the sequence.**

The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:

\[
S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
\]

Substitute the known values into the formula:

\[
S_{25} = \frac{25}{2} \cdot (2 + 50)
\]

Calculate inside the parentheses:

\[
S_{25} = \frac{25}{2} \cdot 52
\]

Multiply:

\[
S_{25} = 25 \cdot 26
\]

Calculate the product:

\[
S_{25} = 650
\]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers from 2 to 50 is 650.
