Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 50," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 50" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. It could refer to a variety of mathematical concepts or types of problems, such as arithmetic, algebra, geometry, calculus, etc.

Since the problem is not explicitly defined, I'll demonstrate a step-by-step approach to solving a generic math problem involving the number 50. Let's assume the problem is to find the sum of all integers from 1 to 50.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of all integers from 1 to 50. This is a classic arithmetic series problem.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the last number in the series.

3. **Apply the Formula:**
   In this case, \( n = 50 \). Plugging this into the formula gives:
   \[
   S = \frac{50 \times (50 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   \[
   S = \frac{50 \times 51}{2}
   \]
   \[
   S = \frac{2550}{2}
   \]
   \[
   S = 1275
   \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure the calculation is correct, let's verify by breaking it down:
   - Calculate \( 50 \times 51 = 2550 \)
   - Divide 2550 by 2 to get 1275

6. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of all integers from 1 to 50 is 1275.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all integers from 1 to 50 is 1275.

If the original problem intended something different, please provide additional details or context so that I can address the specific question accurately.
