Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 50," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 50" is not a clear mathematical question or problem. It seems to be a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that might be found in a textbook or a set of problems.

Since there is no specific mathematical problem provided, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where "Sample math problem 50" refers to a typical math problem. For the sake of illustration, let's assume it is a basic algebra problem:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   Subtract 3 from both sides:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If "Sample math problem 50" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context of the problem for an accurate solution.
