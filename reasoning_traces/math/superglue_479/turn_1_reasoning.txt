==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 479" entails. Since there is no specific math problem provided here, let's assume a hypothetical math problem that involves reasoning and calculations. I will create a problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. Last month, the company produced a total of 1,000 widgets and made a total revenue of $12,000. How many of each type of widget did the company produce?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of widgets produced is 1,000:
     \[
     x + y = 1000
     \]
   - The total revenue from selling the widgets is $12,000. The revenue from Type A is \( 10x \) and from Type B is \( 15y \):
     \[
     10x + 15y = 12000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system:
     \[
     \begin{cases} 
     x + y = 1000 \\
     10x + 15y = 12000 
     \end{cases}
     \]

   - Solve the first equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 1000 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 1000 - x \) into the second equation:
     \[
     10x + 15(1000 - x) = 12000
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     10x + 15000 - 15x = 12000
     \]
     \[
     -5x + 15000 = 12000
     \]
     \[
     -5x = 12000 - 15000
     \]
     \[
     -5x = -3000
     \]
     \[
     x = 600
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 600 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 1000 - 600 = 400
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of widgets:
     \[
     x + y = 600 + 400 = 1000
     \]
   - Check the total revenue:
     \[
     10x + 15y = 10(600) + 15(400) = 6000 + 6000 = 12000
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The company produced 600 Type A widgets and 400 Type B widgets.
