==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many apples Harry has based on the information given about Tim and Martha.

1. **Identify the number of apples Martha has:**
   - Martha has 68 apples.

2. **Determine the number of apples Tim has:**
   - According to the problem, Tim has 30 fewer apples than Martha. We can express this relationship mathematically:
     \[
     \text{Tim's apples} = \text{Martha's apples} - 30
     \]
   - Substituting the number of apples Martha has:
     \[
     \text{Tim's apples} = 68 - 30
     \]
   - Now, perform the subtraction:
     \[
     \text{Tim's apples} = 38
     \]

3. **Determine the number of apples Harry has:**
   - The problem states that Harry has half as many apples as Tim. We can express this relationship as:
     \[
     \text{Harry's apples} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Tim's apples}
     \]
   - Substituting the number of apples Tim has:
     \[
     \text{Harry's apples} = \frac{1}{2} \times 38
     \]
   - Now, perform the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Harry's apples} = 19
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Harry has 19 apples.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{19}
\]
