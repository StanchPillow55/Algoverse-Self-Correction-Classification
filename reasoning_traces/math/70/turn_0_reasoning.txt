Question ID: 70
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by figuring out how many apples Tim has. 

According to the problem, Tim has 30 less apples than Martha. Since Martha has 68 apples, we can subtract 30 from 68 to find out how many apples Tim has. 

68 - 30 = 38

So, Tim has 38 apples.

The problem also tells us that Harry has half as many apples as Tim. To find out how many apples Harry has, we can divide the number of apples Tim has by 2.

38 รท 2 = 19

So, Harry has 19 apples.

Therefore, the final answer is that Harry has 19 apples.
