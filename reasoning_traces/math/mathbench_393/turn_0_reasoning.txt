==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 393" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't provided, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 393:**

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to find the length and width of the rectangle. Let's denote the width of the rectangle as \( w \) and the length as \( l \).

According to the problem, the length is 3 times the width. Therefore, we can express the length in terms of the width as:
\[ l = 3w \]

The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2l + 2w \]

We know the perimeter is 48 units, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 2l + 2w = 48 \]

Substitute the expression for \( l \) from the first equation into the perimeter equation:
\[ 2(3w) + 2w = 48 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 6w + 2w = 48 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 8w = 48 \]

Solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides by 8:
\[ w = \frac{48}{8} \]
\[ w = 6 \]

Now that we have the width, we can find the length using the expression \( l = 3w \):
\[ l = 3 \times 6 \]
\[ l = 18 \]

Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width: 6 units
- Length: 18 units

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are 6 units by 18 units.
