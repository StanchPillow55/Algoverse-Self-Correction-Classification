Question ID: 22
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step and use algebra to find the solution.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of letters in Bobbie's last name.
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of letters in Samantha's last name.
   - Let \( J \) represent the number of letters in Jamie's last name.

2. **Information from the Problem:**
   - Jamie's full name is "Jamie Grey," so Jamie's last name, "Grey," has 4 letters. Therefore, \( J = 4 \).

3. **Translate the Problem into Equations:**
   - According to the problem, Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     S = B - 3
     \]
   - The problem also states that if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     B - 2 = 2 \times J
     \]

4. **Solve the Equations:**
   - Substitute \( J = 4 \) into the second equation:
     \[
     B - 2 = 2 \times 4
     \]
     \[
     B - 2 = 8
     \]
   - Solve for \( B \):
     \[
     B = 8 + 2 = 10
     \]

5. **Find the Number of Letters in Samantha's Last Name:**
   - Substitute \( B = 10 \) into the equation for \( S \):
     \[
     S = B - 3
     \]
     \[
     S = 10 - 3 = 7
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The number of letters in Samantha’s last name is 7.

Therefore, the final answer is that Samantha's last name has **7 letters**.
