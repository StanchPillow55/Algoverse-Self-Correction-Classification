Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of letters in Samantha's last name based on the information given about Bobbie's and Jamie's last names.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Jamie's Last Name Length:**
   - Jamie's full name is "Jamie Grey."
   - The last name "Grey" has 4 letters.

2. **Relate Bobbie's Last Name to Jamie's:**
   - We are told that if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s.
   - Jamie's last name has 4 letters, so twice the length of Jamie's last name is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) letters.
   - Therefore, if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, it would have 8 letters.
   - Let \(B\) represent the number of letters in Bobbie's last name. According to the problem, \(B - 2 = 8\).

3. **Solve for Bobbie's Last Name Length:**
   - From the equation \(B - 2 = 8\), we can solve for \(B\):
     \[
     B - 2 = 8 \\
     B = 8 + 2 \\
     B = 10
     \]
   - Bobbie's last name has 10 letters.

4. **Relate Samantha's Last Name to Bobbie's:**
   - Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name.
   - If Bobbie's last name has 10 letters, then Samantha's last name has \(10 - 3 = 7\) letters.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Samantha's last name has 7 letters.

Therefore, the number of letters in Samantha's last name is \(\boxed{7}\).
