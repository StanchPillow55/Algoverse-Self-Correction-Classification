==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the lengths of the last names:**
   - Let \( S \) be the number of letters in Samantha's last name.
   - Let \( B \) be the number of letters in Bobbie's last name.
   - Let \( J \) be the number of letters in Jamie's last name.

2. **Establish relationships based on the problem statement:**
   - According to the problem, Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name:
     \[
     S = B - 3
     \]
   - The problem also states that if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s:
     \[
     B - 2 = 2J
     \]

3. **Determine the length of Jamie's last name:**
   - Jamie's full name is Jamie Grey. The last name "Grey" has 4 letters:
     \[
     J = 4
     \]

4. **Substitute \( J \) into the equation for Bobbie's last name:**
   - Now we substitute \( J = 4 \) into the equation \( B - 2 = 2J \):
     \[
     B - 2 = 2 \times 4
     \]
     \[
     B - 2 = 8
     \]
     \[
     B = 8 + 2
     \]
     \[
     B = 10
     \]

5. **Now substitute \( B \) back into the equation for Samantha's last name:**
   - We have \( B = 10 \), so we substitute this value into the equation \( S = B - 3 \):
     \[
     S = 10 - 3
     \]
     \[
     S = 7
     \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - The number of letters in Samantha's last name is \( \boxed{7} \).
