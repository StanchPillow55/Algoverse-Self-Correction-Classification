==================================================

Let's denote the number of letters in Bobbie's last name as B, Samantha's last name as S, and Jamie's last name as J.

From the problem, we know that:

1. Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. This can be written as S = B - 3.

2. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. This can be written as B - 2 = 2J.

We also know that Jamie's last name, Grey, has 4 letters. So, J = 4.

Substituting J = 4 into the second equation gives us B - 2 = 2*4, or B = 2*4 + 2 = 10.

Finally, substituting B = 10 into the first equation gives us S = 10 - 3 = 7.

So, Samantha’s last name has 7 letters.
