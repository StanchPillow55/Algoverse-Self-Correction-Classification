To solve the problem, we need to determine the speed of the fastest car based on the information provided about the second fastest car and the average car.

1. **Identify the speed of the average car:**
   The average car can go 120 miles per hour (mph).

2. **Calculate the speed of the second fastest car:**
   According to the problem, the second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, we can calculate its speed as follows:
   \[
   \text{Speed of the second fastest car} = 5 \times \text{Speed of the average car}
   \]
   Substituting the speed of the average car:
   \[
   \text{Speed of the second fastest car} = 5 \times 120 \text{ mph} = 600 \text{ mph}
   \]

3. **Calculate the speed of the fastest car:**
   The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car. We can calculate its speed as follows:
   \[
   \text{Speed of the fastest car} = 1.25 \times \text{Speed of the second fastest car}
   \]
   Substituting the speed of the second fastest car:
   \[
   \text{Speed of the fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 \text{ mph}
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   \text{Speed of the fastest car} = 750 \text{ mph}
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   The speed of the fastest car is \( \boxed{750} \) miles per hour.
