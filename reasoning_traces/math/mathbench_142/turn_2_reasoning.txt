==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 142" refers to. Since I don't have the specific details of this problem, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 142" is the following:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation.

   - Start with the equation: 
     \[
     3x + 5 = 20
     \]

   - Subtract 5 from both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
     \[
     3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
     \]
     Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     3x = 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This is how you would approach solving a linear equation step by step, ensuring each operation is justified and the solution is verified. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 142," please provide the details so I can assist you accordingly.
