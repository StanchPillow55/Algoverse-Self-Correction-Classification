==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 281" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving math problems using a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 281" involves solving a mathematical equation or problem.

### Hypothetical Problem:
Let's assume the problem is to solve the quadratic equation: \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the coefficients:**
   - Assume \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = 2 \). So the equation becomes:
     \[
     x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0
     \]

2. **Check if the equation can be factored:**
   - Look for two numbers that multiply to \( ac = 1 \times 2 = 2 \) and add to \( b = -3 \).
   - The numbers \(-1\) and \(-2\) satisfy these conditions because:
     \[
     (-1) \times (-2) = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad (-1) + (-2) = -3
     \]

3. **Factor the quadratic equation:**
   - Rewrite the equation using the numbers found:
     \[
     x^2 - 3x + 2 = (x - 1)(x - 2) = 0
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Set each factor equal to zero:
     \[
     x - 1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 1
     \]
     \[
     x - 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 2
     \]

5. **Verify the solutions:**
   - Substitute \( x = 1 \) back into the original equation:
     \[
     (1)^2 - 3(1) + 2 = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0
     \]
   - Substitute \( x = 2 \) back into the original equation:
     \[
     (2)^2 - 3(2) + 2 = 4 - 6 + 2 = 0
     \]
   - Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

### Final Answer:
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0 \) are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 2 \).

This example demonstrates a structured approach to solving a quadratic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 281" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
