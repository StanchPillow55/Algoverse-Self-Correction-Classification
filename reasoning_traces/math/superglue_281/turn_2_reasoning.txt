==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 281" might entail. Since the question itself is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a structured approach to solving a generic math problem, which can be adapted to various types of questions. 

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine the information given.
   - Recognize any constraints or conditions.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Choose an appropriate strategy to solve the problem. This could involve algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, using a formula, etc.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution meets all the conditions of the problem.
   - Check calculations for accuracy.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm the result.

### Example Problem:

**Problem Statement:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- Isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation using algebraic operations.

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
- Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check the Solution
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- Since the left side equals the right side, the solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This structured approach can be applied to a wide range of mathematical problems, ensuring clarity and accuracy in finding solutions. If you have a specific problem or context for "Sample reasoning question 281," please provide more details for a tailored solution.
