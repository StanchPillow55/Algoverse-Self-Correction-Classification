==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 244," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that we can solve. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 244.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2. 
   - The smallest even number greater than 1 is 2.
   - The largest even number less than or equal to 244 is 244.

2. **List the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers between 1 and 244 is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 244.

3. **Determine the Number of Terms:**
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the last term \( a_n = 244 \), with a common difference \( d = 2 \).
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Setting \( a_n = 244 \), we solve for \( n \):
     \[
     244 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     244 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     244 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{244}{2} = 122
     \]
   - There are 122 even numbers between 1 and 244.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{122} = \frac{122}{2} \cdot (2 + 244)
     \]
     \[
     S_{122} = 61 \cdot 246
     \]

5. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - Calculate \( 61 \times 246 \):
     \[
     61 \times 246 = 61 \times (240 + 6)
     \]
     \[
     = 61 \times 240 + 61 \times 6
     \]
     \[
     = (61 \times 24 \times 10) + (61 \times 6)
     \]
     \[
     = (1464 \times 10) + 366
     \]
     \[
     = 14640 + 366
     \]
     \[
     = 15006
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 244 is 15,006.
