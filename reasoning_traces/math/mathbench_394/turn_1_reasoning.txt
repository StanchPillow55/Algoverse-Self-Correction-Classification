==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 394," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 394" is not a specific math problem, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step 1: Understand the problem.**

We are given:
- The length (L) of the rectangle is 3 times the width (W).
- The perimeter (P) of the rectangle is 48 units.

We need to find the dimensions of the rectangle, i.e., the length and the width.

**Step 2: Set up equations based on the problem.**

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2L + 2W \]

Substitute the given perimeter:
\[ 48 = 2L + 2W \]

We also know that the length is 3 times the width:
\[ L = 3W \]

**Step 3: Substitute and solve the equations.**

Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter equation:
\[ 48 = 2(3W) + 2W \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 48 = 6W + 2W \]
\[ 48 = 8W \]

Solve for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{48}{8} \]
\[ W = 6 \]

Now that we have the width, we can find the length using \( L = 3W \):
\[ L = 3 \times 6 \]
\[ L = 18 \]

**Step 4: Verify the solution.**

Check if the perimeter is correct with these dimensions:
\[ P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) \]
\[ P = 36 + 12 \]
\[ P = 48 \]

The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, so our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 6 units
- Length = 18 units
