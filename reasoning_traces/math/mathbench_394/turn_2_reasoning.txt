==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 394," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**

The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

- Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[
2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x = 8
\]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**

Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 4
\]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:

Original equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)

Substitute \( x = 4 \):

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]

Calculate the left side:

\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
