==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 462" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 462:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 15 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

   Start by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides of the equation to get the terms involving \( x \) on one side:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 15 - 2x
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x + 5 = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Next, subtract 5 from both sides to isolate \( x \):

   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 10
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 10 \) back into the original equation to verify:

   \[
   3(10) + 5 = 2(10) + 15
   \]

   Calculate both sides:

   \[
   30 + 5 = 20 + 15
   \]

   \[
   35 = 35
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 10 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 10 \).
