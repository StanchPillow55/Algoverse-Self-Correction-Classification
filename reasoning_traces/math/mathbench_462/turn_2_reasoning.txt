==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 462," I first need to understand the specific details and requirements of the problem. Since the problem statement is not provided in your message, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume the sample math problem 462 is as follows:

**Sample Math Problem 462:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the dimensions (length and width) of a rectangle.
   - The length is 3 times the width.
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( l \) is \( 3w \).

3. **Use the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substitute the known values into the formula:
     \[
     48 = 2 \times (3w + w)
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     48 = 2 \times (4w)
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     48 = 8w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides by 8:
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length \( l \) is 3 times the width:
     \[
     l = 3w = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (18 + 6) = 2 \times 24 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 6 units
- Length = 18 units

This completes the solution to the sample math problem 462. If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample math problem 462," please provide the details so I can solve it accordingly.
