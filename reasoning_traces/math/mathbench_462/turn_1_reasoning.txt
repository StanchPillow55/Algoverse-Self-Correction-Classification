==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 462" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll assume a typical math problem scenario and solve it step by step. Let's consider a hypothetical math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**

The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. **Subtract 5 from both sides**: This will help eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation.
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 3**: This will solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

**Step 3: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

Original equation:
\[
3x + 5 = 20
\]

Substitute \( x = 5 \):
\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]

Calculate the left side:
\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
