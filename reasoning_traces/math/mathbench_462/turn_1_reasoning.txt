Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 462," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 462" is not specific enough for us to determine what the problem is about. It could be related to arithmetic, algebra, geometry, calculus, or any other area of mathematics.

Since the problem is not clearly defined, let's assume a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes. Let's say the problem is as follows:

**Problem 462:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

Now, let's solve this problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Equation
The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

### Step 2: Isolate the Variable
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides** to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2** to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

### Step 3: Verify the Solution
To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
Calculating the left side:
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
