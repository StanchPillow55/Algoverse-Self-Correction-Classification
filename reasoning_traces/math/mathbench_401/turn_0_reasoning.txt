==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample math problem 401." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to solve it for you.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Solve the equation \(2x + 3 = 11\).

**Step 1: Understand the problem.**
We need to find the value of \(x\) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the variable.**
To solve for \(x\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[
2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
\]
\[
2x = 8
\]

**Step 3: Solve for the variable.**
Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(x\):
\[
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
\]
\[
x = 4
\]

**Step 4: Verify the solution.**
Substitute \(x = 4\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
\[
11 = 11
\]
The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \(2x + 3 = 11\) is \(x = 4\).
