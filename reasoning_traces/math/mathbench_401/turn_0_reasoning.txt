Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 401" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem description, I'll assume it might be a placeholder for a specific type of math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 401 positive integers."

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

Where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms. In this case, \( n = 401 \).

**Step-by-step Calculation:**

1. **Identify \( n \):**  
   The number of terms \( n = 401 \).

2. **Apply the formula:**  
   Substitute \( n = 401 \) into the formula:

   \[
   S = \frac{401 \times (401 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate inside the parentheses:**  
   \( 401 + 1 = 402 \).

4. **Multiply 401 by 402:**  
   \[
   401 \times 402 = 161,202
   \]

5. **Divide by 2 to find the sum:**  
   \[
   S = \frac{161,202}{2} = 80,601
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 401 positive integers is \( 80,601 \).

This completes the solution to the hypothetical problem based on the description "Sample math problem 401." If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details, and I can solve that particular problem for you.
