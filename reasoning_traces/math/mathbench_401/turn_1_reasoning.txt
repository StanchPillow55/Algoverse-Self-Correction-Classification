Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 401," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 401" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem 401:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we find:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
