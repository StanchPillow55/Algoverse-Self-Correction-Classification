==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample math problem 401." Since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem by walking through a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem involves solving a quadratic equation:

**Problem:** Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**

A quadratic equation is generally in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). Here, the coefficients are:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula.**

The quadratic formula is given by:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the discriminant.**

The discriminant (\(D\)) is the part under the square root in the quadratic formula: \(b^2 - 4ac\).

\[
D = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
\]

**Step 4: Determine the roots using the quadratic formula.**

Since the discriminant is positive (\(D = 64\)), there are two distinct real roots.

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

Calculate the two possible values for \(x\):

1. \(x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3\)

2. \(x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1\)

**Step 5: Verify the solution.**

Substitute \(x_1 = 3\) back into the original equation to verify:

\[
2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
\]

Substitute \(x_2 = -1\) back into the original equation to verify:

\[
2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
\]

Both values satisfy the original equation.

**Final Answer:**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
