==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 201," we need to first understand what the question is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete and lacks specific details or numerical information. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a hypothetical question and solving it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of products: A and B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 150 units of product B per day. The profit from each unit of product A is $5, and the profit from each unit of product B is $3. The company wants to maximize its profit. How many units of each product should the company produce daily to achieve maximum profit, assuming the production capacity is fully utilized?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced per day.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced per day.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The objective is to maximize the total profit, \( P \).
   - Profit from product A = \( 5x \).
   - Profit from product B = \( 3y \).
   - Total profit, \( P = 5x + 3y \).

3. **Constraints:**
   - The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A: \( x \leq 100 \).
   - The company can produce a maximum of 150 units of product B: \( y \leq 150 \).
   - The production capacity must be fully utilized: \( x + y = 250 \).

4. **Set Up the System of Inequalities:**
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x & \leq 100, \\
   y & \leq 150, \\
   x + y & = 250.
   \end{align*}
   \]

5. **Solve the System:**
   - From the equation \( x + y = 250 \), express \( y \) in terms of \( x \): \( y = 250 - x \).
   - Substitute \( y = 250 - x \) into the constraints:
     - \( x \leq 100 \)
     - \( 250 - x \leq 150 \)

6. **Simplify the Inequality:**
   - \( 250 - x \leq 150 \) simplifies to \( x \geq 100 \).

7. **Determine the Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible values for \( x \) are between 100 and 100, inclusive, due to the constraints \( x \leq 100 \) and \( x \geq 100 \).
   - Therefore, \( x = 100 \).
   - Substitute \( x = 100 \) into \( y = 250 - x \) to find \( y \):
     \[
     y = 250 - 100 = 150.
     \]

8. **Calculate the Maximum Profit:**
   - Substitute \( x = 100 \) and \( y = 150 \) into the profit equation:
     \[
     P = 5(100) + 3(150) = 500 + 450 = 950.
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 100 units of product A and 150 units of product B daily to achieve a maximum profit of $950.
