==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific details about "Sample reasoning question 201." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**  
We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**  
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**  
Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**  
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

Calculate the left side:
\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**  
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide the details, and I'll be glad to help!
