==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 201," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete or unclear. Without specific details or a clear question, it's challenging to provide a precise solution. 

Let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 201" refers to a typical math problem that involves logical reasoning or numerical calculations. Since we don't have the exact details, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math reasoning problem by solving a sample problem.

**Sample Problem:**
Suppose you are given a sequence of numbers: 2, 4, 8, 16, ... and you are asked to find the 10th term in the sequence.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - Look at the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
   - Notice that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2.
   - This is a geometric sequence where each term is twice the previous term.

2. **General Formula for the Sequence:**
   - In a geometric sequence, the \( n \)-th term can be found using the formula:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 \times r^{(n-1)}
     \]
     where \( a_1 \) is the first term and \( r \) is the common ratio.
   - Here, \( a_1 = 2 \) and \( r = 2 \).

3. **Calculate the 10th Term:**
   - Plug the values into the formula to find the 10th term:
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 2^{(10-1)}
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 2^9
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 512
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 1024
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The 10th term in the sequence is 1024.

**Final Answer:**
The 10th term in the sequence is 1024.
