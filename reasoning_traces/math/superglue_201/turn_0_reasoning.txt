5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present your final answer.
   - Ensure it is in the correct form and answers the question posed.

### Example Problem and Solution

**Example Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - The length \( L \) is twice the width \( W \).
   - The perimeter \( P \) is 36 units.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2L + 2W \).
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( W \):
     \[
     36 = 4W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6W
     \]
     \[
     W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find \( L \) using \( L = 2W \):
     \[
     L = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are consistent with the given perimeter.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the rectangle are: Length = 12 units, Width = 6 units.
