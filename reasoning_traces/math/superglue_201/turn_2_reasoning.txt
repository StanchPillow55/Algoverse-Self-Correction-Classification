==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 201" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the field is 400 meters, what are the dimensions of the field?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field.
   - Let the width of the field be \( w \) meters.
   - The length of the field is 3 times the width, so the length is \( 3w \) meters.
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
     \]
   - We are given that the perimeter is 400 meters.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute the expressions for length and width into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     2 \times (3w + w) = 400
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms inside the parentheses:
     \[
     2 \times 4w = 400
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     8w = 400
     \]

4. **Solve for \( w \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 8 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{400}{8} = 50
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length is 3 times the width:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 3w = 3 \times 50 = 150
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the calculated dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (150 + 50) = 2 \times 200 = 400
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the field are 50 meters in width and 150 meters in length.
