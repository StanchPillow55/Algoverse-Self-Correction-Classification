==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, given that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in that same time frame.

1. **Calculate Sofie's total distance walked in 7 days:**
   - Sofie walks 10 miles every day.
   - In 7 days, the total distance Sofie walks is:
     \[
     \text{Total distance Sofie} = \text{Daily distance} \times \text{Number of days} = 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Relate Sofie's distance to Brian's distance:**
   - According to the problem, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days. We can express this relationship mathematically:
     \[
     \text{Total distance Sofie} = 2 \times \text{Total distance Brian}
     \]
   - We already calculated that Sofie walks 70 miles, so we can set up the equation:
     \[
     70 \text{ miles} = 2 \times \text{Total distance Brian}
     \]

3. **Solve for Brian's total distance:**
   - To find the total distance Brian walks, we can rearrange the equation:
     \[
     \text{Total distance Brian} = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, the total distance that Brian will walk in 7 days is 35 miles.

Final answer:
\[
\text{Brian will walk } 35 \text{ miles in seven days.}
\]
