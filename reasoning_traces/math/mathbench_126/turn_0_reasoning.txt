==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 126," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 126" does not provide enough information about the problem itself. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that might be detailed elsewhere.

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample math problem 126," I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 126 positive integers.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 126 positive integers. This is a common problem that can be solved using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this problem, \( n = 126 \). Substitute 126 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{126(126 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate Inside the Parentheses:**
   First, calculate \( 126 + 1 \):
   \[
   126 + 1 = 127
   \]

5. **Multiply the Terms:**
   Next, multiply 126 by 127:
   \[
   126 \times 127 = 16002
   \]

6. **Divide by 2:**
   Finally, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S = \frac{16002}{2} = 8001
   \]

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   The sum of the first 126 positive integers is 8001.

Therefore, the final answer to the sample problem is 8001.
