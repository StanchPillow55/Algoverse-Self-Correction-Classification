==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 126" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly provided, I'll assume a generic math problem involving the number 126. Let's consider a problem involving the factors of 126, which is a common type of math problem.

**Problem:** Find all the factors of 126 and determine if 126 is a perfect square.

**Step 1: Find the prime factorization of 126.**

To find the factors of 126, we first need its prime factorization.

1. Start by dividing 126 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
   \[
   126 \div 2 = 63
   \]
   So, 2 is a factor, and we have \(126 = 2 \times 63\).

2. Next, factor 63. Since 63 is odd, it is not divisible by 2. Try the next smallest prime number, which is 3:
   \[
   63 \div 3 = 21
   \]
   So, 3 is a factor, and we have \(63 = 3 \times 21\).

3. Now, factor 21. Again, 21 is not divisible by 2, but it is divisible by 3:
   \[
   21 \div 3 = 7
   \]
   So, 3 is a factor, and we have \(21 = 3 \times 7\).

4. Finally, 7 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 126 is:
\[
126 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 7
\]

**Step 2: List all factors of 126.**

To find all factors, consider all combinations of the prime factors:

- \(1\) (since 1 is a factor of every number)
- \(2\)
- \(3\)
- \(3^2 = 9\)
- \(7\)
- \(2 \times 3 = 6\)
- \(2 \times 3^2 = 18\)
- \(2 \times 7 = 14\)
- \(3 \times 7 = 21\)
- \(3^2 \times 7 = 63\)
- \(2 \times 3 \times 7 = 42\)
- \(2 \times 3^2 \times 7 = 126\)

Thus, the factors of 126 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 14, 18, 21, 42, 63, and 126.

**Step 3: Determine if 126 is a perfect square.**

A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For 126 to be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even.

The prime factorization of 126 is \(2^1 \times 3^2 \times 7^1\). The exponents are 1, 2, and 1. Since not all exponents are even, 126 is not a perfect square.

**Final Answer:**

The factors of 126 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 14, 18, 21, 42, 63, and 126. The number 126 is not a perfect square.
