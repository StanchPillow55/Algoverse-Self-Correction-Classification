Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 126" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem involving the number 126. Let's consider a few possibilities and solve them:

### Problem 1: Factorization
**Problem:** Find the prime factorization of 126.

**Solution:**
1. Start by dividing 126 by the smallest prime number, 2.
   \[
   126 \div 2 = 63
   \]
   So, 126 = 2 × 63.

2. Next, factor 63. The smallest prime number that divides 63 is 3.
   \[
   63 \div 3 = 21
   \]
   So, 63 = 3 × 21.

3. Now, factor 21. Again, the smallest prime number that divides 21 is 3.
   \[
   21 \div 3 = 7
   \]
   So, 21 = 3 × 7.

4. Finally, 7 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 126 is:
\[
126 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 7
\]

### Problem 2: Divisibility
**Problem:** Determine if 126 is divisible by 9.

**Solution:**
A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.

1. Find the sum of the digits of 126:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 6 = 9
   \]

2. Since 9 is divisible by 9, 126 is also divisible by 9.

### Problem 3: Arithmetic Sequence
**Problem:** If 126 is the 10th term of an arithmetic sequence, and the first term is 6, find the common difference.

**Solution:**
The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
\]
where \(a_n\) is the nth term, \(a_1\) is the first term, \(n\) is the term number, and \(d\) is the common difference.

Given:
- \(a_{10} = 126\)
- \(a_1 = 6\)
- \(n = 10\)

Substitute the known values into the formula:
\[
126 = 6 + (10-1) \cdot d
\]
\[
126 = 6 + 9d
\]
Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[
120 = 9d
\]
Divide both sides by 9:
\[
d = \frac{120}{9} = \frac{40}{3}
\]

The common difference is \(\frac{40}{3}\).

### Final Answer
Since the original problem was not specified, we explored different mathematical aspects involving the number 126. Here are the final answers for each scenario:

1. Prime factorization of 126: \(2 \times 3^2 \times 7\).
2. 126 is divisible by 9.
3. The common difference in the arithmetic sequence is \(\frac{40}{3}\).
