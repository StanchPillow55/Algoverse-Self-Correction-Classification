==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 126," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 126" without any specific details or context. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 126."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers between 1 and 126 are numbers divisible by 2.
   - The sequence of even numbers between 1 and 126 is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 126.

2. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the last term \( a_n = 126 \).
   - The common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms:**
   - Use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plug in the values to find \( n \):
     \[
     126 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     126 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     126 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{126}{2} = 63
     \]
   - There are 63 even numbers between 1 and 126.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - Use the formula for the sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Plug in the values:
     \[
     S_{63} = \frac{63}{2} \cdot (2 + 126)
     \]
     \[
     S_{63} = \frac{63}{2} \cdot 128
     \]
     \[
     S_{63} = 63 \cdot 64
     \]
     \[
     S_{63} = 4032
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 126 is 4032.
