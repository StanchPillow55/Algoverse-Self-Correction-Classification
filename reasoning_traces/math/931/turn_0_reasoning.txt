To solve the problem, we need to define the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- Peter's age as \( P \)
- Paul's age as \( A \)
- Jean's age as \( J \)

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions we have into the equations.

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
P + 2J + 10 = 100
\]
Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[
P + 2J = 90
\]
Now we have our first equation:
\[
P = 90 - 2J \quad \text{(1)}
\]

Next, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
P = 2J + 10 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( P = 90 - 2J \)
2. \( P = 2J + 10 \)

Since both equations equal \( P \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[
90 - 2J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, solve for \( J \):
1. Add \( 2J \) to both sides:
   \[
   90 = 4J + 10
   \]
2. Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   80 = 4J
   \]
3. Divide by 4:
   \[
   J = 20
   \]

Now that we have Jean's age, we can find Paul's age using the second equation:
\[
A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

Finally, we can find Peter's age using either equation for \( P \). We'll use equation (2):
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, Peter's age is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]

To verify:
- Jean's age \( J = 20 \)
- Paul's age \( A = 30 \)
- Peter's age \( P = 50 \)

Check the combined age:
\[
P + A + J = 50 + 30 + 20 = 100 \quad \text{(correct)}
\]

Check the conditions:
- Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( 30 = 20 + 10 \quad \text{(correct)} \)
- Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages: \( 50 = 30 + 20 \quad \text{(correct)} \)

Thus, the final answer is confirmed:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]
