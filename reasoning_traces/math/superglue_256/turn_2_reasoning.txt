Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 256" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not clear or specific, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Calculate the sum of the first 256 positive integers.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) integers.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify \( n \):** In this problem, \( n = 256 \).

2. **Apply the formula:**

   \[
   S_{256} = \frac{256(256 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( 256 + 1 \):**

   \[
   256 + 1 = 257
   \]

4. **Substitute back into the formula:**

   \[
   S_{256} = \frac{256 \times 257}{2}
   \]

5. **Calculate \( 256 \times 257 \):**

   To multiply these numbers, we can use the distributive property:

   \[
   256 \times 257 = 256 \times (256 + 1) = 256 \times 256 + 256 \times 1
   \]

   First, calculate \( 256 \times 256 \):

   \[
   256 \times 256 = 65536
   \]

   Then, calculate \( 256 \times 1 \):

   \[
   256 \times 1 = 256
   \]

   Add these two results:

   \[
   65536 + 256 = 65792
   \]

6. **Divide by 2:**

   \[
   S_{256} = \frac{65792}{2} = 32896
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 256 positive integers is \( 32,896 \).

This completes the solution to the hypothetical problem. If "Sample reasoning question 256" refers to a different problem, please provide more details for a specific solution.
