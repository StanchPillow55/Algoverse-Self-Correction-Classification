==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 256" refers to. Since the question itself is not explicitly defined, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 256.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers between 1 and 256 are numbers like 2, 4, 6, ..., 256.
   - These numbers form an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

2. **Find the Number of Terms (n):**
   - The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - We need to find \( n \) such that \( a_n = 256 \).
     \[
     256 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     256 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     256 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{256}{2} = 128
     \]
   - So, there are 128 even numbers between 1 and 256.

3. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{128} = \frac{128}{2} \cdot (2 + 256)
     \]
     \[
     S_{128} = 64 \cdot 258
     \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - Calculate \( 64 \times 258 \):
     \[
     64 \times 258 = 64 \times (250 + 8) = 64 \times 250 + 64 \times 8
     \]
     \[
     64 \times 250 = 16000
     \]
     \[
     64 \times 8 = 512
     \]
     \[
     64 \times 258 = 16000 + 512 = 16512
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 256 is \( \boxed{16512} \).

This solution involves identifying the sequence, determining the number of terms, and using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence to find the final answer.
