To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 256" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem statement, I will assume it is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual content of "Sample reasoning question 256," I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 256" is the following math problem:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100, inclusive.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the even numbers between 1 and 100:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - The even numbers between 1 and 100 are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

2. **Determine the sequence of even numbers:**
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the number of terms in the sequence:**
   - The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - We need to find \( n \) such that \( a_n = 100 \):
     \[
     100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = 50
     \]
   - There are 50 even numbers between 1 and 100.

4. **Calculate the sum of the sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 2550
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100, inclusive, is 2550.
