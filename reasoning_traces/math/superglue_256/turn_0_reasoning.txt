==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what is being asked. However, the question "Sample reasoning question 256" is not specific enough to provide a detailed solution. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here.

To proceed, I'll assume that "Sample reasoning question 256" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"Calculate the sum of the first 256 positive integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 256 positive integers. The first positive integer is 1, and the 256th positive integer is 256.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this case, \( n = 256 \). Substitute 256 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{256(256 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate Inside the Parentheses:**
   First, calculate \( 256 + 1 \):
   \[
   256 + 1 = 257
   \]

5. **Multiply the Terms:**
   Next, multiply 256 by 257:
   \[
   256 \times 257 = 65792
   \]

6. **Divide by 2:**
   Finally, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S = \frac{65792}{2} = 32896
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 256 positive integers is 32,896.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 256 positive integers is 32,896.
