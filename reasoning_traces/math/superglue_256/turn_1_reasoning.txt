==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 256" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's consider a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 256 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 256 positive integers. The sequence of these integers is 1, 2, 3, ..., 256.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the last integer in the sequence.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 256 \). Substitute 256 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{256(256 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   First, calculate \( 256 + 1 \):
   \[
   256 + 1 = 257
   \]

   Next, multiply 256 by 257:
   \[
   256 \times 257 = 65792
   \]

   Finally, divide by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S = \frac{65792}{2} = 32896
   \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure the calculation is correct, let's verify by breaking it down:
   - Calculate \( 256 \times 257 \) using the distributive property:
     \[
     256 \times 257 = 256 \times (250 + 7) = 256 \times 250 + 256 \times 7
     \]
     \[
     256 \times 250 = 64000
     \]
     \[
     256 \times 7 = 1792
     \]
     \[
     64000 + 1792 = 65792
     \]

   - Divide 65792 by 2:
     \[
     65792 \div 2 = 32896
     \]

   The calculations are consistent and correct.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 256 positive integers is 32,896.
