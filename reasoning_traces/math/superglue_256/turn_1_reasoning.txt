==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 256" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear, let's assume it is a placeholder for a specific math problem. For the sake of this exercise, let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 256."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Range of Even Numbers:**
   - The even numbers between 1 and 256 start from 2 and go up to 256.
   - These numbers form an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the last term \( a_n = 256 \).

2. **Determine the Common Difference:**
   - The common difference \( d \) between consecutive even numbers is 2.

3. **Find the Number of Terms in the Sequence:**
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plugging in the known values:
     \[
     256 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     256 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     256 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{256}{2} = 128
     \]
   - There are 128 even numbers between 1 and 256.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{128} = \frac{128}{2} \cdot (2 + 256)
     \]
     \[
     S_{128} = 64 \cdot 258
     \]
   - Calculate \( 64 \times 258 \):
     \[
     64 \times 258 = 64 \times (250 + 8) = 64 \times 250 + 64 \times 8
     \]
     \[
     64 \times 250 = 16000
     \]
     \[
     64 \times 8 = 512
     \]
     \[
     64 \times 258 = 16000 + 512 = 16512
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 256 is \( \boxed{16512} \).

This completes the solution to the hypothetical problem. If "Sample reasoning question 256" refers to a different problem, please provide more details for an accurate solution.
