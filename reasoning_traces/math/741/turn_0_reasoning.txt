==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Birds**: Jeremy saw 12 birds in the backyard.

2. **Calculating the Number of Birds Scared Away**: 
   - Jeremy scared away \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 12 birds.
   - To find out how many birds were scared away, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of birds scared away} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
     \]

3. **Calculating the Remaining Birds**: 
   - After scaring away 4 birds, we need to find out how many birds are left:
     \[
     \text{Remaining birds} = 12 - 4 = 8
     \]

4. **Adding More Birds**: 
   - A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds.
   - We add these new birds to the remaining birds:
     \[
     \text{Total birds now} = 8 + 20 = 28
     \]

5. **Final Answer**: 
   - Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is:
     \[
     \boxed{28}
     \] 

This concludes the problem with all calculations and reasoning clearly shown. The final answer is 28 birds in the backyard.
