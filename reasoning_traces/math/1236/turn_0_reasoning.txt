==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of grapes Madeline ate**:
   - Madeline ate 6 grapes.

2. **Calculate the number of grapes her brother used**:
   - Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline.
   - Therefore, the number of grapes her brother used is:
     \[
     5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of grapes used so far**:
   - The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is:
     \[
     6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of grapes used for the pies**:
   - The recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie, and their mother made 4 pies.
   - Therefore, the total number of grapes used for the pies is:
     \[
     12 \times 4 = 48 \text{ grapes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of grapes at the beginning**:
   - To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother:
     \[
     \text{Total grapes} = \text{grapes used by Madeline} + \text{grapes used by brother} + \text{grapes used for pies}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we calculated:
     \[
     \text{Total grapes} = 6 + 30 + 48
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     6 + 30 = 36
     \]
     \[
     36 + 48 = 84
     \]

Thus, the total number of grapes at the beginning was **84 grapes**.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{84}
\]
