To determine how much money Derrick makes in June from selling doughnuts, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in a day.**
   - Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day.
   - Since 1 dozen equals 12, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts:
     \[
     10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts}
     \]

2. **Calculate the daily revenue from selling doughnuts.**
   - Each doughnut is sold for $2.
   - Therefore, the daily revenue can be calculated as:
     \[
     120 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 240 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of days in June.**
   - June has 30 days.

4. **Calculate the total revenue for the month of June.**
   - To find the total revenue for June, we multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in June:
     \[
     240 \text{ dollars/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June from selling all the doughnuts is:

\[
\boxed{7200} \text{ dollars}
\]
