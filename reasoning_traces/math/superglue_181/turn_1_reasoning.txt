==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific details about "Sample reasoning question 181." Since the question is not provided, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by breaking it down into steps, showing all calculations, and explaining the reasoning.

Let's assume the problem is a typical algebra problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \), which means we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Isolate the Term with \( x \):**
   To isolate the term with \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it completely. Since \( x \) is multiplied by 3, we divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   Original equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)

   Substitute \( x = 5 \):

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

If you have a specific problem or question number, please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem for you.
