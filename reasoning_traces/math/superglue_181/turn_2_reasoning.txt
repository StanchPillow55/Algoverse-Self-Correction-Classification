==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 181" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking down the steps involved in reasoning through a problem.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 181" is a math problem that involves solving a quadratic equation. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to solve a quadratic equation:

### Problem:
Solve the quadratic equation: \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the coefficients**: 
   - The quadratic equation is given in the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).
   - Identify the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

2. **Check if the equation can be factored**:
   - If the quadratic can be factored, express it as \( (px + q)(rx + s) = 0 \).
   - Solve for \( x \) by setting each factor equal to zero: \( px + q = 0 \) and \( rx + s = 0 \).

3. **Use the quadratic formula if necessary**:
   - If the quadratic cannot be easily factored, use the quadratic formula:
     \[
     x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Calculate the discriminant \( D = b^2 - 4ac \).
   - Determine the nature of the roots based on the discriminant:
     - If \( D > 0 \), there are two distinct real roots.
     - If \( D = 0 \), there is one real root (a repeated root).
     - If \( D < 0 \), there are two complex roots.

4. **Calculate the roots**:
   - Substitute the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) into the quadratic formula.
   - Simplify to find the values of \( x \).

5. **Verify the solution**:
   - Substitute the roots back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy the equation.

### Example:

Let's solve the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \).

1. **Identify the coefficients**: \( a = 2 \), \( b = -4 \), \( c = -6 \).

2. **Calculate the discriminant**:
   \[
   D = b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
   \]

3. **Use the quadratic formula**:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

4. **Calculate the roots**:
   - \( x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \)
   - \( x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1 \)

5. **Verify the solution**:
   - Substitute \( x = 3 \) into the original equation:
     \[
     2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
     \]
   - Substitute \( x = -1 \) into the original equation:
     \[
     2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
     \]

Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

### Final Answer:
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \).
