==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 490" entails. However, since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by using a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers that are divisible by 2.
   - Between 1 and 100, the even numbers start from 2 and end at 100.

2. **List the Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers between 1 and 100 is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

3. **Determine the Number of Terms:**
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the last term \( a_n = 100 \).
   - The common difference \( d = 2 \).
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plugging in the values, we have:
     \[
     100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = 50
     \]
   - Thus, there are 50 even numbers between 1 and 100.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 2550
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.

This approach demonstrates a structured method to solve a mathematical problem by identifying the sequence, determining the number of terms, and using the appropriate formula to find the sum. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide additional details.
