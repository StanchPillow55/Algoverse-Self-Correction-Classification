==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cherries Richard and Jerry have, given that Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard.

1. **Identify the variables**:
   - Let \( R \) be the number of cherries Richard has.
   - Let \( J \) be the number of cherries Jerry has.
   - We know that Robert has 30 cherries.

2. **Set up the relationship between Richard and Robert**:
   - According to the problem, Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:
   \[
   30 = R + 10
   \]
   From this equation, we can solve for \( R \):
   \[
   R = 30 - 10 = 20
   \]
   So, Richard has 20 cherries.

3. **Calculate the total cherries shared**:
   - The total number of cherries shared among Richard, Jerry, and Robert is 60. We can express this as:
   \[
   R + J + 30 = 60
   \]
   Substituting the value of \( R \) we found:
   \[
   20 + J + 30 = 60
   \]
   Simplifying this equation:
   \[
   50 + J = 60
   \]
   Now, solving for \( J \):
   \[
   J = 60 - 50 = 10
   \]
   So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

4. **Determine how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry**:
   - We know Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries. To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we calculate:
   \[
   30 - 10 = 20
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]
