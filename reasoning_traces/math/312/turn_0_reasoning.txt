==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of Trent, Jane, and Quinn based on the information provided.

1. **Identify Quinn's Age**: 
   We know from the problem that Quinn is 30 years old.

2. **Determine Jane's Age**: 
   The problem states that Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. Therefore, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jane's Age} = \text{Quinn's Age} - 3
   \]
   Substituting Quinn's age:
   \[
   \text{Jane's Age} = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]

3. **Determine Trent's Age**: 
   The problem also states that Trent is 5 years older than Jane. We can calculate Trent's age using Jane's age:
   \[
   \text{Trent's Age} = \text{Jane's Age} + 5
   \]
   Substituting Jane's age:
   \[
   \text{Trent's Age} = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: 
   Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

In conclusion, after working through the relationships and calculations step by step, we find that Trent's age is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]
