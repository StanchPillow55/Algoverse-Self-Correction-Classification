Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many emus are in Farmer Brown's flock based on the information given about heads and legs.

### Step 1: Understand the problem
Each emu has:
- 1 head
- 2 legs

We know that the total number of heads and legs combined is 60.

### Step 2: Set up the equations
Let \( x \) be the number of emus in the flock.

Since each emu has 1 head, the total number of heads contributed by \( x \) emus is:
\[
\text{Total heads} = x
\]

Since each emu has 2 legs, the total number of legs contributed by \( x \) emus is:
\[
\text{Total legs} = 2x
\]

### Step 3: Combine the equations
The total number of heads and legs combined is given as 60:
\[
x + 2x = 60
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the equation
Combine like terms:
\[
3x = 60
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[
x = \frac{60}{3} = 20
\]

### Conclusion
Farmer Brown has \( \boxed{20} \) emus in his flock.
