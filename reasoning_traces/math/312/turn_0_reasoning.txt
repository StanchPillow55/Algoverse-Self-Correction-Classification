==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many emus Farmer Brown has in his flock, given that the total number of heads and legs is 60.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the characteristics of an emu:**
   - Each emu has 1 head.
   - Each emu has 2 legs.

2. **Define variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of emus in the flock.

3. **Express the total number of heads and legs in terms of \( x \):**
   - Since each emu has 1 head, the total number of heads is \( x \).
   - Since each emu has 2 legs, the total number of legs is \( 2x \).

4. **Set up the equation:**
   - The problem states that the total number of heads and legs combined is 60. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     x + 2x = 60
     \]

5. **Simplify and solve the equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     3x = 60
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:
     \[
     x = \frac{60}{3} = 20
     \]

6. **Interpret the solution:**
   - The value of \( x \) is 20, which means there are 20 emus in the flock.

7. **Verify the solution:**
   - If there are 20 emus, then:
     - The number of heads is \( 20 \times 1 = 20 \).
     - The number of legs is \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \).
     - The total number of heads and legs is \( 20 + 40 = 60 \), which matches the given condition.

Therefore, the final answer is that Farmer Brown has \(\boxed{20}\) emus in his flock.
