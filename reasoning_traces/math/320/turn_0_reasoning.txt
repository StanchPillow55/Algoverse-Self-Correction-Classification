==================================================

To determine how much Austin started with, we need to calculate the total cost of the robots, including tax, and then add the change he received back.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the robots
Austin bought 7 robots, and each robot costs $8.75. We can calculate the total cost of the robots as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost of robots} = \text{Number of robots} \times \text{Cost per robot}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of robots} = 7 \times 8.75
\]

Calculating this:

\[
7 \times 8.75 = 61.25
\]

So, the total cost of the robots is **$61.25**.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost including tax
Austin was charged $7.22 for tax. To find the total amount he spent, we add the total cost of the robots to the tax:

\[
\text{Total cost including tax} = \text{Total cost of robots} + \text{Tax}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost including tax} = 61.25 + 7.22
\]

Calculating this:

\[
61.25 + 7.22 = 68.47
\]

So, the total cost including tax is **$68.47**.

### Step 3: Determine how much Austin started with
Austin left with $11.53 in change. To find out how much he started with, we need to add the total cost (including tax) to the change he received back:

\[
\text{Amount Austin started with} = \text{Total cost including tax} + \text{Change}
\]
\[
\text{Amount Austin started with} = 68.47 + 11.53
\]

Calculating this:

\[
68.47 + 11.53 = 80.00
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the amount Austin started with is **$80.00**.
