==================================================

To determine how much money Austin started with, we need to calculate the total cost of the robots, add the tax, and then account for the change he received.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the robots
Austin bought a robot for each of his seven friends, and each robot costs $8.75.

\[
\text{Total cost of robots} = 7 \times 8.75
\]

Calculating this:

\[
7 \times 8.75 = 61.25
\]

So, the total cost of the robots is $61.25.

### Step 2: Add the tax to the total cost
The tax charged was $7.22. We need to add this to the total cost of the robots to find the total amount Austin spent.

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 61.25 + 7.22
\]

Calculating this:

\[
61.25 + 7.22 = 68.47
\]

So, the total amount spent, including tax, is $68.47.

### Step 3: Calculate the amount Austin started with
Austin left with $11.53 in change. This means that after spending $68.47, he had $11.53 left. To find out how much he started with, we add the change to the total amount spent.

\[
\text{Amount Austin started with} = 68.47 + 11.53
\]

Calculating this:

\[
68.47 + 11.53 = 80.00
\]

### Final Answer
Austin started with $80.00.
