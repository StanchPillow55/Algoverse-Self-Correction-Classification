Question ID: 320
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial total number of people at the party.**
   - There are 25 men and 15 women.
   - Total number of people = Number of men + Number of women
   \[
   \text{Total number of people} = 25 + 15 = 40
   \]

2. **Calculate how many people left the party.**
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the total number of people left after an hour.
   - Number of people who left = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 \)
   \[
   \text{Number of people who left} = \frac{40}{4} = 10
   \]

3. **Determine how many people stayed at the party.**
   - Total number of people who stayed = Total number of people - Number of people who left
   \[
   \text{Number of people who stayed} = 40 - 10 = 30
   \]

4. **Identify how many men stayed at the party.**
   - We know from the problem that 22 men stayed at the party.

5. **Calculate how many women stayed at the party.**
   - Since we know the total number of people who stayed is 30 and 22 of them are men, we can find the number of women who stayed.
   \[
   \text{Number of women who stayed} = \text{Total who stayed} - \text{Number of men who stayed}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of women who stayed} = 30 - 22 = 8
   \]

6. **State the final answer.**
   - The number of women left at the party is \( \boxed{8} \).
