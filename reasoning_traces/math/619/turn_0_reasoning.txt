==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of functioning street lights at the road intersections. We will break this down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of street lights per pole:**
   Each pole has 4 street lights.

2. **Determine the number of poles per intersection:**
   There are 6 poles at each intersection.

3. **Calculate the total number of street lights per intersection:**
   To find the total number of street lights at one intersection, we multiply the number of poles by the number of street lights per pole:
   \[
   \text{Street lights per intersection} = \text{Number of poles} \times \text{Street lights per pole} = 6 \times 4 = 24
   \]

4. **Determine the number of intersections:**
   The road has 4 intersections.

5. **Calculate the total number of street lights for all intersections:**
   To find the total number of street lights for all intersections, we multiply the number of street lights per intersection by the number of intersections:
   \[
   \text{Total street lights} = \text{Street lights per intersection} \times \text{Number of intersections} = 24 \times 4 = 96
   \]

6. **Account for the non-functioning street lights:**
   We are told that 20 street lights are not working. To find the total number of functioning street lights, we subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights:
   \[
   \text{Functioning street lights} = \text{Total street lights} - \text{Non-functioning street lights} = 96 - 20 = 76
   \]

7. **Final answer:**
   The total number of functioning street lights is \( \boxed{76} \).
