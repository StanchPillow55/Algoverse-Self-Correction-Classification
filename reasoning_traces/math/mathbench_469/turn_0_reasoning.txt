To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 469" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a sample math problem with the number 469 and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 469:**

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"Find the sum of the digits of the number 469, and then multiply the result by 3. What is the final answer?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 469:**
   - The number 469 consists of three digits: 4, 6, and 9.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Sum = 4 + 6 + 9

   Let's perform the addition:
   - 4 + 6 = 10
   - 10 + 9 = 19

   Therefore, the sum of the digits is 19.

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - We need to multiply the result from the previous step by 3.
   - 19 × 3

   Let's perform the multiplication:
   - 19 × 3 = 57

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The final answer, after multiplying the sum of the digits by 3, is 57.

Therefore, the solution to the sample math problem is 57.
