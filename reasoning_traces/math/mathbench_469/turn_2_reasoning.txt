==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 469," we need to first understand what the problem entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation.

   \[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

   First, subtract 5 from both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left side:

   \[ 3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5 \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[ 3x = 15 \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

   \[ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3} \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[ x = 5 \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[ 3(5) + 5 = 20 \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is 5.

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a basic linear equation. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 469," please provide the details, and I can assist you with that specific problem.
