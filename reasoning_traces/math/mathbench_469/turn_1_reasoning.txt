Question ID: mathbench_469
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 469," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 469" is not specific enough for us to determine what the problem actually is. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem in a textbook or a set of problems.

Since we don't have the actual details of the problem, let's assume a hypothetical math problem that involves a common type of math question. Let's say the problem is:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 469 positive integers.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Identify the number of terms:**
   In this problem, \( n = 469 \).

2. **Apply the formula:**
   Substitute \( n = 469 \) into the formula:

   \[
   S = \frac{469(469 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate inside the parentheses:**
   \[
   469 + 1 = 470
   \]

4. **Multiply the terms:**
   \[
   469 \times 470 = 220930
   \]

5. **Divide by 2:**
   \[
   S = \frac{220930}{2} = 110465
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 469 positive integers is \( 110465 \).

This solution assumes a typical problem involving the sum of consecutive integers. If "Sample math problem 469" refers to a different problem, please provide more details or context so I can assist you accurately.
