==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 469," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not provided here. Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample math problem 469," I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by outlining a structured method for solving math problems step by step.

### Step-by-Step Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given information or constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**

   - Choose an appropriate strategy (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and signs.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step for accuracy.
   - Ensure the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Re-calculate if necessary.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Since "Sample math problem 469" is not specified, let's solve a generic example problem:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
This is a simple linear equation. We can solve it by isolating \( x \).

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. Start with the equation:  
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):  
   \[
   2x = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):  
   \[
   x = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Check Your Work
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:  
\[
2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
\]
The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

#### Step 5: State the Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

### Conclusion
Without the specific details of "Sample math problem 469," this example demonstrates a structured approach to solving a math problem. If you have the details of the specific problem, please provide them, and I can offer a tailored solution.
