==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 469," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by outlining a step-by-step process that can be applied to various types of math problems.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and signs.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your calculations.
   - Check if the answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Review the problem to ensure all parts have been addressed.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem:

Let's assume "Sample math problem 469" is a simple algebra problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

#### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can solve this linear equation by isolating \( x \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
     \]
     \[
     3x = 15
     \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
     \]
     \[
     x = 5
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     3(5) + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

### Final Answer:
\( x = 5 \)

This example demonstrates a structured approach to solving a math problem. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 469," please provide the details, and I can apply this methodology to solve it.
