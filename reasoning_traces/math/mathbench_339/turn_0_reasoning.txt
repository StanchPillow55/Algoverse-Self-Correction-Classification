==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample math problem 339" as it is not specified in your request. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems by breaking down the process into steps. If you provide more details about the specific problem, I can tailor the solution to that problem.

### Generic Steps to Solve a Math Problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note down the given information and data.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Determine the type of problem (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Choose a strategy to solve the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation, using a formula).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and conversions if applicable.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify each step of your calculations.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Ensure that the final answer addresses the question.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem:

Let's solve a simple algebra problem as an example:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- This is a linear equation. We can solve it by isolating \( x \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
- Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Review/Check the Solution**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, so the solution is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).
