Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 339" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem that might be labeled as such. Let's consider a common type of math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 339" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation, as this is a common type of problem in math courses. Here's a sample quadratic equation:

\[ x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \]

We will solve this quadratic equation using the factoring method, which is one of the standard methods for solving quadratic equations.

### Step 1: Write the equation in standard form
The equation is already in standard form: 

\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]

where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), and \( c = 6 \).

### Step 2: Factor the quadratic equation
We need to find two numbers that multiply to \( ac = 1 \times 6 = 6 \) and add to \( b = -5 \).

The numbers that satisfy these conditions are -2 and -3 because:

- \((-2) \times (-3) = 6\)
- \((-2) + (-3) = -5\)

Using these numbers, we can factor the quadratic equation as:

\[ x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0 \]

### Step 3: Solve for the roots
Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \( x \):

1. \( x - 2 = 0 \)

   Solving for \( x \), we get:
   \[ x = 2 \]

2. \( x - 3 = 0 \)

   Solving for \( x \), we get:
   \[ x = 3 \]

### Conclusion
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \).

### Final Answer
The roots of the equation are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \).
