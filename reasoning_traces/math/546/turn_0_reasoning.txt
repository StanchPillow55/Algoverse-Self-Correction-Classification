To determine how many letters Elise has written in total, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Writing the alphabet in full twice**:
   The English alphabet consists of 26 letters. When Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, we calculate the total number of letters written in this step as follows:
   \[
   26 \text{ letters} \times 2 = 52 \text{ letters}
   \]

2. **Writing half of the alphabet once**:
   Half of the alphabet means she writes 13 letters (since half of 26 is 13). Therefore, the total number of letters written in this step is:
   \[
   13 \text{ letters}
   \]

3. **Re-writing everything she has already written**:
   At this point, Elise has already written a total of:
   \[
   52 \text{ letters (from the full alphabets)} + 13 \text{ letters (from half the alphabet)} = 65 \text{ letters}
   \]
   Now, when she re-writes everything she has already written, she writes another 65 letters.

4. **Calculating the total**:
   Now we can sum all the letters written in each step:
   \[
   52 \text{ letters (first two full alphabets)} + 13 \text{ letters (half the alphabet)} + 65 \text{ letters (re-writing everything)} = 130 \text{ letters}
   \]

Thus, the total number of letters Elise has written is:
\[
\boxed{130}
\]
