==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to understand the context and the specific question being asked. However, the question "Sample reasoning question 161" is not clear on its own, as it lacks specific details or context. Therefore, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem by considering a hypothetical math problem. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. The distance between City A and City B is 180 miles. How long does it take for the train to reach City B from City A?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the train to travel from City A to City B.
   - We are given the speed of the train and the distance between the two cities.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - Distance = 180 miles
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 180 by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - To ensure the calculation is correct, consider the units:
     - The units of miles cancel out, leaving hours, which is the correct unit for time.
   - Check the logic: If the train travels 60 miles in one hour, it will take 3 hours to cover 180 miles.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The train takes 3 hours to travel from City A to City B.

This step-by-step approach ensures that we understand the problem, apply the correct formula, perform accurate calculations, and verify the results. If you have a specific problem or context for "Sample reasoning question 161," please provide more details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
