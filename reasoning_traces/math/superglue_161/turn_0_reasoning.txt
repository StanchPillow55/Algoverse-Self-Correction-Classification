==================================================

To solve this problem, I need more specific details about "Sample reasoning question 161." Since I don't have access to external databases or specific sample questions, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving a math problem, assuming it involves typical reasoning and calculation steps.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - Is it algebraic, geometric, statistical, or another type?
   - Recognize any patterns or formulas that might apply.

3. **Plan a Solution:**
   - Decide on the best approach to solve the problem.
   - Consider drawing diagrams, writing equations, or listing possibilities.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out the calculations or logical reasoning step by step.
   - Be meticulous with arithmetic and algebraic manipulations.

5. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Re-evaluate the final answer to see if it makes sense in the context of the problem.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the solution.
   - Ensure it answers the question posed.

### Example Problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - This is a simple linear equation.

3. **Plan a Solution:**
   - Isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

5. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
