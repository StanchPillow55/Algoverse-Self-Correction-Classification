==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 161." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem using a step-by-step method. Let's consider a sample algebra problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

**Step 3: Subtract 3 from Both Sides**
\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]
\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 4: Divide Both Sides by 2**
To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]
\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]
\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]
\[ 11 = 11 \]

The solution satisfies the original equation, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 4.

If you have a specific problem or question in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to work through it step by step.
