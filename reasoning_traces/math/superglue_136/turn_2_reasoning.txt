To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 136," let's break it down step by step. However, since the problem statement is not fully provided, I'll demonstrate a generic approach to solving a typical math problem. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the complete details, and I'll tailor the solution accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could involve algebraic manipulation, drawing diagrams, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most efficient strategy based on the given information.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work to avoid errors.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Double-check calculations and consider alternative methods to confirm the result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, ensuring it addresses the question asked.
   - Include units if applicable and provide a brief explanation if necessary.

### Example Problem:

Let's assume a sample problem: "Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

#### Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming the solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
