==================================================

To solve this problem, I will first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 136" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I will assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual content of the problem, I cannot provide a specific solution. However, I can demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by outlining a general problem-solving strategy.

Let's assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies this equation.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side. Subtract 3 from both sides:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This example illustrates a typical approach to solving a linear equation. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide the details of "Sample reasoning question 136," and I will be happy to help solve it.
