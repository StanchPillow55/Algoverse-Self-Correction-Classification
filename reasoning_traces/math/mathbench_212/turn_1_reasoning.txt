Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 212," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 212" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact mathematical question or context. Therefore, I will assume that "Sample math problem 212" is a placeholder for a specific math problem that you would like me to solve.

Since I don't have the details of the problem, I'll provide a general approach to solving math problems, which you can apply to the specific problem you have in mind:

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem statement carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider different strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Looking for patterns.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Review calculations for any errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample math problem 212," I'll demonstrate the approach with a simple example problem:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, so the solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
