==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 212," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 212" is not specific enough to provide any details or context. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. 

Since I don't have the actual problem details, let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will cancel out the other terms on the same side as \( x \).

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation. Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Next, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 5.
