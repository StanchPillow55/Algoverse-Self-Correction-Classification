==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many clay dishes Jada, Rory, and Kora made, based on the relationships given in the problem.

1. **Identify the number of dishes Kora made**: 
   - We are told that Kora made 20 dishes.
   \[
   K = 20
   \]

2. **Determine how many dishes Rory made**: 
   - The problem states that Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora. Therefore, we can express the number of dishes Rory made (R) as:
   \[
   R = K + 20
   \]
   Substituting the value of K:
   \[
   R = 20 + 20 = 40
   \]

3. **Determine how many dishes Jada made**: 
   - According to the problem, Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory. Thus, we can express the number of dishes Jada made (J) as:
   \[
   J = 2R
   \]
   Substituting the value of R:
   \[
   J = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of dishes made by all three**: 
   - Now we can find the total number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora by adding their individual contributions:
   \[
   \text{Total} = J + R + K
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total} = 80 + 40 + 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total} = 140
   \]

Thus, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is \(\boxed{140}\).
