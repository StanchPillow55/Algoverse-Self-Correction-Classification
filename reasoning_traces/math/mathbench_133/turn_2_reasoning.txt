==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 133" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that we can solve step by step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 133" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's how we can approach it:

**Problem:** Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step 1: Identify the quadratic equation.**

The given equation is \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\). This is a standard quadratic equation of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula to find the roots.**

The quadratic formula is given by:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Plug in the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6)}}{2 \times 2}
\]

**Step 3: Simplify the expression under the square root (the discriminant).**

Calculate \(b^2 - 4ac\):

\[
b^2 = (-4)^2 = 16
\]

\[
4ac = 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = -48
\]

\[
b^2 - 4ac = 16 - (-48) = 16 + 48 = 64
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the roots using the quadratic formula.**

Substitute the discriminant back into the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{64}}{4}
\]

Calculate \(\sqrt{64}\):

\[
\sqrt{64} = 8
\]

Now, substitute back into the formula:

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

This gives us two possible solutions:

1. \(x = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3\)

2. \(x = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1\)

**Step 5: State the final answer.**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

**Final Answer:**
The roots of the quadratic equation are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
