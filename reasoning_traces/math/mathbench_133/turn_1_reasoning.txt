==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 133" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 133" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 133" is as follows:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the type of equation:**
   The given equation \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \) is a quadratic equation in the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -6 \).

2. **Check if the equation can be simplified:**
   The coefficients \( a = 2 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -6 \) do not have a common factor other than 1, so the equation is already in its simplest form.

3. **Use the quadratic formula:**
   The quadratic formula is given by:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   Plug in the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-6)}}{2 \cdot 2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the discriminant:**
   The discriminant \( \Delta \) is \( b^2 - 4ac \):
   \[
   \Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
   \]

5. **Evaluate the square root of the discriminant:**
   \[
   \sqrt{64} = 8
   \]

6. **Substitute back into the quadratic formula:**
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

7. **Solve for the two possible values of \( x \):**
   - First solution:
     \[
     x = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   - Second solution:
     \[
     x = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   The solutions to the equation \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \).

**Final Answer:**
\( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \)
