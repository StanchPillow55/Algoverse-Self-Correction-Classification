==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 277," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**

The given equation is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

The equation is:
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:
\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]

Simplifying both sides gives:
\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**

Now, we have \( 2x = 8 \). To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

Original equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

Substitute \( x = 4 \):
\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

Calculate the left side:
\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
