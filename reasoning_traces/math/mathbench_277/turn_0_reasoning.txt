==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 277" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 277" is a typical algebra problem.

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 15 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the equation:**
   The given equation is:
   \[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 15 \]

2. **Isolate the variable \( x \):**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

3. **Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 15 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = 15
   \]

4. **Subtract 5 from both sides:**
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 10
   \]

5. **Verify the solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 10 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(10) + 5 = 2(10) + 15
   \]
   Simplifying both sides:
   \[
   30 + 5 = 20 + 15
   \]
   \[
   35 = 35
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 10 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 15 \) is \( x = 10 \).
