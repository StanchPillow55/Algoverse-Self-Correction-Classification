==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 168" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem itself, I'll assume a generic math problem involving the number 168. Let's consider a problem that involves finding the factors of 168, as this is a common type of math problem.

**Problem:** Find all the factors of 168.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find all the positive integers that divide 168 without leaving a remainder. These integers are called factors.

2. **Start with the Smallest Factor:**
   The smallest factor of any integer is 1. So, 1 is a factor of 168.

3. **Check for Divisibility:**
   We will check divisibility starting from 2 upwards to find all factors.

   - **Divisibility by 2:** 
     Since 168 is an even number, it is divisible by 2. 
     \[
     168 \div 2 = 84
     \]
     So, 2 and 84 are factors.

   - **Divisibility by 3:**
     To check divisibility by 3, sum the digits of 168: \(1 + 6 + 8 = 15\). Since 15 is divisible by 3, 168 is also divisible by 3.
     \[
     168 \div 3 = 56
     \]
     So, 3 and 56 are factors.

   - **Divisibility by 4:**
     A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits form a number divisible by 4. The last two digits of 168 are 68, and 68 is divisible by 4.
     \[
     168 \div 4 = 42
     \]
     So, 4 and 42 are factors.

   - **Divisibility by 5:**
     A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5. Since 168 does not, it is not divisible by 5.

   - **Divisibility by 6:**
     A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. Since 168 is divisible by both, it is divisible by 6.
     \[
     168 \div 6 = 28
     \]
     So, 6 and 28 are factors.

   - **Divisibility by 7:**
     To check divisibility by 7, perform the division:
     \[
     168 \div 7 = 24
     \]
     So, 7 and 24 are factors.

   - **Divisibility by 8:**
     A number is divisible by 8 if the last three digits form a number divisible by 8. Since 168 is a three-digit number, check directly:
     \[
     168 \div 8 = 21
     \]
     So, 8 and 21 are factors.

   - **Divisibility by 9:**
     A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. The sum of the digits of 168 is 15, which is not divisible by 9. So, 168 is not divisible by 9.

   - **Divisibility by 10:**
     A number is divisible by 10 if it ends in 0. Since 168 does not, it is not divisible by 10.

   - **Divisibility by 11 and higher:**
     Continue checking divisibility up to the square root of 168, which is approximately 12.96. We check up to 12:

     - **Divisibility by 12:**
       A number is divisible by 12 if it is divisible by both 3 and 4. Since 168 is divisible by both, it is divisible by 12.
       \[
       168 \div 12 = 14
       \]
       So, 12 and 14 are factors.

4. **List All Factors:**
   The factors of 168, in ascending order, are: 
   \[
   1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 21, 24, 28, 42, 56, 84, 168
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The factors of 168 are \(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 21, 24, 28, 42, 56, 84, \) and \(168\).
