==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 168" refers to. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a generic math problem with the number 168 involved. Let's create a problem involving the number 168 and solve it step-by-step.

**Problem:**  
Find the prime factorization of 168 and determine the number of divisors it has.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 168**

To find the prime factorization, we start by dividing 168 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. \( 168 \div 2 = 84 \)  
   (168 is even, so it is divisible by 2)

2. \( 84 \div 2 = 42 \)  
   (84 is even, so it is divisible by 2)

3. \( 42 \div 2 = 21 \)  
   (42 is even, so it is divisible by 2)

4. \( 21 \div 3 = 7 \)  
   (21 is divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits, 2 + 1 = 3, is divisible by 3)

5. \( 7 \div 7 = 1 \)  
   (7 is a prime number)

So, the prime factorization of 168 is \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 7^1 \).

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number, use the formula based on its prime factorization. If a number \( n \) has the prime factorization \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of divisors \( D(n) \) is given by:

\[ D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1) \]

For 168, with the prime factorization \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 7^1 \):

- \( a_1 = 3 \) for the prime 2
- \( a_2 = 1 \) for the prime 3
- \( a_3 = 1 \) for the prime 7

Thus, the number of divisors is:

\[ D(168) = (3 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \times 2 \times 2 = 16 \]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 168 is \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 7^1 \), and it has 16 divisors.
