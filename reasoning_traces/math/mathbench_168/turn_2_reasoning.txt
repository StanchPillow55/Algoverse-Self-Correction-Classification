==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 168," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only states "Sample math problem 168" without any specific details or context. Therefore, I will assume that "168" is a number involved in a mathematical problem, and I will create a problem involving this number and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Find the prime factorization of the number 168.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to express the number 168 as a product of prime numbers.

2. **Start with the Smallest Prime Number:**
   Begin dividing 168 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

   \[
   168 \div 2 = 84
   \]

   So, 168 can be divided by 2, and we write:
   \[
   168 = 2 \times 84
   \]

3. **Continue Factoring 84:**
   Next, factor 84 by dividing it by 2 again (since it is even).

   \[
   84 \div 2 = 42
   \]

   So, we have:
   \[
   168 = 2 \times 2 \times 42
   \]

4. **Continue Factoring 42:**
   Divide 42 by 2 once more.

   \[
   42 \div 2 = 21
   \]

   Now, we have:
   \[
   168 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 21
   \]

5. **Factor 21:**
   The number 21 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

   \[
   21 \div 3 = 7
   \]

   Therefore, we have:
   \[
   168 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 7
   \]

6. **Verify the Prime Factors:**
   Check that all factors are prime numbers: 2, 3, and 7 are all prime.

7. **Write the Final Prime Factorization:**
   Combine the factors to express 168 as a product of primes:
   \[
   168 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 7
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 168 is \(2^3 \times 3 \times 7\).
