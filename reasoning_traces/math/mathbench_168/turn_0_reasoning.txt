==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear with just "Sample math problem 168." To provide a complete solution, I need a specific math problem or question to work through. However, I can create a sample math problem involving the number 168 and solve it step by step. Let's consider the following problem:

**Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of the number 168 and determine the number of positive divisors it has.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 168**

To find the prime factorization, we start by dividing 168 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. \( 168 \div 2 = 84 \)
   - 168 is even, so it is divisible by 2.

2. \( 84 \div 2 = 42 \)
   - 84 is also even, so it is divisible by 2.

3. \( 42 \div 2 = 21 \)
   - 42 is even, so it is divisible by 2.

4. \( 21 \div 3 = 7 \)
   - 21 is not even, so we try the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since the sum of the digits (2 + 1 = 3) is divisible by 3, 21 is divisible by 3.

5. \( 7 \div 7 = 1 \)
   - 7 is a prime number, so we divide by 7.

The prime factorization of 168 is \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 7^1 \).

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Positive Divisors**

To find the number of positive divisors of a number, use the formula based on its prime factorization. If the prime factorization of a number is \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_n^{a_n} \), then the number of divisors is given by:

\[
(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_n + 1)
\]

For 168, the prime factorization is \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 7^1 \). Therefore, the number of divisors is:

\[
(3 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \times 2 \times 2 = 16
\]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 168 is \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 7^1 \), and it has 16 positive divisors.
