==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 168," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 168" does not provide enough information about the specific math problem we need to solve. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific problem from a textbook or worksheet.

To proceed, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 168" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 168."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - The even numbers between 1 and 168 start from 2 and go up to 168.

2. **List the Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 168.

3. **Determine the Number of Terms:**
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the last term \( a_n = 168 \).
   - The common difference \( d = 2 \).
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     168 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     168 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     168 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{168}{2} = 84
     \]
   - There are 84 even numbers between 1 and 168.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{84} = \frac{84}{2} \cdot (2 + 168)
     \]
     \[
     S_{84} = 42 \cdot 170
     \]
     \[
     S_{84} = 7140
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 168 is 7140.
