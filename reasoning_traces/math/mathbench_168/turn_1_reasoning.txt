Question ID: mathbench_168
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 168" refers to. Since no specific details about the problem are provided, I will assume it is a generic math problem involving the number 168. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Factorization of 168

One common type of math problem is to factor a number into its prime components. Let's factor 168:

1. **Divide by 2 (the smallest prime number):**
   \[
   168 \div 2 = 84
   \]
   So, 168 = 2 × 84.

2. **Divide 84 by 2:**
   \[
   84 \div 2 = 42
   \]
   So, 84 = 2 × 42, and thus 168 = 2 × 2 × 42.

3. **Divide 42 by 2:**
   \[
   42 \div 2 = 21
   \]
   So, 42 = 2 × 21, and thus 168 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 21.

4. **Divide 21 by 3 (the next smallest prime number):**
   \[
   21 \div 3 = 7
   \]
   So, 21 = 3 × 7, and thus 168 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7.

Therefore, the prime factorization of 168 is:
\[
168 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 7
\]

### Possibility 2: Solving for Divisors of 168

Another type of problem could be finding all divisors of 168. Using the prime factorization, we can find the divisors:

- The prime factorization is \(2^3 \times 3 \times 7\).
- To find the divisors, consider all combinations of these factors:

The exponents in the factorization are 3, 1, and 1. The number of divisors is given by multiplying the incremented exponents:
\[
(3+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 4 \times 2 \times 2 = 16
\]

The divisors are:
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 21, 24, 28, 42, 56, 84, 168.

### Possibility 3: Solving an Equation Involving 168

If the problem involves solving an equation, such as finding \(x\) in \(x + 168 = 200\):

1. **Subtract 168 from both sides:**
   \[
   x + 168 - 168 = 200 - 168
   \]
   \[
   x = 32
   \]

### Conclusion

Without specific details, I have explored three potential problems involving the number 168: its prime factorization, finding its divisors, and solving a simple equation. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details. Otherwise, these are the types of problems that could involve the number 168.

Final Answer:
1. Prime factorization of 168: \(2^3 \times 3 \times 7\)
2. Divisors of 168: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 21, 24, 28, 42, 56, 84, 168
3. Solution to \(x + 168 = 200\): \(x = 32\)
