==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 452" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 452:**

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Start by getting all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side. We can do this by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides of the equation:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 9 - 2x
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x + 5 = 9
   \]

3. **Isolate \( x \):**
   Next, we need to isolate \( x \) by removing the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides:

   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   3(4) + 5 = 2(4) + 9
   \]

   Calculate both sides:

   \[
   12 + 5 = 8 + 9
   \]

   \[
   17 = 17
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \) is \( x = 4 \).
