==================================================

Let's denote the amount of allowance that Julia and Nadine each received as \( x \). Since they both received the same amount, together they have:

\[
2x
\]

Next, we will calculate the total cost of the items they purchased for their father's birthday.

1. **Cost of the cake**: 
   The cake costs $11.

2. **Cost of the balloons**: 
   They bought 1 dozen balloons. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we need to find out how many pairs of balloons that is. There are 2 balloons in a pair, so:

   \[
   \text{Number of pairs} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
   \]

   The cost for 2 balloons is $0.5, so the cost for 6 pairs (or 12 balloons) is:

   \[
   \text{Cost of balloons} = 6 \times 0.5 = 3
   \]

3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 
   They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7. Therefore, the total cost for the ice cream is:

   \[
   \text{Cost of ice cream} = 2 \times 7 = 14
   \]

Now, we can find the total amount spent on all items:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of cake} + \text{Cost of balloons} + \text{Cost of ice cream}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 11 + 3 + 14 = 28
\]

Now, we know that Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to pay for these items, so we set up the equation:

\[
2x = 28
\]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = \frac{28}{2} = 14
\]

Thus, each girl received:

\[
\boxed{14}
\]

In conclusion, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.
