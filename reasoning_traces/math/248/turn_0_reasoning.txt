To determine how much cheaper the promotional subscription is compared to the normal subscription, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the normal subscription cost**: The normal cost for an 18-month magazine subscription is given as $34.

2. **Calculate the number of issues in the subscription**: Since the magazine is published twice a month, we can calculate the total number of issues over 18 months:
   \[
   \text{Number of issues} = 2 \text{ issues/month} \times 18 \text{ months} = 36 \text{ issues}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost per issue for the normal subscription**: To find the cost per issue for the normal subscription, we divide the total cost by the number of issues:
   \[
   \text{Cost per issue (normal)} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of issues}} = \frac{34}{36}
   \]

   Performing the division:
   \[
   \frac{34}{36} = \frac{17}{18} \approx 0.9444 \text{ dollars per issue}
   \]

4. **Determine the promotional discount per issue**: The promotion offers a discount of $0.25 off each issue. Therefore, the cost per issue during the promotion is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per issue (promotional)} = \text{Cost per issue (normal)} - \text{Discount} = \frac{17}{18} - 0.25
   \]

   To perform this calculation, we need to express $0.25$ as a fraction with a denominator of 18:
   \[
   0.25 = \frac{1}{4} = \frac{4.5}{18}
   \]

   Now we can subtract:
   \[
   \text{Cost per issue (promotional)} = \frac{17}{18} - \frac{4.5}{18} = \frac{17 - 4.5}{18} = \frac{12.5}{18}
   \]

   Simplifying this fraction:
   \[
   \frac{12.5}{18} = \frac{125}{180} = \frac{25}{36} \approx 0.6944 \text{ dollars per issue}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for the promotional subscription**: Now we can find the total cost for the promotional subscription by multiplying the cost per issue by the total number of issues:
   \[
   \text{Total cost (promotional)} = \text{Cost per issue (promotional)} \times \text{Number of issues} = \frac{25}{36} \times 36 = 25 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the difference in cost between the normal and promotional subscriptions**: Finally, we find out how much cheaper the promotional subscription is compared to the normal subscription:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total cost (normal)} - \text{Total cost (promotional)} = 34 - 25 = 9 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the promotional subscription is **$9 cheaper** than the normal subscription.

**Final Answer**: $9
