To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of the magazine subscription under the promotional offer and compare it to the normal subscription cost. Here's how we can do that step by step:

1. **Determine the Number of Issues:**
   - The subscription is for 18 months.
   - The magazine is issued twice a month.
   - Therefore, the total number of issues over 18 months is:
     \[
     18 \text{ months} \times 2 \text{ issues per month} = 36 \text{ issues}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Discount Per Issue:**
   - The promotion offers $0.25 off each issue.
   - Therefore, the total discount for all 36 issues is:
     \[
     36 \text{ issues} \times \$0.25 \text{ per issue} = \$9.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the Promotional Subscription Cost:**
   - The normal cost of the subscription is $34.
   - With the promotional discount, the cost is reduced by $9.00.
   - Therefore, the promotional cost is:
     \[
     \$34 - \$9 = \$25
     \]

4. **Determine How Much Cheaper the Promotional Subscription Is:**
   - The difference between the normal subscription cost and the promotional subscription cost is:
     \[
     \$34 - \$25 = \$9
     \]

Thus, the promotional subscription is $9 cheaper than the normal subscription.

**Final Answer:**
The promotional subscription is $9 cheaper than the normal subscription.
