To determine how much the chef spent on onions, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the onions**: 
   The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. We can find the total weight by multiplying the number of bags by the weight of each bag.

   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Weight per bag}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds/bag} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the onions**: 
   The cost of onions is given as $1.50 per pound. To find the total cost, we multiply the total weight of the onions by the cost per pound.

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total weight} \times \text{Cost per pound}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/pound}
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   200 \times 1.50 = 300
   \]

3. **Final answer**: 
   The total amount the chef spent on onions is $300.

Thus, the chef spent **$300** on onions.
