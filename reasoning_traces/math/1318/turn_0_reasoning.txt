To solve the problem, we need to determine how many slices of pizza each person can have when Henry and his 3 friends share the pizzas equally.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizzas.**
Henry and his 3 friends ordered 7 pizzas.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of slices.**
Each pizza is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total slices} = \text{Number of pizzas} \times \text{Slices per pizza}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total slices} = 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ slices}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the total number of people sharing the pizzas.**
Henry has 3 friends, which means there are a total of:

\[
\text{Total people} = 1 \text{ (Henry)} + 3 \text{ (friends)} = 4 \text{ people}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of slices per person.**
To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the total number of people:

\[
\text{Slices per person} = \frac{\text{Total slices}}{\text{Total people}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Slices per person} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \text{ slices}
\]

**Final Answer:**
Each person can have 14 slices of pizza.
