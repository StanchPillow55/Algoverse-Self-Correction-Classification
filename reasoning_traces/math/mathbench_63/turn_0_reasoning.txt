==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 63" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement given here, I will assume that "Sample math problem 63" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. For the sake of this exercise, let's create a sample math problem and solve it.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 63.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - Between 1 and 63, the even numbers start at 2 and end at 62.

2. **List the Even Numbers:**
   - The even numbers between 1 and 63 are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 62.

3. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

4. **Find the Number of Terms:**
   - The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Set \( a_n = 62 \) to find \( n \):
     \[
     62 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     62 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     62 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = 31
     \]
   - There are 31 even numbers between 1 and 63.

5. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{31} = \frac{31}{2} \cdot (2 + 62)
     \]
     \[
     S_{31} = \frac{31}{2} \cdot 64
     \]
     \[
     S_{31} = 31 \cdot 32
     \]
     \[
     S_{31} = 992
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 63 is 992.
