==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete, as "Sample math problem 63" doesn't provide enough information to determine what the problem is asking. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem if you provide more details or specify the type of problem you're dealing with (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus, etc.).

If "Sample math problem 63" refers to a specific problem from a textbook or resource, please provide the full problem statement. If you have a particular type of math problem in mind, please describe it, and I'll be happy to help you solve it step by step.
