==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 63" refers to. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, let's assume it involves a mathematical operation or concept related to the number 63. I'll explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Prime Factorization of 63

Let's find the prime factorization of 63.

1. **Divide by the smallest prime number (2):**  
   63 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.

2. **Next smallest prime number (3):**  
   Sum of digits of 63 is \(6 + 3 = 9\), which is divisible by 3.  
   Divide 63 by 3:  
   \[
   63 \div 3 = 21
   \]

3. **Divide 21 by 3 again:**  
   Sum of digits of 21 is \(2 + 1 = 3\), which is divisible by 3.  
   Divide 21 by 3:  
   \[
   21 \div 3 = 7
   \]

4. **Check if 7 is a prime number:**  
   7 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 63 is:
\[
63 = 3^2 \times 7
\]

### Possibility 2: Solving an Equation Involving 63

Suppose the problem involves solving an equation like \(x + 63 = 100\).

1. **Isolate \(x\):**  
   \[
   x + 63 = 100
   \]
   Subtract 63 from both sides:  
   \[
   x = 100 - 63
   \]
   \[
   x = 37
   \]

### Possibility 3: Calculating the Square Root of 63

Let's approximate the square root of 63.

1. **Estimate between two perfect squares:**  
   \( \sqrt{64} = 8 \) and \( \sqrt{49} = 7 \).  
   Therefore, \( \sqrt{63} \) is between 7 and 8.

2. **Refine the estimate:**  
   Try \( 7.9 \):  
   \[
   7.9^2 = 62.41
   \]
   Try \( 8.0 \):  
   \[
   8.0^2 = 64
   \]
   Since \( 62.41 < 63 < 64 \), \( \sqrt{63} \approx 7.9 \).

### Conclusion

Without a specific problem statement, I've explored several mathematical concepts involving the number 63. Here are the results:

1. **Prime Factorization:** \( 63 = 3^2 \times 7 \)
2. **Equation Solution:** If \( x + 63 = 100 \), then \( x = 37 \).
3. **Square Root Approximation:** \( \sqrt{63} \approx 7.9 \)

If you have a specific problem involving 63, please provide more details for a precise solution.
