==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 63," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 63" is not a standard or specific math problem, I will assume it refers to a problem involving the number 63. Let's consider a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Factorization of 63
One common type of problem involving a number is to find its prime factorization. Let's factor 63:

1. **Check divisibility by 2**: 63 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
2. **Check divisibility by 3**: Add the digits of 63 (6 + 3 = 9). Since 9 is divisible by 3, 63 is also divisible by 3.
   - Divide 63 by 3: 
     \[
     63 \div 3 = 21
     \]
3. **Factor 21**: 
   - Again, check divisibility by 3: Add the digits of 21 (2 + 1 = 3). Since 3 is divisible by 3, 21 is also divisible by 3.
   - Divide 21 by 3:
     \[
     21 \div 3 = 7
     \]
4. **Factor 7**: 7 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 63 is:
\[
63 = 3^2 \times 7
\]

### Possibility 2: Solve an Equation Involving 63
Another possibility is solving an equation where 63 is a part of the equation. Let's consider a simple linear equation:

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[
2x + 3 = 63
\]

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides**:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 63 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 60
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2**:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{60}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 30
   \]

### Possibility 3: Find the Sum of the Digits of 63
Another simple problem could be finding the sum of the digits of 63:

- The digits of 63 are 6 and 3.
- Sum of the digits:
  \[
  6 + 3 = 9
  \]

### Conclusion
Without a specific problem statement, we explored different mathematical tasks involving the number 63. Here are the results:

1. **Prime Factorization**: \( 63 = 3^2 \times 7 \)
2. **Solution to the Equation \( 2x + 3 = 63 \)**: \( x = 30 \)
3. **Sum of the Digits of 63**: 9
