Question ID: 674
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from its current height of 20 feet to a height of 600 inches.

### Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches.
Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 20 feet to inches:

\[
20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the height increase needed.
Next, we find out how much more height the bamboo needs to reach 600 inches:

\[
600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches.
The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total height increase needed by the daily growth rate:

\[
\frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days}
\]

### Final Answer
It will take **12 days** for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.
