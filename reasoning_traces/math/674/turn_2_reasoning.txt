Question ID: 674
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from its current height of 20 feet to a height of 600 inches.

**Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches.**
- We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.
- Therefore, to convert 20 feet to inches:
  \[
  20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches}
  \]

**Step 2: Determine the target height in inches.**
- The target height is already given as 600 inches.

**Step 3: Calculate the height increase needed.**
- We need to find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches:
  \[
  \text{Height increase needed} = \text{Target height} - \text{Current height}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Height increase needed} = 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches}
  \]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of days required for the bamboo to grow this height.**
- The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find the number of days required to grow 360 inches:
  \[
  \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Height increase needed}}{\text{Growth rate per day}} = \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days}
  \]

**Final Answer:**
It will take Mrs. Jameson's bamboo 12 days to reach a height of 600 inches.
