==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from its current height of 20 feet to a height of 600 inches.

### Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches
Since the target height is given in inches, we first convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches, so:
\[
20 \text{ feet} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the height increase needed
Next, we need to find out how much more height the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches.

Current height = 240 inches  
Target height = 600 inches

The height increase needed is:
\[
600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of days required for the bamboo to grow this height
The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find the number of days required to grow 360 inches, we divide the total height increase needed by the growth rate:

\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Height increase needed}}{\text{Growth rate per day}} = \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, it will take **12 days** for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from 20 feet to 600 inches.
