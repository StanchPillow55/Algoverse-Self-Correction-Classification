To solve the problem, we need to define the time it took for each person to complete their part of the meal.

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the time (in minutes) that Donovan took to complete his part.
- \( B \) as the time (in minutes) that Betsy took to complete her part.

According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part:
   \[
   B = D + 18
   \]

2. The total time taken to make the meal was 98 minutes:
   \[
   B + D = 98
   \]

Now we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation.

Substituting \( B \) in the total time equation:
\[
(D + 18) + D = 98
\]

Now, combine like terms:
\[
2D + 18 = 98
\]

Next, we will isolate \( D \) by first subtracting 18 from both sides:
\[
2D = 98 - 18
\]
\[
2D = 80
\]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):
\[
D = \frac{80}{2} = 40
\]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( B \) using the first equation:
\[
B = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58
\]

Thus, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

Finally, we can summarize our findings:
- Donovan's part took 40 minutes.
- Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

The final answer is:
\[
\text{Betsy's part was } 58 \text{ minutes long.}
\]
