Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 475," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 475" is not specific and doesn't provide any details about what needs to be solved. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem that you intended to provide.

Since I don't have the details of the actual math problem, I will create a hypothetical problem for demonstration purposes and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 475."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of all integers from 1 to 475. This is a classic problem of finding the sum of an arithmetic series.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the last integer in the series.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this problem, \( n = 475 \). Substitute 475 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{475(475 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   First, calculate \( 475 + 1 \):
   \[
   475 + 1 = 476
   \]

   Next, multiply 475 by 476:
   \[
   475 \times 476 = 226100
   \]

   Finally, divide by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S = \frac{226100}{2} = 113050
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of all integers from 1 to 475 is 113050.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all integers from 1 to 475 is 113050.
