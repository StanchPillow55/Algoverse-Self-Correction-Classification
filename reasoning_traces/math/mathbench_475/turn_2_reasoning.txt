==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 475" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem based on the number 475 and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Find the prime factorization of the number 475 and determine if it is a perfect square.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization**  
To find the prime factorization of 475, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime numbers.

1. **Check divisibility by 2:**  
   475 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

2. **Check divisibility by 3:**  
   To check divisibility by 3, sum the digits of 475:  
   \(4 + 7 + 5 = 16\).  
   Since 16 is not divisible by 3, 475 is not divisible by 3.

3. **Check divisibility by 5:**  
   A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5.  
   475 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.  
   Divide 475 by 5:  
   \[
   475 \div 5 = 95
   \]

4. **Factor 95:**  
   Check divisibility of 95 by 5:  
   95 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.  
   Divide 95 by 5:  
   \[
   95 \div 5 = 19
   \]

5. **Check if 19 is a prime number:**  
   19 is a prime number because it is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root (approximately 4.36). The primes to check are 2 and 3, and 19 is not divisible by either.

Thus, the prime factorization of 475 is:  
\[ 475 = 5^2 \times 19 \]

**Step 2: Determine if 475 is a perfect square**  
A number is a perfect square if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even.

In the prime factorization \(5^2 \times 19\), the exponent of 5 is 2 (which is even), but the exponent of 19 is 1 (which is odd). Therefore, 475 is not a perfect square.

**Final Answer:**  
The prime factorization of 475 is \(5^2 \times 19\).  
475 is not a perfect square.
