==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 475," we first need to clarify what the problem actually is. Since "Sample math problem 475" doesn't specify any details, I'll create a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Solution:**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. **Subtract 5 from both sides:**

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 3:**

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

**Verification:**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]

Calculating the left side:

\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
