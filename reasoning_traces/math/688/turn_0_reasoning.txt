==================================================

To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time John needs to complete his homework.**
   - Math homework: 20 minutes
   - Reading homework: 40 minutes
   - History homework: 20 minutes

   We add these times together:
   \[
   \text{Total homework time} = 20 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total homework time} = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Convert the time John has before dinner from hours to minutes.**
   - John has 3 hours before dinner. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert hours to minutes:
   \[
   \text{Time before dinner} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time John has left for a nap after completing his homework.**
   - We subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner:
   \[
   \text{Time for nap} = \text{Time before dinner} - \text{Total homework time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time for nap} = 180 \text{ minutes} - 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time for nap} = 100 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, John has **100 minutes** to nap.

Final answer: **100 minutes**.
