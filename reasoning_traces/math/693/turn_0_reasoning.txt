To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square based on the information provided and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the number of red squares:**
   - Brittany has 14 red squares.
   \[
   \text{Red squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of blue squares:**
   - The problem states that there are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   \[
   \text{Blue squares} = \text{Red squares} + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of green squares:**
   - The problem states that there are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   \[
   \text{Green squares} = \text{Blue squares} + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of white squares:**
   - The problem states that there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   \[
   \text{White squares} = \text{Green squares} - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

5. **Sum all the squares to find the total number of squares:**
   - Now we add the number of squares of each color together.
   \[
   \text{Total squares} = \text{Red squares} + \text{Blue squares} + \text{Green squares} + \text{White squares}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12
   \]

   Let's perform the addition step by step:
   - First, add the red and blue squares:
   \[
   14 + 18 = 32
   \]
   - Next, add the green squares:
   \[
   32 + 24 = 56
   \]
   - Finally, add the white squares:
   \[
   56 + 12 = 68
   \]

Thus, the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter is:
\[
\boxed{68}
\]
