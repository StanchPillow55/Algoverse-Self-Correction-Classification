Question ID: 407
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Eustace and Milford based on the information given. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let's define the variables for the ages of Eustace and Milford:
- Let \( E \) be the current age of Eustace.
- Let \( M \) be the current age of Milford.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations
We have two pieces of information from the problem:
1. Eustace is twice as old as Milford. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   E = 2M
   \]

2. In 3 years, Eustace will be 39 years old. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   E + 3 = 39
   \]

### Step 3: Solve the Equations
First, solve the second equation for \( E \):
\[
E + 3 = 39
\]
Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[
E = 39 - 3
\]
\[
E = 36
\]

Now that we know \( E = 36 \), we can use the first equation to find \( M \):
\[
E = 2M
\]
Substitute \( E = 36 \) into the equation:
\[
36 = 2M
\]
Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( M \):
\[
M = \frac{36}{2}
\]
\[
M = 18
\]

### Conclusion
Milford is currently 18 years old. Therefore, the final answer is:

Milford will be 18 years old.
