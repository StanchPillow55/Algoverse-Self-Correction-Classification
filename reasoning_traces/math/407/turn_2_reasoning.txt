Question ID: 407
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationship between Eustace's age and Milford's age based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( E \) represent Eustace's current age.
   - Let \( M \) represent Milford's current age.

2. **Set Up the Equations**:
   - According to the problem, Eustace is twice as old as Milford:
     \[
     E = 2M
     \]
   - We are also told that in 3 years, Eustace will be 39 years old:
     \[
     E + 3 = 39
     \]

3. **Solve for Eustace's Current Age**:
   - From the equation \( E + 3 = 39 \), we can find Eustace's current age:
     \[
     E = 39 - 3
     \]
     \[
     E = 36
     \]

4. **Substitute Eustace's Age into the First Equation**:
   - Now that we know \( E = 36 \), we can substitute this value into the equation \( E = 2M \):
     \[
     36 = 2M
     \]

5. **Solve for Milford's Age**:
   - To find \( M \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     M = \frac{36}{2}
     \]
     \[
     M = 18
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Milford's current age is \( \boxed{18} \). 

This solution is consistent with the information given in the problem, confirming that Eustace is indeed twice as old as Milford (36 is twice 18) and that in 3 years, Eustace will be 39 years old.
