Question ID: 407
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Eustace and Milford based on the information provided. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( E \) represent Eustace's current age.
   - Let \( M \) represent Milford's current age.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on the Problem:**
   - We are told that Eustace is twice as old as Milford. This gives us the equation:
     \[
     E = 2M
     \]
   - We are also told that in 3 years, Eustace will be 39 years old. This gives us another equation:
     \[
     E + 3 = 39
     \]

3. **Solve for Eustace's Current Age:**
   - From the second equation, solve for \( E \):
     \[
     E + 3 = 39
     \]
     \[
     E = 39 - 3
     \]
     \[
     E = 36
     \]

4. **Use Eustace's Age to Find Milford's Age:**
   - Now that we know \( E = 36 \), we can use the first equation to find \( M \):
     \[
     E = 2M
     \]
     \[
     36 = 2M
     \]
     \[
     M = \frac{36}{2}
     \]
     \[
     M = 18
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Milford is currently 18 years old.

Therefore, the final answer is that Milford is 18 years old.
