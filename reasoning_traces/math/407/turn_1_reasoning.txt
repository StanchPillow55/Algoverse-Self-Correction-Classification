Question ID: 407
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break down the information given step by step and calculate how many steps Elliott took during his jog.

1. **Total Steps Goal**: Elliott is trying to walk a total of 10,000 steps a day.

2. **Steps Completed from School**: We know that Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he is aiming for 10,000 steps, half of that is:
   \[
   \text{Steps from school} = \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

3. **Steps from Short Walk with Friend**: Elliott also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, we add this to the steps he has already taken:
   \[
   \text{Total steps so far} = \text{Steps from school} + \text{Steps from walk with friend} = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

4. **Steps Remaining After Jog**: After finishing his jog, Elliott realized he had only 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means that the total number of steps he had taken before the jog was:
   \[
   \text{Steps before jog} = 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

5. **Calculating Steps Taken During Jog**: We know that before the jog, Elliott had taken 6,000 steps. Therefore, the number of steps he took during his jog can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Steps during jog} = \text{Steps before jog} - \text{Total steps so far} = 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:

\[
\boxed{2000}
\]
