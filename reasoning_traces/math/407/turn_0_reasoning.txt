==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationship between Eustace's age and Milford's age based on the information provided.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( E \) represent Eustace's current age.
   - Let \( M \) represent Milford's current age.

2. **Set Up the Relationships**:
   - According to the problem, Eustace is twice as old as Milford:
     \[
     E = 2M
     \]
   - We also know that in 3 years, Eustace will be 39 years old:
     \[
     E + 3 = 39
     \]

3. **Solve for Eustace's Current Age**:
   - From the equation \( E + 3 = 39 \), we can solve for \( E \):
     \[
     E = 39 - 3
     \]
     \[
     E = 36
     \]

4. **Substitute Eustace's Age into the First Equation**:
   - Now that we know \( E = 36 \), we can substitute this value into the equation \( E = 2M \):
     \[
     36 = 2M
     \]

5. **Solve for Milford's Age**:
   - To find \( M \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     M = \frac{36}{2}
     \]
     \[
     M = 18
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Milford's current age is \( 18 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]
