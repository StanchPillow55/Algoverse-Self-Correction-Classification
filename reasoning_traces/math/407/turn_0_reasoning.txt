To solve the problem, we need to determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog. We will break down the information given step by step.

1. **Total Steps Goal**: Elliott aims to walk a total of 10,000 steps in a day.

2. **Steps Completed from School**: It is stated that he finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he aims for 10,000 steps, half of that is:
   \[
   \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

3. **Additional Steps with a Friend**: Elliott also took an additional 1,000 steps while going for a short walk with his friend. Therefore, the total steps he has taken so far is:
   \[
   5,000 \text{ (from school)} + 1,000 \text{ (with friend)} = 6,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

4. **Remaining Steps**: After completing his school walks and the walk with his friend, he realizes that he has only 2,000 steps left to take to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. We can confirm this by subtracting the steps he has already taken from his total goal:
   \[
   10,000 \text{ (total goal)} - 6,000 \text{ (steps taken)} = 4,000 \text{ steps left}
   \]
   However, the problem states he has only 2,000 steps left after his jog, which means he must have taken some steps during his jog.

5. **Calculating Steps Taken During the Jog**: Let \( x \) be the number of steps Elliott took during his jog. After his jog, he has 2,000 steps left, which means:
   \[
   6,000 \text{ (steps taken)} + x \text{ (jog steps)} = 10,000 - 2,000 \text{ (remaining steps)}
   \]
   Simplifying the right side gives:
   \[
   6,000 + x = 8,000
   \]

6. **Solving for \( x \)**: To find \( x \), we subtract 6,000 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000
   \]

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
\[
\boxed{2,000}
\]
