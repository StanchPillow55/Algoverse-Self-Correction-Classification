==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Eustace and Milford based on the information given. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( E \) represent Eustace's current age.
   - Let \( M \) represent Milford's current age.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on the Problem:**
   - We know from the problem that Eustace is twice as old as Milford. This gives us the equation:
     \[
     E = 2M
     \]
   - We also know that in 3 years, Eustace will be 39 years old. This gives us another equation:
     \[
     E + 3 = 39
     \]

3. **Solve for Eustace's Current Age:**
   - From the second equation, solve for \( E \):
     \[
     E + 3 = 39
     \]
     Subtract 3 from both sides:
     \[
     E = 39 - 3 = 36
     \]
   - So, Eustace is currently 36 years old.

4. **Use Eustace's Age to Find Milford's Age:**
   - We know from the first equation that \( E = 2M \). Substitute \( E = 36 \) into this equation:
     \[
     36 = 2M
     \]
   - Solve for \( M \) by dividing both sides by 2:
     \[
     M = \frac{36}{2} = 18
     \]
   - So, Milford is currently 18 years old.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Milford is currently 18 years old. Therefore, the final answer is:

Milford will be 18 years old.
