==================================================

To determine how many vlogs Emma needs to complete in order to reach her goal of 72 vlogs for the month, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of vlogs Emma has made so far.**
   - For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
   - For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
   - For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

   We can find the total number of vlogs made by adding these amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total vlogs made} = 18 + 21 + 15
   \]

   Let's calculate this step by step:

   - First, add 18 and 21:
     \[
     18 + 21 = 39
     \]
   - Next, add the result to 15:
     \[
     39 + 15 = 54
     \]

   So, Emma has made a total of 54 vlogs so far.

2. **Determine how many more vlogs she needs to reach her goal of 72 vlogs.**
   - We know her monthly goal is 72 vlogs. To find out how many more vlogs she needs, we subtract the total vlogs made from her goal:

   \[
   \text{Vlogs needed} = 72 - 54
   \]

   Now, let's perform the subtraction:

   \[
   72 - 54 = 18
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs for the month.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{18}
\]
