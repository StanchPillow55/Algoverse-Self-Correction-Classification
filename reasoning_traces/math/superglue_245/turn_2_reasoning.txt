==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 245" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. Last month, the company produced a total of 1,000 widgets and made a profit of $5,000. How many of each type of widget did the company produce?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Total widgets produced: \( x + y = 1000 \)
   - Profit equation: Profit = Revenue - Cost
     - Revenue from Type A: \( 10x \)
     - Revenue from Type B: \( 15y \)
     - Total Revenue: \( 10x + 15y \)
     - Cost for Type A: \( 5x \)
     - Cost for Type B: \( 8y \)
     - Total Cost: \( 5x + 8y \)
     - Profit: \( (10x + 15y) - (5x + 8y) = 5000 \)

3. **Simplify the Profit Equation:**
   \[
   10x + 15y - 5x - 8y = 5000
   \]
   \[
   5x + 7y = 5000
   \]

4. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - Equation 1: \( x + y = 1000 \)
   - Equation 2: \( 5x + 7y = 5000 \)

   From Equation 1, express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
   \[
   x = 1000 - y
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 1000 - y \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   5(1000 - y) + 7y = 5000
   \]
   \[
   5000 - 5y + 7y = 5000
   \]
   \[
   2y = 0
   \]
   \[
   y = 0
   \]

5. **Find \( x \):**
   Substitute \( y = 0 \) back into Equation 1:
   \[
   x + 0 = 1000
   \]
   \[
   x = 1000
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The company produced 1000 Type A widgets and 0 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company produced 1000 Type A widgets and 0 Type B widgets.
