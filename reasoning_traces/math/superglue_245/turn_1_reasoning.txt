==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 245" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 245 positive integers.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 245 positive integers. The sequence of these integers is 1, 2, 3, ..., 245.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this problem, \( n = 245 \). Substitute 245 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{245(245 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate Inside the Parentheses:**
   First, calculate \( 245 + 1 \):
   \[
   245 + 1 = 246
   \]

5. **Multiply the Terms:**
   Now multiply 245 by 246:
   \[
   245 \times 246 = 60270
   \]

6. **Divide by 2:**
   Finally, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S = \frac{60270}{2} = 30135
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 245 positive integers is 30,135.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 245 positive integers is 30,135.
