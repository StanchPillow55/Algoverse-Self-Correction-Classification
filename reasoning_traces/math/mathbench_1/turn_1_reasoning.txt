Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Sure! Let's work through a sample math problem step by step. Since you haven't provided a specific math problem, I'll create a simple one for demonstration purposes.

**Problem:** Calculate the area of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 5 units.

### Step 1: Understand the Formula for Area
The area \( A \) of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula:
\[
A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
\]

### Step 2: Identify the Given Values
From the problem, we know:
- Length = 8 units
- Width = 5 units

### Step 3: Substitute the Values into the Formula
Now, we will substitute the given values into the area formula:
\[
A = 8 \times 5
\]

### Step 4: Perform the Calculation
Next, we perform the multiplication:
\[
A = 40
\]

### Step 5: State the Final Answer
The area of the rectangle is:
\[
\boxed{40} \text{ square units}
\]

This concludes the problem-solving process. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide it, and I will work through it in a similar step-by-step manner!
