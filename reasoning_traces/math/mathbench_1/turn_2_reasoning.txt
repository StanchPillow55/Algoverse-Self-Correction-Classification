Sure! Let's work through a sample math problem step by step. Since you haven't provided a specific math problem, I'll create a simple one for demonstration purposes.

**Problem:**  
A rectangle has a length of 10 meters and a width of 5 meters. What is the area of the rectangle?

**Step 1: Understand the formula for the area of a rectangle.**  
The area \( A \) of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula:
\[
A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
\]

**Step 2: Identify the values given in the problem.**  
From the problem, we know:
- Length = 10 meters
- Width = 5 meters

**Step 3: Substitute the values into the formula.**  
Now we will substitute the length and width into the area formula:
\[
A = 10 \, \text{meters} \times 5 \, \text{meters}
\]

**Step 4: Perform the multiplication.**  
Calculating the area:
\[
A = 10 \times 5 = 50 \, \text{square meters}
\]

**Step 5: State the final answer.**  
The area of the rectangle is:
\[
\boxed{50 \, \text{square meters}}
\]

This concludes the problem-solving process. If you have a specific math problem you'd like me to solve, please provide it, and I'll be happy to assist!
