==================================================

To solve the problem, we need more specific information about "Sample math problem 149." However, since no specific details are provided, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem step by step. Let's assume a common type of math problem: solving a quadratic equation.

**Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**
The standard form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\).
For the equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\), the coefficients are:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula.**
The quadratic formula is given by:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the discriminant.**
The discriminant \(\Delta\) is \(b^2 - 4ac\).
\[
\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
\]

**Step 4: Substitute into the quadratic formula.**
Since the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions.
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

**Step 5: Solve for the two possible values of \(x\).**

1. **First solution:**
   \[
   x = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
   \]

2. **Second solution:**
   \[
   x = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

This is a complete step-by-step solution to a sample quadratic equation problem. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 149," please provide the details, and I can solve that particular problem for you.
