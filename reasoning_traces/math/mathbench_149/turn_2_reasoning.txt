==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 149" entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem 149:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Since the length is 3 times the width, the length \( l \) can be expressed as \( l = 3w \).

2. **Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 48 units, so:
     \[
     2l + 2w = 48
     \]

3. **Substitute the Expression for Length:**
   - Substitute \( l = 3w \) into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(3w) + 2w = 48
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     6w + 2w = 48
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     8w = 48
     \]

5. **Solve for Width:**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

6. **Find the Length:**
   - Use the expression for length \( l = 3w \) to find \( l \):
     \[
     l = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     2l + 2w = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 6 units and a length of 18 units.
