==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 149" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 149" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 149" is the following:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

Step 1: Define the variables.
- Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
- Since the length is 3 times the width, the length \( l \) can be expressed as \( l = 3w \).

Step 2: Write the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle.
- The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
  \[
  P = 2l + 2w
  \]

Step 3: Substitute the known values into the perimeter formula.
- We know the perimeter is 48 units, so:
  \[
  48 = 2(3w) + 2w
  \]

Step 4: Simplify and solve the equation for \( w \).
- Distribute the 2 in the equation:
  \[
  48 = 6w + 2w
  \]
- Combine like terms:
  \[
  48 = 8w
  \]
- Solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides by 8:
  \[
  w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
  \]

Step 5: Find the length using the width.
- Since \( l = 3w \), substitute \( w = 6 \) into the equation for \( l \):
  \[
  l = 3 \times 6 = 18
  \]

Step 6: Verify the solution.
- Check that the perimeter with these dimensions is correct:
  \[
  P = 2l + 2w = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
  \]
- The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 6 units and a length of 18 units.
