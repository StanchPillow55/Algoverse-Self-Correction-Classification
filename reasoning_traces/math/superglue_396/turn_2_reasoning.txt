Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 396" could entail. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that involves multiple steps of reasoning and calculation. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of products: A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $30, and the profit from each unit of product B is $50. The company can produce a maximum of 200 units of product A and 150 units of product B per month. However, due to a supply constraint, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 300 units per month. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to use linear programming, a method to achieve the best outcome in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - We want to maximize the profit, \( P \), which is given by:
     \[
     P = 30x + 50y
     \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 200 \quad \text{(cannot produce more than 200 units of A)}
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 150 \quad \text{(cannot produce more than 150 units of B)}
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 300 \quad \text{(total production cannot exceed 300 units)}
     \]
   - Non-negativity constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is the area where all constraints overlap.

5. **Identify the Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are where the lines intersect:
     - Intersection of \( x = 200 \) and \( x + y = 300 \): \( (200, 100) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 150 \) and \( x + y = 300 \): \( (150, 150) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 150 \): \( (0, 150) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 200 \) and \( y = 0 \): \( (200, 0) \)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(200, 100) = 30(200) + 50(100) = 6000 + 5000 = 11000 \)
   - \( P(150, 150) = 30(150) + 50(150) = 4500 + 7500 = 12000 \)
   - \( P(0, 150) = 30(0) + 50(150) = 0 + 7500 = 7500 \)
   - \( P(200, 0) = 30(200) + 50(0) = 6000 + 0 = 6000 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit of $12,000 occurs at the point \( (150, 150) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 150 units of product A and 150 units of product B, resulting in a maximum profit of $12,000.
