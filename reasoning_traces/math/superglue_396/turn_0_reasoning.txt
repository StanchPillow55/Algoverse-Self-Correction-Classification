==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 396" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem to solve:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to find the length and width of the rectangle.

1. **Understand the relationship between length and width:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Since the length is 3 times the width, the length \( l \) can be expressed as \( l = 3w \).

2. **Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 48 units, so we can set up the equation:
     \[
     2l + 2w = 48
     \]

3. **Substitute the expression for the length into the perimeter equation:**
   - Replace \( l \) with \( 3w \) in the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(3w) + 2w = 48
     \]

4. **Simplify and solve for \( w \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     6w + 2w = 48
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     8w = 48
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

5. **Find the length using the width:**
   - Since \( l = 3w \), substitute \( w = 6 \) into the equation for \( l \):
     \[
     l = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

6. **Verify the solution:**
   - Check that the perimeter is correct with these dimensions:
     \[
     2l + 2w = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 6 units and a length of 18 units.
