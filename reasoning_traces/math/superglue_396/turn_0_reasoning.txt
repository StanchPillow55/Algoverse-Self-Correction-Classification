==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 396" entails. Since the question is not explicitly defined, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A train travels from Station A to Station B at a speed of 60 km/h. After reaching Station B, it immediately returns to Station A at a speed of 90 km/h. The total round trip takes 5 hours. What is the distance between Station A and Station B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between Station A and Station B in kilometers.

2. **Calculate Time for Each Leg of the Trip:**
   - Time taken to travel from Station A to Station B at 60 km/h: 
     \[
     \text{Time}_{AB} = \frac{d}{60}
     \]
   - Time taken to travel from Station B to Station A at 90 km/h:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{BA} = \frac{d}{90}
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation for Total Time:**
   - The total time for the round trip is given as 5 hours. Therefore, we can write:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{90} = 5
     \]

4. **Find a Common Denominator:**
   - The common denominator for 60 and 90 is 180. Rewrite the equation with this common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{3d}{180} + \frac{2d}{180} = 5
     \]

5. **Combine the Fractions:**
   - Combine the fractions on the left side:
     \[
     \frac{3d + 2d}{180} = 5
     \]
     \[
     \frac{5d}{180} = 5
     \]

6. **Solve for \( d \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 180 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     5d = 5 \times 180
     \]
     \[
     5d = 900
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( d \):
     \[
     d = \frac{900}{5}
     \]
     \[
     d = 180
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between Station A and Station B is 180 kilometers.

**Final Answer:**
The distance between Station A and Station B is 180 kilometers.
