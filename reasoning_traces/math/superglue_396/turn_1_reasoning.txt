==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 396" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without additional context or details, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company has a budget of $400 for production. Additionally, the company needs to produce at least 30 units in total. How many units of each type should the company produce to maximize the number of units produced within the budget?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up the Constraints:**
   - The total production cost should not exceed the budget: 
     \[
     5x + 8y \leq 400
     \]
   - The total number of units produced should be at least 30:
     \[
     x + y \geq 30
     \]
   - Non-negativity constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

3. **Objective:**
   - Maximize the total number of units produced, \( x + y \).

4. **Graphical Solution Method:**
   - First, graph the inequality \( 5x + 8y \leq 400 \).
     - Find intercepts: 
       - If \( x = 0 \), then \( 8y = 400 \) \(\Rightarrow y = 50\).
       - If \( y = 0 \), then \( 5x = 400 \) \(\Rightarrow x = 80\).
     - Plot the line through (0, 50) and (80, 0).

   - Next, graph the inequality \( x + y \geq 30 \).
     - Find intercepts:
       - If \( x = 0 \), then \( y = 30 \).
       - If \( y = 0 \), then \( x = 30 \).
     - Plot the line through (0, 30) and (30, 0).

5. **Identify Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible region is the area where both constraints overlap, including the non-negativity constraints.

6. **Find Corner Points:**
   - Solve the system of equations to find intersection points:
     - \( 5x + 8y = 400 \)
     - \( x + y = 30 \)

   - Substitute \( y = 30 - x \) into \( 5x + 8y = 400 \):
     \[
     5x + 8(30 - x) = 400
     \]
     \[
     5x + 240 - 8x = 400
     \]
     \[
     -3x = 160 \Rightarrow x = -\frac{160}{3} \quad (\text{not feasible since } x \geq 0)
     \]

   - Check other intersections:
     - Intersection of \( 5x + 8y = 400 \) and \( x = 0 \): \( y = 50 \)
     - Intersection of \( 5x + 8y = 400 \) and \( y = 0 \): \( x = 80 \)
     - Intersection of \( x + y = 30 \) and \( x = 0 \): \( y = 30 \)
     - Intersection of \( x + y = 30 \) and \( y = 0 \): \( x = 30 \)

7. **Evaluate Objective Function at Corner Points:**
   - \( (0, 50) \): \( x + y = 50 \)
   - \( (30, 0) \): \( x + y = 30 \)
   - \( (0, 30) \): \( x + y = 30 \)

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum number of units produced is 50 when \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 50 \).

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 0 units of Type A and 50 units of Type B to maximize the number of units produced within the budget.
