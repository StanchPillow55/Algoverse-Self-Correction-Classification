==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 396" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that involves logical reasoning and calculations. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem Statement:**  
A company produces two types of products: A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $3, and the profit from each unit of product B is $5. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 150 units per day. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced per day.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced per day.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - We want to maximize the profit \( P \), which is given by:
     \[
     P = 3x + 5y
     \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 100 \quad \text{(maximum units of A)}
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 80 \quad \text{(maximum units of B)}
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 150 \quad \text{(total production constraint)}
     \]
   - Additionally, \( x \) and \( y \) must be non-negative:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines \( x = 100 \), \( y = 80 \), and \( x + y = 150 \).

5. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are found by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the lines:
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \):  
       \[
       x = 100, \quad y = 150 - 100 = 50 \quad \Rightarrow (100, 50)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \):  
       \[
       y = 80, \quad x = 150 - 80 = 70 \quad \Rightarrow (70, 80)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( y = 80 \):  
       \[
       (100, 80)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \):  
       \[
       (0, 0)
       \]

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(100, 50) = 3(100) + 5(50) = 300 + 250 = 550 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 3(70) + 5(80) = 210 + 400 = 610 \)
   - \( P(100, 80) = 3(100) + 5(80) = 300 + 400 = 700 \)
   - \( P(0, 0) = 3(0) + 5(0) = 0 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the point \( (100, 80) \) with a profit of $700.

### Final Answer:
To maximize profit, the company should produce 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day, resulting in a maximum profit of $700.
