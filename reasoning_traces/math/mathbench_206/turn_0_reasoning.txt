==================================================

It seems like you've mentioned "Sample math problem 206," but without specific details of the problem, I can't provide a solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine the information given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, using a formula).
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and signs.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for any arithmetic errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's solve a sample problem using the above approach:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- We can isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
1. Start with the equation: 
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 4: Check Your Work**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
