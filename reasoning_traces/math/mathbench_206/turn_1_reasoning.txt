==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 206," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 206" is not specific enough for us to determine what the actual math problem is. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that isn't provided here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 206" refers to a typical math problem that we might encounter. Since we don't have the actual problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Let's assume "Sample math problem 206" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's a sample problem:

Solve the quadratic equation: \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the quadratic equation:**
   The given quadratic equation is \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

2. **Simplify the equation:**
   First, we can simplify the equation by dividing all terms by 2 to make the coefficients smaller:
   \[
   x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
   \]

3. **Factor the quadratic equation:**
   We need to factor the quadratic equation. We are looking for two numbers that multiply to \(-3\) (the constant term) and add to \(-2\) (the coefficient of the linear term).

   The numbers that satisfy these conditions are \(-3\) and \(1\). Therefore, we can factor the quadratic as:
   \[
   (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 1 = 0
   \]

   Solving these equations gives:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]

5. **Verify the solutions:**
   Substitute \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\) back into the original equation to verify:

   - For \(x = 3\):
     \[
     2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
     \]
     This is correct.

   - For \(x = -1\):
     \[
     2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
     \]
     This is also correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

If "Sample math problem 206" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context of the problem, and I will be happy to solve it accordingly.
