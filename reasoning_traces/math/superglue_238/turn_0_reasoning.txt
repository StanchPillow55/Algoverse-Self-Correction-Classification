==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 238." Since the question itself isn't provided, I'll walk you through a general approach to solving a math problem by breaking it down into steps. If you have specific details or numbers from the problem, please share them, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.

### General Approach to Solving a Math Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that could be used to solve the problem. This might include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Looking for patterns.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps youâ€™ve planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if the answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Re-calculate if necessary to ensure accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's consider a simple example problem to illustrate these steps:

**Example Problem:**
A car travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. How far does it travel in 3 hours?

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the distance traveled by the car.
- Given: Speed = 60 miles per hour, Time = 3 hours.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- Use the formula for distance: \(\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}\).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Substitute the given values into the formula:
  \[
  \text{Distance} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
  \]

**Step 4: Review/Check Your Work**
- Check the calculation: \(60 \times 3 = 180\).
- The units are consistent (miles per hour and hours), resulting in miles.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The car travels 180 miles in 3 hours.

If you provide the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 238," I can apply this structured approach to solve that particular problem.
