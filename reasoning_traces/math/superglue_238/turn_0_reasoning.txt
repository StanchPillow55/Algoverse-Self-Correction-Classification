==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 238." Since the question isn't provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step-by-step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we want to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to remove the constant:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or question number in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem for you.
