==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 238" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem and demonstrate a structured approach to solving it.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 238" is a typical math problem involving algebra, geometry, or arithmetic. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We are given a linear equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies this equation.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to get:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This structured approach can be applied to a wide range of math problems by understanding the problem, isolating the variable, solving, verifying, and stating the final answer.
