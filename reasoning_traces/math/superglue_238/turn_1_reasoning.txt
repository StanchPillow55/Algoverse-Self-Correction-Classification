==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 238" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and mathematical calculations. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
A store sells two types of candies: chocolate and gummy bears. The price of a chocolate is $2, and the price of a gummy bear is $1.50. A customer buys a total of 20 candies and spends $32. How many chocolates and gummy bears did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolates.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of gummy bears.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of candies is 20: 
     \[
     x + y = 20
     \]
   - The total cost is $32:
     \[
     2x + 1.5y = 32
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{cases} 
   x + y = 20 \\
   2x + 1.5y = 32 
   \end{cases}
   \]

   From the first equation, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 20 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 20 - x \) into the second equation:
   \[
   2x + 1.5(20 - x) = 32
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 30 - 1.5x = 32
   \]
   \[
   0.5x + 30 = 32
   \]
   \[
   0.5x = 2
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{2}{0.5} = 4
   \]

4. **Find \( y \):**

   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the equation \( y = 20 - x \):
   \[
   y = 20 - 4 = 16
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the total cost:
   \[
   2x + 1.5y = 2(4) + 1.5(16) = 8 + 24 = 32
   \]

   The calculations are correct, and the conditions of the problem are satisfied.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 4 chocolates and 16 gummy bears.
