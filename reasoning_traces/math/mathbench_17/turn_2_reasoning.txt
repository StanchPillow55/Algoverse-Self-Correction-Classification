Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 17" entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 17" and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Sample math problem 17: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we have \( 3x = 15 \). To isolate \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 3:

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
