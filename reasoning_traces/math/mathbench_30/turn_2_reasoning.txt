==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 30" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I will assume it refers to a generic math problem that involves the number 30. Let's create a problem involving the number 30 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**
Find the sum of all positive divisors of the number 30.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Divisors of 30:**
   - A divisor is a number that divides another number completely without leaving a remainder.
   - To find the divisors of 30, we start with 1 and go up to 30, checking which numbers divide 30 evenly.
   - The divisors of 30 are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.

2. **Verify Each Divisor:**
   - 1 divides 30: \(30 \div 1 = 30\)
   - 2 divides 30: \(30 \div 2 = 15\)
   - 3 divides 30: \(30 \div 3 = 10\)
   - 5 divides 30: \(30 \div 5 = 6\)
   - 6 divides 30: \(30 \div 6 = 5\)
   - 10 divides 30: \(30 \div 10 = 3\)
   - 15 divides 30: \(30 \div 15 = 2\)
   - 30 divides 30: \(30 \div 30 = 1\)

3. **Sum the Divisors:**
   - Add all the divisors together: \(1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 10 + 15 + 30\).

4. **Perform the Addition:**
   - \(1 + 2 = 3\)
   - \(3 + 3 = 6\)
   - \(6 + 5 = 11\)
   - \(11 + 6 = 17\)
   - \(17 + 10 = 27\)
   - \(27 + 15 = 42\)
   - \(42 + 30 = 72\)

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of all positive divisors of 30 is 72.

Therefore, the final answer is 72.
