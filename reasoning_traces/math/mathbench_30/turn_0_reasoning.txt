==================================================

Certainly! However, the phrase "Sample math problem 30" doesn't provide enough information about the specific math problem you're referring to. To help you effectively, I'll need more details about the problem itself. 

If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details or the full problem statement. Once I have that, I can work through the problem step by step, showing all calculations and reasoning, and provide you with the final answer.
