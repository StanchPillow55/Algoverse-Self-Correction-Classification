It seems like you've provided a placeholder or an incomplete problem statement: "Sample math problem 30." To assist you effectively, I need a specific math problem or question to solve. However, I can create a sample math problem and solve it step-by-step for you. Let's proceed with that:

**Sample Math Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Term with \( x \):**
   To isolate the term with \( x \), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. The constant term here is \( 5 \).

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract \( 5 \) from both sides of the equation:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is \( 3 \).

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
