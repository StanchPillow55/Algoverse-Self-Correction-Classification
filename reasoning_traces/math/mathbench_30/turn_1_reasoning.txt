==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 30," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 30." Without additional context or details, it's challenging to provide a specific solution. 

Let's assume that "Sample math problem 30" refers to a generic math problem involving the number 30. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Find the sum of all positive divisors of the number 30.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Divisors of 30:**
   - A divisor is a number that divides another number completely without leaving a remainder.
   - To find the divisors of 30, we start from 1 and go up to 30, checking which numbers divide 30 evenly.
   - The divisors of 30 are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.

2. **Verify the Divisors:**
   - \(30 \div 1 = 30\) (remainder 0)
   - \(30 \div 2 = 15\) (remainder 0)
   - \(30 \div 3 = 10\) (remainder 0)
   - \(30 \div 5 = 6\) (remainder 0)
   - \(30 \div 6 = 5\) (remainder 0)
   - \(30 \div 10 = 3\) (remainder 0)
   - \(30 \div 15 = 2\) (remainder 0)
   - \(30 \div 30 = 1\) (remainder 0)

3. **Sum the Divisors:**
   - Add all the divisors together: \(1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 10 + 15 + 30\).

4. **Perform the Addition:**
   - \(1 + 2 = 3\)
   - \(3 + 3 = 6\)
   - \(6 + 5 = 11\)
   - \(11 + 6 = 17\)
   - \(17 + 10 = 27\)
   - \(27 + 15 = 42\)
   - \(42 + 30 = 72\)

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of all positive divisors of 30 is 72.

Thus, if the problem was to find the sum of all positive divisors of 30, the final answer would be 72. If you have a different or specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you accurately.
