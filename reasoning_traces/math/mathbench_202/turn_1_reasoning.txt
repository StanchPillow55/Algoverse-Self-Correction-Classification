==================================================

Certainly! Let's tackle a sample math problem step by step. Since the problem is labeled "Sample math problem 202," I'll create a hypothetical problem to solve. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to move the constant term to the right side:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to check if both sides are equal.

   Original equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)

   Substitute \( x = 5 \):

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplify the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
