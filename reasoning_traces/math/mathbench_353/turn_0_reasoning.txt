==================================================

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or missing information in your request. "Sample math problem 353" doesn't provide enough detail for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a generic math problem-solving process. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details. For now, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Let's solve the following algebraic equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to remove the constant term from the left side:

     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]

     Simplifying both sides gives:

     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, we need to isolate \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]

     Simplifying both sides gives:

     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]

     Simplifying the left side gives:

     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]

     Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
