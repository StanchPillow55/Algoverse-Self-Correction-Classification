To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of buildings that collapsed after a series of earthquakes, starting with the first earthquake where 4 buildings collapsed.

1. **First Earthquake**:
   - Number of buildings that collapsed: 4

2. **Second Earthquake**:
   - According to the problem, each subsequent earthquake causes double the number of buildings to collapse compared to the previous earthquake.
   - Therefore, for the second earthquake:
     \[
     \text{Buildings collapsed} = 2 \times 4 = 8
     \]

3. **Third Earthquake**:
   - Again, we double the number of buildings that collapsed in the second earthquake:
     \[
     \text{Buildings collapsed} = 2 \times 8 = 16
     \]

4. **Fourth Earthquake**:
   - We continue this pattern for the fourth earthquake:
     \[
     \text{Buildings collapsed} = 2 \times 16 = 32
     \]

Now, we have the number of buildings that collapsed in each earthquake:
- First earthquake: 4 buildings
- Second earthquake: 8 buildings
- Third earthquake: 16 buildings
- Fourth earthquake: 32 buildings

5. **Total Buildings Collapsed**:
   - To find the total number of buildings that collapsed after all four earthquakes, we sum the buildings collapsed from each earthquake:
   \[
   \text{Total} = 4 + 8 + 16 + 32
   \]

   Let's calculate this step by step:
   - First, add 4 and 8:
     \[
     4 + 8 = 12
     \]
   - Next, add 12 and 16:
     \[
     12 + 16 = 28
     \]
   - Finally, add 28 and 32:
     \[
     28 + 32 = 60
     \]

Thus, the total number of buildings that collapsed after the first earthquake and the subsequent three earthquakes is **60**.

**Final Answer**: 60 buildings collapsed.
