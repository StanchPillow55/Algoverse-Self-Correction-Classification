==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many grams of chips you can eat without exceeding your daily calorie target of 2000 calories, given that you have already consumed 1800 calories.

### Step 1: Calculate Remaining Calories
First, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume:

\[
\text{Remaining calories} = \text{Daily calorie target} - \text{Calories consumed}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining calories} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 2: Determine Calories per Serving of Chips
Next, we know that a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. Since the bag contains 5 servings, we can confirm the total calories in the bag:

\[
\text{Total calories in the bag} = \text{Calories per serving} \times \text{Number of servings}
\]
\[
\text{Total calories in the bag} = 250 \times 5 = 1250 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Calories per Gram of Chips
Now, we need to find out how many calories are in each gram of chips. The total weight of the bag is 300 grams, so:

\[
\text{Calories per gram} = \frac{\text{Total calories in the bag}}{\text{Total weight of the bag}}
\]
\[
\text{Calories per gram} = \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.1667 \text{ calories/gram}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate How Many Grams You Can Eat
Now, we can determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. We will use the calories per gram calculated above:

\[
\text{Grams of chips} = \frac{\text{Remaining calories}}{\text{Calories per gram}}
\]
\[
\text{Grams of chips} = \frac{200}{4.1667} \approx 48 \text{ grams}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, you can eat approximately **48 grams** of chips without exceeding your daily calorie target of 2000 calories.
