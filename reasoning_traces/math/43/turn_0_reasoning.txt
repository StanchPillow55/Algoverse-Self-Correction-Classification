==================================================

Let's start by understanding the pattern of the number of buildings collapsing. 

In the first earthquake, 4 buildings collapsed. 

According to the problem, each subsequent earthquake doubles the number of buildings that collapse compared to the previous earthquake. 

So, in the second earthquake, 2 * 4 = 8 buildings would collapse.

In the third earthquake, we double the number of buildings that collapsed in the second earthquake, so 2 * 8 = 16 buildings would collapse.

In the fourth earthquake, we again double the number of buildings that collapsed in the third earthquake, so 2 * 16 = 32 buildings would collapse.

To find the total number of buildings that collapsed, we add the number of buildings that collapsed in each earthquake:

4 (from the first earthquake) + 8 (from the second earthquake) + 16 (from the third earthquake) + 32 (from the fourth earthquake) = 60 buildings

So, a total of 60 buildings collapsed after all four earthquakes.
