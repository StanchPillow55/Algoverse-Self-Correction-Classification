==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the number of buildings collapsing after each earthquake. According to the problem, each earthquake causes double the number of buildings to collapse compared to the previous one.

Let's start with the first earthquake. We know that it caused four buildings to collapse.

For the second earthquake, the number of collapsing buildings would be double the number from the first earthquake. So, we calculate 4 (from the first earthquake) times 2, which equals 8.

For the third earthquake, the number of collapsing buildings would be double the number from the second earthquake. So, we calculate 8 (from the second earthquake) times 2, which equals 16.

For the fourth earthquake, the number of collapsing buildings would be double the number from the third earthquake. So, we calculate 16 (from the third earthquake) times 2, which equals 32.

To find the total number of buildings that collapsed, we add the number of buildings that collapsed in each earthquake. So, we calculate 4 (from the first earthquake) + 8 (from the second earthquake) + 16 (from the third earthquake) + 32 (from the fourth earthquake), which equals 60.

Therefore, a total of 60 buildings had collapsed after the four earthquakes.
