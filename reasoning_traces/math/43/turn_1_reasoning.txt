Question ID: 43
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many grams of chips you can eat given your daily calorie target and what you have already consumed.

1. **Determine Remaining Calories**:
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

2. **Calories per Serving of Chips**:
   - The bag of chips has 250 calories per serving.
   - Since the bag contains 5 servings, the total calories in the bag = 250 calories/serving Ã— 5 servings = 1250 calories.

3. **Calculate the Number of Servings You Can Consume**:
   - To find out how many servings you can consume with the remaining 200 calories:
   \[
   \text{Servings you can consume} = \frac{\text{Remaining calories}}{\text{Calories per serving}} = \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \text{ servings}
   \]

4. **Convert Servings to Grams**:
   - Since the bag contains 300 grams and has 5 servings, each serving weighs:
   \[
   \text{Weight per serving} = \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ grams/serving}
   \]
   - Now, calculate the weight of 0.8 servings:
   \[
   \text{Weight of chips you can eat} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 60 \text{ grams/serving} = 48 \text{ grams}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - You can eat **48 grams** of chips.

Thus, the final answer is **48 grams**.
