==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 324" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I'll assume it involves the number 324 and explore a few mathematical aspects related to it. Let's consider a few possibilities:

### 1. **Prime Factorization of 324:**

To find the prime factorization of 324, we start by dividing by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. \( 324 \div 2 = 162 \)
2. \( 162 \div 2 = 81 \)
3. \( 81 \div 3 = 27 \)
4. \( 27 \div 3 = 9 \)
5. \( 9 \div 3 = 3 \)
6. \( 3 \div 3 = 1 \)

Thus, the prime factorization of 324 is:
\[ 324 = 2^2 \times 3^4 \]

### 2. **Square Root of 324:**

Since 324 is a perfect square, we can find its square root.

To find the square root of 324, we can use the prime factorization:
\[ \sqrt{324} = \sqrt{2^2 \times 3^4} \]

Using the property of square roots, \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\), we have:
\[ \sqrt{324} = \sqrt{2^2} \times \sqrt{3^4} \]
\[ \sqrt{324} = 2 \times 3^2 \]
\[ \sqrt{324} = 2 \times 9 \]
\[ \sqrt{324} = 18 \]

### 3. **Sum of Digits of 324:**

Let's find the sum of the digits of 324.

The digits of 324 are 3, 2, and 4. Adding these gives:
\[ 3 + 2 + 4 = 9 \]

### 4. **Checking if 324 is a Perfect Square:**

We already found that the square root of 324 is 18, which is an integer. Therefore, 324 is indeed a perfect square.

### Conclusion:

Based on the exploration above, here are the key points about the number 324:

- The prime factorization of 324 is \(2^2 \times 3^4\).
- The square root of 324 is 18.
- The sum of the digits of 324 is 9.
- 324 is a perfect square.

If the problem was specifically about one of these aspects, the final answer would depend on that context. However, given the general exploration, the final answer is:

**The square root of 324 is 18.**
