==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of running Kim's TV for a week, given the power consumption, daily usage, and electricity cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh).**

1. The TV uses 125 watts of electricity per hour.
2. Kim runs the TV for 4 hours a day.

First, calculate the daily energy consumption in watt-hours:
\[ \text{Daily energy consumption (Wh)} = 125 \, \text{watts} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 500 \, \text{Wh} \]

Convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours:
\[ \text{Daily energy consumption (kWh)} = \frac{500 \, \text{Wh}}{1000} = 0.5 \, \text{kWh} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the weekly energy consumption in kilowatt-hours.**

Since there are 7 days in a week, multiply the daily energy consumption by 7:
\[ \text{Weekly energy consumption (kWh)} = 0.5 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 3.5 \, \text{kWh} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the weekly energy consumption.**

The cost of electricity is 14 cents per kilowatt-hour. Therefore, the cost for 3.5 kWh is:
\[ \text{Cost (cents)} = 3.5 \, \text{kWh} \times 14 \, \text{cents/kWh} = 49 \, \text{cents} \]

**Final Answer:**

The cost to run Kim's TV for a week is 49 cents.
