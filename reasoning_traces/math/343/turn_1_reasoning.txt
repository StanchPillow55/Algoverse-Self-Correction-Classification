Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of running Kim's TV for a week, given the power consumption, the duration of use per day, and the cost of electricity.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the daily energy consumption of the TV:**

   The TV uses 125 watts per hour. Since Kim runs it for 4 hours a day, we calculate the daily energy consumption in watt-hours (Wh):

   \[
   \text{Daily energy consumption} = 125 \, \text{watts} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 500 \, \text{Wh}
   \]

2. **Convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours:**

   Since electricity costs are given in kilowatt-hours (kWh), we need to convert the daily energy consumption from watt-hours to kilowatt-hours. There are 1000 watts in a kilowatt, so:

   \[
   \text{Daily energy consumption in kWh} = \frac{500 \, \text{Wh}}{1000} = 0.5 \, \text{kWh}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weekly energy consumption:**

   Kim uses the TV for 7 days a week, so we calculate the weekly energy consumption:

   \[
   \text{Weekly energy consumption} = 0.5 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 3.5 \, \text{kWh}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of electricity for a week:**

   The cost of electricity is 14 cents per kWh. Therefore, the cost to run the TV for a week is:

   \[
   \text{Weekly cost} = 3.5 \, \text{kWh} \times 14 \, \text{cents/kWh} = 49 \, \text{cents}
   \]

### Final Answer:

The cost to run Kim's TV for a week is **49 cents**.
