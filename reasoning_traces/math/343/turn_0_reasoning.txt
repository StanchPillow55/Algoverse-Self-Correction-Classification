To determine how much it costs Kim to run her TV for a week, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily energy consumption of the TV in kilowatt-hours (kWh)**:
   - The TV uses 125 watts. To convert watts to kilowatts, we divide by 1000:
     \[
     \text{Power in kW} = \frac{125 \text{ watts}}{1000} = 0.125 \text{ kW}
     \]
   - Kim runs the TV for 4 hours a day. Therefore, the daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     \text{Daily energy consumption} = \text{Power in kW} \times \text{Hours per day} = 0.125 \text{ kW} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ kWh}
     \]

2. **Calculate the weekly energy consumption**:
   - There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly energy consumption is:
     \[
     \text{Weekly energy consumption} = \text{Daily energy consumption} \times 7 = 0.5 \text{ kWh} \times 7 = 3.5 \text{ kWh}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of running the TV for a week**:
   - The cost of electricity is 14 cents per kWh. Therefore, the total cost for running the TV for a week is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Weekly energy consumption} \times \text{Cost per kWh} = 3.5 \text{ kWh} \times 14 \text{ cents/kWh}
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 3.5 \times 14 = 49 \text{ cents}
     \]

Thus, the cost for Kim to run her TV for a week is **49 cents**. 

Final answer: **49 cents**.
