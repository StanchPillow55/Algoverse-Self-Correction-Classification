==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many meters Tyson would run each day if he follows his coach's advice, and then calculate the total distance he would cover in June.

### Step 1: Calculate the increased daily distance
Tyson currently runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more than this amount.

First, we need to calculate \( \frac{1}{5} \) of 5000 meters:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters}
\]

Now, we add this amount to his original daily distance:

\[
5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters}
\]

So, if Tyson follows his coach's advice, he will run **6000 meters** each day.

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance for the month of June
June has 30 days. To find the total distance Tyson would run in June, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days in June:

\[
6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total distance Tyson would cover in June, if he follows his coach's advice, is:

\[
\boxed{180000} \text{ meters}
\]
