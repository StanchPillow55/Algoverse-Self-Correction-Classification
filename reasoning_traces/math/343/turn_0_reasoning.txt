To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of running Kim's TV for a week based on the given electricity usage and cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the daily electricity usage of the TV in kilowatt-hours (kWh):**

   - The TV uses 125 watts per hour.
   - Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the power usage to kilowatts:
     \[
     \text{Power in kW} = \frac{125 \text{ watts}}{1000} = 0.125 \text{ kW}
     \]

   - Kim runs the TV for 4 hours a day. Therefore, the daily electricity usage in kWh is:
     \[
     \text{Daily usage in kWh} = 0.125 \text{ kW} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ kWh}
     \]

2. **Calculate the weekly electricity usage in kWh:**

   - There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly usage is:
     \[
     \text{Weekly usage in kWh} = 0.5 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 3.5 \text{ kWh}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of electricity for a week:**

   - The cost of electricity is 14 cents per kWh.
   - Therefore, the weekly cost is:
     \[
     \text{Weekly cost in cents} = 3.5 \text{ kWh} \times 14 \text{ cents/kWh} = 49 \text{ cents}
     \]

### Final Answer:

The cost to run Kim's TV for a week is **49 cents**.
