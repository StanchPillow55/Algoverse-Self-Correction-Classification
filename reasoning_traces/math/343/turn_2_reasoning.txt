Question ID: 343
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of running Kim's TV for a week, given the power consumption, daily usage, and electricity cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh).**

Kim's TV uses 125 watts per hour. To convert this to kilowatts, we divide by 1000 (since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts):

\[ 
125 \text{ watts} = \frac{125}{1000} \text{ kilowatts} = 0.125 \text{ kW}
\]

Kim runs the TV for 4 hours a day. Therefore, the daily energy consumption in kilowatt-hours is:

\[ 
0.125 \text{ kW} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ kWh}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the weekly energy consumption in kilowatt-hours.**

Since there are 7 days in a week, the weekly energy consumption is:

\[ 
0.5 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 3.5 \text{ kWh}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of electricity for the week.**

The cost of electricity is 14 cents per kilowatt-hour. Therefore, the cost to run the TV for a week is:

\[ 
3.5 \text{ kWh} \times 14 \text{ cents/kWh} = 49 \text{ cents}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The cost to run Kim's TV for a week is 49 cents.
