==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School and then find the difference between the enrollment at Norman High School and Butler High School.

1. **Identify the average enrollment at Norman High School:**
   - The problem states that Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year.

2. **Calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School:**
   - Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School.
   - To find the enrollment at Butler High School, we multiply the enrollment at Norman High School by \( \frac{3}{4} \):
     \[
     \text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000
     \]

3. **Perform the calculation:**
   - First, calculate \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \):
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = \frac{3 \times 4000}{4} = \frac{12000}{4} = 3000
     \]
   - Thus, the average enrollment at Butler High School is 3000 students.

4. **Find the difference in enrollment:**
   - Now, we need to find how much greater the enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} - \text{Enrollment at Butler High School}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
     \]

5. **State the final answer:**
   - The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1000}
\]
