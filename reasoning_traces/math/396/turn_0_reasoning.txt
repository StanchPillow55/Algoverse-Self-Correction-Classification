To determine how many pills Holly takes in a week, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the daily pill intake:**
   - Holly takes 2 insulin pills per day.
   - Holly takes 3 blood pressure pills per day.
   - Holly takes twice as many anticonvulsants as blood pressure pills. Since she takes 3 blood pressure pills, the number of anticonvulsants she takes is:
     \[
     2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ anticonvulsants per day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of pills taken per day:**
   - Total pills per day can be calculated by adding the number of each type of pill:
     \[
     \text{Total pills per day} = \text{Insulin pills} + \text{Blood pressure pills} + \text{Anticonvulsants}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total pills per day} = 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 \text{ pills per day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pills taken in a week:**
   - Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total daily pills by 7:
     \[
     \text{Total pills in a week} = \text{Total pills per day} \times 7
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total pills in a week} = 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ pills}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, Holly takes a total of **77 pills in a week**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{77}
\]
