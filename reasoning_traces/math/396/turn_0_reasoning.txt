To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pills Holly takes each day and then calculate the total for a week.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily pill intake.**

1. **Insulin pills:** Holly takes 2 insulin pills per day.
2. **Blood pressure pills:** Holly takes 3 blood pressure pills per day.
3. **Anticonvulsant pills:** Holly takes twice as many anticonvulsant pills as blood pressure pills each day. Since she takes 3 blood pressure pills, she takes:
   \[
   2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ anticonvulsant pills per day.}
   \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of pills taken per day.**

Add up the number of each type of pill Holly takes per day:
\[
2 \text{ (insulin)} + 3 \text{ (blood pressure)} + 6 \text{ (anticonvulsant)} = 11 \text{ pills per day.}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pills taken in a week.**

Since there are 7 days in a week, multiply the daily total by 7:
\[
11 \text{ pills/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 77 \text{ pills/week.}
\]

Therefore, Holly takes a total of 77 pills in a week.

**Final Answer:**
Holly takes 77 pills in a week.
