==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many slices of pizza are left after Jenny gives some to Bill and Mark and eats some herself. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Slices of Pizza**: 
   Jenny starts with a pizza that has 12 slices.

2. **Slices Given to Bill**:
   Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the pizza to Bill. To find out how many slices that is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Slices to Bill} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Slices Given to Mark**:
   Next, Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pizza to Mark. We calculate:
   \[
   \text{Slices to Mark} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Total Slices Given Away**:
   Now, we add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
   \[
   \text{Total Slices Given Away} = \text{Slices to Bill} + \text{Slices to Mark} = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices}
   \]

5. **Slices Eaten by Jenny**:
   Jenny eats 2 slices of pizza.

6. **Total Slices Consumed**:
   We need to find the total number of slices that have been consumed (given away and eaten):
   \[
   \text{Total Slices Consumed} = \text{Total Slices Given Away} + \text{Slices Eaten by Jenny} = 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ slices}
   \]

7. **Slices Left**:
   Finally, we subtract the total slices consumed from the original number of slices to find out how many slices are left:
   \[
   \text{Slices Left} = \text{Total Slices} - \text{Total Slices Consumed} = 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ slices}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that there are **3 slices left**.
