To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 222" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per widget, and for Type B, it is $8 per widget. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. If the company produces 100 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets, calculate the total profit.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total production cost:**

   - For Type A widgets:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type A} = \text{Number of Type A widgets} \times \text{Cost per Type A widget}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type A} = 100 \times 5 = 500
     \]

   - For Type B widgets:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type B} = \text{Number of Type B widgets} \times \text{Cost per Type B widget}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type B} = 150 \times 8 = 1200
     \]

   - Total production cost:
     \[
     \text{Total production cost} = \text{Cost for Type A} + \text{Cost for Type B}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total production cost} = 500 + 1200 = 1700
     \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue:**

   - Revenue from Type A widgets:
     \[
     \text{Revenue for Type A} = \text{Number of Type A widgets} \times \text{Selling price per Type A widget}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Revenue for Type A} = 100 \times 10 = 1000
     \]

   - Revenue from Type B widgets:
     \[
     \text{Revenue for Type B} = \text{Number of Type B widgets} \times \text{Selling price per Type B widget}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Revenue for Type B} = 150 \times 15 = 2250
     \]

   - Total revenue:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue for Type A} + \text{Revenue for Type B}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = 1000 + 2250 = 3250
     \]

3. **Calculate the total profit:**

   - Profit is calculated as the difference between total revenue and total production cost:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total production cost}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Profit} = 3250 - 1700 = 1550
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The total profit from producing and selling the widgets is $1550.
