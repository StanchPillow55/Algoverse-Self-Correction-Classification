==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 222" might entail. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A store sells two types of candies: chocolate and gummy bears. The price of a chocolate is $2, and the price of a gummy bear is $1.50. If a customer buys a total of 10 candies and spends $17, how many chocolates and how many gummy bears did the customer buy?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolates.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of gummy bears.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - The total number of candies is 10: 
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
   - The total cost of the candies is $17:
     \[
     2x + 1.5y = 17
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**

   We have the following system:
   \[
   \begin{cases} 
   x + y = 10 \\
   2x + 1.5y = 17 
   \end{cases}
   \]

   From the first equation, solve for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 10 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 10 - x \) into the second equation:
   \[
   2x + 1.5(10 - x) = 17
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 15 - 1.5x = 17
   \]
   \[
   0.5x + 15 = 17
   \]
   \[
   0.5x = 2
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 10 - 4 = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the solution:**

   Check the total number of candies:
   \[
   x + y = 4 + 6 = 10
   \]

   Check the total cost:
   \[
   2x + 1.5y = 2(4) + 1.5(6) = 8 + 9 = 17
   \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 4 chocolates and 6 gummy bears.
