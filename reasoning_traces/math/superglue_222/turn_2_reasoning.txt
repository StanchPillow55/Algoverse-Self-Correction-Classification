==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 222" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of gadgets: Gadget A and Gadget B. The production cost for Gadget A is $50 per unit, and for Gadget B, it is $70 per unit. The company sells Gadget A for $100 per unit and Gadget B for $120 per unit. If the company produces and sells 300 units of Gadget A and 200 units of Gadget B, what is the total profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the total profit from selling two types of gadgets.
   - Profit is calculated as the difference between total revenue and total cost.

2. **Identify the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Gadget A units produced and sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Gadget B units produced and sold.
   - Here, \( x = 300 \) and \( y = 200 \).

3. **Calculate Total Revenue:**
   - Revenue from Gadget A = Selling price per unit of Gadget A \(\times\) Number of units sold.
   - Revenue from Gadget B = Selling price per unit of Gadget B \(\times\) Number of units sold.
   - Total Revenue = Revenue from Gadget A + Revenue from Gadget B.

   \[
   \text{Revenue from Gadget A} = 100 \times 300 = 30,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Revenue from Gadget B} = 120 \times 200 = 24,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 30,000 + 24,000 = 54,000
   \]

4. **Calculate Total Cost:**
   - Cost for Gadget A = Production cost per unit of Gadget A \(\times\) Number of units produced.
   - Cost for Gadget B = Production cost per unit of Gadget B \(\times\) Number of units produced.
   - Total Cost = Cost for Gadget A + Cost for Gadget B.

   \[
   \text{Cost for Gadget A} = 50 \times 300 = 15,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost for Gadget B} = 70 \times 200 = 14,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 15,000 + 14,000 = 29,000
   \]

5. **Calculate Total Profit:**
   - Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost.

   \[
   \text{Total Profit} = 54,000 - 29,000 = 25,000
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The total profit from producing and selling 300 units of Gadget A and 200 units of Gadget B is $25,000.

**Final Answer:**
The total profit is $25,000.
