==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 222" might entail. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem-solving exercise. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Question:** If \( x \) and \( y \) are integers such that \( 2x + 3y = 12 \), find all possible pairs \((x, y)\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3y = 12 \). This is a linear Diophantine equation, which means we are looking for integer solutions.

2. **Express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):**
   Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 12 - 3y
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{12 - 3y}{2}
   \]
   For \( x \) to be an integer, \( 12 - 3y \) must be even.

3. **Determine when \( 12 - 3y \) is even:**
   Since 12 is even, \( 3y \) must also be even. This implies \( y \) must be even (since 3 is odd, \( y \) must be even for \( 3y \) to be even).

4. **Find possible values of \( y \):**
   Since \( y \) must be even, let \( y = 2k \) where \( k \) is an integer. Substitute \( y = 2k \) into the equation:
   \[
   x = \frac{12 - 3(2k)}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{12 - 6k}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 6 - 3k
   \]

5. **Find integer pairs \((x, y)\):**
   We need to find integer values of \( k \) such that both \( x \) and \( y \) are integers. Substitute back to find pairs:
   - If \( k = 0 \), \( y = 0 \), \( x = 6 \) → Pair: \((6, 0)\)
   - If \( k = 1 \), \( y = 2 \), \( x = 3 \) → Pair: \((3, 2)\)
   - If \( k = 2 \), \( y = 4 \), \( x = 0 \) → Pair: \((0, 4)\)
   - If \( k = 3 \), \( y = 6 \), \( x = -3 \) → Pair: \((-3, 6)\)

6. **Check for negative values of \( k \):**
   - If \( k = -1 \), \( y = -2 \), \( x = 9 \) → Pair: \((9, -2)\)
   - If \( k = -2 \), \( y = -4 \), \( x = 12 \) → Pair: \((12, -4)\)

7. **Verify all solutions:**
   Substitute each pair back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy \( 2x + 3y = 12 \).

### Final Answer:
The integer solutions to the equation \( 2x + 3y = 12 \) are:
- \((6, 0)\)
- \((3, 2)\)
- \((0, 4)\)
- \((-3, 6)\)
- \((9, -2)\)
- \((12, -4)\)

These pairs represent all possible integer solutions to the given equation.
