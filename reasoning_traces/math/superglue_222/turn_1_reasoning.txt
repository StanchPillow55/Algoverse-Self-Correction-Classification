==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 222" might entail. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that involves reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce up to 100 widgets in a day. The profit from selling one Type A widget is $3, and the profit from selling one Type B widget is $5. The company wants to maximize its profit, but it must produce at least 20 Type A widgets and at least 10 Type B widgets each day. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize its profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up the Constraints:**
   - The total production constraint: \( x + y \leq 100 \).
   - The minimum production constraints: \( x \geq 20 \) and \( y \geq 10 \).

3. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function to maximize is \( P = 3x + 5y \).

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the line \( x + y = 100 \).
   - Shade the region below this line, as it represents \( x + y \leq 100 \).
   - Plot the vertical line \( x = 20 \) and shade to the right, representing \( x \geq 20 \).
   - Plot the horizontal line \( y = 10 \) and shade above, representing \( y \geq 10 \).

5. **Identify the Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible region is the area where all shaded regions overlap. It is bounded by the lines \( x = 20 \), \( y = 10 \), and \( x + y = 100 \).

6. **Find the Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are where the lines intersect:
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( y = 10 \): \( (20, 10) \).
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( x + y = 100 \): \( (20, 80) \).
     - Intersection of \( y = 10 \) and \( x + y = 100 \): \( (90, 10) \).

7. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - At \( (20, 10) \): \( P = 3(20) + 5(10) = 60 + 50 = 110 \).
   - At \( (20, 80) \): \( P = 3(20) + 5(80) = 60 + 400 = 460 \).
   - At \( (90, 10) \): \( P = 3(90) + 5(10) = 270 + 50 = 320 \).

8. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the point \( (20, 80) \) with a profit of $460.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 20 Type A widgets and 80 Type B widgets each day, resulting in a maximum profit of $460.
