==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Sharing of $18 Among 3 Boys**:
   Let's denote the shares of the three boys as \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \). Since the total amount shared is $18, we have:
   \[
   x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 18
   \]
   However, we don't know how much each boy receives individually. For the sake of this problem, we will focus on the eldest boy's transactions.

2. **Eldest Boy's Initial Share**:
   Let's denote the eldest boy's initial share as \( x_1 \). 

3. **Eldest Boy Adds Money**:
   - On the first day, he adds $5 to his share:
     \[
     x_1 + 5
     \]
   - On the second day, he adds another $10:
     \[
     (x_1 + 5) + 10 = x_1 + 15
     \]

4. **Eldest Boy Spends Money**:
   - After adding the money, he spends $8:
     \[
     (x_1 + 15) - 8 = x_1 + 7
     \]

5. **Tripling the Remaining Amount**:
   - After spending $8, he saves some more money and is able to triple the amount he has left. The amount he has left after spending is \( x_1 + 7 \).
   - Tripling this amount gives:
     \[
     3(x_1 + 7)
     \]

6. **Final Amount Calculation**:
   - The final amount he has after tripling is:
     \[
     3(x_1 + 7) = 3x_1 + 21
     \]

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Since we do not have the exact value of \( x_1 \) (the eldest boy's initial share), we cannot calculate a specific numerical answer for how much he has now. However, we can express the final amount he has in terms of \( x_1 \):
   \[
   \text{Final amount} = 3x_1 + 21
   \]

If we assume that the $18 is shared equally among the three boys, then:
\[
x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = \frac{18}{3} = 6
\]
Substituting \( x_1 = 6 \) into the final amount:
\[
3(6) + 21 = 18 + 21 = 39
\]

Thus, if the eldest boy initially received $6, after all transactions, he would have:
\[
\boxed{39}
\] 

This is the final answer based on the assumption of equal sharing. If the sharing was not equal, the final amount would depend on the specific value of \( x_1 \).
