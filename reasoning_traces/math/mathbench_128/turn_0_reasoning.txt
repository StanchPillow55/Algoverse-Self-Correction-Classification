To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 128" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume that "128" is a key part of the problem. Let's consider a few possibilities and solve a problem involving the number 128.

### Problem: Find the prime factorization of 128.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

Prime factorization involves breaking down a number into its prime number components. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Step 2: Start with the Smallest Prime Number**

The smallest prime number is 2. We check if 128 is divisible by 2.

\[ 128 \div 2 = 64 \]

Since 128 is divisible by 2, we write:

\[ 128 = 2 \times 64 \]

**Step 3: Continue Factoring 64**

Now, we factor 64. Again, we check divisibility by 2.

\[ 64 \div 2 = 32 \]

So, we have:

\[ 64 = 2 \times 32 \]

Thus, the factorization so far is:

\[ 128 = 2 \times 2 \times 32 \]

**Step 4: Continue Factoring 32**

Next, we factor 32 by checking divisibility by 2.

\[ 32 \div 2 = 16 \]

So, we have:

\[ 32 = 2 \times 16 \]

Thus, the factorization so far is:

\[ 128 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 16 \]

**Step 5: Continue Factoring 16**

Next, we factor 16 by checking divisibility by 2.

\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \]

So, we have:

\[ 16 = 2 \times 8 \]

Thus, the factorization so far is:

\[ 128 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 8 \]

**Step 6: Continue Factoring 8**

Next, we factor 8 by checking divisibility by 2.

\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \]

So, we have:

\[ 8 = 2 \times 4 \]

Thus, the factorization so far is:

\[ 128 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 4 \]

**Step 7: Continue Factoring 4**

Finally, we factor 4 by checking divisibility by 2.

\[ 4 \div 2 = 2 \]

So, we have:

\[ 4 = 2 \times 2 \]

Thus, the complete factorization is:

\[ 128 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \]

**Step 8: Write the Prime Factorization in Exponential Form**

Since we have seven 2's multiplied together, we can write this as:

\[ 128 = 2^7 \]

**Final Answer**

The prime factorization of 128 is \( 2^7 \).
