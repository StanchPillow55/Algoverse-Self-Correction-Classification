==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample math problem 128" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves performing operations with the number 128. Let's explore some common mathematical operations and concepts involving the number 128.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization
First, let's perform the prime factorization of 128.

1. **Divide by 2 (the smallest prime number):**
   \[
   128 \div 2 = 64
   \]

2. **Continue dividing by 2:**
   \[
   64 \div 2 = 32
   \]
   \[
   32 \div 2 = 16
   \]
   \[
   16 \div 2 = 8
   \]
   \[
   8 \div 2 = 4
   \]
   \[
   4 \div 2 = 2
   \]
   \[
   2 \div 2 = 1
   \]

The prime factorization of 128 is \(2^7\).

### Step 2: Binary Representation
Next, let's find the binary representation of 128.

- 128 in binary is \(10000000_2\).

### Step 3: Powers and Roots
Let's explore some powers and roots involving 128.

1. **Square Root:**
   \[
   \sqrt{128} \approx 11.3137
   \]

2. **Cube Root:**
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{128} \approx 5.0397
   \]

3. **Power of 2:**
   Since \(128 = 2^7\), it is a power of 2.

### Step 4: Logarithms
Calculate the logarithm of 128 in different bases.

1. **Base 2:**
   \[
   \log_2(128) = 7
   \]

2. **Base 10:**
   \[
   \log_{10}(128) \approx 2.1072
   \]

### Step 5: Divisors
Find the divisors of 128.

- The divisors of 128 are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
