Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 128" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample problem involving the number 128 and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Determine if the number 128 is a power of 2. If it is, express it as \(2^n\), where \(n\) is an integer.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understanding Powers of 2:**
   Powers of 2 are numbers that can be expressed in the form \(2^n\), where \(n\) is a non-negative integer. The sequence of powers of 2 starts as follows: \(2^0 = 1\), \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), \(2^3 = 8\), \(2^4 = 16\), \(2^5 = 32\), \(2^6 = 64\), \(2^7 = 128\), and so on.

2. **Checking if 128 is a Power of 2:**
   We need to determine if 128 can be expressed as \(2^n\). We will check the powers of 2 sequentially:

   - \(2^0 = 1\)
   - \(2^1 = 2\)
   - \(2^2 = 4\)
   - \(2^3 = 8\)
   - \(2^4 = 16\)
   - \(2^5 = 32\)
   - \(2^6 = 64\)
   - \(2^7 = 128\)

   We find that \(2^7 = 128\).

3. **Conclusion:**
   Since \(2^7 = 128\), the number 128 is indeed a power of 2. The integer \(n\) that satisfies this equation is 7.

**Final Answer:**
128 is a power of 2 and can be expressed as \(2^7\).
