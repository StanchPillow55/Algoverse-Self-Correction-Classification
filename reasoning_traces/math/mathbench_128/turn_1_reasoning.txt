==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 128," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not clear or complete. It seems like "Sample math problem 128" is a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not provided here.

Since the problem is not specified, I will demonstrate how to solve a typical math problem involving the number 128. Let's consider a problem where we need to find the prime factorization of 128.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to express 128 as a product of prime numbers.

2. **Start with the Smallest Prime Number:**
   Begin dividing 128 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

3. **Perform the Division:**
   - 128 ÷ 2 = 64
   - 64 is still even, so divide by 2 again: 64 ÷ 2 = 32
   - 32 is even, divide by 2: 32 ÷ 2 = 16
   - 16 is even, divide by 2: 16 ÷ 2 = 8
   - 8 is even, divide by 2: 8 ÷ 2 = 4
   - 4 is even, divide by 2: 4 ÷ 2 = 2
   - 2 is even, divide by 2: 2 ÷ 2 = 1

4. **Collect the Prime Factors:**
   Each division by 2 represents a factor of 2. We divided by 2 a total of 7 times.

5. **Write the Prime Factorization:**
   The prime factorization of 128 is \(2^7\).

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   Multiply the prime factors to ensure they equal the original number:
   \[
   2^7 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 128
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 128 is \(2^7\).

This solution demonstrates how to find the prime factorization of 128. If you have a different or specific problem involving the number 128, please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
