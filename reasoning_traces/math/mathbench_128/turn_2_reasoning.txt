Question ID: mathbench_128
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 128" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I will assume that "Sample math problem 128" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem details, I will create a sample math problem involving the number 128 and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** What is the cube root of 128, rounded to two decimal places?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the cube root of 128 and round it to two decimal places.

2. **Calculate the Cube Root:**
   - The cube root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^3 = x \).
   - We are looking for \( y \) such that \( y^3 = 128 \).

3. **Estimate the Cube Root:**
   - We know that \( 5^3 = 125 \) and \( 6^3 = 216 \).
   - Therefore, the cube root of 128 is between 5 and 6.

4. **Use a Calculator for Precision:**
   - Using a calculator, we find that the cube root of 128 is approximately 5.039684.

5. **Round to Two Decimal Places:**
   - The number 5.039684 rounded to two decimal places is 5.04.

6. **Verify the Result:**
   - To verify, we can calculate \( 5.04^3 \) and check if it is close to 128.
   - \( 5.04^3 = 5.04 \times 5.04 \times 5.04 = 25.4016 \times 5.04 = 128.063424 \).
   - This is very close to 128, confirming our result is accurate.

**Final Answer:**
The cube root of 128, rounded to two decimal places, is 5.04.
