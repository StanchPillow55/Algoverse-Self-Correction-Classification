==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 324" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume that "Sample reasoning question 324" refers to a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller, equal-sized square plots. What is the largest possible side length of each square plot?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 120 meters by 80 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into smaller square plots of equal size.
   - The goal is to find the largest possible side length for these square plots.

2. **Identify the Mathematical Concept:**
   - The problem requires us to find the largest square that can fit into both the length and the width of the rectangle without leaving any remainder.
   - This is a classic problem of finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which in this case are the length and width of the rectangle.

3. **Calculate the GCD:**
   - We need to find the GCD of 120 and 80.
   - Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD:
     - Divide 120 by 80, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 40.
     - Now, divide 80 by 40, which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0.
     - Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 40.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The largest possible side length of each square plot is 40 meters.

5. **Verification:**
   - Check that 40 meters divides both 120 meters and 80 meters without leaving a remainder:
     - 120 รท 40 = 3
     - 80 รท 40 = 2
   - Both divisions result in whole numbers, confirming that 40 meters is indeed the largest possible side length.

**Final Answer:**

The largest possible side length of each square plot is 40 meters.
