==================================================

To solve the problem, we need more context or details about what "Sample reasoning question 324" entails. Since the question is not specified, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem step by step. Let's assume a sample math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are asked to find the area of a triangle.
   - We know the formula for the area of a triangle is:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

2. **Identify Given Values:**
   - Base (\(b\)) = 10 units
   - Height (\(h\)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   - Plug the given values into the area formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

**Conclusion:**
By following these steps, we calculated the area of the triangle to be 25 square units. This process demonstrates how to approach a math problem systematically by understanding the problem, identifying given values, substituting into the formula, performing calculations, and stating the final answer. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide additional details.
