Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 324" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. Let's create a sample problem and solve it.

**Sample Problem:**
A store sells two types of candies: chocolate and gummy bears. The price of a chocolate candy is $0.50, and the price of a gummy bear is $0.30. A customer buys a total of 20 candies and spends $8.00. How many of each type of candy did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate candies.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of gummy bears.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of candies is 20: 
     \[
     x + y = 20
     \]
   - The total cost is $8.00:
     \[
     0.50x + 0.30y = 8.00
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   First, solve the first equation for one of the variables. Let's solve for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 20 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 20 - x \) into the second equation:
   \[
   0.50x + 0.30(20 - x) = 8.00
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   0.50x + 6.00 - 0.30x = 8.00
   \]
   \[
   0.20x + 6.00 = 8.00
   \]
   \[
   0.20x = 2.00
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{2.00}{0.20}
   \]
   \[
   x = 10
   \]

   Now, substitute \( x = 10 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 20 - 10
   \]
   \[
   y = 10
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the total number of candies:
   \[
   x + y = 10 + 10 = 20
   \]

   Check the total cost:
   \[
   0.50 \times 10 + 0.30 \times 10 = 5.00 + 3.00 = 8.00
   \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 10 chocolate candies and 10 gummy bears.
