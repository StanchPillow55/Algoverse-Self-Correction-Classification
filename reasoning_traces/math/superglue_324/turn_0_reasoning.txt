==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 324" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 324 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 324 positive integers. The sequence of the first 324 positive integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 324.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 324 \). Substitute 324 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{324(324 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, calculate \( 324 + 1 \):
     \[
     324 + 1 = 325
     \]
   - Next, multiply 324 by 325:
     \[
     324 \times 325 = 105300
     \]
   - Finally, divide the result by 2 to find the sum:
     \[
     S = \frac{105300}{2} = 52650
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure the calculation is correct, let's verify by considering a smaller example. For the first 5 positive integers, the sum is:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
   \]
   Using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{5(5 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \times 6}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]
   The formula works correctly for smaller numbers, so it should be reliable for larger numbers as well.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 324 positive integers is \( 52650 \).
