==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 23" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume a generic approach to tackle a reasoning question. Let's consider a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. It then returns from City B to City A at a speed of 40 miles per hour. The total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours. What is the distance between City A and City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B in miles.
   - The speed from City A to City B is 60 mph.
   - The speed from City B to City A is 40 mph.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B is \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - The time taken to travel from City B to City A is \( \frac{d}{40} \) hours.
   - The total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours.

3. **Equation for Total Time:**
   \[
   \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = 5
   \]

4. **Find a Common Denominator:**
   - The common denominator for 60 and 40 is 120.
   - Rewrite the equation with the common denominator:
   \[
   \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = 5
   \]

5. **Combine the Fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{2d + 3d}{120} = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{5d}{120} = 5
   \]

6. **Solve for \( d \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 120 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   5d = 600
   \]
   - Divide both sides by 5:
   \[
   d = 120
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.

**Final Answer:**
The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.
