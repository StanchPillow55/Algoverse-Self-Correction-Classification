==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 23" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A store sells two types of candies: chocolate and gummy bears. The price of a chocolate candy is $0.50, and the price of a gummy bear is $0.30. If a customer buys a total of 20 candies and spends $8.00, how many of each type of candy did they buy?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate candies.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of gummy bears.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The total number of candies is 20:
     \[
     x + y = 20
     \]
   - The total cost of the candies is $8.00:
     \[
     0.50x + 0.30y = 8.00
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 20 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   0.50x + 0.30y &= 8.00 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Step 1: Solve Equation 1 for \( y \):**
   \[
   y = 20 - x
   \]

   **Step 2: Substitute \( y \) in Equation 2:**
   \[
   0.50x + 0.30(20 - x) = 8.00
   \]

   **Step 3: Simplify and Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   0.50x + 6.00 - 0.30x = 8.00
   \]
   \[
   0.20x + 6.00 = 8.00
   \]
   \[
   0.20x = 2.00
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{2.00}{0.20}
   \]
   \[
   x = 10
   \]

   **Step 4: Substitute \( x = 10 \) back into the equation for \( y \):**
   \[
   y = 20 - 10
   \]
   \[
   y = 10
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**

The customer bought 10 chocolate candies and 10 gummy bears.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 10 chocolate candies and 10 gummy bears.
