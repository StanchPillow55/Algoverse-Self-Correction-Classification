==================================================

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or missing information in your request. "Sample reasoning question 23" doesn't provide enough context or details for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what is unknown.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that could be used to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning).
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check if there is another method to solve the problem and compare results.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

If you provide a specific math problem, I can apply this approach to solve it for you.
