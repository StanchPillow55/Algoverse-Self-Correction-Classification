==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 23" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided in detail, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies this equation.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

The equation is:
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:
\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]
\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 3: Solve for the Variable**
Now, we have \( 2x = 8 \). To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]
\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]
\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]
\[ 11 = 11 \]

The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 4.

This is a demonstration of how to solve a linear equation by isolating the variable and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or question, please provide more details, and I can assist you further.
