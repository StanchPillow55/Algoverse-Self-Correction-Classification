==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 23" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the area of a right triangle with a base of 6 cm and a height of 8 cm.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are asked to find the area of a right triangle.
   - We are given the base and the height of the triangle.

2. **Recall the Formula:**
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - Base (\(b\)) = 6 cm
   - Height (\(h\)) = 8 cm
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 8
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     6 \times 8 = 48
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the right triangle is 24 square centimeters.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle. This methodical approach ensures that we understand each part of the problem and apply the correct formula to find the solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details, and I will be happy to help!
