==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to establish relationships between the ages of Anne, Emile, and Maude at a future time. Let's define the variables and work through the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Define the Variables
- Let \( A \) be Anne's current age.
- Let \( E \) be Emile's current age.
- Let \( M \) be Maude's current age.

### Step 2: Understand the Problem
We are given two conditions:
1. By the time Anne is two times as old as Emile, Emile will be six times as old as Maude.
2. At that time, Maude will be 8 years old.

### Step 3: Set Up the Equations
We need to find Anne's age when these conditions are met.

#### Condition 1:
Anne will be twice as old as Emile:
\[ A + x = 2(E + x) \]
where \( x \) is the number of years from now when this condition is met.

#### Condition 2:
Emile will be six times as old as Maude:
\[ E + x = 6(M + x) \]

#### Condition 3:
Maude will be 8 years old:
\[ M + x = 8 \]

### Step 4: Solve the Equations

#### Solve for \( x \) using Condition 3:
\[ M + x = 8 \]
\[ x = 8 - M \]

#### Substitute \( x = 8 - M \) into Condition 2:
\[ E + (8 - M) = 6(8) \]
\[ E + 8 - M = 48 \]
\[ E - M = 40 \]
\[ E = M + 40 \]

#### Substitute \( x = 8 - M \) into Condition 1:
\[ A + (8 - M) = 2(E + (8 - M)) \]
\[ A + 8 - M = 2(E + 8 - M) \]
\[ A + 8 - M = 2E + 16 - 2M \]
\[ A + 8 - M = 2E + 16 - 2M \]
\[ A = 2E + 16 - 2M + M - 8 \]
\[ A = 2E + 8 - M \]

### Step 5: Substitute \( E = M + 40 \) into the equation for \( A \):
\[ A = 2(M + 40) + 8 - M \]
\[ A = 2M + 80 + 8 - M \]
\[ A = M + 88 \]

### Step 6: Use \( M + x = 8 \) to find \( M \):
Since \( x = 8 - M \), and we need \( M + x = 8 \), we have:
\[ M + (8 - M) = 8 \]
This equation is always true, so we need to use the relationship \( M + x = 8 \) to find \( M \).

### Step 7: Solve for Anne's Age
Since \( M + x = 8 \), and we know \( x = 8 - M \), we substitute:
\[ A = M + 88 \]

Given that Maude will be 8 years old:
\[ M + x = 8 \]
\[ M + (8 - M) = 8 \]
This confirms \( M \) is consistent with the condition.

Finally, since \( M \) will be 8 years old:
\[ A = 8 + 88 = 96 \]

### Final Answer
Anne will be 96 years old.
