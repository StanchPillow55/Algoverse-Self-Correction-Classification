==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to set up some variables and equations based on the information given.

Let's define the current ages of Anne, Emile, and Maude as follows:
- Let \( A \) be Anne's current age.
- Let \( E \) be Emile's current age.
- Let \( M \) be Maude's current age.

From the problem, we know that:
1. Maude will be 8 years old at some point in the future.
2. By the time Anne is twice as old as Emile, Emile will be six times as old as Maude.

We need to determine how old Anne will be when Maude is 8 years old.

### Step 1: Determine Maude's current age
Since we know that Maude will be 8 years old, we need to find out how many years it will take for her to reach that age. Let's denote the number of years until Maude is 8 as \( x \).

If Maude is currently \( M \) years old, then:
\[
M + x = 8 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 8 - M
\]

### Step 2: Express Anne's and Emile's ages in terms of \( x \)
In \( x \) years:
- Anne's age will be \( A + x \).
- Emile's age will be \( E + x \).
- Maude's age will be \( 8 \).

### Step 3: Set up the equations based on the problem statement
According to the problem:
- By the time Anne is twice as old as Emile, we have:
\[
A + x = 2(E + x)
\]
- At that same time, Emile will be six times as old as Maude:
\[
E + x = 6 \cdot 8 = 48
\]

### Step 4: Solve the second equation for \( E \)
From the second equation:
\[
E + x = 48 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E = 48 - x
\]

### Step 5: Substitute \( E \) into the first equation
Now we substitute \( E \) into the first equation:
\[
A + x = 2(48 - x + x)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
A + x = 2 \cdot 48
\]
\[
A + x = 96
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( A \)
Now we can express \( A \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
A = 96 - x
\]

### Step 7: Substitute \( x \) back in terms of \( M \)
Recall that \( x = 8 - M \). We can substitute this back into the equation for \( A \):
\[
A = 96 - (8 - M)
\]
\[
A = 96 - 8 + M
\]
\[
A = 88 + M
\]

### Step 8: Determine \( M \)
Since we need to find Anne's age when Maude is 8, we can set \( M = 8 \):
\[
A = 88 + 8 = 96
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, when Maude is 8 years old, Anne will be:
\[
\boxed{96}
\]
