==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to establish relationships between the ages of Anne, Emile, and Maude. Let's define the variables and work through the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Define the Variables
- Let \( A \) be Anne's current age.
- Let \( E \) be Emile's current age.
- Let \( M \) be Maude's current age.

### Step 2: Analyze the Problem Statement
The problem states that by the time Anne is two times as old as Emile, Emile will be six times as old as Maude. Additionally, we know that Maude will be 8 years old at that time.

### Step 3: Set Up the Equations
1. **Anne is two times as old as Emile:**
   \[
   A + x = 2(E + x)
   \]
   where \( x \) is the number of years from now when this condition is met.

2. **Emile is six times as old as Maude:**
   \[
   E + x = 6(M + x)
   \]

3. **Maude will be 8 years old:**
   \[
   M + x = 8
   \]

### Step 4: Solve the Equations
First, solve the equation for Maude:
\[
M + x = 8 \implies x = 8 - M
\]

Substitute \( x = 8 - M \) into the other equations.

**Equation for Anne and Emile:**
\[
A + (8 - M) = 2(E + (8 - M))
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 8 - M = 2E + 16 - 2M
\]
Rearrange:
\[
A = 2E + 16 - 2M + M - 8
\]
\[
A = 2E + 8 - M
\]

**Equation for Emile and Maude:**
\[
E + (8 - M) = 6M
\]
Simplify:
\[
E + 8 - M = 6M
\]
Rearrange:
\[
E = 6M - 8 + M
\]
\[
E = 7M - 8
\]

### Step 5: Substitute and Solve for \( A \)
Substitute \( E = 7M - 8 \) into the equation for \( A \):
\[
A = 2(7M - 8) + 8 - M
\]
Simplify:
\[
A = 14M - 16 + 8 - M
\]
\[
A = 13M - 8
\]

### Step 6: Use the Condition \( M + x = 8 \)
Since \( M + x = 8 \), we know \( x = 8 - M \). We need to find \( A \) when Maude is 8 years old, which means \( M + x = 8 \) is satisfied.

### Step 7: Solve for \( A \) When \( M = 0 \)
Since \( M + x = 8 \) and \( x = 8 - M \), if \( M = 0 \), then \( x = 8 \).

Substitute \( M = 0 \) into the equation for \( A \):
\[
A = 13(0) - 8 = -8
\]

This result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, indicating a miscalculation or misinterpretation. Let's re-evaluate:

### Step 8: Correct Calculation
Since \( M + x = 8 \) and \( x = 8 - M \), when Maude is 8, \( M = 8 - x \).

Re-evaluate:
If \( M = 0 \), then \( x = 8 \), which is incorrect. Let's assume \( M = 8 \).

Recalculate:
\[
A = 13(8) - 8 = 104 - 8 = 96
\]

### Conclusion
The correct interpretation is that when Maude is 8 years old, Anne will be 96 years old.

**Final Answer: Anne will be 96 years old.**
