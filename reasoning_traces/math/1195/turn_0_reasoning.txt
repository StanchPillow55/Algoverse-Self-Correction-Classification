==================================================

To find the total number of people that entered The Best Cookeries Around restaurant on that day, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Entry**: 
   - In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
   \[
   \text{Total after morning} = 50
   \]

2. **Entry at 10:00**: 
   - At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
   \[
   \text{Total after 10:00} = 50 + 40 = 90
   \]

3. **Twice the Number of People from 10:00**: 
   - The problem states that twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in later. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80
   \]
   - Adding this to the total:
   \[
   \text{Total after additional entry} = 90 + 80 = 170
   \]

4. **Entry in the Evening**: 
   - By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (which was 50) entered the restaurant. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150
   \]
   - Adding this to the total:
   \[
   \text{Total after evening entry} = 170 + 150 = 320
   \]

5. **Final Calculation**: 
   - Now we have calculated all the entries throughout the day:
   - Morning: 50
   - 10:00 entry: 40
   - Additional entry (twice the 10:00 entry): 80
   - Evening entry (3 times the first entry): 150

   Adding these all together gives us:
   \[
   50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320
   \]

Thus, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is:
\[
\boxed{320}
\]
