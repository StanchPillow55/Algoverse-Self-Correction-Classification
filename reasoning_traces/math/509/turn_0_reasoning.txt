Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought based on the information provided about Rose's purchases.

1. **Understanding Rose's Purchases**:
   - Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.
   - We can calculate the total number of items Rose bought:
     \[
     \text{Total items Rose bought} = \text{Onions} + \text{Potatoes} = 12 + 4 = 16
     \]

2. **Relationship Between Sophia's and Rose's Purchases**:
   - The problem states that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
   - Let \( S \) be the total number of items (onions and potatoes) that Sophia bought.
   - According to the problem, we have:
     \[
     4S = 16
     \]

3. **Solving for \( S \)**:
   - To find \( S \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
     \[
     S = \frac{16}{4} = 4
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 items (onions and potatoes combined).

5. **Final Answer**:
   - The total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought at the market is \( \boxed{4} \).
