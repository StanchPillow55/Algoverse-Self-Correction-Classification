==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, given the exercise requirements of the other three dogs and the average exercise requirement for all four dogs.

1. **Identify the known values:**
   - Dog 1 needs to walk: 1 mile
   - Dog 2 needs to walk: 4 miles
   - Dog 3 needs to walk: 3 miles
   - Let \( x \) be the distance that the last dog (Dog 4) needs to walk.

2. **Calculate the total exercise needed for all four dogs:**
   The average exercise requirement for the four dogs is given as 3 miles. The average is calculated by dividing the total distance walked by the number of dogs. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Number of dogs}}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   3 = \frac{1 + 4 + 3 + x}{4}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance walked by the first three dogs:**
   \[
   1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Substitute the total distance into the average equation:**
   Now we can substitute the total distance into the equation:
   \[
   3 = \frac{8 + x}{4}
   \]

5. **Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:**
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 8 + x
   \]
   \[
   12 = 8 + x
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   To find \( x \), subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 12 - 8
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   The last dog needs to walk **4 miles**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
