==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 465" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 300 widgets and made $18,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of widgets sold is 300. This gives us our first equation:
     \[
     x + y = 300
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue from the sales is $18,000. This gives us our second equation:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 18,000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system of equations:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 300 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
     50x + 70y &= 18,000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \end{align*}
     \]
   - Solve Equation 1 for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 300 - x
     \]
   - Substitute \( y = 300 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     50x + 70(300 - x) = 18,000
     \]
   - Distribute the 70:
     \[
     50x + 21,000 - 70x = 18,000
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     -20x + 21,000 = 18,000
     \]
   - Subtract 21,000 from both sides:
     \[
     -20x = -3,000
     \]
   - Divide by -20:
     \[
     x = 150
     \]

4. **Find \( y \):**
   - Substitute \( x = 150 \) back into the equation \( y = 300 - x \):
     \[
     y = 300 - 150 = 150
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of widgets:
     \[
     x + y = 150 + 150 = 300 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]
   - Check the total revenue:
     \[
     50(150) + 70(150) = 7,500 + 10,500 = 18,000 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 150 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets.
