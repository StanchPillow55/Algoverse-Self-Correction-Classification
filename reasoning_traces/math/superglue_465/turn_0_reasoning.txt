==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 465" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces widgets. The cost to produce \( x \) widgets is given by the function \( C(x) = 5x + 200 \), where \( C(x) \) is the total cost in dollars. The company sells each widget for $10. How many widgets must the company produce and sell to break even?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of widgets, \( x \), that must be produced and sold so that the total revenue equals the total cost.

2. **Define Revenue Function:**
   - Revenue is the amount of money brought in from sales. The revenue function \( R(x) \) is given by the price per widget times the number of widgets sold: 
     \[
     R(x) = 10x
     \]

3. **Set Up the Break-Even Equation:**
   - Break-even occurs when total revenue equals total cost:
     \[
     R(x) = C(x)
     \]
   - Substitute the expressions for \( R(x) \) and \( C(x) \):
     \[
     10x = 5x + 200
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides to isolate terms involving \( x \):
     \[
     10x - 5x = 200
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     5x = 200
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{200}{5} = 40
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Calculate the total cost for 40 widgets:
     \[
     C(40) = 5(40) + 200 = 200 + 200 = 400
     \]
   - Calculate the total revenue for 40 widgets:
     \[
     R(40) = 10(40) = 400
     \]
   - Since \( R(40) = C(40) = 400 \), the solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The company must produce and sell 40 widgets to break even.
