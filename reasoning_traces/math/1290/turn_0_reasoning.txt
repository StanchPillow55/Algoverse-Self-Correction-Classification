To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of sunflower seeds from both the small sunflower and the large sunflower.

1. **Calculate the number of seeds in the small sunflower:**
   - The problem states that a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds.
   - Since 1 dozen equals 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in the small sunflower:
     \[
     \text{Number of seeds in small sunflower} = 3 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ seeds/dozen} = 36 \text{ seeds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of seeds in the large sunflower:**
   - The problem states that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.
   - First, we need to find 50% of the number of seeds in the small sunflower:
     \[
     50\% \text{ of } 36 \text{ seeds} = 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds}
     \]
   - Now, we add this amount to the number of seeds in the small sunflower to find the total number of seeds in the large sunflower:
     \[
     \text{Number of seeds in large sunflower} = 36 \text{ seeds} + 18 \text{ seeds} = 54 \text{ seeds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of sunflower seeds:**
   - Now we can find the total number of seeds from both sunflowers by adding the seeds from the small sunflower and the large sunflower:
     \[
     \text{Total number of seeds} = \text{Number of seeds in small sunflower} + \text{Number of seeds in large sunflower}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total number of seeds} = 36 \text{ seeds} + 54 \text{ seeds} = 90 \text{ seeds}
     \]

Thus, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is \( \boxed{90} \).
