==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's break down the process step by step. However, it seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear as it stands. "Sample reasoning question 341" doesn't provide specific details or numerical data to work with. Therefore, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem using logical reasoning and calculations.

Let's assume a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Problem:**  
A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends $25, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( o \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of fruits is 10:
     \[
     a + o = 10
     \]
   - We also know the total cost is $25:
     \[
     2a + 3o = 25
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have two equations:
     1. \( a + o = 10 \)
     2. \( 2a + 3o = 25 \)

   - Solve the first equation for one variable, say \( a \):
     \[
     a = 10 - o
     \]

   - Substitute \( a = 10 - o \) into the second equation:
     \[
     2(10 - o) + 3o = 25
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( o \):
     \[
     20 - 2o + 3o = 25
     \]
     \[
     20 + o = 25
     \]
     \[
     o = 5
     \]

   - Substitute \( o = 5 \) back into the equation for \( a \):
     \[
     a = 10 - o = 10 - 5 = 5
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the number of fruits: \( a + o = 5 + 5 = 10 \) (Correct)
   - Check the total cost: \( 2a + 3o = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25 \) (Correct)

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.

This approach demonstrates how to systematically solve a problem by defining variables, setting up equations, solving the system, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or more details, please provide them, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
