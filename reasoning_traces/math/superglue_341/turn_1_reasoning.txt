==================================================

To effectively address the problem, let's first clarify the task at hand. The question provided is "Sample reasoning question 341," but it lacks specific details or a mathematical problem to solve. Therefore, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 5 = 17 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 12
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{12}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   2(6) + 5 = 17
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   12 + 5 = 17
   \]
   \[
   17 = 17
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 17 \) is \( x = 6 \).

This process demonstrates a clear and logical approach to solving a linear equation, ensuring that each step is justified and the solution is verified. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide additional details.
