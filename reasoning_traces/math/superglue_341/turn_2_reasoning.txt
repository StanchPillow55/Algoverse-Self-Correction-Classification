==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 341" entails. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, let's assume a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $3, and the profit from each unit of product B is $5. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 150 units per day. Determine the number of units of each product the company should produce daily to maximize profit.

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced per day.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced per day.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = 3x + 5y
     \]
   - We want to maximize \( P \).

3. **Constraints:**
   - \( x \leq 100 \) (cannot produce more than 100 units of A)
   - \( y \leq 80 \) (cannot produce more than 80 units of B)
   - \( x + y \leq 150 \) (total production constraint)

4. **Graphical Method:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines:
     - \( x = 100 \)
     - \( y = 80 \)
     - \( x + y = 150 \)

5. **Vertices of the Feasible Region:**
   - Find the intersection points of the lines to determine the vertices of the feasible region:
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (100, 50) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (70, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( y = 80 \): \( (100, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( x + y = 150 \) and axes: \( (0, 150) \) and \( (150, 0) \)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - \( P(100, 50) = 3(100) + 5(50) = 300 + 250 = 550 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 3(70) + 5(80) = 210 + 400 = 610 \)
   - \( P(100, 80) = 3(100) + 5(80) = 300 + 400 = 700 \)
   - \( P(0, 150) = 3(0) + 5(150) = 0 + 750 = 750 \)
   - \( P(150, 0) = 3(150) + 5(0) = 450 + 0 = 450 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the vertex \( (0, 150) \) with a profit of $750.

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 0 units of product A and 150 units of product B to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $750 per day.
