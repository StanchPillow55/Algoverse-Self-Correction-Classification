To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books each shelf in a bookcase can hold and then calculate how many bookcases Elly needs to store all her books.

1. **Determine the capacity of each shelf:**
   - Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
   - The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf:
     \[
     \text{Bottom shelf capacity} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books}
     \]
   - The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf:
     \[
     \text{Top shelf capacity} = 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ books}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:**
   - Now we can find the total capacity of one bookcase by adding the capacities of all four shelves:
     \[
     \text{Total capacity} = \text{Top shelf} + \text{Middle shelf 1} + \text{Middle shelf 2} + \text{Bottom shelf}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total capacity} = 15 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 55 \text{ books}
     \]

3. **Determine how many bookcases are needed for 110 books:**
   - To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
     \[
     \text{Number of bookcases} = \frac{\text{Total books}}{\text{Capacity of one bookcase}} = \frac{110}{55}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of bookcases} = 2
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Elly needs **2 bookcases** to hold all of her 110 books.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]
