==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to track Jake's spending and losses step by step. Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Amount:**
   Jake starts with $5000.

2. **Spending on Motorcycle:**
   Jake spends $2800 on a new motorcycle. To find out how much he has left after this purchase, we subtract the cost of the motorcycle from his initial amount:
   \[
   5000 - 2800 = 2200
   \]
   So, Jake has $2200 left after buying the motorcycle.

3. **Spending on Concert Ticket:**
   Jake spends half of what he has left on a concert ticket. To find out how much he spends on the ticket, we calculate half of $2200:
   \[
   \frac{2200}{2} = 1100
   \]
   After buying the concert ticket, Jake has:
   \[
   2200 - 1100 = 1100
   \]
   So, Jake has $1100 left after buying the concert ticket.

4. **Losing a Fourth of the Remaining Money:**
   Jake then loses a fourth of what he has left. To find out how much he loses, we calculate a fourth of $1100:
   \[
   \frac{1100}{4} = 275
   \]
   After losing this amount, Jake has:
   \[
   1100 - 275 = 825
   \]

Therefore, after all the spending and losses, Jake has $825 left.

**Final Answer:**
Jake has $825 left.
