To solve the problem step by step, we will track Jake's money after each transaction.

1. **Initial Amount**: Jake starts with $5000.

2. **Spending on Motorcycle**: 
   - Jake spends $2800 on a motorcycle.
   - Remaining amount after this purchase:
     \[
     5000 - 2800 = 2200
     \]

3. **Spending on Concert Ticket**: 
   - Jake spends half of what he has left on a concert ticket. 
   - Half of the remaining amount ($2200) is:
     \[
     \frac{2200}{2} = 1100
     \]
   - Remaining amount after buying the concert ticket:
     \[
     2200 - 1100 = 1100
     \]

4. **Losing a Fourth of What He Has Left**: 
   - Jake loses a fourth of the remaining amount ($1100).
   - A fourth of $1100 is:
     \[
     \frac{1100}{4} = 275
     \]
   - Remaining amount after the loss:
     \[
     1100 - 275 = 825
     \]

Now, we summarize Jake's remaining money after all transactions:

- After buying the motorcycle: $2200
- After buying the concert ticket: $1100
- After losing a fourth of what he had left: $825

Thus, the final amount of money Jake has left is:

\[
\boxed{825}
\]
