To solve the problem, we need to analyze how many new pens Ram can create from the ink of the empty pens he has after using the initial 25 pens.

1. **Initial Pens**: Ram starts with 25 pens.

2. **Using the Pens**: As Ram uses the pens, they will eventually become empty. For every 5 empty pens, he can mix the ink to create 1 new full pen.

3. **Calculating New Pens from Used Pens**:
   - After using all 25 pens, Ram will have 25 empty pens.
   - He can create new pens from these empty pens. Since it takes 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen, we calculate how many new pens he can create:
     \[
     \text{New Pens} = \frac{\text{Empty Pens}}{5} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ new pens}
     \]

4. **Total Pens After First Use**: After creating the new pens, we add them to the original pens:
   \[
   \text{Total Pens} = \text{Original Pens} + \text{New Pens} = 25 + 5 = 30 \text{ pens}
   \]

5. **Using the New Pens**: Now, Ram will use these 5 new pens, which will also become empty. After using these 5 pens, he will have:
   - 5 empty pens.

6. **Creating More New Pens**: Again, he can create new pens from these 5 empty pens:
   \[
   \text{New Pens from 5 empty pens} = \frac{5}{5} = 1 \text{ new pen}
   \]

7. **Total Pens After Second Use**: Now we add this new pen to the total:
   \[
   \text{Total Pens} = 30 + 1 = 31 \text{ pens}
   \]

8. **Final Calculation**: Ram has now used all the pens he could create from the original 25 pens and the subsequent new pens. The last new pen created from the 5 empty pens means he has a total of 31 pens.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{31}
\]
