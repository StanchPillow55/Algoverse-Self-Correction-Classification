==================================================

Let's define the ages of each family member using variables:

- Let \( x \) be my age.
- Let \( b \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( s \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( m \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. I am three years younger than my brother:
   \[
   x = b - 3
   \]

2. I am two years older than my sister:
   \[
   x = s + 2
   \]

3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age:
   \[
   m = 3b - 1
   \]

4. The sum of all our ages is 87:
   \[
   x + b + s + m = 87
   \]

Now, we can express \( s \) and \( m \) in terms of \( b \) using the equations we derived:

From \( x = b - 3 \), we can express \( b \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
b = x + 3
\]

From \( x = s + 2 \), we can express \( s \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
s = x - 2
\]

Now substituting \( b \) and \( s \) into the equation for \( m \):
\[
m = 3b - 1 = 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 9 - 1 = 3x + 8
\]

Now we substitute \( x \), \( b \), \( s \), and \( m \) into the total age equation:
\[
x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87
\]
\[
6x + 9 = 87
\]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[
6x = 87 - 9
\]
\[
6x = 78
\]
\[
x = \frac{78}{6} = 13
\]

Thus, my age is \( \boxed{13} \).

To verify, we can calculate the ages of the other family members:
- My brother's age \( b = x + 3 = 13 + 3 = 16 \).
- My sister's age \( s = x - 2 = 13 - 2 = 11 \).
- My mom's age \( m = 3b - 1 = 3(16) - 1 = 48 - 1 = 47 \).

Now, let's check the total:
\[
x + b + s + m = 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87.
\]

The calculations confirm that the total age is indeed 87. Therefore, my age is correctly determined as \( \boxed{13} \).
