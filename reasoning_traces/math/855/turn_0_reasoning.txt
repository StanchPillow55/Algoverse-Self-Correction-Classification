==================================================

Let's denote the ages of the individuals involved with variables:

- Let \( x \) be my age.
- Let \( b \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( s \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( m \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. I am three years younger than my brother:
   \[
   x = b - 3
   \]

2. I am two years older than my sister:
   \[
   x = s + 2
   \]

3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age:
   \[
   m = 3b - 1
   \]

4. The sum of all our ages is 87:
   \[
   x + b + s + m = 87
   \]

Now, we will express all ages in terms of \( b \) (my brother's age).

From the first equation, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( b \):
\[
x = b - 3
\]

From the second equation, we can express \( s \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
s = x - 2
\]
Substituting \( x = b - 3 \) into this equation gives:
\[
s = (b - 3) - 2 = b - 5
\]

Now we can substitute \( x \) and \( s \) into the equation for \( m \):
\[
m = 3b - 1
\]

Now we can substitute \( x \), \( s \), and \( m \) into the sum of ages equation:
\[
(b - 3) + b + (b - 5) + (3b - 1) = 87
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation:
\[
b - 3 + b + b - 5 + 3b - 1 = 87
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
6b - 9 = 87
\]

Next, we will add 9 to both sides:
\[
6b = 96
\]

Now, divide both sides by 6:
\[
b = 16
\]

Now that we have my brother's age, we can find my age \( x \):
\[
x = b - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13
\]

Next, we can find my sister's age \( s \):
\[
s = b - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11
\]

Finally, we can find my mom's age \( m \):
\[
m = 3b - 1 = 3(16) - 1 = 48 - 1 = 47
\]

Now, let's verify the sum of all ages:
\[
x + b + s + m = 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87
\]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, my age is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]
