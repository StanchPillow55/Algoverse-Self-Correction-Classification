==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to define variables for each ingredient in Tanya's salt scrub. Let's denote:

- \( z \) = amount of citrus zest (in ounces)
- \( f \) = amount of fragrance (in ounces)
- \( s \) = amount of salt (in ounces)
- \( o \) = amount of oil (in ounces)
- \( g \) = amount of sugar (in ounces)

From the problem statement, we have the following relationships:

1. The amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance:
   \[
   z = f
   \]

2. The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar:
   \[
   s = g
   \]

3. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt:
   \[
   o = 2s
   \]

4. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest:
   \[
   s = 2z
   \]

Now, we also know that the total amount of all ingredients must equal 10 ounces:
\[
z + f + s + o + g = 10
\]

Now, we can substitute the relationships we have into this equation.

Since \( z = f \), we can replace \( f \) with \( z \):
\[
z + z + s + o + g = 10
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2z + s + o + g = 10
\]

Next, since \( s = g \), we can replace \( g \) with \( s \):
\[
2z + s + o + s = 10
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2z + 2s + o = 10
\]

Now, we can substitute \( o = 2s \) into the equation:
\[
2z + 2s + 2s = 10
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2z + 4s = 10
\]

Now, we can divide the entire equation by 2:
\[
z + 2s = 5
\]

Next, we can substitute \( s = 2z \) into this equation:
\[
z + 2(2z) = 5
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
z + 4z = 5
\]
\[
5z = 5
\]
Dividing both sides by 5 gives:
\[
z = 1
\]

Now that we have \( z \), we can find \( s \):
\[
s = 2z = 2(1) = 2
\]

Next, we can find \( o \):
\[
o = 2s = 2(2) = 4
\]

Finally, we can summarize the amounts:
- \( z = 1 \) ounce (citrus zest)
- \( f = 1 \) ounce (fragrance)
- \( s = 2 \) ounces (salt)
- \( o = 4 \) ounces (oil)
- \( g = 2 \) ounces (sugar)

Now, we check the total:
\[
1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 10 \text{ ounces}
\]

Everything checks out. Therefore, the amount of oil that Tanya uses is:
\[
\boxed{4} \text{ ounces}
\]
