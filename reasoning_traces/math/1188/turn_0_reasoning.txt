==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine Jim's current age based on the information provided about John and their ages when Digimon was released.

1. **Understanding the Information Given**:
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it was released 20 years ago.
   - At the time of the release, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - John is currently 28 years old.

2. **Calculating John's Age at the Time of Release**:
   Since Digimon was released 20 years ago and John is currently 28 years old, we can calculate John's age at the time of the release:
   \[
   \text{John's age at release} = \text{Current age} - \text{Years since release} = 28 - 20 = 8 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Setting Up the Relationship Between John and Jim's Ages**:
   According to the problem, when Digimon was released, John was twice as old as Jim. Let Jim's age at that time be represented as \( j \). Therefore, we can express the relationship as:
   \[
   \text{John's age} = 2 \times \text{Jim's age}
   \]
   Substituting the known value of John's age at the time of release:
   \[
   8 = 2j
   \]

4. **Solving for Jim's Age at the Time of Release**:
   To find Jim's age \( j \), we can rearrange the equation:
   \[
   j = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ years old}
   \]

5. **Calculating Jim's Current Age**:
   Since Jim was 4 years old when Digimon was released 20 years ago, we can find Jim's current age by adding the 20 years that have passed since the release:
   \[
   \text{Jim's current age} = 4 + 20 = 24 \text{ years old}
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, Jim is currently \( \boxed{24} \) years old.
