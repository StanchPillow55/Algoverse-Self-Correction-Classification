==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days Angie can drink coffee with the amount she purchased.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cups of coffee Angie can brew.**

Angie bought 3 lbs. of coffee, and each pound can brew about 40 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups she can brew is calculated by multiplying the number of pounds by the number of cups per pound:

\[
3 \text{ lbs.} \times 40 \text{ cups/lb.} = 120 \text{ cups}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many cups of coffee Angie drinks per day.**

According to the problem, Angie drinks 3 cups of coffee every day.

**Step 3: Calculate how many days the coffee will last.**

To find out how many days the coffee will last, divide the total number of cups by the number of cups she drinks per day:

\[
\frac{120 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ cups/day}} = 40 \text{ days}
\]

Thus, the coffee will last Angie for 40 days.

**Final Answer:**

The coffee will last Angie for 40 days.
