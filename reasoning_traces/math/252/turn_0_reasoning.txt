To determine how many days the coffee will last Angie, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cups of coffee Angie has.**
   - Angie bought 3 lbs. of coffee.
   - Each lb. of coffee brews about 40 cups.
   - Therefore, the total number of cups of coffee can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total cups of coffee} = \text{Number of lbs.} \times \text{Cups per lb.}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cups of coffee} = 3 \, \text{lbs.} \times 40 \, \text{cups/lb.} = 120 \, \text{cups}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many cups of coffee Angie drinks per day.**
   - Angie drinks 3 cups of coffee every day.

3. **Determine how many days the coffee will last.**
   - To find out how many days the coffee will last, we divide the total number of cups of coffee by the number of cups Angie drinks per day:

   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total cups of coffee}}{\text{Cups per day}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{120 \, \text{cups}}{3 \, \text{cups/day}} = 40 \, \text{days}
   \]

Thus, the coffee will last Angie for **40 days**.

Final answer: **40 days**.
