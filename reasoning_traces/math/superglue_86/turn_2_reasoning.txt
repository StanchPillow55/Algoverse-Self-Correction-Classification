==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 86" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical scenario. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 86" is a math problem involving algebraic expressions. Here's how I would solve it:

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 

\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have an equation with variables on both sides. The goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To isolate \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

3. **Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 9 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = 9
   \]

4. **Subtract 5 from both sides:**
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   3(4) + 5 = 2(4) + 9
   \]
   Simplifying both sides:
   \[
   12 + 5 = 8 + 9
   \]
   \[
   17 = 17
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \) is \( x = 4 \).
