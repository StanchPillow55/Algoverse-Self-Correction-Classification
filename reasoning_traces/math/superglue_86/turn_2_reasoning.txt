Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 86" might entail. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by building a fence parallel to the shorter side. How long will the fence be?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is rectangular with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal parts using a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - Imagine the rectangle with the longer side (100 meters) as the base.
   - The shorter side (60 meters) is the width.
   - The fence will be parallel to the 60-meter side, effectively dividing the field into two equal rectangles.

3. **Determine the Dimensions of Each Part:**
   - Since the fence is parallel to the 60-meter side, it will run along the length of the field.
   - The field's total area is \(100 \times 60 = 6000\) square meters.
   - Dividing the field into two equal parts means each part will have an area of \(6000 / 2 = 3000\) square meters.

4. **Calculate the Length of the Fence:**
   - Each part will have an area of 3000 square meters.
   - The width of each part remains 60 meters (since the fence is parallel to the width).
   - Let \(L\) be the length of each part.
   - The area of each part is given by \(L \times 60 = 3000\).
   - Solving for \(L\), we get:
     \[
     L = \frac{3000}{60} = 50 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The length of the fence required to divide the field into two equal parts is 50 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The fence will be 50 meters long.
