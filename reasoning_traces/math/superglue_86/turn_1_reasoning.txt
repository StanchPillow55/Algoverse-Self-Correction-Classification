Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 86" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires a structured approach to solve. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field and also divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field.
   - Dimensions: Length = 120 meters, Width = 80 meters.
   - We need to fence around the entire field.
   - We also need an additional fence to divide the field into two equal parts parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
     \]
   - Substitute the given values:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (120 + 80) = 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Additional Fence Required:**
   - The additional fence is parallel to the shorter side (width) and divides the field into two equal parts.
   - The length of this additional fence is equal to the length of the field, which is 120 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence:**
   - Total fence length = Perimeter of the field + Additional fence
   - Total fence length = 400 meters + 120 meters = 520 meters

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The total length of the fence required is 520 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The total length of the fence required is 520 meters.
