==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to understand the context and details provided in "Sample reasoning question 119." However, since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving reasoning problems, which can be applied to a variety of mathematical and logical scenarios.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given data or conditions.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - Determine if it is a numerical problem, a logical reasoning problem, or a combination of both.
   - Recognize any patterns or sequences if applicable.

3. **Gather Information:**
   - List all known values and conditions.
   - Translate any word problems into mathematical expressions or equations.

4. **Develop a Plan:**
   - Decide on the best approach to solve the problem.
   - Consider using algebraic methods, logical deductions, or graphical representations.

5. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Perform calculations step by step.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.
   - Use logical reasoning to deduce unknowns from knowns.

6. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step for accuracy.
   - Ensure that the solution satisfies all given conditions.
   - Re-calculate if necessary to confirm results.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.
   - Provide a brief explanation of how the answer was derived.

### Example Problem:

Let's assume a hypothetical problem for demonstration:

**Problem Statement:**
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 km/h. If the distance between the two cities is 180 km, how long does the journey take?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time taken for the journey.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - This is a basic distance-speed-time problem.

3. **Gather Information:**
   - Speed = 60 km/h
   - Distance = 180 km

4. **Develop a Plan:**
   - Use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

5. **Execute the Plan:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{180 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify the calculation: \( 60 \times 3 = 180 \), which matches the given distance.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The journey takes 3 hours.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively tackle a wide range of reasoning problems. If you have a specific problem statement, feel free to provide it, and I can offer a more tailored solution.
