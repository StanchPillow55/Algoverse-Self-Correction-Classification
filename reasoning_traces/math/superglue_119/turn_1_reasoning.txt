==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 119" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem, using a hypothetical example.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 119" is a logic puzzle involving a sequence of numbers. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving such a problem:

### Hypothetical Problem:
Consider the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...

**Question:** What is the next number in the sequence?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - Look at the differences or ratios between consecutive terms.
   - From 2 to 4, the number doubles (2 * 2 = 4).
   - From 4 to 8, the number doubles again (4 * 2 = 8).
   - From 8 to 16, the number doubles once more (8 * 2 = 16).

2. **Formulate a Hypothesis:**
   - The sequence appears to be a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 2 to get the next term.

3. **Verify the Pattern:**
   - Check if the pattern holds for all given terms.
   - 2, 4, 8, 16 all follow the rule of multiplying by 2.

4. **Predict the Next Term:**
   - Apply the pattern to the last known term.
   - The last term is 16. Multiply by 2 to find the next term: 16 * 2 = 32.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The next number in the sequence is 32.

### Conclusion:
By identifying the pattern and verifying it with the given terms, we determined that the sequence is geometric with a common ratio of 2. Therefore, the next number in the sequence is 32.

If "Sample reasoning question 119" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details or context so I can tailor the solution accordingly.
