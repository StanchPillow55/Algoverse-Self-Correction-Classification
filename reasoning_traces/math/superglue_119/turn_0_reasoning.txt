==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to follow a structured approach. However, the problem statement you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 119," lacks specific details or numerical information. Therefore, I'll outline a general approach to solving a typical math problem, and if you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Review calculations for accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, ensuring it answers the question asked.

### Example Problem

Since no specific problem was provided, let's consider a simple example:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or question in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to work through it step by step.
