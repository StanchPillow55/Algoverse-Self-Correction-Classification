Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow a structured approach. However, the question provided is "Sample reasoning question 119," which does not contain any specific mathematical problem or context. Without additional details or context, it's challenging to provide a complete solution.

Let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 119" refers to a typical math problem that involves logical reasoning or calculations. Since no specific problem is given, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. How long does it take for the train to reach City B from City A?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Distance from City A to City B = 300 miles
   - Speed of the train = 60 miles per hour

2. **Determine What We Need to Find:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the train to travel from City A to City B.

3. **Use the Formula for Time:**
   - The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

4. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   - Distance = 300 miles
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
   \]

5. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 300 by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - It takes the train 5 hours to travel from City A to City B.

This solution demonstrates a clear and logical approach to solving a typical math problem involving distance, speed, and time. If "Sample reasoning question 119" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details or context, and I would be happy to help solve it.
