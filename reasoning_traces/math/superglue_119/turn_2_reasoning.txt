Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 119." However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem by creating a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem involves a typical reasoning question involving numbers or patterns.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Consider a sequence where each term after the first is the sum of the previous term and a constant number. The first term of the sequence is 5, and the constant number added is 3. What is the 10th term of this sequence?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Sequence:**
   - The sequence is an arithmetic sequence because each term is obtained by adding a constant to the previous term.
   - The first term (\(a_1\)) is 5.
   - The common difference (\(d\)) is 3.

2. **General Formula for an Arithmetic Sequence:**
   - The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \times d
     \]
   - Here, \(a_1 = 5\) and \(d = 3\).

3. **Calculate the 10th Term:**
   - Substitute \(n = 10\) into the formula:
     \[
     a_{10} = 5 + (10-1) \times 3
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     a_{10} = 5 + 9 \times 3
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 5 + 27
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 32
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The 10th term of the sequence is 32.

**Final Answer:**
The 10th term of the sequence is 32.

This example demonstrates a structured approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem involving an arithmetic sequence. If you have a specific problem or additional details, please provide them, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
