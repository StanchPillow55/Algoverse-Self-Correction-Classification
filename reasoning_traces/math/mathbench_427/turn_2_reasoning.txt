==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 427," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 427" is not a specific math problem, I will assume that you meant to provide a specific math problem for me to solve. Without a specific problem, I can create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 7 = 19 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 7 = 19 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 7 = 19
   \]

   Subtract 7 from both sides to get:

   \[
   3x + 7 - 7 = 19 - 7
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 12
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{12}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify the solution.

   \[
   3(4) + 7 = 19
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   12 + 7 = 19
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 7 = 19 \) is \( x = 4 \).
