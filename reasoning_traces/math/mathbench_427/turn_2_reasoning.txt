==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 427," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 427" does not provide enough information about the specific math problem we need to solve. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 427" refers to a hypothetical math problem. Since no specific details are given, I will create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 427:**

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Write the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 48 units, so:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 48
     \]

3. **Substitute the Expression for Length:**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute this into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(3W) + 2W = 48
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     6W + 2W = 48
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     8W = 48
     \]

5. **Solve for Width (W):**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

6. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 3W \) to find the length:
     \[
     L = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The perimeter is indeed 48, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 18 units

This completes the solution to the sample math problem I created based on the given prompt. If you have a specific math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 427," please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
