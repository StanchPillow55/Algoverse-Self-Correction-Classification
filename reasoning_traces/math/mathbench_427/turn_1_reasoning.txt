==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 427," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 427" does not provide specific details about the problem itself. It seems to be a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here.

Since there is no specific math problem provided, I will demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem with the number 427 involved. Let's assume a hypothetical problem involving the number 427:

**Problem:** Suppose you have a number 427, and you need to determine if it is a prime number. If it is not a prime number, find its prime factors.

**Step 1: Determine if 427 is a prime number.**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To determine if 427 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and 427.

**Step 2: Check divisibility by smaller prime numbers.**

We will check divisibility by prime numbers less than the square root of 427. The square root of 427 is approximately 20.66, so we check divisibility by the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19.

- **Divisibility by 2:** 427 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
- **Divisibility by 3:** The sum of the digits of 427 is 4 + 2 + 7 = 13, which is not divisible by 3.
- **Divisibility by 5:** 427 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
- **Divisibility by 7:** Perform the division 427 รท 7 = 61. Since 61 is an integer, 427 is divisible by 7.

Since 427 is divisible by 7, it is not a prime number.

**Step 3: Find the prime factors of 427.**

We found that 427 is divisible by 7, so we divide 427 by 7:

\[ 427 รท 7 = 61 \]

Now, we need to determine if 61 is a prime number. Check divisibility by prime numbers less than the square root of 61 (approximately 7.81):

- **Divisibility by 2:** 61 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
- **Divisibility by 3:** The sum of the digits of 61 is 6 + 1 = 7, which is not divisible by 3.
- **Divisibility by 5:** 61 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
- **Divisibility by 7:** Perform the division 61 รท 7, which does not result in an integer.

Since 61 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, 61 is a prime number.

**Conclusion:**

The prime factors of 427 are 7 and 61.

**Final Answer:**

427 is not a prime number. Its prime factors are 7 and 61.
