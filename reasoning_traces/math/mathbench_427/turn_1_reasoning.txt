==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 427," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 427" is not specific and does not provide any details about the nature of the problem. Therefore, I will assume that "427" might refer to a specific problem number in a textbook or a set of problems, but without additional context, it's impossible to determine the exact nature of the problem.

Since I don't have the details of "Sample math problem 427," I will demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem involving the number 427. Let's consider a problem involving basic arithmetic operations with the number 427.

**Problem:** Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 427 and determine if the sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 427:**
   - The number 427 consists of the digits 4, 2, and 7.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Sum = 4 + 2 + 7

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - 4 + 2 = 6
   - 6 + 7 = 13

4. **Determine if the sum is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The number 13 is greater than 1.
   - Check divisibility of 13 by numbers less than its square root (approximately 3.6):
     - 13 is not divisible by 2 (since it's odd).
     - 13 is not divisible by 3 (since 13 divided by 3 gives a non-integer result).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since 13 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself, it is a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of the number 427 is 13, and 13 is a prime number.
