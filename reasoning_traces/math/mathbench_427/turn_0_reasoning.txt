==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 427," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 427" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 427 and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Find the sum of the digits of the number 427 and determine if this sum is a prime number."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 427:**
   - The number 427 consists of the digits 4, 2, and 7.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Sum = 4 + 2 + 7

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - 4 + 2 = 6
   - 6 + 7 = 13

   Therefore, the sum of the digits of 427 is 13.

4. **Determine if the sum (13) is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - To check if 13 is prime, we need to see if it has any divisors other than 1 and 13.

5. **Check divisibility:**
   - 13 is not divisible by 2 (since it's odd).
   - 13 is not divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 1 + 3 = 4, is not divisible by 3).
   - 13 is not divisible by 5 (since it does not end in 0 or 5).

   Since 13 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself, it is a prime number.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the digits of 427 is 13, and 13 is a prime number.
