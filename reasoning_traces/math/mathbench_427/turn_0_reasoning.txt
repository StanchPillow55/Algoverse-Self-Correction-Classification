==================================================

It seems like you referenced "Sample math problem 427," but I don't have the specific details of that problem. However, I can guide you through a generic math problem-solving process. If you provide the specific problem, I can solve it step by step. 

For now, letâ€™s assume a sample math problem to demonstrate the process. 

**Sample Problem: Solve for x in the equation: 2x + 3 = 11.**

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to isolate the variable \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step 2: Rearranging the Equation
To isolate \( x \), we first need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides.

\[
2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x = 8
\]

### Step 3: Solve for x
Now, we need to isolate \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.

\[
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 4
\]

### Step 4: Verify the Solution
To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]

Calculating the left side:

\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer
The value of \( x \) is \( 4 \).

If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I will solve it step by step!
