==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 355," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 355" without providing any specific details or context. 

Since the problem is not fully specified, I will assume that "355" might refer to a number that we need to work with in some mathematical context. Let's explore a few possibilities of what a math problem involving the number 355 might entail, and solve it step by step.

### Possibility 1: Prime Factorization of 355

One possible problem could be to find the prime factorization of 355.

**Step 1: Check divisibility by 2**
355 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

**Step 2: Check divisibility by 3**
To check divisibility by 3, sum the digits of 355: \(3 + 5 + 5 = 13\). Since 13 is not divisible by 3, 355 is not divisible by 3.

**Step 3: Check divisibility by 5**
355 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5. Dividing 355 by 5 gives:
\[ 355 \div 5 = 71 \]

**Step 4: Check if 71 is a prime number**
71 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7 (since \( \sqrt{71} \approx 8.4 \), we only need to check divisibility up to 7). Therefore, 71 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 355 is:
\[ 355 = 5 \times 71 \]

### Possibility 2: Solve for x in an Equation Involving 355

Another possible problem could be solving an equation like \( x + 355 = 500 \).

**Step 1: Isolate x**
Subtract 355 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x + 355 - 355 = 500 - 355 \]
\[ x = 145 \]

### Possibility 3: Find the Sum of the Digits of 355

A simpler problem could be to find the sum of the digits of 355.

**Step 1: Add the digits**
The digits of 355 are 3, 5, and 5. Adding these gives:
\[ 3 + 5 + 5 = 13 \]

### Conclusion

Since the original problem statement was not specific, I explored a few different mathematical problems involving the number 355. Here are the solutions to each possibility:

1. **Prime Factorization of 355**: \( 355 = 5 \times 71 \)
2. **Solve for x in \( x + 355 = 500 \)**: \( x = 145 \)
3. **Sum of the digits of 355**: 13

If you have a specific problem in mind involving the number 355, please provide more details, and I would be happy to solve it for you.
