Question ID: mathbench_355
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 355" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I can't provide a solution. However, I can guide you on how to approach solving a typical math problem.

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that apply to the problem.
   - Consider different strategies such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Recalculate if necessary to ensure accuracy.

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample math problem 355," I can't provide a detailed solution. If you can provide the actual math problem, I'd be happy to help solve it step by step.
