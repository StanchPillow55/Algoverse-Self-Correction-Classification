==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 355, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 355" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. Therefore, I will assume a hypothetical math problem involving the number 355 and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Find the sum of the digits of the number 355, and then determine if this sum is a prime number.

**Step 1: Find the sum of the digits of 355.**

The number 355 consists of three digits: 3, 5, and 5. To find the sum of these digits, we simply add them together:

\[ 3 + 5 + 5 = 13 \]

**Step 2: Determine if the sum (13) is a prime number.**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To determine if 13 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and 13.

- The divisors of 13 are 1 and 13.
- 13 is not divisible by any other numbers (e.g., 2, 3, 4, etc.) without leaving a remainder.

Since 13 has no divisors other than 1 and itself, it is a prime number.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the digits of 355 is 13, and 13 is a prime number.
