It seems like you've mentioned "Sample math problem 355," but without specific details or context, it's unclear what the problem entails. To help you effectively, I'll need more information about the problem you're referring to. However, I can create a sample math problem and solve it step by step for you. Let's proceed with a hypothetical problem:

**Sample Math Problem:**

Calculate the sum of the first 355 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

To find the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[
S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)
\]

where:
- \( S_n \) is the sum of the series,
- \( n \) is the number of terms,
- \( a \) is the first term,
- \( l \) is the last term.

For the first 355 positive integers:
- \( n = 355 \),
- \( a = 1 \),
- \( l = 355 \).

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[
S_{355} = \frac{355}{2} \times (1 + 355)
\]

Calculate the expression inside the parentheses:

\[
1 + 355 = 356
\]

Now substitute back into the formula:

\[
S_{355} = \frac{355}{2} \times 356
\]

Calculate \( \frac{355}{2} \):

\[
\frac{355}{2} = 177.5
\]

Multiply this by 356:

\[
177.5 \times 356 = 63190
\]

Thus, the sum of the first 355 positive integers is:

\[
\boxed{63190}
\]

This is the complete solution to the problem, showing all calculations and reasoning. If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample math problem 355," please provide the details, and I can assist you further.
