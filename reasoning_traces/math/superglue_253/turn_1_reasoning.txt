==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify the question. The question provided is "Sample reasoning question 253," which seems to be a placeholder or an incomplete problem statement. Without specific details or numerical information, it's challenging to provide a precise solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving reasoning problems in mathematics.

### General Approach to Solving Mathematical Reasoning Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given data or conditions.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Determine the type of problem (e.g., algebra, geometry, probability).
   - Consider similar problems you've solved before.
   - Choose a strategy (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step for accuracy.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Ensure all parts of the question are addressed.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present your final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution:

Since the original question is not specific, let's consider a simple example problem:

**Example Problem:**
A train travels 60 miles in 1.5 hours. What is the average speed of the train in miles per hour?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the average speed.
   - Distance traveled = 60 miles.
   - Time taken = 1.5 hours.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for average speed: 
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
     \]

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the given values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{1.5 \text{ hours}} = 40 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Check the calculation: \(60 \div 1.5 = 40\).
   - The units are consistent (miles per hour).

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The average speed of the train is 40 miles per hour.

### Conclusion:

Without specific details from "Sample reasoning question 253," I provided a general framework and an example to illustrate how to approach and solve a mathematical reasoning problem. If you have a specific problem or more details, feel free to share, and I can provide a more targeted solution.
