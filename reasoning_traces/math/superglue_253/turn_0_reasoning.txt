==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 253" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day. The profit from each Type A widget is $5, and the profit from each Type B widget is $7. The company must produce at least 20 Type A widgets and at least 10 Type B widgets each day. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up the Constraints:**
   - The total number of widgets produced cannot exceed 100:
     \[
     x + y \leq 100
     \]
   - At least 20 Type A widgets must be produced:
     \[
     x \geq 20
     \]
   - At least 10 Type B widgets must be produced:
     \[
     y \geq 10
     \]

3. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = 5x + 7y
     \]
   - We want to maximize \( P \).

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the lines \( x + y = 100 \), \( x = 20 \), and \( y = 10 \) on a coordinate plane.
   - Identify the feasible region that satisfies all constraints.

5. **Find the Corner Points:**
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines and the axes. The corner points are where the lines intersect:
     - Intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( x = 20 \):
       \[
       20 + y = 100 \implies y = 80 \quad \text{(Point: (20, 80))}
       \]
     - Intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( y = 10 \):
       \[
       x + 10 = 100 \implies x = 90 \quad \text{(Point: (90, 10))}
       \]
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( y = 10 \):
       \[
       \text{(Point: (20, 10))}
       \]

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(20, 80) = 5(20) + 7(80) = 100 + 560 = 660 \)
   - \( P(90, 10) = 5(90) + 7(10) = 450 + 70 = 520 \)
   - \( P(20, 10) = 5(20) + 7(10) = 100 + 70 = 170 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the point (20, 80) with a profit of $660.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 20 Type A widgets and 80 Type B widgets per day, resulting in a maximum profit of $660.
