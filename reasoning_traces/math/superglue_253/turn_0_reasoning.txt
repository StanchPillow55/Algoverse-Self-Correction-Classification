==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 253" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces widgets. The cost to produce \( x \) widgets is given by the function \( C(x) = 5x + 200 \), where \( C(x) \) is the total cost in dollars. The company sells each widget for $10. How many widgets must the company sell to break even?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of widgets, \( x \), that must be sold to break even.
   - Breaking even means the total revenue equals the total cost.

2. **Define the Revenue Function:**
   - Revenue, \( R(x) \), is the total income from selling \( x \) widgets.
   - Since each widget sells for $10, the revenue function is \( R(x) = 10x \).

3. **Set Up the Break-Even Equation:**
   - To break even, set the revenue equal to the cost: 
   \[
   R(x) = C(x)
   \]
   \[
   10x = 5x + 200
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides to isolate terms involving \( x \):
   \[
   10x - 5x = 200
   \]
   \[
   5x = 200
   \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{200}{5}
   \]
   \[
   x = 40
   \]

5. **Interpret the Result:**
   - The company must sell 40 widgets to break even.

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Calculate the total cost for 40 widgets:
   \[
   C(40) = 5(40) + 200 = 200 + 200 = 400
   \]
   - Calculate the total revenue for 40 widgets:
   \[
   R(40) = 10(40) = 400
   \]
   - Since the total cost equals the total revenue at 40 widgets, the solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The company must sell 40 widgets to break even.
