==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 265." However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.

### General Approach to Solving a Math Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Using logical reasoning.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify each step of the calculation.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Ensure that all parts of the problem have been addressed.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's consider an example problem to illustrate this approach:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - Given: Length \( L = 2W \) (where \( W \) is the width), and the perimeter \( P = 36 \) units.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2L + 2W \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( W \):
     \[
     36 = 4W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6W
     \]
     \[
     W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find \( L \) using \( L = 2W \):
     \[
     L = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are correct, and the solution satisfies the given conditions.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the rectangle are: Length = 12 units, Width = 6 units.
