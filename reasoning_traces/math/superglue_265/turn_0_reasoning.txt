==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 265." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. Let's assume a sample problem:

**Problem:**
A car travels from Town A to Town B at a speed of 60 km/h and returns from Town B to Town A at a speed of 40 km/h. If the total travel time is 5 hours, what is the distance between Town A and Town B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between Town A and Town B in kilometers.
   - The speed from A to B is 60 km/h.
   - The speed from B to A is 40 km/h.
   - The total travel time is 5 hours.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Time taken to travel from A to B: \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - Time taken to travel from B to A: \( \frac{d}{40} \) hours.
   - Total travel time is given as 5 hours.

3. **Create the Equation:**
   \[
   \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = 5
   \]

4. **Find a Common Denominator:**
   - The common denominator for 60 and 40 is 120.

5. **Rewrite the Equation:**
   \[
   \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = 5
   \]

6. **Combine the Fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{5d}{120} = 5
   \]

7. **Solve for \( d \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 120 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     5d = 600
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5:
     \[
     d = 120
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Time from A to B: \( \frac{120}{60} = 2 \) hours.
   - Time from B to A: \( \frac{120}{40} = 3 \) hours.
   - Total time: \( 2 + 3 = 5 \) hours, which matches the given total travel time.

**Final Answer:**
The distance between Town A and Town B is 120 kilometers.
