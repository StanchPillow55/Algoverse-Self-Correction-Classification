==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 93" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or documents, I will assume this is a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Without specific details, I'll create a sample problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels the first half of the distance at a speed of 60 miles per hour and the second half at a speed of 40 miles per hour. What is the total time taken for the journey?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Total distance = 300 miles.
   - First half distance = 300 miles / 2 = 150 miles.
   - Second half distance = 150 miles.
   - Speed for the first half = 60 mph.
   - Speed for the second half = 40 mph.

2. **Calculate the Time for Each Half:**
   - Time is calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

   - **First Half:**
     \[
     \text{Time for first half} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ mph}} = 2.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

   - **Second Half:**
     \[
     \text{Time for second half} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ mph}} = 3.75 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Time:**
   - Add the time taken for both halves of the journey:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 2.5 \text{ hours} + 3.75 \text{ hours} = 6.25 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The total time taken for the train to travel from City A to City B is 6.25 hours.

**Final Answer:**
The total time taken for the journey is 6.25 hours.
