==================================================

To find out how much Jen's travel costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the cost of supplies**: According to the problem, Jen pays $400 for supplies.

2. **Calculate the cost of travel**: The problem states that the tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies. To find out how much 50% of the supplies cost, we calculate:

   \[
   50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200
   \]

3. **Add the additional cost to the original cost of supplies**: Since the travel costs 50% more than the supplies, we add this amount to the original cost of the supplies:

   \[
   \text{Cost of travel} = \text{Cost of supplies} + 50\% \text{ of Cost of supplies}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of travel} = 400 + 200 = 600
   \]

Thus, the total cost of travel is **$600**.

4. **Final answer**: Therefore, the travel costs **$600**.
