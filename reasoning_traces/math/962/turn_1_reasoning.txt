Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total cost of travel tickets based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the cost of supplies**: 
   Jen has to pay $400 for the supplies he needs.

2. **Calculate the cost of travel tickets**: 
   The problem states that the tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies. To find out how much more that is, we first need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies.

   \[
   \text{50% of supplies cost} = 0.50 \times 400 = 200
   \]

3. **Add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel tickets**:
   The total cost of the travel tickets is the cost of the supplies plus the additional 50%.

   \[
   \text{Total cost of travel tickets} = \text{Cost of supplies} + \text{50% of supplies cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of travel tickets} = 400 + 200 = 600
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total cost of travel tickets is **$600**.

In conclusion, the travel cost is **$600**.
