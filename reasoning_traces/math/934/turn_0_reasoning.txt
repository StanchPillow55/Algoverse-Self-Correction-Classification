To find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney in the watermelon seed spitting contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person spits their seeds and then find the average of those two distances.

**Step 1: Calculate Zoey's total distance.**
- Zoey has 40 seeds.
- She spits each seed 10 feet.

To find the total distance Zoey spits, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat:

\[
\text{Total distance spat by Zoey} = \text{Number of seeds} \times \text{Distance per seed}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance spat by Zoey} = 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Sydney's total distance.**
- Sydney has 35 seeds.
- She spits each seed 12 feet.

Similarly, we calculate the total distance Sydney spits:

\[
\text{Total distance spat by Sydney} = \text{Number of seeds} \times \text{Distance per seed}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance spat by Sydney} = 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the average total distance spat.**
Now we have the total distances for both Zoey and Sydney:
- Zoey: 400 feet
- Sydney: 420 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we add both distances and divide by the number of participants (which is 2):

\[
\text{Average total distance} = \frac{\text{Total distance by Zoey} + \text{Total distance by Sydney}}{2}
\]
\[
\text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2}
\]
\[
\text{Average total distance} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet}
\]

**Final Answer:**
The average total distance spat is **410 feet**.
