==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of each type of coin Ravi has and then calculate the total value of these coins.

### Step 1: Determine the number of each type of coin

1. **Nickels:**
   - Ravi has 6 nickels.

2. **Quarters:**
   - Ravi has 2 more quarters than nickels.
   - Since he has 6 nickels, the number of quarters is:
     \[
     6 + 2 = 8 \text{ quarters}
     \]

3. **Dimes:**
   - Ravi has 4 more dimes than quarters.
   - Since he has 8 quarters, the number of dimes is:
     \[
     8 + 4 = 12 \text{ dimes}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total value of the coins

1. **Value of Nickels:**
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - The total value of 6 nickels is:
     \[
     6 \times 0.05 = 0.30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Value of Quarters:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - The total value of 8 quarters is:
     \[
     8 \times 0.25 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Value of Dimes:**
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - The total value of 12 dimes is:
     \[
     12 \times 0.10 = 1.20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money

Add up the values of all the coins:
\[
0.30 + 2.00 + 1.20 = 3.50 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Ravi has a total of $3.50.
