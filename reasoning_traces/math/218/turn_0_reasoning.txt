To solve the problem, we need to determine how many coins Ravi has and their respective values.

1. **Identify the number of nickels:**
   - Ravi has 6 nickels.

2. **Determine the number of quarters:**
   - According to the problem, Ravi has 2 more quarters than nickels. 
   - Since he has 6 nickels, the number of quarters is:
     \[
     \text{Number of quarters} = \text{Number of nickels} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8
     \]

3. **Determine the number of dimes:**
   - The problem states that Ravi has 4 more dimes than quarters.
   - Since he has 8 quarters, the number of dimes is:
     \[
     \text{Number of dimes} = \text{Number of quarters} + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12
     \]

4. **Calculate the total value of the coins:**
   - Now we will calculate the total value of each type of coin.
   - The value of the nickels:
     \[
     \text{Value of nickels} = \text{Number of nickels} \times 0.05 = 6 \times 0.05 = 0.30 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The value of the quarters:
     \[
     \text{Value of quarters} = \text{Number of quarters} \times 0.25 = 8 \times 0.25 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The value of the dimes:
     \[
     \text{Value of dimes} = \text{Number of dimes} \times 0.10 = 12 \times 0.10 = 1.20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Sum the total value of all coins:**
   - Now we add the values of all the coins together:
     \[
     \text{Total value} = \text{Value of nickels} + \text{Value of quarters} + \text{Value of dimes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total value} = 0.30 + 2.00 + 1.20 = 3.50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total amount of money Ravi has is:
     \[
     \boxed{3.50} \text{ dollars}
     \]
