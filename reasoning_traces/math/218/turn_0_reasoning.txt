==================================================

To solve the problem, we will first determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. **Determine Harriet's age**:
   - We are given that Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Adrian's age**:
   - The problem states that Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. 
   - Since Harriet is 21 years old, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Determine Zack's age**:
   - The problem also states that Harriet is half the age of Zack. 
   - Since Harriet is 21 years old, we can express Zack's age as:
     \[
     \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
     \]

Now we have the current ages of all three individuals:
- Adrian: 63 years old
- Harriet: 21 years old
- Zack: 42 years old

4. **Calculate their ages in three years**:
   - In three years, each person's age will increase by 3 years. Therefore:
     - Adrian's age in three years:
       \[
       63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years old}
       \]
     - Harriet's age in three years:
       \[
       21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years old}
       \]
     - Zack's age in three years:
       \[
       42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years old}
       \]

5. **Calculate the average age of the three in three years**:
   - To find the average age, we will sum the ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years and then divide by the number of individuals (which is 3).
   - The sum of their ages in three years is:
     \[
     66 + 24 + 45 = 135
     \]
   - Now, we calculate the average:
     \[
     \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age}}{\text{Number of individuals}} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
     \]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years will be:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]
