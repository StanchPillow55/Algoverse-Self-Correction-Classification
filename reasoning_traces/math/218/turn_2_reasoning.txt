Question ID: 218
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many coins Ravi has and their respective values. We will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of nickels**:
   - According to the problem, Ravi has 6 nickels.

2. **Determine the number of quarters**:
   - The problem states that Ravi has 2 more quarters than nickels. Since he has 6 nickels, we can calculate the number of quarters as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of quarters} = \text{Number of nickels} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8
     \]

3. **Determine the number of dimes**:
   - The problem also states that Ravi has 4 more dimes than quarters. Since we found that he has 8 quarters, we can calculate the number of dimes as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of dimes} = \text{Number of quarters} + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12
     \]

4. **Calculate the total value of the coins**:
   - Now that we know the number of each type of coin, we can calculate the total value of the coins Ravi has.
   - The value of each type of coin is as follows:
     - Nickels: Each nickel is worth $0.05.
     - Quarters: Each quarter is worth $0.25.
     - Dimes: Each dime is worth $0.10.

   - Now we calculate the total value for each type of coin:
     - Value of nickels:
       \[
       \text{Value of nickels} = \text{Number of nickels} \times \text{Value per nickel} = 6 \times 0.05 = 0.30 \text{ dollars}
       \]
     - Value of quarters:
       \[
       \text{Value of quarters} = \text{Number of quarters} \times \text{Value per quarter} = 8 \times 0.25 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
       \]
     - Value of dimes:
       \[
       \text{Value of dimes} = \text{Number of dimes} \times \text{Value per dime} = 12 \times 0.10 = 1.20 \text{ dollars}
       \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of money**:
   - Now we sum the values of all the coins to find the total amount of money Ravi has:
     \[
     \text{Total amount} = \text{Value of nickels} + \text{Value of quarters} + \text{Value of dimes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total amount} = 0.30 + 2.00 + 1.20 = 3.50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the total amount of money Ravi has is \(\boxed{3.50}\) dollars.
