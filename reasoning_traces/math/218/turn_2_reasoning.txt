Question ID: 218
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of coin Ravi has and then calculate the total value of these coins. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of each type of coin

1. **Nickels:**
   - Ravi has 6 nickels. This is given directly in the problem.

2. **Quarters:**
   - Ravi has 2 more quarters than nickels.
   - Since he has 6 nickels, the number of quarters he has is:
     \[
     \text{Number of quarters} = 6 + 2 = 8
     \]

3. **Dimes:**
   - Ravi has 4 more dimes than quarters.
   - Since he has 8 quarters, the number of dimes he has is:
     \[
     \text{Number of dimes} = 8 + 4 = 12
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total value of the coins

1. **Value of Nickels:**
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - The total value of 6 nickels is:
     \[
     6 \times 0.05 = 0.30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Value of Quarters:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - The total value of 8 quarters is:
     \[
     8 \times 0.25 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Value of Dimes:**
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - The total value of 12 dimes is:
     \[
     12 \times 0.10 = 1.20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money

To find the total amount of money Ravi has, we add the values of all the coins together:
\[
0.30 + 2.00 + 1.20 = 3.50 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Ravi has a total of $3.50.
