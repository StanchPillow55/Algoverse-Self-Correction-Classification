Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of coin Ravi has and then calculate the total amount of money based on those quantities.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Number of Nickels:**
   - We are given that Ravi has 6 nickels.

2. **Determine the Number of Quarters:**
   - According to the problem, Ravi has 2 more quarters than nickels.
   - Since he has 6 nickels, the number of quarters is:
     \[
     \text{Number of quarters} = 6 + 2 = 8
     \]

3. **Determine the Number of Dimes:**
   - The problem states that Ravi has 4 more dimes than quarters.
   - Since he has 8 quarters, the number of dimes is:
     \[
     \text{Number of dimes} = 8 + 4 = 12
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Value of Each Type of Coin:**
   - **Nickels:** Each nickel is worth $0.05. Therefore, the total value of the nickels is:
     \[
     \text{Value of nickels} = 6 \times 0.05 = 0.30 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - **Quarters:** Each quarter is worth $0.25. Therefore, the total value of the quarters is:
     \[
     \text{Value of quarters} = 8 \times 0.25 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - **Dimes:** Each dime is worth $0.10. Therefore, the total value of the dimes is:
     \[
     \text{Value of dimes} = 12 \times 0.10 = 1.20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the Total Amount of Money:**
   - Add the values of all the coins together to find the total amount of money Ravi has:
     \[
     \text{Total money} = 0.30 + 2.00 + 1.20 = 3.50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Ravi has a total of $3.50.
