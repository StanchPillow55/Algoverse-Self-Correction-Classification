==================================================

To find out how many fish Catriona has in her aquarium, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of goldfish**:
   Catriona has 8 goldfish.

2. **Determine the number of angelfish**:
   According to the problem, Catriona has 4 more angelfish than goldfish. 
   - Since she has 8 goldfish, we can calculate the number of angelfish as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of angelfish} = \text{Number of goldfish} + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12
   \]

3. **Determine the number of guppies**:
   The problem states that Catriona has twice as many guppies as angelfish.
   - Since we found that she has 12 angelfish, we can calculate the number of guppies as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of guppies} = 2 \times \text{Number of angelfish} = 2 \times 12 = 24
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of fish**:
   Now we can find the total number of fish in the aquarium by adding the number of goldfish, angelfish, and guppies together:
   \[
   \text{Total number of fish} = \text{Number of goldfish} + \text{Number of angelfish} + \text{Number of guppies}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total number of fish} = 8 + 12 + 24
   \]

5. **Perform the addition**:
   \[
   8 + 12 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 + 24 = 44
   \]

Thus, the total number of fish Catriona has in her aquarium is **44**.

Final answer: **44** fish.
