==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of fish Catriona has and then sum them up to find the total number of fish in her aquarium.

1. **Determine the number of goldfish:**
   - We are given that Catriona has 8 goldfish.

2. **Determine the number of angelfish:**
   - We are told that Catriona has 4 more angelfish than goldfish.
   - Since she has 8 goldfish, the number of angelfish is:
     \[
     \text{Number of angelfish} = \text{Number of goldfish} + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12
     \]

3. **Determine the number of guppies:**
   - We are informed that Catriona has twice as many guppies as angelfish.
   - Since she has 12 angelfish, the number of guppies is:
     \[
     \text{Number of guppies} = 2 \times \text{Number of angelfish} = 2 \times 12 = 24
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of fish:**
   - Now, we add up the number of each type of fish to find the total number of fish in the aquarium:
     \[
     \text{Total number of fish} = \text{Number of goldfish} + \text{Number of angelfish} + \text{Number of guppies}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we found:
     \[
     \text{Total number of fish} = 8 + 12 + 24 = 44
     \]

Therefore, Catriona has a total of 44 fish in her aquarium.

**Final Answer: 44 fish**
