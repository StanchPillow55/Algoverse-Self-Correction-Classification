==================================================

To determine how many friends Morgan can invite to her birthday party, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and then see how many friends can be included within her $90 budget.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost for one person

1. **Cost of mini-golf**: 
   - Each round of mini-golf costs $5.
   
2. **Cost of arcade tokens**: 
   - Each person gets $5 in arcade tokens.
   
3. **Cost of go-karts**: 
   - Each ride on the go-karts costs $10, and Morgan wants to ride twice.
   - Therefore, the cost for go-karts for one person is:
     \[
     2 \text{ rides} \times 10 \text{ dollars/ride} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for one person

Now, we can sum up the costs for one person:
\[
\text{Total cost for one person} = \text{Cost of mini-golf} + \text{Cost of arcade tokens} + \text{Cost of go-karts}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for one person} = 5 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} + 20 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many people can be accommodated within the budget

Morgan has a total budget of $90. We need to find out how many people (including Morgan) can be accommodated within this budget. 

Let \( n \) be the total number of people (Morgan plus her friends). The total cost for \( n \) people is:
\[
\text{Total cost for } n \text{ people} = n \times 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

We set up the inequality:
\[
n \times 30 \leq 90
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( n \)

To find \( n \), we divide both sides of the inequality by 30:
\[
n \leq \frac{90}{30} = 3
\]

### Step 5: Determine the number of friends

Since \( n \) includes Morgan herself, we need to subtract 1 from \( n \) to find out how many friends she can invite:
\[
\text{Number of friends} = n - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2
\]

### Final Answer

Morgan can invite **2 friends** to her birthday party.
