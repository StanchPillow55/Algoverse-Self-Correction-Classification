==================================================

It seems like you've referenced a "Sample reasoning question 193," but without specific details or context about the problem, I can't provide a solution. However, I can guide you on how to approach a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what is missing.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation, using logical reasoning).
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's solve a sample problem using this approach:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
- We know the perimeter is 36 units.
- The length is twice the width.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
- Let \( w \) be the width. Then the length is \( 2w \).
- Substitute into the perimeter formula: \( 36 = 2 \times (2w + w) \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Simplify the equation: \( 36 = 2 \times 3w \).
- \( 36 = 6w \).
- Solve for \( w \): \( w = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \).

**Step 4: Check Your Work**
- If \( w = 6 \), then the length \( l = 2w = 12 \).
- Check the perimeter: \( 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36 \), which matches the given perimeter.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.
