==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the current age of Cori's aunt based on the information provided.

1. **Identify Cori's current age**: 
   Cori is currently 3 years old.

2. **Determine Cori's age in 5 years**: 
   In 5 years, Cori will be:
   \[
   3 \text{ years} + 5 \text{ years} = 8 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Set up the relationship between Cori's age and her aunt's age**: 
   According to the problem, in 5 years, Cori will be one-third the age of her aunt. Let's denote the current age of Cori's aunt as \( x \).

4. **Calculate the aunt's age in 5 years**: 
   In 5 years, Cori's aunt will be:
   \[
   x + 5 \text{ years}
   \]

5. **Set up the equation based on the relationship**: 
   The problem states that in 5 years, Cori's age will be one-third of her aunt's age. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   8 = \frac{1}{3}(x + 5)
   \]

6. **Solve the equation for \( x \)**:
   To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = x + 5
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   24 = x + 5
   \]

   Next, subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   24 - 5 = x
   \]
   \[
   x = 19
   \]

7. **Conclusion**: 
   Cori's aunt is currently \( 19 \) years old.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Cori's aunt is } 19 \text{ years old today.}
\]
