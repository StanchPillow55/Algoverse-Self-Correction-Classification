==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the current age of Cori's aunt based on the information given about their ages in the future.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the current age of Cori:**
   - Cori is currently 3 years old.

2. **Determine Cori's age in 5 years:**
   - In 5 years, Cori will be \(3 + 5 = 8\) years old.

3. **Use the information about the aunt's age in 5 years:**
   - In 5 years, Cori will be one-third the age of her aunt. Let's denote the current age of Cori's aunt as \(A\).

4. **Express the aunt's age in 5 years:**
   - In 5 years, Cori's aunt will be \(A + 5\) years old.

5. **Set up the equation based on the given relationship:**
   - According to the problem, in 5 years, Cori's age will be one-third of her aunt's age. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     8 = \frac{1}{3}(A + 5)
     \]

6. **Solve the equation for \(A\):**
   - First, eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:
     \[
     3 \times 8 = A + 5
     \]
     \[
     24 = A + 5
     \]

   - Next, solve for \(A\) by subtracting 5 from both sides:
     \[
     24 - 5 = A
     \]
     \[
     A = 19
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Cori's aunt is currently 19 years old.

Therefore, the final answer is that Cori's aunt is 19 years old today.
