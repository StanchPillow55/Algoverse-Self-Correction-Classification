Question ID: mathbench_90
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 90" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, let's assume that "Sample math problem 90" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I will create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 90" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Sample math problem 90: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
