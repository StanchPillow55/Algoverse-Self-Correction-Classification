==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 90" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it is a generic math problem involving the number 90. Let's consider a few possibilities and solve them step by step.

### Possibility 1: Find the Prime Factorization of 90

**Step 1: Identify the smallest prime number that divides 90.**

The smallest prime number is 2. Check if 90 is divisible by 2:

\[ 90 \div 2 = 45 \]

Since 90 is divisible by 2, we write:

\[ 90 = 2 \times 45 \]

**Step 2: Factor 45 further.**

The next smallest prime number is 3. Check if 45 is divisible by 3:

\[ 45 \div 3 = 15 \]

So, we can write:

\[ 45 = 3 \times 15 \]

**Step 3: Factor 15 further.**

Check if 15 is divisible by 3:

\[ 15 \div 3 = 5 \]

So, we can write:

\[ 15 = 3 \times 5 \]

**Step 4: Combine all the factors.**

Now, we have:

\[ 90 = 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5 \]

This can be written using exponents as:

\[ 90 = 2^1 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \]

**Final Answer for Possibility 1:**

The prime factorization of 90 is \( 2^1 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \).

### Possibility 2: Calculate 90% of a Number

Let's assume the problem is to find 90% of a given number, say 100.

**Step 1: Convert the percentage to a decimal.**

90% as a decimal is:

\[ 90\% = \frac{90}{100} = 0.9 \]

**Step 2: Multiply the decimal by the given number.**

To find 90% of 100:

\[ 0.9 \times 100 = 90 \]

**Final Answer for Possibility 2:**

90% of 100 is 90.

### Possibility 3: Solve for x in the Equation \( x + 90 = 180 \)

**Step 1: Isolate x.**

Subtract 90 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x + 90 - 90 = 180 - 90 \]

\[ x = 90 \]

**Final Answer for Possibility 3:**

The solution to the equation \( x + 90 = 180 \) is \( x = 90 \).

### Conclusion

Without a specific problem statement, I have considered different scenarios involving the number 90. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details, and I can solve it accordingly.
