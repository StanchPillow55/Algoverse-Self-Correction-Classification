==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 90" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I will assume it is a generic math problem labeled as "90." Without specific details, I will create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 90 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of 90 and determine the number of divisors it has.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 90**

To find the prime factorization of 90, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue with the next smallest prime numbers.

1. 90 is even, so divide by 2:
   \[
   90 \div 2 = 45
   \]
   So, 90 = 2 × 45.

2. 45 is not even, so we try the next smallest prime number, which is 3:
   \[
   45 \div 3 = 15
   \]
   So, 45 = 3 × 15, and thus 90 = 2 × 3 × 15.

3. 15 is divisible by 3:
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
   So, 15 = 3 × 5, and thus 90 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5.

Now, we have the prime factorization of 90:
\[
90 = 2^1 \times 3^2 \times 5^1
\]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number given its prime factorization, use the formula:
\[
(n_1 + 1)(n_2 + 1)(n_3 + 1) \ldots
\]
where \(n_1, n_2, n_3, \ldots\) are the exponents in the prime factorization.

For 90 = \(2^1 \times 3^2 \times 5^1\), the exponents are 1, 2, and 1.

Calculate the number of divisors:
\[
(1 + 1)(2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 2 \times 3 \times 2 = 12
\]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 90 is \(2^1 \times 3^2 \times 5^1\), and it has 12 divisors.
