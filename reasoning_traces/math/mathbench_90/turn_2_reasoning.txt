Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 90" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 90. Let's consider a common type of problem involving the number 90, such as finding its factors, determining if it's a prime number, or solving an equation where 90 is a part of the solution.

Let's explore a problem involving the factors of 90:

**Problem:** Find all the factors of 90 and determine if 90 is a prime number.

**Step 1: Understanding Factors**
Factors of a number are integers that can be multiplied together to produce the original number. For example, if \( a \times b = 90 \), then both \( a \) and \( b \) are factors of 90.

**Step 2: Finding Factors of 90**
To find the factors of 90, we start with the number 1 and the number itself, 90. We then check each integer between 1 and 90 to see if it divides 90 without leaving a remainder.

- \( 1 \times 90 = 90 \)
- \( 2 \times 45 = 90 \) (since 90 is even, it's divisible by 2)
- \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) (sum of digits \( 9 + 0 = 9 \), divisible by 3)
- \( 5 \times 18 = 90 \) (last digit is 0, divisible by 5)
- \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) (since 90 is divisible by both 2 and 3, it's divisible by 6)
- \( 9 \times 10 = 90 \) (sum of digits \( 9 + 0 = 9 \), divisible by 9)

**Step 3: Listing All Factors**
From the calculations above, the factors of 90 are:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90 \]

**Step 4: Determine if 90 is a Prime Number**
A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. Since 90 has more than two factors, it is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The factors of 90 are \( 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, \) and \( 90 \). The number 90 is not a prime number.
