==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 90" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume it involves a mathematical operation or concept related to the number 90. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations
Let's assume the problem involves basic arithmetic operations with the number 90.

1. **Addition**: 
   - Problem: What is 90 + 10?
   - Solution: 
     \[
     90 + 10 = 100
     \]
   - Final Answer: 100

2. **Subtraction**:
   - Problem: What is 90 - 10?
   - Solution:
     \[
     90 - 10 = 80
     \]
   - Final Answer: 80

3. **Multiplication**:
   - Problem: What is 90 \times 2?
   - Solution:
     \[
     90 \times 2 = 180
     \]
   - Final Answer: 180

4. **Division**:
   - Problem: What is 90 \div 3?
   - Solution:
     \[
     90 \div 3 = 30
     \]
   - Final Answer: 30

### Possibility 2: Prime Factorization
Let's assume the problem involves finding the prime factorization of 90.

- To find the prime factorization, we divide 90 by the smallest prime number possible and continue the process with the quotient until we reach 1.

1. Divide 90 by 2 (the smallest prime number):
   \[
   90 \div 2 = 45
   \]
   So, 90 = 2 \times 45.

2. Next, divide 45 by 3 (the next smallest prime number):
   \[
   45 \div 3 = 15
   \]
   So, 45 = 3 \times 15.

3. Continue with 15:
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
   So, 15 = 3 \times 5.

4. Finally, 5 is a prime number.

- Therefore, the prime factorization of 90 is:
  \[
  90 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5
  \]

- Final Answer: \(2 \times 3^2 \times 5\)

### Possibility 3: Solving an Equation
Let's assume the problem involves solving a simple equation where 90 is part of the equation.

- Problem: Solve for \(x\) in the equation \(x + 90 = 150\).

1. Subtract 90 from both sides to isolate \(x\):
   \[
   x + 90 - 90 = 150 - 90
   \]
   \[
   x = 60
   \]

- Final Answer: \(x = 60\)

### Conclusion
Without a specific problem statement, I've explored several mathematical scenarios involving the number 90. Each scenario provides a different type of problem and solution. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details for a targeted solution.
