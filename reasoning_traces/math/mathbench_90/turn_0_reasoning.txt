==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 90" refers to. Since the problem statement is not fully provided, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 90" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual details of the problem, I will create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 90 and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Find the sum of all positive divisors of 90.

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the Prime Factorization of 90:**

   The first step is to express 90 as a product of its prime factors.

   - 90 is even, so divide by 2:  
     \( 90 \div 2 = 45 \)  
     So, 90 = \( 2 \times 45 \).

   - 45 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 4 + 5 = 9, is divisible by 3):  
     \( 45 \div 3 = 15 \)  
     So, 45 = \( 3 \times 15 \).

   - 15 is also divisible by 3:  
     \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \)  
     So, 15 = \( 3 \times 5 \).

   - 5 is a prime number.

   Therefore, the prime factorization of 90 is:  
   \( 90 = 2^1 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \).

2. **Use the Divisor Function Formula:**

   The sum of the divisors of a number \( n = p_1^{k_1} \times p_2^{k_2} \times \cdots \times p_m^{k_m} \) is given by:  
   \[
   \sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \cdots + p_1^{k_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \cdots + p_2^{k_2}) \cdots (1 + p_m + p_m^2 + \cdots + p_m^{k_m})
   \]

   Applying this to 90:

   - For \( 2^1 \): \( 1 + 2 = 3 \)
   - For \( 3^2 \): \( 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 \)
   - For \( 5^1 \): \( 1 + 5 = 6 \)

   Therefore, the sum of the divisors is:  
   \[
   \sigma(90) = 3 \times 13 \times 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the Product:**

   - First, calculate \( 3 \times 13 = 39 \).
   - Then, calculate \( 39 \times 6 \).

   \[
   39 \times 6 = 234
   \]

Therefore, the sum of all positive divisors of 90 is 234.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all positive divisors of 90 is 234.
