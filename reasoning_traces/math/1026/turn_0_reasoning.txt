To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the mining capacity of one dwarf with different tools:**
   - A dwarf can mine **12 pounds of ore per day** with his bare hands.
   - With an **iron pickaxe**, he can mine **twice as much**:
     \[
     \text{Ore mined with iron pickaxe} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ pounds per day}
     \]
   - With a **steel pickaxe**, he can mine **50% more** than with an iron pickaxe:
     \[
     \text{Ore mined with steel pickaxe} = 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds per day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total mining capacity of 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes:**
   - If one dwarf can mine **36 pounds per day** with a steel pickaxe, then 40 dwarves can mine:
     \[
     \text{Total ore mined by 40 dwarves per day} = 40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total mining capacity over a month (30 days):**
   - To find out how much ore can be mined in a month, we multiply the daily mining capacity by the number of days in the month:
     \[
     \text{Total ore mined in 30 days} = 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Therefore, the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days is:
     \[
     \boxed{43200} \text{ pounds}
     \]
