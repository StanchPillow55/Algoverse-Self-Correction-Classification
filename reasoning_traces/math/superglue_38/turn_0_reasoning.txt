==================================================

I'm sorry, but it seems like the question "Sample reasoning question 38" is not specific enough for me to provide a detailed solution. It appears to be a reference to a specific problem from a book or a test, but without the actual content of the question, I can't provide a solution.

If you can provide the full details of the math problem, I'd be happy to help you work through it step by step. Please include all relevant information such as numbers, operations, and any specific instructions or constraints.
