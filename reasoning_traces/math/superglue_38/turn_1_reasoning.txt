==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 38" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is twice its width. The perimeter of the field is 300 meters. What are the dimensions of the field?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field.
   - Let the width of the field be \( w \) meters.
   - The length of the field is twice the width, so it is \( 2w \) meters.
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is given as 300 meters.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute the known values into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     300 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     300 = 2 \times (3w)
     \]
   - This simplifies further to:
     \[
     300 = 6w
     \]

5. **Solve for \( w \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{300}{6} = 50
     \]

6. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length is twice the width, calculate the length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 50 = 100
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that the calculated dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (100 + 50) = 2 \times 150 = 300
     \]
   - The perimeter matches the given condition, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the field are:
- Width: 50 meters
- Length: 100 meters

This approach demonstrates how to solve a typical reasoning problem involving algebra and geometry. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
