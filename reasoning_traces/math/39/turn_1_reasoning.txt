==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate how much candy each person gets. 

First, let's calculate how much candy Anna gets. She gets 14 pieces of candy per house and there are 60 houses in her subdivision. So, we multiply 14 by 60 to find out how much candy she gets in total:

14 pieces/house * 60 houses = 840 pieces of candy

Next, we calculate how much candy Billy gets. He gets 11 pieces of candy per house and there are 75 houses in his subdivision. So, we multiply 11 by 75 to find out how much candy he gets in total:

11 pieces/house * 75 houses = 825 pieces of candy

Finally, to find out how much more candy Anna gets, we subtract the amount of candy Billy gets from the amount of candy Anna gets:

840 pieces - 825 pieces = 15 pieces

So, Anna gets 15 more pieces of candy than Billy.
