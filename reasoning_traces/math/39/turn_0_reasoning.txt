==================================================

To solve the problem, we will first determine Dana's walking, running, and skipping speeds based on the information provided.

1. **Determine Dana's skipping speed:**
   - We know that Dana can skip at a speed of 3 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - It is stated that Dana can skip at a rate that is half as fast as she can run. Therefore, if her skipping speed is 3 mph, her running speed can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ mph} = 6 \text{ mph}
     \]

3. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. Thus, we can find her walking speed using the running speed:
     \[
     \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph}
     \]

Now we have the following speeds:
- Walking speed: 1.5 mph
- Running speed: 6 mph
- Skipping speed: 3 mph

4. **Calculate the time spent on each activity:**
   - Dana spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking over a total of 6 hours.
   - Time spent running:
     \[
     \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time spent walking:
     \[
     \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed Ã— Time
   - Distance running:
     \[
     \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
     \]

6. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Distance walking:
     \[
     \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

7. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}
   \]

Thus, the total distance that Dana can travel in six hours is:

\[
\boxed{18} \text{ miles}
\]
