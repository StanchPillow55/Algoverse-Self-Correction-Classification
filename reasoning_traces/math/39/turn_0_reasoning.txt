To determine how many more pieces of candy Anna gets compared to Billy, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each of them collects based on the number of houses they visit and the amount of candy they receive per house.

**Step 1: Calculate Anna's total candy.**

Anna receives 14 pieces of candy per house and visits 60 houses. We can calculate her total candy using the formula:

\[
\text{Total candy for Anna} = \text{pieces of candy per house} \times \text{number of houses}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total candy for Anna} = 14 \text{ pieces/house} \times 60 \text{ houses}
\]

Now, performing the multiplication:

\[
\text{Total candy for Anna} = 14 \times 60 = 840 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Billy's total candy.**

Billy receives 11 pieces of candy per house and visits 75 houses. We can calculate his total candy using the same formula:

\[
\text{Total candy for Billy} = \text{pieces of candy per house} \times \text{number of houses}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total candy for Billy} = 11 \text{ pieces/house} \times 75 \text{ houses}
\]

Now, performing the multiplication:

\[
\text{Total candy for Billy} = 11 \times 75 = 825 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in total candy.**

Now that we have the total amounts of candy for both Anna and Billy, we can find out how many more pieces of candy Anna has than Billy by subtracting Billy's total from Anna's total:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total candy for Anna} - \text{Total candy for Billy}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Difference} = 840 \text{ pieces} - 825 \text{ pieces}
\]

Now, performing the subtraction:

\[
\text{Difference} = 15 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Anna gets 15 more pieces of candy than Billy.
