==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many girls are on the field trip given the total number of students and the number of boys.

1. **Calculate the total number of students transported by the vans:**
   - Each van carries 28 students.
   - There are 5 vans.
   - Therefore, the total number of students can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total students} = \text{Number of vans} \times \text{Students per van} = 5 \times 28
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   5 \times 28 = 140
   \]

   So, there are 140 students in total.

2. **Identify the number of boys:**
   - According to the problem, there are 60 boys.

3. **Calculate the number of girls:**
   - To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = \text{Total students} - \text{Number of boys} = 140 - 60
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   140 - 60 = 80
   \]

Thus, the number of girls is 80.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The number of girls on the field trip is \( \boxed{80} \).
