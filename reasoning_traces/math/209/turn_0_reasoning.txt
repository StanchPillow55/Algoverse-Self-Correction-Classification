Question ID: 209
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of students and then find out how many of them are girls.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Students

Each van carries 28 students, and there are 5 vans. Therefore, the total number of students can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of vans} \times \text{Number of students per van}
\]

\[
\text{Total number of students} = 5 \times 28 = 140
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Number of Boys

The problem states that there are 60 boys among the students.

### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Girls

To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = \text{Total number of students} - \text{Number of boys}
\]

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 140 - 60 = 80
\]

### Conclusion

The number of girls on the field trip is 80.

**Final Answer: 80 girls**
