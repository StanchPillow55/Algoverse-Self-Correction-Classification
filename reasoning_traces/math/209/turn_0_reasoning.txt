==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the quantities involved**:
   - We have **twenty dozen cups**. Since one dozen equals 12, twenty dozen cups is:
     \[
     20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. **Calculating the cost of half a dozen plates**:
   - We are told that each plate costs $6000. Half a dozen plates means:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ plates}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost of half a dozen plates is:
     \[
     6 \times 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Setting up the equation for the cost of the cups**:
   - According to the problem, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. We can express this relationship mathematically:
     \[
     \text{Cost of cups} = \text{Cost of half a dozen plates} - 1200
     \]
   - Substituting the known value:
     \[
     \text{Cost of cups} = 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculating the cost per cup**:
   - Now, we need to find the cost of each cup. We have the total cost of the cups and the total number of cups:
     \[
     \text{Cost per cup} = \frac{\text{Total cost of cups}}{\text{Total number of cups}} = \frac{34800}{240}
     \]
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     \frac{34800}{240} = 145
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - The total cost of buying each cup is:
     \[
     \boxed{145} \text{ dollars}
     \]
