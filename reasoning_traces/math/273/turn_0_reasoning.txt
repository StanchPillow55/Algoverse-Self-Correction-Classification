==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much shorter the commercial will be after reducing its length by 30%. We will then subtract this reduction from the original length to find the new length of the commercial.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Identify the original length of the commercial:**
   The original length of the commercial is 30 seconds.

2. **Calculate 30% of the original length:**
   To find 30% of the original 30-second commercial, we use the formula for percentage:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of a value} = \left(\frac{\text{Percentage}}{100}\right) \times \text{Original Value}
   \]
   Plugging in the values, we get:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of 30 seconds} = \left(\frac{30}{100}\right) \times 30 = 0.3 \times 30 = 9 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Subtract the reduction from the original length:**
   Now, we subtract the 9 seconds (which is 30% of the original length) from the original 30 seconds to find the new length of the commercial:
   \[
   \text{New Length} = \text{Original Length} - \text{Reduction}
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Length} = 30 \text{ seconds} - 9 \text{ seconds} = 21 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Therefore, after Ursula shortens the commercial by 30%, the new length of the commercial will be 21 seconds.

**Final Answer:**
The commercial will be 21 seconds long after the desired changes.
