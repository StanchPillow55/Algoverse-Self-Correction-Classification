To determine how long Ursula's commercial will be after shortening it by 30%, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original length of the commercial**: The original length is given as 30 seconds.

2. **Calculate 30% of the original length**: To find out how much time needs to be removed from the commercial, we need to calculate 30% of 30 seconds.

   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 30 \text{ seconds} = 0.30 \times 30
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   0.30 \times 30 = 9 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Subtract the time to be removed from the original length**: Now that we know we need to remove 9 seconds from the original 30 seconds, we can calculate the new length of the commercial.

   \[
   \text{New length} = \text{Original length} - \text{Time to be removed}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{New length} = 30 \text{ seconds} - 9 \text{ seconds} = 21 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: After shortening the commercial by 30%, the new length of the commercial will be:

   \[
   \boxed{21 \text{ seconds}}
   \]
