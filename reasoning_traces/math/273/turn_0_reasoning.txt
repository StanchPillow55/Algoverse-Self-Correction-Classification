==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break down the components of the sweater and calculate the number of stitches for each part.

1. **Body of the Sweater**: 
   - The body takes 900 stitches.

2. **Collar**: 
   - The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches of the body.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches}
     \]

3. **Rosette**: 
   - The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches}
     \]

4. **Total Stitches for Body, Collar, and Rosette**:
   - Now we can calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Total stitches for body, collar, and rosette} = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \text{ stitches}
     \]

5. **Total Stitches for the Whole Sweater**:
   - The problem states that the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. 
   - We need to find out how many stitches are left for the two sleeves.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Stitches for sleeves} = 1800 - 1170 = 630 \text{ stitches}
     \]

6. **Stitches per Sleeve**:
   - Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches for the sleeves by 2.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches}
     \]

Finally, we conclude that each sleeve takes **315 stitches**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Each sleeve takes } 315 \text{ stitches.}
\]
