==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the new length of the commercial after it has been shortened by 30%. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the Original Length:**
   - The original length of the commercial is 30 seconds.

2. **Calculate the Reduction Amount:**
   - We need to reduce the length of the commercial by 30%. To find out how many seconds this reduction represents, we calculate 30% of the original length.
   - To find 30% of 30 seconds, we use the formula for percentage:
     \[
     \text{Reduction Amount} = \left(\frac{30}{100}\right) \times 30
     \]
   - Simplifying the calculation:
     \[
     \text{Reduction Amount} = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the New Length:**
   - To find the new length of the commercial, subtract the reduction amount from the original length.
   - Original length = 30 seconds
   - Reduction amount = 9 seconds
   - New length = Original length - Reduction amount
     \[
     \text{New Length} = 30 - 9 = 21 \text{ seconds}
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - After reducing the commercial by 30%, the new length of the commercial will be 21 seconds.

Therefore, the final answer is that the commercial will be 21 seconds long after Ursula makes the desired changes.
