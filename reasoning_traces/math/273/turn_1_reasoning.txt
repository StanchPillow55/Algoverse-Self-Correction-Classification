To solve the problem, we need to determine how many stitches each sleeve takes in Terri's sweater project. Let's break down the information given step by step.

1. **Identify the number of stitches for the body of the sweater**:
   - The body of the sweater takes **900 stitches**.

2. **Calculate the number of stitches for the collar**:
   - The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches of the body.
   - Therefore, the number of stitches for the collar is:
     \[
     \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette**:
   - The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   - Therefore, the number of stitches for the rosette is:
     \[
     \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of stitches used so far**:
   - Now, we can add the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
     \[
     \text{Total stitches so far} = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \text{ stitches}
     \]

5. **Determine the total number of stitches available for the sleeves**:
   - The whole sweater is an **1800-stitch project**. Therefore, the number of stitches remaining for the sleeves is:
     \[
     \text{Sleeves stitches} = 1800 - 1170 = 630 \text{ stitches}
     \]

6. **Calculate the number of stitches for each sleeve**:
   - Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:
     \[
     \text{Sleeve stitches} = \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches}
     \]

Now we have determined the number of stitches for each component of the sweater:
- Body: 900 stitches
- Collar: 90 stitches
- Rosette: 180 stitches
- Each Sleeve: 315 stitches

Finally, we can state the answer:

**Final Answer**: Each sleeve takes **315 stitches**.
