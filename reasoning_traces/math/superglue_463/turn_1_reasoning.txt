==================================================

To solve a problem effectively, it's important to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the question you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 463," does not contain any specific details or numbers to work with. Therefore, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving math problems, which you can apply to a specific problem once you have one.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.
     - Using logical reasoning.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the strategy you have chosen.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.
   - If one approach doesnâ€™t work, try another.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if the answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Recalculate if necessary to ensure accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem:

Let's apply this approach to a simple example problem:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length of 10 units and a width of 5 units. What is the area of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a rectangle.
   - We are given the length (10 units) and the width (5 units).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
     \]

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the given values into the formula:
     \[
     A = 10 \times 5
     \]
   - Calculate the area:
     \[
     A = 50 \text{ square units}
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - The calculation follows the formula for the area of a rectangle.
   - The units are consistent (square units for area).

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the rectangle is 50 square units.

This structured approach can be applied to any math problem once you have the specific details. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can help solve it using this method.
