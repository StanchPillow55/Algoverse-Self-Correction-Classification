==================================================

It seems like the question you've provided is a bit unclear. The phrase "Sample math problem 240" does not specify a particular math problem or operation to solve. However, I can demonstrate how to approach a general math problem step by step. 

Let's assume we are tasked with solving a math problem involving the number 240. For example, we could find the prime factorization of 240. Hereâ€™s how we would do that:

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
We want to find the prime factorization of the number 240. Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of its prime numbers.

### Step 2: Dividing by the Smallest Prime Number
We start by dividing 240 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

\[
240 \div 2 = 120
\]

### Step 3: Continuing to Divide by 2
We continue dividing by 2 since 120 is also even.

\[
120 \div 2 = 60
\]

\[
60 \div 2 = 30
\]

\[
30 \div 2 = 15
\]

At this point, 15 is not divisible by 2 anymore, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

### Step 4: Dividing by 3
Now we divide 15 by 3.

\[
15 \div 3 = 5
\]

### Step 5: Identifying the Last Prime Number
Now we have reached 5, which is a prime number itself. 

### Step 6: Writing the Prime Factorization
Now we can write the prime factorization of 240. We have divided 240 as follows:

\[
240 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5
\]

This can also be expressed using exponents for repeated factors:

\[
240 = 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 5^1
\]

### Final Answer
The prime factorization of 240 is:

\[
\boxed{2^4 \times 3^1 \times 5^1}
\]
