==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 240," we need to understand what the problem is asking. Since "Sample math problem 240" is not a specific question, I'll assume it refers to a generic math problem involving the number 240. Let's create a problem involving 240 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**  
Find the prime factorization of 240 and determine the number of divisors it has.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 240**

To find the prime factorization, we start by dividing 240 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by 2 until we can no longer do so evenly.

1. \( 240 \div 2 = 120 \)
2. \( 120 \div 2 = 60 \)
3. \( 60 \div 2 = 30 \)
4. \( 30 \div 2 = 15 \)

Now, 15 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

5. \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \)

Finally, 5 is a prime number itself.

Thus, the prime factorization of 240 is:
\[ 240 = 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number given its prime factorization, we use the formula:  
If \( n = p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \) is the prime factorization of \( n \), then the number of divisors \( D(n) \) is given by:
\[ D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1) \]

For 240, the prime factorization is \( 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \). Therefore, the number of divisors is:
\[ D(240) = (4 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) \]
\[ D(240) = 5 \times 2 \times 2 \]
\[ D(240) = 20 \]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 240 is \( 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \), and it has 20 divisors.
