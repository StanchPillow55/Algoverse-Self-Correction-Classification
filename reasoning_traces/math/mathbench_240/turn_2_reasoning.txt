==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 240" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume a generic math problem involving the number 240. Let's consider a problem involving the factors of 240, which is a common type of math problem.

**Problem:** Find all the factors of 240 and determine if 240 is a perfect square.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 240**

To find the factors of 240, we first perform its prime factorization.

1. Start by dividing 240 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
   \[
   240 \div 2 = 120
   \]
2. Continue dividing by 2:
   \[
   120 \div 2 = 60
   \]
3. Continue dividing by 2:
   \[
   60 \div 2 = 30
   \]
4. Continue dividing by 2:
   \[
   30 \div 2 = 15
   \]
5. Now, 15 is not divisible by 2. Move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3:
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
6. Finally, 5 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 240 is:
\[
240 = 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 5^1
\]

**Step 2: Finding All Factors of 240**

To find all factors, consider the combinations of the prime factors:
- The exponents of the prime factors are 4, 1, and 1 for 2, 3, and 5, respectively.
- The number of factors is given by multiplying the incremented exponents: \((4+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 5 \times 2 \times 2 = 20\).

Now, list the factors by considering all combinations of the prime factors:
- \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4\)
- \(3^0, 3^1\)
- \(5^0, 5^1\)

The factors are:
1. \(2^0 \times 3^0 \times 5^0 = 1\)
2. \(2^1 \times 3^0 \times 5^0 = 2\)
3. \(2^2 \times 3^0 \times 5^0 = 4\)
4. \(2^3 \times 3^0 \times 5^0 = 8\)
5. \(2^4 \times 3^0 \times 5^0 = 16\)
6. \(2^0 \times 3^1 \times 5^0 = 3\)
7. \(2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^0 = 6\)
8. \(2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^0 = 12\)
9. \(2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^0 = 24\)
10. \(2^4 \times 3^1 \times 5^0 = 48\)
11. \(2^0 \times 3^0 \times 5^1 = 5\)
12. \(2^1 \times 3^0 \times 5^1 = 10\)
13. \(2^2 \times 3^0 \times 5^1 = 20\)
14. \(2^3 \times 3^0 \times 5^1 = 40\)
15. \(2^4 \times 3^0 \times 5^1 = 80\)
16. \(2^0 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 = 15\)
17. \(2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 = 30\)
18. \(2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 = 60\)
19. \(2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 = 120\)
20. \(2^4 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 = 240\)

**Step 3: Determine if 240 is a Perfect Square**

A number is a perfect square if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even. In the prime factorization of 240, \(2^4\) is even, but \(3^1\) and \(5^1\) are odd. Therefore, 240 is not a perfect square.

**Final Answer:**

The factors of 240 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 40, 48, 60, 80, 120, and 240.  
240 is not a perfect square.
