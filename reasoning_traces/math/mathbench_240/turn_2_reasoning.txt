==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 240, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is simply "Sample math problem 240," it lacks specific details. However, let's assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem that involves the number 240. 

Let's consider a few possible interpretations and solve them:

### Interpretation 1: Factorization of 240
One common math problem is to find the prime factorization of a number. Let's find the prime factors of 240.

1. **Divide by 2 (smallest prime number):**
   \[
   240 \div 2 = 120
   \]
   So, 240 = 2 × 120.

2. **Divide 120 by 2:**
   \[
   120 \div 2 = 60
   \]
   So, 120 = 2 × 60, and thus 240 = 2 × 2 × 60.

3. **Divide 60 by 2:**
   \[
   60 \div 2 = 30
   \]
   So, 60 = 2 × 30, and thus 240 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 30.

4. **Divide 30 by 2:**
   \[
   30 \div 2 = 15
   \]
   So, 30 = 2 × 15, and thus 240 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 15.

5. **Divide 15 by 3 (next smallest prime number):**
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
   So, 15 = 3 × 5, and thus 240 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 5.

Therefore, the prime factorization of 240 is:
\[
240 = 2^4 \times 3 \times 5
\]

### Interpretation 2: Divisors of 240
Another common problem is to find all the divisors of a number. Using the prime factorization, we can find the divisors.

The prime factorization of 240 is \(2^4 \times 3 \times 5\). To find the divisors, consider all combinations of these factors:

- \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4\)
- \(3^0, 3^1\)
- \(5^0, 5^1\)

The total number of divisors is given by multiplying the number of choices for each prime factor:
\[
(4+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 5 \times 2 \times 2 = 20
\]

Listing them:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 40, 48, 60, 80, 120, 240.

### Final Answer
Given the lack of specific details in the problem statement, we explored two possible interpretations. The prime factorization of 240 is \(2^4 \times 3 \times 5\), and it has 20 divisors. If the problem intended something else, please provide more context or details.
