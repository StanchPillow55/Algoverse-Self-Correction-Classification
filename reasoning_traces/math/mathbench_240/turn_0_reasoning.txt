==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 240" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem that could be labeled as "240." Let's consider a common type of math problem involving the number 240, such as finding its factors, solving an equation, or working with its properties.

Let's assume the problem is to find all the factors of 240 and determine whether it is a perfect square.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 240

To find the factors of 240, we start with its prime factorization:

1. **Divide by 2** (the smallest prime number):
   \[
   240 \div 2 = 120
   \]
   \[
   120 \div 2 = 60
   \]
   \[
   60 \div 2 = 30
   \]
   \[
   30 \div 2 = 15
   \]

2. **Divide by 3** (the next smallest prime number):
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]

3. **Divide by 5** (the next smallest prime number):
   \[
   5 \div 5 = 1
   \]

Thus, the prime factorization of 240 is:
\[
240 = 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 5^1
\]

### Step 2: Find All Factors

To find all factors, consider the combinations of the prime factors:
- The exponents in the prime factorization are 4, 1, and 1.
- The number of factors is given by \((4+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 5 \times 2 \times 2 = 20\).

The factors of 240 are obtained by taking all combinations of the prime factors:
- \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4\)
- \(3^0, 3^1\)
- \(5^0, 5^1\)

By multiplying these combinations, we get the factors:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 40, 48, 60, 80, 120, 240.

### Step 3: Check if 240 is a Perfect Square

A number is a perfect square if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even. In the prime factorization of 240, \(2^4\) is even, but \(3^1\) and \(5^1\) are odd. Therefore, 240 is not a perfect square.

### Final Answer

The factors of 240 are:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 40, 48, 60, 80, 120, 240.

240 is not a perfect square.
