==================================================

It seems like your question is a bit unclear, as "Sample math problem 240" does not specify a particular math problem to solve. However, I can create a sample math problem involving the number 240 and solve it step by step.

Let's consider the problem: **What are the prime factors of 240?**

### Step 1: Understanding Prime Factorization
Prime factorization is the process of expressing a number as the product of its prime factors. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.

### Step 2: Start Dividing by the Smallest Prime Number
We will start dividing 240 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

1. **Divide by 2:**
   \[
   240 \div 2 = 120
   \]
   So, we have one factor: \( 2 \).

2. **Divide 120 by 2:**
   \[
   120 \div 2 = 60
   \]
   Now we have two factors: \( 2 \times 2 \).

3. **Divide 60 by 2:**
   \[
   60 \div 2 = 30
   \]
   Now we have three factors: \( 2 \times 2 \times 2 \).

4. **Divide 30 by 2:**
   \[
   30 \div 2 = 15
   \]
   Now we have four factors: \( 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \).

### Step 3: Move to the Next Prime Number
Now, we cannot divide 15 by 2 anymore, so we move to the next prime number, which is 3.

1. **Divide 15 by 3:**
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
   Now we have five factors: \( 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \).

### Step 4: Identify the Last Factor
Now we have 5, which is also a prime number. So we can write:

1. **Final factor:**
   \[
   5 \div 5 = 1
   \]
   Now we have six factors: \( 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5 \).

### Step 5: Write the Prime Factorization
Putting it all together, we can express 240 as:
\[
240 = 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 5^1
\]

### Final Answer
The prime factorization of 240 is:
\[
\boxed{2^4 \times 3^1 \times 5^1}
\]
