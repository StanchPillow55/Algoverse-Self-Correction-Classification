==================================================

To find out how much 2 years of the streaming service will cost Bill, we need to break down the costs into three distinct periods based on the pricing structure provided.

1. **First 6 months**: 
   - The cost per month is $8.
   - Total cost for the first 6 months = \( 6 \text{ months} \times 8 \text{ dollars/month} = 48 \text{ dollars} \).

2. **Next 8 months**: 
   - After the first 6 months, the price increases to $12 per month.
   - Total cost for the next 8 months = \( 8 \text{ months} \times 12 \text{ dollars/month} = 96 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Remaining 10 months**: 
   - After the first 14 months (6 months at $8 and 8 months at $12), the price increases to $14 per month.
   - Since 2 years is 24 months, the remaining months after the first 14 months is \( 24 - 14 = 10 \text{ months} \).
   - Total cost for the remaining 10 months = \( 10 \text{ months} \times 14 \text{ dollars/month} = 140 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, we will add up all the costs from the three periods:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for first 6 months} + \text{Cost for next 8 months} + \text{Cost for remaining 10 months}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 48 \text{ dollars} + 96 \text{ dollars} + 140 \text{ dollars}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 48 + 96 + 140 = 284 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost for 2 years of the streaming service is \(\boxed{284}\) dollars.
