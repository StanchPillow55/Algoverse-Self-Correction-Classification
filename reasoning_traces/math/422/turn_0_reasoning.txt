To determine how much time Bryan spends on marketing posts each day, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total hours Bryan works each day**: 
   Bryan works a total of 8 hours each day.

2. **Determine the time spent on customer outreach posts**: 
   According to the problem, Bryan spends 4 hours on customer outreach posts each day.

3. **Determine the time spent on advertisement posts**: 
   The problem states that he spends half the time on advertisement posts compared to customer outreach posts. Since he spends 4 hours on customer outreach posts, the time spent on advertisement posts can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Time on advertisement posts} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Time on customer outreach posts} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total time spent on customer outreach and advertisement posts**: 
   Now we can add the time spent on both types of posts:
   \[
   \text{Total time on outreach and advertisement posts} = \text{Time on customer outreach posts} + \text{Time on advertisement posts} = 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Determine the time spent on marketing posts**: 
   Since Bryan works a total of 8 hours each day, we can find the time he spends on marketing posts by subtracting the total time spent on customer outreach and advertisement posts from his total working hours:
   \[
   \text{Time on marketing posts} = \text{Total working hours} - \text{Total time on outreach and advertisement posts} = 8 \text{ hours} - 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, Bryan spends **2 hours each day** on marketing posts.

Final answer: **2 hours**.
