To solve this problem, we need to determine how Bryan allocates his eight-hour workday among the three types of posts: customer outreach posts, advertisement posts, and marketing posts. We are specifically asked to find out how much time he spends on marketing posts each day.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the time spent on customer outreach posts:**
   - According to the problem, Bryan spends four hours each day on customer outreach posts.

2. **Determine the time spent on advertisement posts:**
   - The problem states that Bryan spends half the time he spends on customer outreach posts on advertisement posts.
   - Since he spends four hours on customer outreach posts, he spends half of that time on advertisement posts:
     \[
     \text{Time on advertisement posts} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent on customer outreach and advertisement posts:**
   - Add the time spent on customer outreach posts and advertisement posts:
     \[
     \text{Total time on outreach and advertisement posts} = 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the time spent on marketing posts:**
   - Bryan works a total of eight hours each day. The remaining time after accounting for customer outreach and advertisement posts is spent on marketing posts.
   - Subtract the total time spent on customer outreach and advertisement posts from the total workday:
     \[
     \text{Time on marketing posts} = 8 \text{ hours} - 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, Bryan spends 2 hours each day on marketing posts.

**Final Answer:**
Bryan spends 2 hours each day on marketing posts.
