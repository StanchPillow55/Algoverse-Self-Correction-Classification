Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 321," let's first assume that "321" refers to a specific math problem. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem using the number 321 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 321, then multiply the result by 3.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 321:**
   - The number 321 consists of three digits: 3, 2, and 1.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(3 + 2 + 1\).
   - Perform the addition: 
     \[
     3 + 2 = 5
     \]
     \[
     5 + 1 = 6
     \]
   - The sum of the digits is 6.

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Take the sum of the digits (6) and multiply it by 3:
     \[
     6 \times 3 = 18
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The final result of the calculation is 18.

Therefore, the solution to the hypothetical problem is 18.
