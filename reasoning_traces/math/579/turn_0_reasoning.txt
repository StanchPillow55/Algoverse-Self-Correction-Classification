==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of cards the boy has.**
   The problem states that the boy has 5 cards.

2. **Determine how many cards the brother has.**
   The problem states that the brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy. To find the number of cards the brother has, we subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has:
   \[
   \text{Number of cards the brother has} = \text{Number of cards the boy has} - 3
   \]
   Substituting the number of cards the boy has:
   \[
   \text{Number of cards the brother has} = 5 - 3 = 2
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cards they have together.**
   To find the total number of cards they have together, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards the brother has:
   \[
   \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of cards the boy has} + \text{Number of cards the brother has}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total number of cards} = 5 + 2 = 7
   \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   Therefore, the total number of cards they have together is:
   \[
   \boxed{7}
   \]
