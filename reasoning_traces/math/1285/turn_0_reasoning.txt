To determine how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of meals Mamou started with**: 
   - Mamou has a total of 1,360 meals.

2. **Calculate the total number of meals distributed over the three days**:
   - On Friday, Mamou distributed 64 meals.
   - On Saturday, she distributed 30 meals.
   - On Sunday, she distributed 48 meals.

3. **Add the meals distributed each day**:
   \[
   \text{Total meals distributed} = \text{Meals on Friday} + \text{Meals on Saturday} + \text{Meals on Sunday}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total meals distributed} = 64 + 30 + 48
   \]

   Now, we will perform the addition step-by-step:
   - First, add Friday and Saturday:
     \[
     64 + 30 = 94
     \]
   - Next, add the result to the meals distributed on Sunday:
     \[
     94 + 48 = 142
     \]

   Therefore, the total number of meals distributed over the three days is **142 meals**.

4. **Calculate the remaining meals**:
   - To find out how many meals Mamou has left, we subtract the total meals distributed from the initial total:
   \[
   \text{Remaining meals} = \text{Total meals} - \text{Total meals distributed}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining meals} = 1360 - 142
   \]

   Now, we will perform the subtraction:
   \[
   1360 - 142 = 1218
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Mamou has **1,218 meals** left to distribute.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1218}
\]
