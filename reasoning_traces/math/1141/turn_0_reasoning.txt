==================================================

To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we can break the problem down into two parts based on the number of eggs he eats each day.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs eaten in the first 30 days.**

Chester eats 3 eggs per day for the first 30 days. 

To find the total number of eggs eaten in this period, we multiply the number of eggs per day by the number of days:

\[
\text{Total eggs in first 30 days} = 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of eggs eaten in the next 30 days.**

Chester then increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day for the next 30 days.

Again, we multiply the number of eggs per day by the number of days:

\[
\text{Total eggs in next 30 days} = 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of eggs eaten over the entire 60 days.**

Now, we add the total number of eggs eaten in both periods:

\[
\text{Total eggs for 60 days} = 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}
\]

**Step 4: Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.**

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens Chester needs:

\[
\text{Total dozens of eggs} = \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Chester will need **20 dozens of eggs** for 60 days.
