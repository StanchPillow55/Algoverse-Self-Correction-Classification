To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 31." However, since the specific content of this question isn't provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by outlining the steps typically involved in reasoning through a mathematical question.

### General Approach to Solving a Math Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.
     - Using logical reasoning.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify each step of the calculation.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to ensure the solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's apply this approach to a hypothetical math problem:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - Given: Perimeter = 36 units, Length = 2 Ã— Width.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \).
   - Substitute the given relationship between length and width into the formula.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Let \( W \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( L = 2W \).
   - Substitute into the perimeter formula: 
     \[
     36 = 2 \times (2W + W)
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( W \):
     \[
     36 = 2 \times 3W
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6W
     \]
     \[
     W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find the length using \( L = 2W \):
     \[
     L = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are consistent with the given perimeter.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.

This structured approach ensures that all aspects of the problem are considered, leading to a correct and verified solution. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can apply this methodology to solve it.
