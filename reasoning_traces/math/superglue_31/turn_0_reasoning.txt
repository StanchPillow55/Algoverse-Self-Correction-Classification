==================================================

To provide a complete solution, I need the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 31." Since I don't have access to external databases or documents, I can't see the content of this question directly. However, I can guide you on how to approach a typical math reasoning problem by outlining a general method. If you provide the specific details of the problem, I can give a more tailored solution.

### General Approach to Solving Math Reasoning Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given information or constraints.

2. **Plan a Solution:**
   - Determine the type of problem (e.g., algebra, geometry, probability).
   - Decide on a strategy to solve the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, writing an equation).

3. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out the necessary calculations or logical reasoning.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.
   - Show all steps clearly.

4. **Review and Check:**
   - Verify each step for accuracy.
   - Check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Ensure all parts of the question have been addressed.

### Example Problem and Solution

**Example Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - Given: Length \( L = 2W \) (where \( W \) is the width).
   - Perimeter \( P = 36 \).

2. **Plan a Solution:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2L + 2W \).

3. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( W \):
     \[
     36 = 4W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6W
     \]
     \[
     W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find \( L \) using \( L = 2W \):
     \[
     L = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Review and Check:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are correct, and the dimensions satisfy the given conditions.

**Final Answer:**
The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.
