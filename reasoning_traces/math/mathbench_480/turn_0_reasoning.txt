To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 480" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem related to the number 480 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Find the prime factorization of 480 and determine the number of divisors it has.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 480**

To find the prime factorization of 480, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by 2 until it is no longer divisible by 2. Then, we proceed with the next smallest prime numbers.

1. \( 480 \div 2 = 240 \)
2. \( 240 \div 2 = 120 \)
3. \( 120 \div 2 = 60 \)
4. \( 60 \div 2 = 30 \)
5. \( 30 \div 2 = 15 \)

15 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

6. \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \)

Finally, 5 is a prime number, so we stop here.

The prime factorization of 480 is:
\[ 480 = 2^5 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number given its prime factorization, we use the formula:

If \( n = p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of divisors \( D(n) \) is given by:
\[ D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1) \]

For 480, the prime factorization is \( 2^5 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \).

Using the formula:
\[ D(480) = (5 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) \]
\[ D(480) = 6 \times 2 \times 2 \]
\[ D(480) = 24 \]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 480 is \( 2^5 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \), and it has 24 divisors.
