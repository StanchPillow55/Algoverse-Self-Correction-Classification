==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample math problem 480." Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 4 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 480 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 4 times the width: \( L = 4W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 480 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - Substitute \( L = 4W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     480 = 2(4W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the terms:
     \[
     480 = 8W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     480 = 10W
     \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 10 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{480}{10} = 48
     \]

6. **Find the Length:**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 4W \) to find the length:
     \[
     L = 4 \times 48 = 192
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(192) + 2(48) = 384 + 96 = 480
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 48 units and a length of 192 units.
