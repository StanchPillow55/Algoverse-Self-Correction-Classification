==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 480, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 480" is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 480."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - The even numbers between 1 and 480 start at 2 and end at 480.

2. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - The sequence of even numbers is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 480.
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms:**
   - The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Set \( a_n = 480 \) to find \( n \):
     \[
     480 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     480 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     480 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{480}{2} = 240
     \]
   - There are 240 even numbers between 1 and 480.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{240} = \frac{240}{2} \cdot (2 + 480)
     \]
     \[
     S_{240} = 120 \cdot 482
     \]

5. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - Calculate \( 120 \times 482 \):
     \[
     120 \times 482 = 120 \times (480 + 2) = 120 \times 480 + 120 \times 2
     \]
     \[
     120 \times 480 = 57600
     \]
     \[
     120 \times 2 = 240
     \]
     \[
     120 \times 482 = 57600 + 240 = 57840
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 480 is \( 57,840 \).
