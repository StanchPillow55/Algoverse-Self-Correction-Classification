==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 480," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 480" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. It seems like there might be a missing context or description of the problem.

To proceed, let's assume a hypothetical math problem related to the number 480. We can explore various mathematical aspects of the number 480, such as its factors, prime factorization, or any other mathematical property.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 480

To find the prime factorization of 480, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by 2 until it is no longer divisible by 2.

1. \( 480 \div 2 = 240 \)
2. \( 240 \div 2 = 120 \)
3. \( 120 \div 2 = 60 \)
4. \( 60 \div 2 = 30 \)
5. \( 30 \div 2 = 15 \)

Now, 15 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

6. \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \)

Finally, 5 is a prime number itself.

Thus, the prime factorization of 480 is:
\[ 480 = 2^5 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \]

### Step 2: Number of Factors

To find the total number of factors of 480, we use its prime factorization. If a number \( n \) has a prime factorization of \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of factors is given by:
\[ (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1) \]

For 480, the prime factorization is \( 2^5 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \). Therefore, the number of factors is:
\[ (5 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 6 \times 2 \times 2 = 24 \]

### Step 3: Sum of Factors

To find the sum of all factors of 480, we use the formula for the sum of divisors based on its prime factorization:
\[ \sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \ldots + p_1^{a_1})(1 + p_2 + \ldots + p_2^{a_2}) \ldots (1 + p_k + \ldots + p_k^{a_k}) \]

For 480, this becomes:
\[ \sigma(480) = (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32)(1 + 3)(1 + 5) \]

Calculating each part:
- \( 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 63 \)
- \( 1 + 3 = 4 \)
- \( 1 + 5 = 6 \)

Thus, the sum of the factors is:
\[ 63 \times 4 \times 6 = 1512 \]

### Final Answer

Based on the hypothetical exploration of the number 480, we have:
- Prime factorization: \( 2^5 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \)
- Number of factors: 24
- Sum of factors: 1512
