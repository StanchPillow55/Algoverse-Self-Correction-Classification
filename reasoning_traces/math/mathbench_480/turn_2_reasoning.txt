==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 480" refers to. Since no specific details about the problem are provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 480 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**  
Find the prime factorization of 480 and use it to determine the number of divisors of 480.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 480**

To find the prime factorization, we start by dividing 480 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by 2 until we can no longer do so evenly.

1. \( 480 \div 2 = 240 \)
2. \( 240 \div 2 = 120 \)
3. \( 120 \div 2 = 60 \)
4. \( 60 \div 2 = 30 \)
5. \( 30 \div 2 = 15 \)

Now, 15 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

6. \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \)

Finally, 5 is a prime number itself.

Thus, the prime factorization of 480 is:
\[ 480 = 2^5 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number given its prime factorization, we use the formula:
\[ (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)(e_3 + 1) \ldots (e_n + 1) \]
where \( e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n \) are the exponents in the prime factorization.

For 480, the prime factorization is \( 2^5 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \). Therefore, the exponents are 5, 1, and 1.

Applying the formula:
\[ (5 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 6 \times 2 \times 2 = 24 \]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 480 is \( 2^5 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \), and the number of divisors of 480 is 24.
