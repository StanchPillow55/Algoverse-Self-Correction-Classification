==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 486" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume that "486" is the number we need to work with in some mathematical context. Let's explore a few possible mathematical problems involving the number 486 and solve them step by step.

### Problem 1: Prime Factorization of 486

**Step 1: Check divisibility by 2.**

The number 486 is even, so it is divisible by 2.

\[ 486 \div 2 = 243 \]

**Step 2: Check divisibility of 243 by 3.**

The sum of the digits of 243 is \(2 + 4 + 3 = 9\), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 243 is divisible by 3.

\[ 243 \div 3 = 81 \]

**Step 3: Check divisibility of 81 by 3.**

The sum of the digits of 81 is \(8 + 1 = 9\), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 81 is divisible by 3.

\[ 81 \div 3 = 27 \]

**Step 4: Check divisibility of 27 by 3.**

The sum of the digits of 27 is \(2 + 7 = 9\), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 27 is divisible by 3.

\[ 27 \div 3 = 9 \]

**Step 5: Check divisibility of 9 by 3.**

The sum of the digits of 9 is \(9\), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 9 is divisible by 3.

\[ 9 \div 3 = 3 \]

**Step 6: Check divisibility of 3 by 3.**

3 is a prime number and is divisible by itself.

\[ 3 \div 3 = 1 \]

**Conclusion:**

The prime factorization of 486 is:

\[ 486 = 2 \times 3^5 \]

### Problem 2: Calculate the Square Root of 486

**Step 1: Estimate the square root.**

Since \(22^2 = 484\) and \(23^2 = 529\), the square root of 486 is between 22 and 23.

**Step 2: Use the average method to refine the estimate.**

Let's take the average of 22 and 23:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{22 + 23}{2} = 22.5 \]

**Step 3: Calculate \(22.5^2\).**

\[ 22.5^2 = (22 + 0.5)^2 = 22^2 + 2 \times 22 \times 0.5 + 0.5^2 \]

\[ = 484 + 22 + 0.25 = 506.25 \]

Since 506.25 is greater than 486, the square root is less than 22.5.

**Step 4: Try a smaller number, 22.1.**

\[ 22.1^2 = (22 + 0.1)^2 = 22^2 + 2 \times 22 \times 0.1 + 0.1^2 \]

\[ = 484 + 4.4 + 0.01 = 488.41 \]

Since 488.41 is greater than 486, try a smaller number.

**Step 5: Try 22.05.**

\[ 22.05^2 = (22 + 0.05)^2 = 22^2 + 2 \times 22 \times 0.05 + 0.05^2 \]

\[ = 484 + 2.2 + 0.0025 = 486.2025 \]

Since 486.2025 is very close to 486, the square root of 486 is approximately 22.05.

### Final Answer

1. The prime factorization of 486 is \(2 \times 3^5\).
2. The approximate square root of 486 is 22.05.
