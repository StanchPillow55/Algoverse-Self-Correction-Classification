==================================================

The problem you've provided is "Sample math problem 486," which doesn't specify the details of the math problem to be solved. To proceed, I'll assume you want me to solve the number 486 in some mathematical context. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### 1. **Prime Factorization of 486**

To find the prime factorization of 486, we need to divide it by the smallest prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. **Divide by 2** (the smallest prime number):
   \[
   486 \div 2 = 243
   \]
   So, 486 = \(2 \times 243\).

2. **Divide 243 by 3** (the next smallest prime number):
   \[
   243 \div 3 = 81
   \]
   So, 243 = \(3 \times 81\).

3. **Divide 81 by 3**:
   \[
   81 \div 3 = 27
   \]
   So, 81 = \(3 \times 27\).

4. **Divide 27 by 3**:
   \[
   27 \div 3 = 9
   \]
   So, 27 = \(3 \times 9\).

5. **Divide 9 by 3**:
   \[
   9 \div 3 = 3
   \]
   So, 9 = \(3 \times 3\).

6. Finally, divide 3 by 3:
   \[
   3 \div 3 = 1
   \]

Putting it all together, the prime factorization of 486 is:
\[
486 = 2 \times 3^5
\]

### 2. **Finding the Square Root of 486**

To find the square root of 486, we can use a calculator or estimate it manually. Let's estimate:

1. **Estimate between perfect squares**:
   - \(22^2 = 484\)
   - \(23^2 = 529\)

Since \(486\) is closer to \(484\), we know \(\sqrt{486}\) is slightly more than 22.

2. **Refine the estimate**:
   - Try \(22.1^2\):
     \[
     22.1 \times 22.1 = 488.41
     \]
   - Try \(22.05^2\):
     \[
     22.05 \times 22.05 = 486.2025
     \]

The square root of 486 is approximately 22.05.

### 3. **Checking if 486 is a Perfect Number**

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, excluding itself. Let's find the divisors of 486 and check:

1. **List the divisors**:
   - 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54, 81, 162, 243

2. **Sum the divisors (excluding 486)**:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 18 + 27 + 54 + 81 + 162 + 243 = 606
   \]

Since 606 is not equal to 486, 486 is not a perfect number.

### Final Answer

Since the problem was not specified, I explored different mathematical aspects of the number 486. Here are the key results:

- **Prime Factorization**: \(486 = 2 \times 3^5\)
- **Approximate Square Root**: \(\sqrt{486} \approx 22.05\)
- **Perfect Number Check**: 486 is not a perfect number.
