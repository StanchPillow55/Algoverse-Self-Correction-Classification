==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 486" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't specified, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 486. Let's create a problem involving 486 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of 486 and determine the sum of its prime factors.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 486**

To find the prime factorization of 486, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. Check divisibility by 2:
   - 486 is even, so it is divisible by 2.
   - \( 486 \div 2 = 243 \)

2. Check divisibility of 243 by 2:
   - 243 is not even, so it is not divisible by 2.

3. Check divisibility by 3:
   - Sum of digits of 243 is \( 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 \), which is divisible by 3.
   - \( 243 \div 3 = 81 \)

4. Check divisibility of 81 by 3:
   - Sum of digits of 81 is \( 8 + 1 = 9 \), which is divisible by 3.
   - \( 81 \div 3 = 27 \)

5. Check divisibility of 27 by 3:
   - Sum of digits of 27 is \( 2 + 7 = 9 \), which is divisible by 3.
   - \( 27 \div 3 = 9 \)

6. Check divisibility of 9 by 3:
   - Sum of digits of 9 is \( 9 \), which is divisible by 3.
   - \( 9 \div 3 = 3 \)

7. Finally, divide 3 by 3:
   - \( 3 \div 3 = 1 \)

The prime factorization of 486 is \( 2 \times 3^5 \).

**Step 2: Sum of Prime Factors**

The prime factors of 486 are 2 and 3. We need to find the sum of these distinct prime factors.

- Sum of prime factors: \( 2 + 3 = 5 \)

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 486 is \( 2 \times 3^5 \), and the sum of its prime factors is 5.
