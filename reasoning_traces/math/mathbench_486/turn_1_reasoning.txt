==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample math problem 486" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves the number 486 and explore a few mathematical concepts related to it. Let's consider some possibilities:

### 1. Prime Factorization
First, let's find the prime factorization of 486.

1. **Divide by 2**: 486 is even, so divide by 2.
   \[
   486 \div 2 = 243
   \]

2. **Divide by 3**: 243 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 2 + 4 + 3 = 9, is divisible by 3).
   \[
   243 \div 3 = 81
   \]

3. **Divide by 3 again**: 81 is also divisible by 3.
   \[
   81 \div 3 = 27
   \]

4. **Divide by 3 again**: 27 is divisible by 3.
   \[
   27 \div 3 = 9
   \]

5. **Divide by 3 again**: 9 is divisible by 3.
   \[
   9 \div 3 = 3
   \]

6. **Divide by 3 again**: Finally, 3 is divisible by 3.
   \[
   3 \div 3 = 1
   \]

So, the prime factorization of 486 is:
\[
486 = 2 \times 3^5
\]

### 2. Divisors of 486
Using the prime factorization, we can determine the number of divisors. If a number \( n \) has the prime factorization \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), the number of divisors is given by:
\[
(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1)
\]

For 486, with the prime factorization \( 2^1 \times 3^5 \):
\[
(1 + 1)(5 + 1) = 2 \times 6 = 12
\]

So, 486 has 12 divisors.

### 3. Sum of Digits
Let's calculate the sum of the digits of 486.

- The digits are 4, 8, and 6.
- Sum = 4 + 8 + 6 = 18

### 4. Check if 486 is a Perfect Square
A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. To check if 486 is a perfect square, we can take its square root and see if the result is an integer.

\[
\sqrt{486} \approx 22.045
\]

Since 22.045 is not an integer, 486 is not a perfect square.

### Final Answer
Given the exploration above, here are some key points about the number 486:

- **Prime Factorization**: \( 486 = 2 \times 3^5 \)
- **Number of Divisors**: 12
- **Sum of Digits**: 18
- **Not a Perfect Square**
