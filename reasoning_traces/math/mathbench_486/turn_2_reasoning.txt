==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 486" refers to. Since no specific details or context are provided about this problem, I'll assume it involves basic arithmetic operations with the number 486. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations

1. **Addition**: Let's add the digits of 486.
   \[
   4 + 8 + 6 = 18
   \]

2. **Subtraction**: Let's subtract the digits of 486 in sequence.
   \[
   4 - 8 - 6 = -10
   \]

3. **Multiplication**: Let's multiply the digits of 486.
   \[
   4 \times 8 \times 6 = 192
   \]

4. **Division**: Let's divide the number by one of its digits.
   \[
   486 \div 6 = 81
   \]

### Possibility 2: Factorization

Let's factor the number 486.

1. **Check divisibility by 2**: 486 is even, so it is divisible by 2.
   \[
   486 \div 2 = 243
   \]

2. **Check divisibility by 3**: The sum of the digits of 243 is \(2 + 4 + 3 = 9\), which is divisible by 3.
   \[
   243 \div 3 = 81
   \]

3. **Check divisibility by 3 again**: The sum of the digits of 81 is \(8 + 1 = 9\), which is divisible by 3.
   \[
   81 \div 3 = 27
   \]

4. **Check divisibility by 3 again**: The sum of the digits of 27 is \(2 + 7 = 9\), which is divisible by 3.
   \[
   27 \div 3 = 9
   \]

5. **Check divisibility by 3 again**: The sum of the digits of 9 is \(9\), which is divisible by 3.
   \[
   9 \div 3 = 3
   \]

6. **Final division**: 3 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 486 is:
\[
486 = 2 \times 3^5
\]

### Conclusion

Without specific instructions or context, we explored several mathematical operations involving the number 486. The prime factorization of 486 is \(2 \times 3^5\), which is a fundamental property of the number.

Final Answer: The prime factorization of 486 is \(2 \times 3^5\).
