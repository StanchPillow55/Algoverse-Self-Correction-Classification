Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 486" refers to. Since no specific details about the problem are provided, I'll assume it's a generic math problem labeled as "486." Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 486 and solve it.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Find the prime factorization of the number 486.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify if 486 is even or odd:**
   - Since 486 ends in 6, it is an even number. Therefore, it is divisible by 2.

2. **Divide 486 by 2:**
   \[
   486 \div 2 = 243
   \]
   So, 486 = 2 × 243.

3. **Check if 243 is divisible by 3:**
   - To check divisibility by 3, sum the digits of 243: \(2 + 4 + 3 = 9\).
   - Since 9 is divisible by 3, 243 is also divisible by 3.

4. **Divide 243 by 3:**
   \[
   243 \div 3 = 81
   \]
   So, 243 = 3 × 81.

5. **Check if 81 is divisible by 3:**
   - Sum the digits of 81: \(8 + 1 = 9\).
   - Since 9 is divisible by 3, 81 is also divisible by 3.

6. **Divide 81 by 3:**
   \[
   81 \div 3 = 27
   \]
   So, 81 = 3 × 27.

7. **Check if 27 is divisible by 3:**
   - Sum the digits of 27: \(2 + 7 = 9\).
   - Since 9 is divisible by 3, 27 is also divisible by 3.

8. **Divide 27 by 3:**
   \[
   27 \div 3 = 9
   \]
   So, 27 = 3 × 9.

9. **Check if 9 is divisible by 3:**
   - Sum the digits of 9: \(9\).
   - Since 9 is divisible by 3, 9 is also divisible by 3.

10. **Divide 9 by 3:**
    \[
    9 \div 3 = 3
    \]
    So, 9 = 3 × 3.

11. **Finally, 3 is a prime number.**

Now, we can write the complete prime factorization of 486:

\[
486 = 2 \times 3^5
\]

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 486 is \(2 \times 3^5\).
