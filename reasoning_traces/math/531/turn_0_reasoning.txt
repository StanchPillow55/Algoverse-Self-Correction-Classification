==================================================

Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of passengers**: 
   We start with 48 passengers on the bus.

2. **First stop**:
   - **Passengers getting off**: 8 passengers get off the bus.
   - **Calculating remaining passengers**: 
     \[
     48 - 8 = 40 \text{ passengers left on the bus}
     \]
   - **Passengers getting on**: According to the problem, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get on the bus. 
     \[
     5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ passengers get on the bus}
     \]
   - **Calculating total passengers after the first stop**:
     \[
     40 + 40 = 80 \text{ passengers on the bus after the first stop}
     \]

3. **Second stop**:
   - **Passengers getting off**: 21 passengers get off the bus.
   - **Calculating remaining passengers**:
     \[
     80 - 21 = 59 \text{ passengers left on the bus}
     \]
   - **Passengers getting on**: The problem states that 3 times fewer passengers get on than those who got off (21). This means we need to calculate:
     \[
     \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ passengers get on the bus}
     \]
   - **Calculating total passengers after the second stop**:
     \[
     59 + 7 = 66 \text{ passengers on the bus after the second stop}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   The total number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is:
   \[
   \boxed{66}
   \]
