Question ID: mathbench_245
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 245," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 245" is not specific and does not provide any details or context. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem.

To proceed, let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is \( 2x + 5 = 13 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 5 = 13
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 245," please provide the details so I can solve it accurately.
