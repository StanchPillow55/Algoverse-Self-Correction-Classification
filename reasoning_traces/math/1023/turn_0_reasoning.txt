To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to first calculate the total number of sandwiches each family member eats in one day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

1. **Calculate the daily consumption of sandwiches for each family member:**
   - The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
   - The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
   - The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

2. **Add the daily consumption of all family members:**
   \[
   \text{Total sandwiches per day} = \text{sandwiches by man} + \text{sandwiches by wife} + \text{sandwiches by son}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total sandwiches per day} = 5 + 4 + 2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total sandwiches per day} = 11
   \]

3. **Calculate the total sandwiches consumed in one week:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the total daily consumption by 7:
   \[
   \text{Total sandwiches in one week} = \text{Total sandwiches per day} \times 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total sandwiches in one week} = 11 \times 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total sandwiches in one week} = 77
   \]

Thus, the family eats a total of **77 sandwiches in one week**.

Final answer: **77 sandwiches**.
