To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total revenue earned by the mechanic on both Thursday and Friday, and then determine the difference in revenue between the two days.

**Step 1: Calculate Thursday's Revenue**

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs:
- 6 truck tires
- 4 car tires

The charges are:
- $60 per truck tire
- $40 per car tire

Now, we calculate the revenue from truck tires:
\[
\text{Revenue from truck tires} = \text{Number of truck tires} \times \text{Charge per truck tire}
\]
\[
\text{Revenue from truck tires} = 6 \times 60 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from car tires:
\[
\text{Revenue from car tires} = \text{Number of car tires} \times \text{Charge per car tire}
\]
\[
\text{Revenue from car tires} = 4 \times 40 = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we find the total revenue for Thursday:
\[
\text{Total revenue on Thursday} = \text{Revenue from truck tires} + \text{Revenue from car tires}
\]
\[
\text{Total revenue on Thursday} = 360 + 160 = 520 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Friday's Revenue**

On Friday, the mechanic repairs:
- 0 truck tires
- 12 car tires

The charges remain the same:
- $60 per truck tire
- $40 per car tire

Since no truck tires are repaired, the revenue from truck tires is:
\[
\text{Revenue from truck tires on Friday} = 0 \times 60 = 0 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the revenue from car tires:
\[
\text{Revenue from car tires on Friday} = 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we find the total revenue for Friday:
\[
\text{Total revenue on Friday} = \text{Revenue from truck tires} + \text{Revenue from car tires}
\]
\[
\text{Total revenue on Friday} = 0 + 480 = 480 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the Day with Higher Revenue**

We compare the total revenues:
- Total revenue on Thursday: $520
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

Thursday has the higher revenue.

**Step 4: Calculate the Difference in Revenue**

Now, we calculate how much more revenue was earned on Thursday compared to Friday:
\[
\text{Difference in revenue} = \text{Total revenue on Thursday} - \text{Total revenue on Friday}
\]
\[
\text{Difference in revenue} = 520 - 480 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**
The mechanic earned **$40** more on Thursday than on Friday.
