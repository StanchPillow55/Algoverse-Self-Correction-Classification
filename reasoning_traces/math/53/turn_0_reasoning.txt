To solve this problem, we first need to calculate how much Caleb spent on ice cream and how much he spent on frozen yoghurt.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the ice cream. Since each carton of ice cream costs $4 and Caleb bought 10 cartons, we multiply the cost per carton by the number of cartons:

4 (dollars per carton) * 10 (cartons) = $40

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the frozen yoghurt. Since each carton of frozen yoghurt costs $1 and Caleb bought 4 cartons, we multiply the cost per carton by the number of cartons:

1 (dollar per carton) * 4 (cartons) = $4

Now, to find out how much more Caleb spent on ice cream than on frozen yoghurt, we subtract the total cost of the frozen yoghurt from the total cost of the ice cream:

40 (dollars spent on ice cream) - 4 (dollars spent on frozen yoghurt) = $36

So, Caleb spent $36 more on ice cream than on frozen yoghurt.
