==================================================

To determine how much more Caleb spent on ice cream than on frozen yoghurt, we will first calculate the total cost for each type of product and then find the difference between the two amounts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of ice cream.**

Caleb bought 10 cartons of ice cream, and each carton costs $4. We can calculate the total cost of the ice cream using the formula:

\[
\text{Total cost of ice cream} = \text{Number of cartons} \times \text{Cost per carton}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total cost of ice cream} = 10 \times 4 = 40
\]

So, Caleb spent $40 on ice cream.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of frozen yoghurt.**

Caleb bought 4 cartons of frozen yoghurt, and each carton costs $1. We can calculate the total cost of the frozen yoghurt using the same formula:

\[
\text{Total cost of frozen yoghurt} = \text{Number of cartons} \times \text{Cost per carton}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total cost of frozen yoghurt} = 4 \times 1 = 4
\]

So, Caleb spent $4 on frozen yoghurt.

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in spending.**

Now, we need to find out how much more Caleb spent on ice cream than on frozen yoghurt. We can do this by subtracting the total cost of frozen yoghurt from the total cost of ice cream:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total cost of ice cream} - \text{Total cost of frozen yoghurt}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Difference} = 40 - 4 = 36
\]

**Final Answer:**

Caleb spent $36 more on ice cream than on frozen yoghurt.
