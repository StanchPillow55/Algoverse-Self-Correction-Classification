Question ID: 150
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many meals Angela delivers. Let's break down the information given and set up an equation to find the solution.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( m \) represent the number of meals Angela delivers.
   - Let \( p \) represent the number of packages Angela delivers.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - According to the problem, Angela delivers 8 times as many packages as meals. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     p = 8m
     \]
   - The total number of meals and packages combined is 27. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     m + p = 27
     \]

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute the expression for \( p \) from the first equation into the second equation:
     \[
     m + 8m = 27
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     9m = 27
     \]
   - Solve for \( m \) by dividing both sides by 9:
     \[
     m = \frac{27}{9} = 3
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Angela delivers 3 meals.

Therefore, the final answer is that Angela delivers 3 meals.
