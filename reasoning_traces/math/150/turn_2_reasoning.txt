Question ID: 150
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to define two variables based on the information given:

Let:
- \( m \) = number of meals delivered
- \( p \) = number of packages delivered

According to the problem, Angela delivers 8 times as many packages as meals. This can be expressed mathematically as:
\[
p = 8m
\]

We also know that the total number of meals and packages combined is 27. This can be expressed as:
\[
m + p = 27
\]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( p \) from the first equation into the second equation. This gives us:
\[
m + 8m = 27
\]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[
9m = 27
\]

Next, we solve for \( m \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 9:
\[
m = \frac{27}{9} = 3
\]

Now that we have found the number of meals delivered, we can also find the number of packages delivered using the first equation:
\[
p = 8m = 8 \times 3 = 24
\]

Finally, we can summarize our findings:
- Number of meals delivered: \( m = 3 \)
- Number of packages delivered: \( p = 24 \)

Thus, the final answer to the question of how many meals Angela delivers is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]
