==================================================

To determine who wins the race and how long the winner will be waiting for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

### Step 1: Convert distances from miles to feet

1 mile = 5280 feet.

**For Steve:**
- Distance = 3 miles
- Distance in feet = 3 miles × 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

**For Tim:**
- Distance = 2 miles
- Distance in feet = 2 miles × 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken for each person to get home

**For Steve:**
- Speed = 440 feet per minute
- Time = Distance / Speed
- Time for Steve = 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute

Calculating Steve's time:
\[
\text{Time for Steve} = \frac{15840}{440} = 36 \text{ minutes}
\]

**For Tim:**
- Speed = 264 feet per minute
- Time = Distance / Speed
- Time for Tim = 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute

Calculating Tim's time:
\[
\text{Time for Tim} = \frac{10560}{264} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the winner and the waiting time

Now we compare the times:
- Steve's time = 36 minutes
- Tim's time = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes less time, he is the winner.

### Step 4: Calculate how long the winner waits

To find out how long Steve will be waiting for Tim:
\[
\text{Waiting time} = \text{Time for Tim} - \text{Time for Steve}
\]
\[
\text{Waiting time} = 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

Steve will be waiting for Tim for **4 minutes** before Tim finishes the race.
