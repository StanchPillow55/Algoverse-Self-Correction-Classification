==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to establish a relationship between the number of meals Angela delivers and the number of packages she delivers.

Let's define:
- \( m \) = number of meals delivered
- \( p \) = number of packages delivered

According to the problem, Angela delivers 8 times as many packages as meals. This can be expressed mathematically as:
\[
p = 8m
\]

We also know that the total number of meals and packages combined is 27. This can be expressed as:
\[
m + p = 27
\]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( p \) from the first equation into the second equation. This gives us:
\[
m + 8m = 27
\]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[
9m = 27
\]

Next, we solve for \( m \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 9:
\[
m = \frac{27}{9} = 3
\]

Now that we have found the number of meals Angela delivers, we can also find the number of packages delivered by substituting \( m \) back into the equation for \( p \):
\[
p = 8m = 8 \times 3 = 24
\]

Finally, we can verify our solution by checking the total:
\[
m + p = 3 + 24 = 27
\]
This confirms that our calculations are correct.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Angela delivers } 3 \text{ meals.}
\]
