Question ID: 150
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's define the variables for the problem:

- Let \( m \) represent the number of meals Angela delivers.
- Let \( p \) represent the number of packages Angela delivers.

According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Angela delivers 8 times as many packages as meals:
   \[
   p = 8m
   \]

2. The total number of meals and packages combined is 27:
   \[
   m + p = 27
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( p \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[
m + 8m = 27
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
9m = 27
\]

Next, we solve for \( m \):

\[
m = \frac{27}{9} = 3
\]

Now that we have the number of meals, we can find the number of packages by substituting \( m \) back into the equation for \( p \):

\[
p = 8m = 8 \times 3 = 24
\]

Finally, we can summarize the results:

- Meals delivered: \( m = 3 \)
- Packages delivered: \( p = 24 \)

Thus, the number of meals Angela delivers is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
