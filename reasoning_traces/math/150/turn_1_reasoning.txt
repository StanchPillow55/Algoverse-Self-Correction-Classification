==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many meals Angela delivers, given the relationship between the number of packages and meals and the total number of deliveries.

Let's define:
- \( m \) as the number of meals Angela delivers.
- \( p \) as the number of packages Angela delivers.

According to the problem:
1. Angela delivers 8 times as many packages as meals. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   p = 8m
   \]

2. The total number of meals and packages delivered is 27. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   m + p = 27
   \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
p &= 8m \\
m + p &= 27
\end{align*}
\]

We can substitute the expression for \( p \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
m + 8m = 27
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
9m = 27
\]

To find \( m \), divide both sides by 9:
\[
m = \frac{27}{9} = 3
\]

Thus, Angela delivers 3 meals.

To verify, calculate the number of packages:
\[
p = 8m = 8 \times 3 = 24
\]

Check the total:
\[
m + p = 3 + 24 = 27
\]

The calculations are consistent with the problem statement. Therefore, the final answer is that Angela delivers \(\boxed{3}\) meals.
