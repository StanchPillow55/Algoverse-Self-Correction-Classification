Question ID: superglue_319
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what is being asked. The problem statement is "Sample reasoning question 319," which is not a typical math problem. It seems to be a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here.

However, to demonstrate a structured approach to solving a math problem, let's assume a hypothetical math problem and work through it step by step. Suppose the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides**: This will help eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2**: This will isolate \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 3: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Step 4: State the Final Answer**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This structured approach can be applied to various types of math problems to ensure clarity and accuracy in finding the solution.
