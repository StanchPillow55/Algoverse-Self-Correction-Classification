==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 319." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem step by step. Let's assume a sample problem:

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**  
We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**  
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

**Step 3: Subtract 3 from Both Sides**  
\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]  
\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 4: Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \)**  
The coefficient of \( x \) is 2. To isolate \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 2.

\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]  
\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**  
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]  
\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]  
\[ 11 = 11 \]

The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**  
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
