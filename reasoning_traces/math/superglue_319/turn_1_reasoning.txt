==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to follow a structured approach. However, the problem statement you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 319," lacks specific details or numerical data to work with. Therefore, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a hypothetical example and working through it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A store sells apples and oranges. An apple costs $0.50, and an orange costs $0.70. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends $6.20, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we have two conditions:
     1. The total number of fruits is 10: 
        \[
        x + y = 10
        \]
     2. The total cost is $6.20:
        \[
        0.50x + 0.70y = 6.20
        \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   - First, solve the first equation for one of the variables. Let's solve for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 10 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 10 - x \) into the second equation:
     \[
     0.50x + 0.70(10 - x) = 6.20
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     0.50x + 7 - 0.70x = 6.20
     \]
     \[
     -0.20x + 7 = 6.20
     \]
     \[
     -0.20x = 6.20 - 7
     \]
     \[
     -0.20x = -0.80
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-0.80}{-0.20}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 10 - 4
     \]
     \[
     y = 6
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of fruits:
     \[
     x + y = 4 + 6 = 10
     \]
   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     0.50(4) + 0.70(6) = 2.00 + 4.20 = 6.20
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming that the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 4 apples and 6 oranges.
