==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 319" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I will assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. Let's consider a hypothetical math problem and work through it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such plots can the farmer create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters.
   - The area of the entire field is calculated by multiplying the length and the width:
     \[
     \text{Area of the field} = 100 \, \text{m} \times 60 \, \text{m} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]
   - Each smaller plot should have an area of 150 square meters.

2. **Determine the Number of Plots:**
   - To find out how many 150-square-meter plots can fit into the 6000-square-meter field, we divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
     \[
     \text{Number of plots} = \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{150 \, \text{square meters per plot}}
     \]
   - Perform the division:
     \[
     \frac{6000}{150} = 40
     \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 40 smaller plots, each with an area of 150 square meters, from the 6000-square-meter field.

**Final Answer:**

The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 150 square meters.
