To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 260." Since the problem statement is missing, I'll provide a general approach to solving math problems step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to assist you with that.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine the information given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Recalculate if necessary to ensure accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's solve a sample problem using the above steps:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
- Given: Perimeter = 36 units, Length = 2 Ã— Width.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \).
- Substitute the given relationship between length and width into the formula.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Let \( W \) be the width of the rectangle.
- Then the length \( L = 2W \).
- Substitute into the perimeter formula: 
  \[
  36 = 2 \times (2W + W)
  \]
  \[
  36 = 2 \times 3W
  \]
  \[
  36 = 6W
  \]
  \[
  W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
  \]
- Now, find the length:
  \[
  L = 2W = 2 \times 6 = 12
  \]

**Step 4: Review/Check Your Work**
- Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
  \[
  P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
  \]
- The calculations are correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.
