==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 260." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a general math problem by creating an example problem and solving it step by step.

### Example Problem:
A company produces two types of widgets: A and B. Each widget A requires 2 hours of labor and 3 units of material, while each widget B requires 1 hour of labor and 4 units of material. The company has a maximum of 100 labor hours and 120 units of material available per week. If the profit from each widget A is $5 and from each widget B is $7, how many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of widget A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of widget B produced.

2. **Set Up the Constraints:**
   - Labor constraint: \( 2x + y \leq 100 \)
   - Material constraint: \( 3x + 4y \leq 120 \)
   - Non-negativity constraint: \( x \geq 0 \), \( y \geq 0 \)

3. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function to maximize is \( P = 5x + 7y \).

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Convert each inequality to an equation to find the boundary lines:
     - \( 2x + y = 100 \)
     - \( 3x + 4y = 120 \)

5. **Find the Intersections:**
   - Solve the system of equations to find intersection points:
     - From \( 2x + y = 100 \), express \( y \) as \( y = 100 - 2x \).
     - Substitute into \( 3x + 4(100 - 2x) = 120 \):
       \[
       3x + 400 - 8x = 120 \\
       -5x = -280 \\
       x = 56
       \]
     - Substitute \( x = 56 \) back into \( y = 100 - 2x \):
       \[
       y = 100 - 2(56) = 100 - 112 = -12
       \]
     - Since \( y \) cannot be negative, this point is not feasible.

6. **Evaluate the Vertices of the Feasible Region:**
   - Find the feasible region by evaluating the constraints:
     - Intersection of \( 2x + y = 100 \) and \( x = 0 \): \( y = 100 \)
     - Intersection of \( 3x + 4y = 120 \) and \( y = 0 \): \( x = 40 \)
     - Intersection of \( 2x + y = 100 \) and \( 3x + 4y = 120 \) (already calculated as infeasible).

7. **Calculate Profit at Each Vertex:**
   - \( (0, 0) \): \( P = 5(0) + 7(0) = 0 \)
   - \( (0, 100) \): \( P = 5(0) + 7(100) = 700 \)
   - \( (40, 0) \): \( P = 5(40) + 7(0) = 200 \)

8. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is $700 at the point \( (0, 100) \).

### Final Answer:
The company should produce 0 widgets of type A and 100 widgets of type B to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $700.
