==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify the task at hand. The problem statement is somewhat ambiguous as it refers to "Sample reasoning question 260" without providing specific details or context. However, I will demonstrate a systematic approach to solving a generic math problem by outlining the steps typically involved in problem-solving. 

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine the knowns and unknowns.
   - Look for keywords or phrases that indicate mathematical operations or relationships.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work to avoid errors.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the process.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify each step and calculation.
   - Ensure the solution answers the question posed.
   - Consider whether the answer is reasonable and check for any overlooked details.

### Example Problem:

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 260" involves solving a simple algebraic equation. Here's how we might approach it:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- To isolate \( x \), we will perform inverse operations to both sides of the equation.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
1. Start with the equation: 
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 4: Review/Check the Solution**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
  The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
- The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This structured approach ensures a thorough understanding and accurate solution to mathematical problems. If "Sample reasoning question 260" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details for a more specific solution.
