==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 260" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear and does not provide specific details or numbers, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 260" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - We are given the base \( b = 10 \) units and the height \( h = 5 \) units.

2. **Recall the Formula:**
   - The formula for the area \( A \) of a triangle is:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Substitute the given values of the base and height into the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a typical math problem involving the calculation of the area of a triangle. If "Sample reasoning question 260" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details or context so I can assist you more accurately.
