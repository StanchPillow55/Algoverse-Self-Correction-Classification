==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the combined balance of both of Gina's bank accounts based on the information given about Betty's account.

1. **Identify Betty's Account Balance**: 
   - We know that Betty's account balance is $3,456.

2. **Determine the Balance in One of Gina's Accounts**:
   - According to the problem, each of Gina's accounts has a quarter of the balance in Betty's account.
   - To find out how much is in one of Gina's accounts, we calculate a quarter of Betty's balance:
     \[
     \text{Balance in one of Gina's accounts} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Betty's balance}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Balance in one of Gina's accounts} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3,456
     \]

3. **Calculate a Quarter of Betty's Balance**:
   - Now, we perform the division:
     \[
     \frac{3,456}{4} = 864
     \]
   - Therefore, each of Gina's accounts has a balance of $864.

4. **Determine the Combined Balance of Both of Gina's Accounts**:
   - Since Gina has two accounts, we need to find the total balance by adding the balances of both accounts:
     \[
     \text{Combined balance of both accounts} = \text{Balance in one account} + \text{Balance in the other account}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Combined balance of both accounts} = 864 + 864
     \]

5. **Calculate the Combined Balance**:
   - Now, we perform the addition:
     \[
     864 + 864 = 1,728
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - The combined balance of both of Gina's accounts is **$1,728**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1728}
\]
