==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the combined balance of Gina's two bank accounts, given that each account has a quarter of the balance in Betty's account. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the relationship between the accounts:**
   - We are told that each of Gina's accounts has a balance that is a quarter of Betty's account balance.
   - Betty's account balance is given as $3,456.

2. **Calculate the balance of one of Gina's accounts:**
   - Since each of Gina's accounts has a quarter of Betty's balance, we need to calculate one quarter of $3,456.
   - To find one quarter, we divide $3,456 by 4:
     \[
     \text{Balance of one of Gina's accounts} = \frac{3,456}{4}
     \]

3. **Perform the division:**
   - Divide $3,456 by 4:
     \[
     3,456 \div 4 = 864
     \]
   - Therefore, each of Gina's accounts has a balance of $864.

4. **Calculate the combined balance of both Gina's accounts:**
   - Since Gina has two accounts, each with a balance of $864, we add the balances of the two accounts:
     \[
     \text{Combined balance of both Gina's accounts} = 864 + 864
     \]

5. **Perform the addition:**
   - Add the two balances:
     \[
     864 + 864 = 1,728
     \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The combined balance of both Gina's accounts is $1,728.

Therefore, the final answer is that the combined balance of both Gina's accounts is **$1,728**.
