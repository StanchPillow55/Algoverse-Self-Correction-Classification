==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the balance of Gina's two bank accounts based on the information provided about Betty's account.

1. **Identify Betty's account balance**: 
   Betty's account balance is given as $3,456.

2. **Determine the balance of one of Gina's accounts**:
   According to the problem, each of Gina's accounts has a quarter of the balance in Betty's account. 
   To find out how much one of Gina's accounts has, we calculate a quarter of Betty's balance:
   \[
   \text{Balance of one of Gina's accounts} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Betty's balance}
   \]
   Substituting in Betty's balance:
   \[
   \text{Balance of one of Gina's accounts} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3,456
   \]

3. **Perform the calculation**:
   To calculate \(\frac{1}{4} \times 3,456\):
   \[
   \frac{3,456}{4} = 864
   \]
   So, each of Gina's accounts has a balance of $864.

4. **Calculate the combined balance of both of Gina's accounts**:
   Since Gina has two accounts, we need to find the total balance by adding the balances of both accounts:
   \[
   \text{Combined balance of both accounts} = 864 + 864
   \]

5. **Perform the addition**:
   \[
   864 + 864 = 1,728
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   The combined balance of both Gina's accounts is \(\boxed{1,728}\).
