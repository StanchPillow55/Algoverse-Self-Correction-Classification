==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the combined balance of Gina's two bank accounts given that each account has a quarter of the balance in Betty's account.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the balance in Betty's account:**
   - Betty's account balance is given as $3,456.

2. **Determine the balance in one of Gina's accounts:**
   - Each of Gina's accounts has a quarter of the balance in Betty's account.
   - To find the balance in one of Gina's accounts, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Balance in one of Gina's accounts} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3,456
     \]

3. **Perform the division to find the balance in one of Gina's accounts:**
   - Divide 3,456 by 4:
     \[
     3,456 \div 4 = 864
     \]
   - Therefore, each of Gina's accounts has a balance of $864.

4. **Calculate the combined balance of both Gina's accounts:**
   - Gina has two accounts, each with a balance of $864.
   - To find the combined balance, we add the balances of the two accounts:
     \[
     \text{Combined balance} = 864 + 864
     \]

5. **Perform the addition to find the combined balance:**
   - Add the two balances:
     \[
     864 + 864 = 1,728
     \]

Therefore, the combined balance of both Gina's accounts is $1,728.

**Final Answer:**
The combined balance of both Gina's accounts is $1,728.
