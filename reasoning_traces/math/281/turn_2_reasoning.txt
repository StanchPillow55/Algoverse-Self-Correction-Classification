==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the balance of Gina's two bank accounts based on the information given about Betty's account.

1. **Identify Betty's Account Balance**: 
   - We know that Betty's account balance is $3,456.

2. **Determine the Balance in One of Gina's Accounts**:
   - According to the problem, each of Gina's accounts has a quarter of the balance in Betty's account.
   - To find out how much is in one of Gina's accounts, we need to calculate a quarter of Betty's balance.
   - A quarter can be expressed as the fraction \( \frac{1}{4} \).

   \[
   \text{Balance in one of Gina's accounts} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Betty's balance}
   \]

   Substituting Betty's balance:

   \[
   \text{Balance in one of Gina's accounts} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3456
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 3456 = \frac{3456}{4}
   \]

   To divide 3456 by 4, we can perform the long division or simplify it:

   \[
   3456 \div 4 = 864
   \]

   So, the balance in one of Gina's accounts is $864.

3. **Determine the Combined Balance of Both Accounts**:
   - Since Gina has two accounts and each has the same balance, we can find the combined balance by multiplying the balance of one account by 2.

   \[
   \text{Combined balance of both accounts} = 2 \times \text{Balance in one account}
   \]

   Substituting the balance we found:

   \[
   \text{Combined balance of both accounts} = 2 \times 864
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   2 \times 864 = 1728
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   - The combined balance of both of Gina's accounts is **$1,728**.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1728}
\]
