Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the combined balance of Gina's two bank accounts, given that each account has a quarter of the balance in Betty's account.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Betty's Account Balance:**
   - We are given that Betty's account balance is $3,456.

2. **Determine the Balance of One of Gina's Accounts:**
   - Each of Gina's accounts has a quarter of the balance in Betty's account.
   - To find the balance of one of Gina's accounts, we calculate one quarter of Betty's balance:
     \[
     \text{Balance of one of Gina's accounts} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3,456
     \]

3. **Calculate One Quarter of Betty's Balance:**
   - Perform the division:
     \[
     \frac{3,456}{4} = 864
     \]
   - So, each of Gina's accounts has a balance of $864.

4. **Determine the Combined Balance of Both Gina's Accounts:**
   - Gina has two accounts, each with a balance of $864.
   - To find the combined balance, we add the balances of the two accounts:
     \[
     \text{Combined balance of both Gina's accounts} = 864 + 864
     \]

5. **Calculate the Combined Balance:**
   - Perform the addition:
     \[
     864 + 864 = 1,728
     \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The combined balance of both Gina's accounts is $1,728.

Therefore, the final answer is that the combined balance of both Gina's accounts is $1,728.
