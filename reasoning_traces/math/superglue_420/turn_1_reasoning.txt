==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 420" entails. However, since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. 

Let's assume a hypothetical math reasoning problem:

**Problem:**  
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 km/h. On its return trip from City B to City A, it travels at a speed of 90 km/h. If the total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours, what is the distance between City A and City B?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B in kilometers.
   - The speed from City A to City B is 60 km/h.
   - The speed from City B to City A is 90 km/h.

2. **Write Equations for Time:**
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B is \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - The time taken to travel from City B to City A is \( \frac{d}{90} \) hours.

3. **Set Up the Total Time Equation:**
   - The total travel time for the round trip is given as 5 hours.
   - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{90} = 5
     \]

4. **Find a Common Denominator:**
   - The common denominator for 60 and 90 is 180.
   - Rewrite the equation with the common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{3d}{180} + \frac{2d}{180} = 5
     \]

5. **Combine the Fractions:**
   - Combine the fractions on the left side:
     \[
     \frac{3d + 2d}{180} = 5
     \]
     \[
     \frac{5d}{180} = 5
     \]

6. **Solve for \( d \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 180 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     5d = 900
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5:
     \[
     d = 180
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between City A and City B is 180 kilometers.

**Final Answer:**
The distance between City A and City B is 180 km.

This approach demonstrates how to systematically solve a math reasoning problem by defining variables, setting up equations, and solving for the unknown. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide additional details.
