To solve the problem, we will first determine the selling price of each of Lily's lottery tickets, calculate the total revenue from selling all the tickets, and then find out how much money the winner will receive after Lily keeps her profit.

### Step 1: Determine the selling prices of the tickets

Lily sells her tickets as follows:
- First ticket: $1
- Second ticket: $1 + $1 = $2
- Third ticket: $2 + $1 = $3
- Fourth ticket: $3 + $1 = $4
- Fifth ticket: $4 + $1 = $5

Now, let's list the selling prices:
- Ticket 1: $1
- Ticket 2: $2
- Ticket 3: $3
- Ticket 4: $4
- Ticket 5: $5

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling all tickets

Now, we will sum the prices of all the tickets to find the total revenue.

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:
- \(1 + 2 = 3\)
- \(3 + 3 = 6\)
- \(6 + 4 = 10\)
- \(10 + 5 = 15\)

Thus, the total revenue from selling all the tickets is:

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 15
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the amount kept by Lily

Lily plans to keep a profit of $4. Therefore, we will subtract this profit from the total revenue to find out how much money will be available for the prize.

\[
\text{Prize Money} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Profit}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Prize Money} = 15 - 4
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Prize Money} = 11
\]

### Final Answer

The amount of money that the winner of the lottery will receive is:

\[
\boxed{11}
\]
