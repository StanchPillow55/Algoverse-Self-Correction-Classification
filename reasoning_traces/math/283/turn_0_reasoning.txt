To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of money Lily collects from selling the lottery tickets and then subtract her profit to find out how much money the winner will receive.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the selling price of each ticket:**
   - Lily sells the first ticket for $1.
   - Each successive ticket is sold for $1 more than the previous ticket.

   Therefore, the selling prices of the tickets are:
   - 1st ticket: $1
   - 2nd ticket: $1 + $1 = $2
   - 3rd ticket: $2 + $1 = $3
   - 4th ticket: $3 + $1 = $4
   - 5th ticket: $4 + $1 = $5

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all the tickets:**
   - Total revenue = Sum of the prices of all tickets
   - Total revenue = $1 + $2 + $3 + $4 + $5

   Let's calculate this sum:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
   \]

   So, the total revenue from selling all the tickets is $15.

3. **Determine the prize money:**
   - Lily plans to keep a $4 profit.
   - Therefore, the prize money is the total revenue minus Lily's profit.

   \[
   \text{Prize money} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Prize money} = 15 - 4 = 11
   \]

Thus, the winner of the lottery will receive $11.

**Final Answer:**
The winner of the lottery will receive $11.
