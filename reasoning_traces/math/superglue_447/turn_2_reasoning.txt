==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 447" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into logical steps. Let's assume this is a math problem involving algebra, as an example.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.
   - Recognize any constraints or conditions.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Choose an appropriate strategy to solve the problem. This could involve setting up equations, drawing diagrams, or using logical reasoning.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and signs.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for accuracy.
   - Ensure that the solution satisfies all given conditions.

### Example Problem

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- We will isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation using basic algebraic operations.

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. Start with the equation: 
   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

2. Subtract 5 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check the Solution
- Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  3(5) + 5 = 20
  \]
  \[
  15 + 5 = 20
  \]
  \[
  20 = 20
  \]
- The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is correct.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This structured approach ensures that we thoroughly understand and solve the problem, providing a clear and logical solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details!
