==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 447" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, let's assume it's a typical math problem that requires logical reasoning and calculations. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. Last month, the company produced a total of 1,000 widgets and made a total profit of $6,000. How many Type A and Type B widgets did the company produce?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Total widgets produced: \( x + y = 1,000 \)
   - Profit equation: Profit = Revenue - Cost
     - Revenue from Type A = \( 10x \)
     - Revenue from Type B = \( 15y \)
     - Total Revenue = \( 10x + 15y \)
     - Cost for Type A = \( 5x \)
     - Cost for Type B = \( 8y \)
     - Total Cost = \( 5x + 8y \)
     - Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = \( (10x + 15y) - (5x + 8y) = 5x + 7y \)
   - Given profit: \( 5x + 7y = 6,000 \)

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have two equations:
     1. \( x + y = 1,000 \)
     2. \( 5x + 7y = 6,000 \)

   - Solve equation 1 for \( x \): 
     \[
     x = 1,000 - y
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 1,000 - y \) into equation 2:
     \[
     5(1,000 - y) + 7y = 6,000
     \]
     \[
     5,000 - 5y + 7y = 6,000
     \]
     \[
     2y = 1,000
     \]
     \[
     y = 500
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 500 \) back into equation 1:
     \[
     x + 500 = 1,000
     \]
     \[
     x = 500
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The company produced 500 Type A widgets and 500 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company produced 500 Type A widgets and 500 Type B widgets.
