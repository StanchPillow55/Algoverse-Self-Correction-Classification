Question ID: superglue_142
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 142" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a mathematical reasoning problem. Let's assume this is a typical math problem involving numbers, operations, and logical reasoning.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Identify the Problem Type:**
   - Since the problem is labeled as a "reasoning question," it likely involves logical deduction or pattern recognition.

2. **Assume a Sample Problem:**
   - Let's assume the problem is: "Find the next number in the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ..."

3. **Analyze the Sequence:**
   - Look for a pattern in the sequence.
   - Observe that each number is double the previous one.

4. **Determine the Rule:**
   - The sequence follows the rule: \( a_n = 2 \times a_{n-1} \)
   - Where \( a_n \) is the nth term of the sequence.

5. **Apply the Rule:**
   - To find the next number after 16, apply the rule: \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \).

6. **Verify the Pattern:**
   - Check the consistency of the pattern with previous terms:
     - \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \)
     - \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \)
     - \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \)
     - \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \)

7. **Conclude:**
   - The next number in the sequence is 32.

### Final Answer:
The next number in the sequence is 32.

This approach demonstrates how to tackle a reasoning problem by identifying patterns and applying logical rules. If "Sample reasoning question 142" refers to a specific problem, please provide more details for a precise solution.
