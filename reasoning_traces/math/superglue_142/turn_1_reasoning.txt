==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 142." However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by reasoning through a hypothetical example.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 142" is a math problem involving algebraic equations. Here's how I would approach solving it:

### Hypothetical Problem Statement:
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). The goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   Start by eliminating the constant term on the side with the variable. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Next, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This approach demonstrates a systematic method of solving a linear equation by isolating the variable, performing arithmetic operations, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or additional context for "Sample reasoning question 142," please provide more details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
