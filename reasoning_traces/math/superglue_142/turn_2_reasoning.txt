==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 142" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear, let's assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is 10 meters longer than its width. The area of the field is 600 square meters. What are the dimensions of the field?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the field in meters.
   - Then the length of the field will be \( w + 10 \) meters.

2. **Write the Equation for Area:**
   - The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     600 = (w + 10) \times w
     \]

3. **Expand and Rearrange the Equation:**
   - Expand the right-hand side:
     \[
     600 = w^2 + 10w
     \]
   - Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:
     \[
     w^2 + 10w - 600 = 0
     \]

4. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula, where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 10 \), and \( c = -600 \):
     \[
     w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = 10^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-600) = 100 + 2400 = 2500
     \]
   - Calculate the square root of the discriminant:
     \[
     \sqrt{2500} = 50
     \]
   - Substitute back into the quadratic formula:
     \[
     w = \frac{-10 \pm 50}{2}
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{-10 + 50}{2} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
     \]
     \[
     w = \frac{-10 - 50}{2} = \frac{-60}{2} = -30
     \]
   - Since width cannot be negative, \( w = 20 \).

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Substitute \( w = 20 \) back into the expression for length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = w + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the field are 20 meters in width and 30 meters in length.
