==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 142" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and calculation. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A company produces widgets. The cost to produce each widget is $5, and they sell each widget for $12. The company has fixed costs of $700 per month. How many widgets must the company sell in a month to break even?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of widgets produced and sold.
   - The cost to produce each widget is $5.
   - The selling price per widget is $12.
   - The fixed costs are $700.

2. **Calculate Total Costs:**
   The total cost includes both fixed costs and variable costs (cost per widget times the number of widgets).
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Fixed Costs} + (\text{Cost per Widget} \times \text{Number of Widgets})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 700 + 5x
   \]

3. **Calculate Total Revenue:**
   The total revenue is the selling price per widget times the number of widgets sold.
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Selling Price per Widget} \times \text{Number of Widgets}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 12x
   \]

4. **Set Up the Break-Even Equation:**
   To break even, total revenue must equal total costs.
   \[
   12x = 700 + 5x
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides to isolate terms involving \( x \) on one side.
   \[
   12x - 5x = 700
   \]
   \[
   7x = 700
   \]
   Divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( x \).
   \[
   x = \frac{700}{7}
   \]
   \[
   x = 100
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   The company must sell 100 widgets in a month to break even.

**Final Answer:**
The company must sell 100 widgets to break even.
