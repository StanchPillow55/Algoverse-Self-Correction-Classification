To solve the problem, we need to determine the weights of Stan, Steve, and Jim, and then calculate their total weight.

1. **Identify Jim's weight**: 
   We know from the problem that Jim weighs 110 pounds.

   \[
   \text{Jim's weight} = 110 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine Steve's weight**: 
   The problem states that Steve is eight pounds lighter than Jim. Therefore, we can calculate Steve's weight by subtracting 8 pounds from Jim's weight.

   \[
   \text{Steve's weight} = \text{Jim's weight} - 8 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Steve's weight} = 110 \text{ pounds} - 8 \text{ pounds} = 102 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine Stan's weight**: 
   The problem also states that Stan weighs 5 more pounds than Steve. We can find Stan's weight by adding 5 pounds to Steve's weight.

   \[
   \text{Stan's weight} = \text{Steve's weight} + 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Stan's weight} = 102 \text{ pounds} + 5 \text{ pounds} = 107 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight**: 
   Now that we have the weights of all three individuals, we can find their total weight by adding Stan's, Steve's, and Jim's weights together.

   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Stan's weight} + \text{Steve's weight} + \text{Jim's weight}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 107 \text{ pounds} + 102 \text{ pounds} + 110 \text{ pounds}
   \]

   Now, let's perform the addition step by step:

   - First, add Stan's and Steve's weights:
     \[
     107 + 102 = 209 \text{ pounds}
     \]

   - Next, add Jim's weight:
     \[
     209 + 110 = 319 \text{ pounds}
     \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   The total weight of Stan, Steve, and Jim when they crowd onto the scale is 

   \[
   \boxed{319} \text{ pounds}
   \]
