==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the weights of Stan and Steve based on the information given, and then calculate the total weight of Stan, Steve, and Jim together.

1. **Identify Jim's Weight:**
   - We are given that Jim weighs 110 pounds.

2. **Determine Steve's Weight:**
   - The problem states that Steve is eight pounds lighter than Jim.
   - Therefore, Steve's weight is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Steve's weight} = \text{Jim's weight} - 8 = 110 - 8 = 102 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Determine Stan's Weight:**
   - We know that Stan weighs 5 more pounds than Steve.
   - Therefore, Stan's weight is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Stan's weight} = \text{Steve's weight} + 5 = 102 + 5 = 107 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Weight:**
   - Now, we add the weights of Stan, Steve, and Jim to find the total weight when they all stand on the scale together:
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = \text{Jim's weight} + \text{Steve's weight} + \text{Stan's weight}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = 110 + 102 + 107 = 319 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Thus, the total weight of Stan, Steve, and Jim when they crowd onto the scale is \(\boxed{319}\) pounds.
