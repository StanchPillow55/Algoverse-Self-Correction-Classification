==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific details about "Sample math problem 221." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by solving an example problem. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details.

Let's consider an example math problem:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample math problem 221," please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
