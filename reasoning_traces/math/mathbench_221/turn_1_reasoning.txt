==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 221" refers to. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated here, I'll assume a generic math problem and demonstrate how to solve it step-by-step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 221" is a typical algebra problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**

The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

**Step 3: Subtract 5 from Both Sides**

First, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side:

\[
3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
\]

Simplifying both sides gives:

\[
3x = 15
\]

**Step 4: Divide by 3**

Next, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
\]

Simplifying both sides gives:

\[
x = 5
\]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]

Calculate the left side:

\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
