==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 221," we need more specific information about what the problem entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample math problem 221" involves solving a quadratic equation. Here's how we might approach it:

### Hypothetical Problem:
Solve the quadratic equation: \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Standard Form**:
   A quadratic equation is generally in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). In this case, \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

2. **Calculate the Discriminant**:
   The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) is given by the formula \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\). This helps determine the nature of the roots.
   \[
   \Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
   \]

3. **Determine the Nature of the Roots**:
   Since the discriminant is positive (\(\Delta = 64\)), the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

4. **Use the Quadratic Formula**:
   The roots of the quadratic equation can be found using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
   \]
   Substitute the known values:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Roots**:
   - First root:
     \[
     x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   - Second root:
     \[
     x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution**:
   Substitute \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\) back into the original equation to verify:
   - For \(x = 3\):
     \[
     2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
     \]
   - For \(x = -1\):
     \[
     2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
     \]

Both values satisfy the original equation, confirming they are correct.

### Final Answer:
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
