To find the average cost across all products sold today, we need to calculate the total revenue from all products and then divide it by the total number of products sold.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue for each product.**

- **iPhones:**
  - Number of iPhones sold = 100
  - Average cost per iPhone = $1000
  - Total revenue from iPhones = Number of iPhones sold × Average cost per iPhone
  \[
  \text{Total revenue from iPhones} = 100 \times 1000 = 100,000
  \]

- **iPads:**
  - Number of iPads sold = 20
  - Average cost per iPad = $900
  - Total revenue from iPads = Number of iPads sold × Average cost per iPad
  \[
  \text{Total revenue from iPads} = 20 \times 900 = 18,000
  \]

- **Apple TVs:**
  - Number of Apple TVs sold = 80
  - Average cost per Apple TV = $200
  - Total revenue from Apple TVs = Number of Apple TVs sold × Average cost per Apple TV
  \[
  \text{Total revenue from Apple TVs} = 80 \times 200 = 16,000
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from all products.**

\[
\text{Total revenue} = \text{Total revenue from iPhones} + \text{Total revenue from iPads} + \text{Total revenue from Apple TVs}
\]
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 100,000 + 18,000 + 16,000 = 134,000
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of products sold.**

\[
\text{Total number of products} = \text{Number of iPhones} + \text{Number of iPads} + \text{Number of Apple TVs}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of products} = 100 + 20 + 80 = 200
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the average cost across all products.**

\[
\text{Average cost} = \frac{\text{Total revenue}}{\text{Total number of products}}
\]
\[
\text{Average cost} = \frac{134,000}{200} = 670
\]

Therefore, the average cost across all products sold today is \(\boxed{670}\).
