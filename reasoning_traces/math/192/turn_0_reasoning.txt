To find the average cost across all products sold today, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from each product.**
2. **Calculate the total number of products sold.**
3. **Calculate the overall average cost.**

### Step 1: Calculate Total Revenue from Each Product

- **iPhones:**
  - Number sold: 100
  - Average cost per iPhone: $1000
  - Total revenue from iPhones = Number sold × Average cost
  \[
  \text{Total revenue from iPhones} = 100 \times 1000 = 100000
  \]

- **iPads:**
  - Number sold: 20
  - Average cost per iPad: $900
  - Total revenue from iPads = Number sold × Average cost
  \[
  \text{Total revenue from iPads} = 20 \times 900 = 18000
  \]

- **Apple TVs:**
  - Number sold: 80
  - Average cost per Apple TV: $200
  - Total revenue from Apple TVs = Number sold × Average cost
  \[
  \text{Total revenue from Apple TVs} = 80 \times 200 = 16000
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Revenue from All Products

Now, we sum the total revenues from all products:
\[
\text{Total revenue} = \text{Total revenue from iPhones} + \text{Total revenue from iPads} + \text{Total revenue from Apple TVs}
\]
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 100000 + 18000 + 16000 = 134000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Number of Products Sold

Next, we calculate the total number of products sold:
\[
\text{Total number of products sold} = \text{Number of iPhones} + \text{Number of iPads} + \text{Number of Apple TVs}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of products sold} = 100 + 20 + 80 = 200
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Average Cost Across All Products

Finally, we calculate the average cost across all products sold:
\[
\text{Average cost} = \frac{\text{Total revenue}}{\text{Total number of products sold}}
\]
\[
\text{Average cost} = \frac{134000}{200} = 670
\]

### Final Answer

The average cost across all products sold today is **$670**.
