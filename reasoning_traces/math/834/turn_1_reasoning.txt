Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how many miles Mason has traveled in total, we need to break down his journey into two parts: the first part where he travels for 4 hours and the second part where he travels for 6 hours. 

1. **Calculate the distance traveled in the first part of the journey:**
   - Mason's speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time traveled in the first part: 4 hours

   We can use the formula for distance, which is:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]

   Plugging in the values for the first part:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled in the second part of the journey:**
   - Time traveled in the second part: 6 hours

   Again, using the same formula for distance:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   To find the total distance, we add the distances from both parts of the journey:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Thus, Mason has traveled a total of **80 miles**. 

Final answer: **80 miles**.
