Question ID: 834
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how many miles Mason has traveled in total, we can break the problem down into two parts: the distance traveled during the first part of his journey and the distance traveled during the second part.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first part of the journey.

Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours. We can use the formula for distance:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

Substituting the values for the first part:

\[
\text{Distance}_1 = 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Distance}_1 = 32 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the second part of the journey.

After taking a rest, Mason continues his journey for another 6 hours at the same rate of 8 miles per hour. Again, we use the distance formula:

\[
\text{Distance}_2 = 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Distance}_2 = 48 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled.

Now, we add the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 32 \text{ miles} + 48 \text{ miles}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 80 \text{ miles}
\]

### Final Answer

Mason has traveled a total of **80 miles**.
