Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 143" entails. Since there is no specific mathematical problem provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating an example problem and solving it step by step.

**Example Problem:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   From the problem, we know:
   - Base \( b = 10 \) units
   - Height \( h = 5 \) units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   Substitute the given values for the base and height into the area formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   First, multiply the base and height:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50
   \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   Now, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle. This process demonstrates how to approach a math problem systematically by understanding the formula, substituting known values, performing calculations, and arriving at the final answer. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details.
