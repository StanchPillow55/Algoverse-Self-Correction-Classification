==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 143" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Question:** A farmer has a rectangular field that is 60 meters long and 40 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such plots can he create, and what will be the dimensions of each plot?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the field} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 60 \, \text{m} \times 40 \, \text{m} = 2400 \, \text{m}^2
   \]

2. **Determine the Number of Plots:**
   Each plot has an area of 150 square meters. To find out how many plots can be created, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
   \[
   \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{2400 \, \text{m}^2}{150 \, \text{m}^2} = 16
   \]

3. **Determine the Dimensions of Each Plot:**
   Since each plot is rectangular and has an area of 150 square meters, we need to find possible dimensions (length and width) that multiply to 150. Common factor pairs of 150 are:
   - \(1 \times 150\)
   - \(2 \times 75\)
   - \(3 \times 50\)
   - \(5 \times 30\)
   - \(6 \times 25\)
   - \(10 \times 15\)

   The dimensions should fit within the dimensions of the field (60 meters by 40 meters). Let's choose \(10 \, \text{m} \times 15 \, \text{m}\) as the dimensions of each plot, as these dimensions are reasonable and fit well within the field's dimensions.

4. **Verify the Arrangement:**
   - Along the length of the field (60 meters), we can fit \( \frac{60}{15} = 4 \) plots.
   - Along the width of the field (40 meters), we can fit \( \frac{40}{10} = 4 \) plots.

   Therefore, the total number of plots is \(4 \times 4 = 16\), which matches our earlier calculation.

### Final Answer:
The farmer can create 16 plots, each with dimensions of 10 meters by 15 meters.
