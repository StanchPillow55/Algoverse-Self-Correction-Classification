Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 143" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear and lacks specific details, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem by creating a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 143" involves a logical reasoning problem.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Suppose we have the following scenario:

- There are three people: Alice, Bob, and Carol.
- Each person has a different favorite fruit: apple, banana, or cherry.
- We have the following clues:
  1. Alice does not like apples.
  2. Bob's favorite fruit is not banana.
  3. Carol likes cherries.

**Objective:**

Determine the favorite fruit of each person.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Analyze the Clues:**

   - From clue 1, we know Alice does not like apples. Therefore, Alice's favorite fruit is either banana or cherry.
   - From clue 2, we know Bob's favorite fruit is not banana. Therefore, Bob's favorite fruit is either apple or cherry.
   - From clue 3, we know Carol likes cherries.

2. **Use the Process of Elimination:**

   - Since Carol likes cherries (clue 3), neither Alice nor Bob can have cherries as their favorite fruit.
   - This means Alice's favorite fruit cannot be cherry, so it must be banana (from clue 1).
   - Since Bob cannot have banana (clue 2) and Carol has cherries, Bob's favorite fruit must be apple.

3. **Assign the Fruits:**

   - Alice: Banana
   - Bob: Apple
   - Carol: Cherry

**Conclusion:**

Based on the given clues and logical reasoning, we have determined the favorite fruit of each person:

- Alice's favorite fruit is banana.
- Bob's favorite fruit is apple.
- Carol's favorite fruit is cherry.

**Final Answer:**

Alice - Banana, Bob - Apple, Carol - Cherry.

This hypothetical example demonstrates how to approach a reasoning problem by analyzing clues, using the process of elimination, and logically deducing the answer. If "Sample reasoning question 143" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details or context for a more accurate solution.
