Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 464" entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem that we can solve step by step. Let's consider a common type of problem: solving a quadratic equation.

**Problem:** Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**

The standard form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). For the given equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\), the coefficients are:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

**Step 2: Calculate the discriminant.**

The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) of a quadratic equation is given by the formula \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\). It helps determine the nature of the roots.

\[
\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
\]

**Step 3: Determine the nature of the roots.**

Since the discriminant \(\Delta = 64\) is positive, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

**Step 4: Use the quadratic formula to find the roots.**

The quadratic formula is given by:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
\]

Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(\Delta\) into the formula:

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the two roots.**

1. First root (\(x_1\)):

\[
x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
\]

2. Second root (\(x_2\)):

\[
x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
\]

**Final Answer:**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
