Question ID: mathbench_464
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 464" entails. Since the problem itself is not provided, let's assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume "Sample math problem 464" is the following:

**Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   11 = 11
   \]
   The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 4.

This step-by-step approach ensures that we have correctly solved the equation by isolating the variable, performing arithmetic operations, and verifying the solution.
