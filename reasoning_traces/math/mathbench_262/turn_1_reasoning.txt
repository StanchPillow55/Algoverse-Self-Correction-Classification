==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 262" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 262" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Sample math problem 262: A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the dimensions (length and width) of a rectangle.
   - The length (\(L\)) is 3 times the width (\(W\)).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The formula for the perimeter (\(P\)) of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]
   - We know \(L = 3W\) and \(P = 48\). Substitute \(L\) in the perimeter formula:
     \[
     48 = 2(3W) + 2W
     \]

3. **Simplify and Solve for \(W\):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     48 = 6W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     48 = 8W
     \]
   - Solve for \(W\):
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

4. **Find \(L\):**
   - Since \(L = 3W\), substitute \(W = 6\):
     \[
     L = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (\(W\)) = 6 units
- Length (\(L\)) = 18 units
