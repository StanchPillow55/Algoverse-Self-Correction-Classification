==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 262" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step. Let's consider a typical algebra problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Isolate the variable term.**

We want to solve for \( x \), so we need to isolate the term that contains \( x \). The equation is:

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

To isolate \( 2x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides:

\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 2: Solve for the variable.**

Now that we have isolated the term with \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \). The equation is:

\[ 2x = 8 \]

To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 2:

\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 3: Verify the solution.**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

Substitute \( x = 4 \):

\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

Calculate the left side:

\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
