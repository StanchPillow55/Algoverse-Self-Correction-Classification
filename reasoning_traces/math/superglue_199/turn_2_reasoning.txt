==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 199" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details, I'll assume this is a hypothetical reasoning question that requires logical analysis and problem-solving skills. Let's create a sample reasoning problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide this field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such plots can the farmer create, and what will be the dimensions of each plot?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**

   The area of the rectangular field is calculated using the formula for the area of a rectangle:
   \[
   \text{Area of the field} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 100 \, \text{meters} \times 60 \, \text{meters} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
   \]

2. **Determine the Number of Plots:**

   Each plot has an area of 150 square meters. To find out how many such plots can be created, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
   \[
   \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{150 \, \text{square meters}} = 40
   \]

3. **Find Possible Dimensions for Each Plot:**

   Each plot must have an area of 150 square meters. Let's assume the dimensions of each plot are \( x \) meters by \( y \) meters. Then:
   \[
   x \times y = 150
   \]

   We need to find integer values for \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy this equation. Some possible pairs \((x, y)\) are:
   - \( (1, 150) \)
   - \( (2, 75) \)
   - \( (3, 50) \)
   - \( (5, 30) \)
   - \( (6, 25) \)
   - \( (10, 15) \)
   - \( (15, 10) \)
   - \( (25, 6) \)
   - \( (30, 5) \)
   - \( (50, 3) \)
   - \( (75, 2) \)
   - \( (150, 1) \)

   The farmer can choose any of these dimensions, depending on how he wants to arrange the plots within the field.

4. **Conclusion:**

   The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. The dimensions of each plot can vary, but they must multiply to 150 square meters. The specific dimensions will depend on how the farmer decides to arrange the plots.

**Final Answer:**

The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. The dimensions of each plot can be any pair of integers \((x, y)\) such that \( x \times y = 150 \).
