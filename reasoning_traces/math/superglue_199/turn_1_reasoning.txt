==================================================

To solve this problem, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 199" might entail. Since no specific details are provided about the content of the question, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem 199:** A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is 10 meters longer than its width. The area of the field is 600 square meters. What are the dimensions of the field?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the field in meters.
   - Then the length of the field is \( w + 10 \) meters.

2. **Write the Equation for Area:**
   - The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values, we have:
     \[
     600 = (w + 10) \times w
     \]

3. **Expand and Simplify the Equation:**
   - Expand the right-hand side:
     \[
     600 = w^2 + 10w
     \]

4. **Rearrange into a Standard Quadratic Equation:**
   - Move all terms to one side of the equation:
     \[
     w^2 + 10w - 600 = 0
     \]

5. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - This is a standard quadratic equation of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 10 \), and \( c = -600 \).
   - Use the quadratic formula:
     \[
     w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Substitute the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
     \[
     w = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{10^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-600)}}{2 \times 1}
     \]
     \[
     w = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{100 + 2400}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     w = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{2500}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     w = \frac{-10 \pm 50}{2}
     \]

6. **Calculate the Possible Values for \( w \):**
   - \( w = \frac{-10 + 50}{2} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
   - \( w = \frac{-10 - 50}{2} = \frac{-60}{2} = -30 \)

7. **Interpret the Results:**
   - Since a width cannot be negative, we discard \( w = -30 \).
   - Thus, the width of the field is \( w = 20 \) meters.

8. **Find the Length:**
   - The length is \( w + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \) meters.

### Final Answer:
The dimensions of the field are 20 meters in width and 30 meters in length.
