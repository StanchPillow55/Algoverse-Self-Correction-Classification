Question ID: 187
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of crayons Madeline has:**
   Madeline has 5 boxes with 24 crayons in each box. Therefore, the total number of crayons is:
   \[
   \text{Total crayons} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Crayons per box} = 5 \times 24 = 120
   \]

2. **Determine the number of crayons in the two boxes where 5/8 are unused:**
   Since there are 5 boxes in total, we need to focus on the 2 boxes mentioned. The total number of crayons in these 2 boxes is:
   \[
   \text{Crayons in 2 boxes} = 2 \times 24 = 48
   \]
   According to the problem, 5/8 of these crayons are unused. Therefore, the number of unused crayons in these 2 boxes is:
   \[
   \text{Unused crayons in 2 boxes} = \frac{5}{8} \times 48 = 30
   \]

3. **Determine the number of crayons in the other two boxes where 2/3 are used:**
   In the next two boxes, the total number of crayons is:
   \[
   \text{Crayons in 2 boxes} = 2 \times 24 = 48
   \]
   If 2/3 of the crayons are used, then the number of crayons used in these boxes is:
   \[
   \text{Used crayons in 2 boxes} = \frac{2}{3} \times 48 = 32
   \]
   Therefore, the number of unused crayons in these 2 boxes is:
   \[
   \text{Unused crayons in 2 boxes} = 48 - 32 = 16
   \]

4. **Determine the number of crayons in the last box:**
   The last box has 24 crayons. The problem states that this box is not entirely used, but it does not specify how many are used. We will denote the number of unused crayons in the last box as \( x \). Thus, the number of used crayons in the last box is:
   \[
   \text{Used crayons in last box} = 24 - x
   \]
   Since we don't have specific information about how many are used, we will consider \( x \) as the number of unused crayons in the last box.

5. **Calculate the total number of unused crayons:**
   The total number of unused crayons is the sum of the unused crayons from all boxes:
   \[
   \text{Total unused crayons} = \text{Unused crayons in 2 boxes} + \text{Unused crayons in other 2 boxes} + \text{Unused crayons in last box}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total unused crayons} = 30 + 16 + x = 46 + x
   \]

Since we don't have a specific value for \( x \) (the number of unused crayons in the last box), we cannot determine an exact number of unused crayons without additional information. However, we can conclude that the total number of unused crayons is expressed as \( 46 + x \).

**Final Answer:**
The total number of unused crayons Madeline has is \( 46 + x \), where \( x \) is the number of unused crayons in the last box. Without additional information about how many crayons are used in the last box, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer.
