To solve the problem of how much Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the principal amount**: Mandy owes Benedict $100.

2. **Identify the interest rate**: The monthly interest rate is 2%, which can be expressed as a decimal for calculations: 
   \[
   \text{Interest rate} = 2\% = 0.02
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount owed after 3 months**: The total amount owed will increase due to the interest accrued over the 3 months. The formula for the amount owed after \( n \) months with compound interest is:
   \[
   A = P(1 + r)^n
   \]
   where:
   - \( A \) is the total amount owed after \( n \) months,
   - \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount owed),
   - \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal),
   - \( n \) is the number of months.

   Plugging in the values:
   - \( P = 100 \)
   - \( r = 0.02 \)
   - \( n = 3 \)

   We calculate:
   \[
   A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3
   \]

4. **Calculate \( (1 + 0.02)^3 \)**:
   \[
   1 + 0.02 = 1.02
   \]
   Now, we calculate \( 1.02^3 \):
   \[
   1.02^3 = 1.02 \times 1.02 \times 1.02
   \]
   First, calculate \( 1.02 \times 1.02 \):
   \[
   1.02 \times 1.02 = 1.0404
   \]
   Now multiply by \( 1.02 \) again:
   \[
   1.0404 \times 1.02 = 1.061208
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount owed**:
   Now we substitute back into the formula:
   \[
   A = 100 \times 1.061208 = 106.1208
   \]

6. **Round to the nearest cent**: Since monetary amounts are typically rounded to two decimal places, we round \( 106.1208 \) to \( 106.12 \).

Thus, the total amount Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months is:
\[
\boxed{106.12}
\]
