To determine how much Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the total amount owed, including the interest accrued over that period.

1. **Identify the principal amount and interest rate:**
   - Principal amount (P) = $100
   - Monthly interest rate (r) = 2% = 0.02 (as a decimal)

2. **Calculate the interest for each month:**
   The interest for each month can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Interest for one month} = P \times r
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Interest for one month} = 100 \times 0.02 = 2
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount owed after each month:**
   - **After 1 month:**
     \[
     \text{Total after 1 month} = P + \text{Interest for one month} = 100 + 2 = 102
     \]
   - **After 2 months:**
     The new principal for the second month is $102.
     \[
     \text{Interest for second month} = 102 \times 0.02 = 2.04
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total after 2 months} = 102 + 2.04 = 104.04
     \]
   - **After 3 months:**
     The new principal for the third month is $104.04.
     \[
     \text{Interest for third month} = 104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total after 3 months} = 104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208
     \]

4. **Final amount owed:**
   After 3 months, the total amount Mandy owes Benedict is approximately $106.12 (rounded to two decimal places).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Mandy should give Benedict } \boxed{106.12}
\]
