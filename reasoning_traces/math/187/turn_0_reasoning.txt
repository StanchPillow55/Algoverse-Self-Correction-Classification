==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many crayons are unused in each of the boxes and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of crayons

Madeline has 5 boxes, each containing 24 crayons. Therefore, the total number of crayons is:

\[ 
5 \times 24 = 120 \text{ crayons}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate unused crayons in the first 2 boxes

In the first 2 boxes, \( \frac{5}{8} \) of the crayons were not yet used. Each box contains 24 crayons, so for 2 boxes, the total number of crayons is:

\[ 
2 \times 24 = 48 \text{ crayons}
\]

The number of unused crayons in these 2 boxes is:

\[ 
\frac{5}{8} \times 48 = 30 \text{ unused crayons}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate unused crayons in the next 2 boxes

In the next 2 boxes, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the crayons were used. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the crayons were unused. Again, each box contains 24 crayons, so for 2 boxes, the total number of crayons is:

\[ 
2 \times 24 = 48 \text{ crayons}
\]

The number of unused crayons in these 2 boxes is:

\[ 
\frac{1}{3} \times 48 = 16 \text{ unused crayons}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate unused crayons in the last box

The last box was not entirely used, meaning some crayons are unused. Since no specific fraction is given, we assume all crayons in this box are unused. Therefore, the number of unused crayons in this box is:

\[ 
24 \text{ unused crayons}
\]

### Step 5: Sum up all the unused crayons

Now, we add up the unused crayons from all the boxes:

\[
30 \text{ (from the first 2 boxes)} + 16 \text{ (from the next 2 boxes)} + 24 \text{ (from the last box)} = 70 \text{ unused crayons}
\]

### Final Answer

Madeline has a total of 70 unused crayons.
