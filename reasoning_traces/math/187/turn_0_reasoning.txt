==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of crayons Madeline has:**
   - Madeline has 5 boxes, and each box contains 24 crayons.
   - Total crayons = Number of boxes × Crayons per box
   \[
   \text{Total crayons} = 5 \times 24 = 120
   \]

2. **Determine the number of crayons in the 2 boxes where 5/8 are unused:**
   - Since there are 5 boxes total, we need to find out how many crayons are in the 2 boxes.
   - Crayons in 2 boxes = 2 × 24 = 48 crayons.
   - According to the problem, 5/8 of these crayons are unused.
   - Unused crayons in these 2 boxes = \( \frac{5}{8} \times 48 \)
   \[
   \text{Unused crayons in 2 boxes} = \frac{5}{8} \times 48 = 30
   \]

3. **Determine the number of crayons in the other 2 boxes where 2/3 are used:**
   - The number of crayons in 2 boxes = 2 × 24 = 48 crayons.
   - In these boxes, 2/3 of the crayons are used, which means 1/3 are unused.
   - Unused crayons in these 2 boxes = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 48 \)
   \[
   \text{Unused crayons in 2 boxes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 48 = 16
   \]

4. **Determine the number of crayons in the last box:**
   - The last box contains 24 crayons, and it is stated that it is not entirely used. We need to find out how many are unused.
   - Since we do not have specific information about how many are used in this box, we will denote the number of unused crayons in this box as \( x \).

5. **Calculate the total number of unused crayons:**
   - Total unused crayons = Unused crayons in the first 2 boxes + Unused crayons in the second 2 boxes + Unused crayons in the last box
   \[
   \text{Total unused crayons} = 30 + 16 + x
   \]

6. **Since we know that the last box is not entirely used, we can assume that at least 1 crayon is used. Therefore, the maximum number of unused crayons in the last box can be 23 (if 1 crayon is used).**
   - Thus, \( x \) can range from 1 to 24, but we will assume \( x \) is less than 24.

7. **Final Calculation:**
   - If we assume the last box has 1 crayon used, then \( x = 23 \).
   - Total unused crayons = \( 30 + 16 + 23 = 69 \).

Therefore, the total number of unused crayons Madeline has is:
\[
\boxed{69}
\]
