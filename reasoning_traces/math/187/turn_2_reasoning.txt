==================================================

To determine how much Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest on the initial amount of $100 over that period, given a monthly interest rate of 2%.

### Step 1: Understand the Interest Calculation
The interest is calculated on the principal amount (the original amount owed) each month. The formula for calculating the total amount owed after a certain number of months with monthly compounding interest is:

\[
A = P(1 + r)^n
\]

Where:
- \( A \) is the total amount owed after \( n \) months,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount owed),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of months.

### Step 2: Identify the Values
From the problem:
- \( P = 100 \) (the amount Mandy owes),
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% expressed as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) (the number of months).

### Step 3: Substitute the Values into the Formula
Now we substitute the values into the formula:

\[
A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Expression
First, calculate \( (1 + 0.02) \):

\[
1 + 0.02 = 1.02
\]

Next, raise \( 1.02 \) to the power of 3:

\[
1.02^3 = 1.02 \times 1.02 \times 1.02
\]

Calculating step-by-step:
1. \( 1.02 \times 1.02 = 1.0404 \)
2. \( 1.0404 \times 1.02 = 1.061208 \)

Now we have:

\[
1.02^3 \approx 1.061208
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Total Amount Owed
Now multiply this result by the principal amount:

\[
A = 100 \times 1.061208 \approx 106.1208
\]

### Step 6: Round to the Appropriate Amount
Since monetary amounts are typically rounded to two decimal places, we round \( 106.1208 \) to \( 106.12 \).

### Final Answer
Mandy should give Benedict **$106.12** after 3 months.
