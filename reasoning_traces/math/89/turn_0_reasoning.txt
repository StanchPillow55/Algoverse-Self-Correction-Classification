==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of books Krystian borrows in a week, taking into account his daily borrowing average and the increase in borrowing on Fridays.

1. **Daily Borrowing Average**: 
   Krystian borrows an average of 40 books every day from Monday to Friday. 

2. **Calculating Weekly Borrowing (Monday to Thursday)**:
   Since the library is open from Monday to Friday, we first calculate the total number of books borrowed from Monday to Thursday (4 days):
   \[
   \text{Books borrowed from Monday to Thursday} = \text{Daily average} \times \text{Number of days}
   \]
   \[
   = 40 \text{ books/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 160 \text{ books}
   \]

3. **Calculating Friday's Borrowing**:
   On Fridays, Krystian borrows about 40% more than his daily average. To find out how many books he borrows on Friday, we first calculate 40% of the daily average:
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \text{ books}
   \]
   Now, we add this increase to the daily average to find the total number of books borrowed on Friday:
   \[
   \text{Books borrowed on Friday} = \text{Daily average} + \text{Increase}
   \]
   \[
   = 40 \text{ books} + 16 \text{ books} = 56 \text{ books}
   \]

4. **Calculating Total Weekly Borrowing**:
   Now, we can find the total number of books borrowed in the week by adding the books borrowed from Monday to Thursday and the books borrowed on Friday:
   \[
   \text{Total books borrowed in a week} = \text{Books from Monday to Thursday} + \text{Books on Friday}
   \]
   \[
   = 160 \text{ books} + 56 \text{ books} = 216 \text{ books}
   \]

Thus, the total number of books Krystian borrows in a week is \( \boxed{216} \).
