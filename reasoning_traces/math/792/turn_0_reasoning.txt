==================================================

To determine how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month from collecting bottle caps, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of bottle caps collected in a day:**
   Damien finds 10 bottle caps each day.

2. **Calculate the total number of bottle caps collected in a month:**
   Since there are 30 days in the month, we can calculate the total number of bottle caps he collects by multiplying the number of caps he finds each day by the number of days in the month:
   \[
   \text{Total bottle caps} = \text{Bottle caps per day} \times \text{Number of days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total bottle caps} = 10 \text{ caps/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ caps}
   \]

3. **Determine the value of each bottle cap:**
   Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

4. **Calculate the total value of the bottle caps collected in a month:**
   To find out how much money Damien makes from the total number of bottle caps, we multiply the total number of bottle caps by the value of each cap:
   \[
   \text{Total money} = \text{Total bottle caps} \times \text{Value per cap}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 300 \text{ caps} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/cap}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month from collecting bottle caps is:
   \[
   \boxed{75}
   \]
