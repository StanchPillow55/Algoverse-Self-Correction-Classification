Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 127," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 127" is not a specific math problem, I'll assume this is a placeholder for an actual math question. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 127 positive integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 127 positive integers. The sequence of the first 127 positive integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 127.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this problem, \( n = 127 \). Substitute 127 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{127(127 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate Inside the Parentheses:**
   First, calculate \( 127 + 1 \):
   \[
   127 + 1 = 128
   \]

5. **Multiply the Terms:**
   Next, multiply 127 by 128:
   \[
   127 \times 128 = 16256
   \]

6. **Divide by 2:**
   Finally, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S = \frac{16256}{2} = 8128
   \]

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   The sum of the first 127 positive integers is 8128.

**Final Answer:**
8128
