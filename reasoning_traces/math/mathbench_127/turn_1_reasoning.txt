==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 127" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem that involves basic arithmetic operations. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 127:**

Calculate the value of the expression: \( (3 \times 4) + (15 \div 3) - (8 - 5) \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the operations and their order:**
   The expression involves multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we should perform calculations in the following order:
   - Parentheses/Brackets
   - Exponents/Orders (not applicable here)
   - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
   - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

2. **Perform multiplication and division first:**
   - Calculate \(3 \times 4\):
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12
     \]
   - Calculate \(15 \div 3\):
     \[
     15 \div 3 = 5
     \]

3. **Substitute the results back into the expression:**
   The expression now becomes:
   \[
   12 + 5 - (8 - 5)
   \]

4. **Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:**
   - Calculate \(8 - 5\):
     \[
     8 - 5 = 3
     \]

5. **Substitute back into the expression:**
   The expression now becomes:
   \[
   12 + 5 - 3
   \]

6. **Perform addition and subtraction from left to right:**
   - Calculate \(12 + 5\):
     \[
     12 + 5 = 17
     \]
   - Subtract \(3\) from the result:
     \[
     17 - 3 = 14
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The value of the expression \( (3 \times 4) + (15 \div 3) - (8 - 5) \) is \( \boxed{14} \).
