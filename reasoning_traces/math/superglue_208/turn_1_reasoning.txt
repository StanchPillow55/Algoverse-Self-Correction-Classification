==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the information given in the question. However, the question provided is "Sample reasoning question 208," which does not contain any specific mathematical problem or context to solve. It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a missing part of the question.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 208" is a placeholder, and I'll create a hypothetical math problem to demonstrate how to solve it step by step. Let's consider the following problem:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A company produces two types of products: A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $5, and the profit from each unit of product B is $8. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. If the company wants to maximize its profit, how many units of each product should it produce, assuming it can sell all the units it produces?

**Solution:**

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Write the Objective Function:**
   - The objective is to maximize the profit, \( P \).
   - Profit from product A = \( 5x \).
   - Profit from product B = \( 8y \).
   - Total profit, \( P = 5x + 8y \).

3. **Write the Constraints:**
   - The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A: \( x \leq 100 \).
   - The company can produce a maximum of 80 units of product B: \( y \leq 80 \).
   - The number of units produced cannot be negative: \( x \geq 0 \) and \( y \geq 0 \).

4. **Set Up the Linear Programming Problem:**
   - Maximize \( P = 5x + 8y \)
   - Subject to:
     - \( x \leq 100 \)
     - \( y \leq 80 \)
     - \( x \geq 0 \)
     - \( y \geq 0 \)

5. **Solve the Linear Programming Problem:**
   - The feasible region is defined by the constraints.
   - The vertices of the feasible region are the points where the constraints intersect.
   - Evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - Vertex (0, 0): \( P = 5(0) + 8(0) = 0 \)
   - Vertex (100, 0): \( P = 5(100) + 8(0) = 500 \)
   - Vertex (0, 80): \( P = 5(0) + 8(80) = 640 \)
   - Vertex (100, 80): \( P = 5(100) + 8(80) = 500 + 640 = 1140 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the vertex (100, 80), where \( P = 1140 \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B, resulting in a maximum profit of $1140.
