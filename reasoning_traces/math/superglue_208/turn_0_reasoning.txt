Question ID: superglue_208
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve a math problem, I need to understand the specific details of the problem itself. The phrase "Sample reasoning question 208" doesn't provide enough information about the problem to be solved. It seems like it might be a reference to a specific problem in a textbook or a database, but without the actual content of the question, I can't proceed with solving it.

If you can provide the details of the math problem, such as the numbers involved, the operations required, or any specific question being asked, I'll be able to help you work through it step by step. Please provide the full text of the problem so I can assist you effectively.
