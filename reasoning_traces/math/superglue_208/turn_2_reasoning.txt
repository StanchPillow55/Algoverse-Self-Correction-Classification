==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to understand the problem statement and break it down into manageable steps. However, the question you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 208," does not contain any specific mathematical problem or details to work through. It seems to be a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that isn't included in your message.

To provide a complete solution, I would need more information about the problem itself. For example, if "Sample reasoning question 208" refers to a specific math problem in a textbook or a set of problems, please provide the details of that problem. This could include any numbers, equations, or scenarios that are part of the question.

Once you provide the specific details of the math problem, I can guide you through the solution process step by step, showing all calculations and explaining the reasoning behind each step. If you have a particular type of math problem in mind (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus), feel free to specify that as well, and I can create a sample problem and work through it for you.
