To solve the problem, I'll need more specific details about "Sample reasoning question 326." Since the question isn't provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating an example problem and solving it step by step.

**Example Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know \( P = 36 \) and \( L = 2W \).
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the terms:
     \[
     36 = 4W + 2W
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     36 = 6W
     \]

5. **Solve for W (Width):**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]

6. **Find L (Length):**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 2W \):
     \[
     L = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The perimeter is indeed 36 units, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 12 units

This example demonstrates how to approach a math problem by understanding the problem, using relevant formulas, substituting known values, simplifying, solving, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that problem instead.
