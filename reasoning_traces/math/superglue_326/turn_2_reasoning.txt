==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 326" might entail. Since the problem itself isn't specified, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $5, and the profit from each unit of product B is $8. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. However, due to resource constraints, the combined production of products A and B cannot exceed 150 units per day. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let's define the variables:
- Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
- Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

**Objective Function:**
We want to maximize the profit, \( P \), which is given by:
\[ P = 5x + 8y \]

**Constraints:**
1. \( x \leq 100 \) (Product A production limit)
2. \( y \leq 80 \) (Product B production limit)
3. \( x + y \leq 150 \) (Combined production limit)
4. \( x \geq 0 \) (Non-negativity constraint)
5. \( y \geq 0 \) (Non-negativity constraint)

**Graphical Solution:**
To find the optimal solution, we can graph the constraints and identify the feasible region.

1. Plot the line \( x = 100 \).
2. Plot the line \( y = 80 \).
3. Plot the line \( x + y = 150 \).

The feasible region is the area where all these constraints overlap, including the axes.

**Vertices of the Feasible Region:**
The vertices of the feasible region are potential candidates for the optimal solution. Let's find these vertices:

1. Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \):
   \[
   100 + y = 150 \implies y = 50
   \]
   Vertex: \( (100, 50) \)

2. Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \):
   \[
   x + 80 = 150 \implies x = 70
   \]
   Vertex: \( (70, 80) \)

3. Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 80 \):
   Vertex: \( (0, 80) \)

4. Intersection of \( y = 0 \) and \( x = 100 \):
   Vertex: \( (100, 0) \)

5. Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( x + y = 150 \):
   \[
   0 + y = 150 \implies y = 150
   \]
   However, \( y = 150 \) is not within the constraint \( y \leq 80 \).

6. Intersection of \( y = 0 \) and \( x + y = 150 \):
   \[
   x + 0 = 150 \implies x = 150
   \]
   However, \( x = 150 \) is not within the constraint \( x \leq 100 \).

**Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**

1. At \( (100, 50) \):
   \[
   P = 5(100) + 8(50) = 500 + 400 = 900
   \]

2. At \( (70, 80) \):
   \[
   P = 5(70) + 8(80) = 350 + 640 = 990
   \]

3. At \( (0, 80) \):
   \[
   P = 5(0) + 8(80) = 0 + 640 = 640
   \]

4. At \( (100, 0) \):
   \[
   P = 5(100) + 8(0) = 500 + 0 = 500
   \]

**Conclusion:**
The maximum profit of $990 is achieved when the company produces 70 units of product A and 80 units of product B.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 70 units of product A and 80 units of product B.
