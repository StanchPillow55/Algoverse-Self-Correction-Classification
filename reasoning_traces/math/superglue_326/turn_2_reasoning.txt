==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 326" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. The production cost for Type A is $30 per widget, and for Type B, it is $40 per widget. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and made a profit of $15,000. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of widgets sold is 500:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - The profit from selling the widgets is calculated as the revenue minus the cost. The revenue from Type A widgets is \( 50x \), and from Type B widgets is \( 70y \). The cost for Type A is \( 30x \), and for Type B is \( 40y \). The profit equation is:
     \[
     (50x + 70y) - (30x + 40y) = 15,000
     \]
   - Simplify the profit equation:
     \[
     20x + 30y = 15,000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 500 \\
     20x + 30y &= 15,000
     \end{align*}
     \]
   - Solve the first equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - x
     \]
   - Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into the second equation:
     \[
     20x + 30(500 - x) = 15,000
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     20x + 15,000 - 30x = 15,000
     \]
     \[
     -10x + 15,000 = 15,000
     \]
     \[
     -10x = 0
     \]
     \[
     x = 0
     \]
   - Substitute \( x = 0 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - 0 = 500
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The company sold 0 Type A widgets and 500 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 0 Type A widgets and 500 Type B widgets.
