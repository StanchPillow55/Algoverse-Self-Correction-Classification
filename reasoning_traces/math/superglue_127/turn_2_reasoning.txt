==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 127" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I will assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce up to 100 widgets per day. The profit on each Type A widget is $5, and the profit on each Type B widget is $8. The company must produce at least 20 Type A widgets and at least 10 Type B widgets each day. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Constraints:**
   - The total production cannot exceed 100 widgets: \( x + y \leq 100 \).
   - At least 20 Type A widgets must be produced: \( x \geq 20 \).
   - At least 10 Type B widgets must be produced: \( y \geq 10 \).

3. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function to maximize is \( P = 5x + 8y \).

4. **Set Up the Linear Programming Problem:**
   - Maximize \( P = 5x + 8y \)
   - Subject to:
     - \( x + y \leq 100 \)
     - \( x \geq 20 \)
     - \( y \geq 10 \)

5. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines:
     - \( x + y = 100 \)
     - \( x = 20 \)
     - \( y = 10 \)

6. **Find the Corner Points:**
   - Intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( x = 20 \): \( (20, 80) \)
   - Intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( y = 10 \): \( (90, 10) \)
   - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( y = 10 \): \( (20, 10) \)

7. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - At \( (20, 80) \): \( P = 5(20) + 8(80) = 100 + 640 = 740 \)
   - At \( (90, 10) \): \( P = 5(90) + 8(10) = 450 + 80 = 530 \)
   - At \( (20, 10) \): \( P = 5(20) + 8(10) = 100 + 80 = 180 \)

8. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is $740 at the point \( (20, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 20 Type A widgets and 80 Type B widgets per day, resulting in a maximum profit of $740.
