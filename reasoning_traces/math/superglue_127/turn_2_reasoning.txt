==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 127" entails. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A company produces widgets. The cost to produce \( x \) widgets is given by the function \( C(x) = 5x + 200 \), where \( C(x) \) is the total cost in dollars. The revenue generated from selling \( x \) widgets is given by the function \( R(x) = 12x \). Determine the number of widgets, \( x \), that must be produced and sold for the company to break even.

**Solution:**

To find the break-even point, we need to determine when the cost equals the revenue. This means we set the cost function equal to the revenue function and solve for \( x \).

\[ C(x) = R(x) \]

Substitute the given functions into the equation:

\[ 5x + 200 = 12x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides to isolate terms involving \( x \) on one side:

   \[ 200 = 12x - 5x \]

2. Simplify the equation:

   \[ 200 = 7x \]

3. Divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( x \):

   \[ x = \frac{200}{7} \]

4. Calculate the value:

   \[ x \approx 28.57 \]

Since the company cannot produce a fraction of a widget, we round up to the nearest whole number, as producing less would not cover the fixed costs. Therefore, the company must produce and sell at least 29 widgets to break even.

**Final Answer:**
The company must produce and sell 29 widgets to break even.
