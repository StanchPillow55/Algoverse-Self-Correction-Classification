==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 127" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math reasoning problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal areas by building a fence parallel to the shorter side. How long will the fence be?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - We need to divide the field into two equal areas using a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     A = 100 \, \text{meters} \times 60 \, \text{meters} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

3. **Determine the Area of Each Half:**
   - Since the field is to be divided into two equal areas, each half will have an area of:
     \[
     \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{2} = 3000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

4. **Determine the Dimensions of Each Half:**
   - The fence is parallel to the shorter side (60 meters), so the width of each half remains 60 meters.
   - Let \( x \) be the length of each half.
   - The area of each half is given by:
     \[
     x \times 60 = 3000
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{3000}{60} = 50 \, \text{meters}
     \]

5. **Determine the Length of the Fence:**
   - The fence will be parallel to the shorter side and will span the entire width of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the fence is equal to the width of the field, which is 60 meters.

**Final Answer:**

The length of the fence needed to divide the field into two equal areas is 60 meters.
