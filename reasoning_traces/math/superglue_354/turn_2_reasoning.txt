==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 354" entails. Since the problem statement is not clear, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 60 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 60 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 60 units, so:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 60
     \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for Length:**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute \( L \) in the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(2W) + 2W = 60
     \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     4W + 2W = 60
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     6W = 60
     \]

6. **Solve for Width (W):**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{60}{6} = 10
     \]

7. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 2W \) to find the length:
     \[
     L = 2 \times 10 = 20
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 2(20) + 2(10) = 40 + 20 = 60
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 10 units
- Length (L) = 20 units
