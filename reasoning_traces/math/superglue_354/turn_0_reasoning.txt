==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 354" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   Even numbers are integers that are divisible by 2. Between 1 and 100, the even numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

2. **Determine the Sequence:**
   The sequence of even numbers from 2 to 100 is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms:**
   To find the number of terms \( n \) in the sequence, use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
   \]
   We know the last term \( a_n = 100 \). Plugging in the known values:
   \[
   100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
   \]
   \[
   100 = 2 + 2n - 2
   \]
   \[
   100 = 2n
   \]
   \[
   n = 50
   \]
   So, there are 50 even numbers between 1 and 100.

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
   \]
   \[
   S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
   \]
   \[
   S_{50} = 2550
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.

Thus, the complete solution to the hypothetical problem is that the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.
