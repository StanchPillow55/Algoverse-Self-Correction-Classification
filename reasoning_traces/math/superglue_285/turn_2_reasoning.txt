==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 285" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by assuming a sample problem. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends $25, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( o \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - The total number of fruits is 10:  
     \[
     a + o = 10
     \]
   - The total cost is $25:  
     \[
     2a + 3o = 25
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   a + o &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   2a + 3o &= 25 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   We can use the substitution or elimination method to solve this system. Let's use the substitution method:

   - From Equation 1, express \( a \) in terms of \( o \):
     \[
     a = 10 - o
     \]

   - Substitute \( a = 10 - o \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     2(10 - o) + 3o = 25
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( o \):
     \[
     20 - 2o + 3o = 25
     \]
     \[
     20 + o = 25
     \]
     \[
     o = 25 - 20
     \]
     \[
     o = 5
     \]

   - Substitute \( o = 5 \) back into the expression for \( a \):
     \[
     a = 10 - o = 10 - 5 = 5
     \]

4. **Verify the solution:**

   - Check the total number of fruits:
     \[
     a + o = 5 + 5 = 10
     \]
     This matches the given condition.

   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     2a + 3o = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25
     \]
     This matches the given condition.

5. **State the final answer:**

   The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.

This is a complete solution to the assumed problem, demonstrating the process of defining variables, setting up equations, solving the system, and verifying the solution.
