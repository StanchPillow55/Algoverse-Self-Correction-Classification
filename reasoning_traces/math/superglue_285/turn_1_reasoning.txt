==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 285" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by building a fence parallel to the shorter side. How long will the fence be?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The field needs to be divided into two equal parts using a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - Imagine the rectangle with the longer side (100 meters) as the base and the shorter side (60 meters) as the height.
   - The fence will be parallel to the shorter side, meaning it will run along the length of the field.

3. **Determine the Length of the Fence:**
   - Since the fence is parallel to the shorter side, it will span the entire length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the fence will be equal to the length of the field.

4. **Calculate the Length of the Fence:**
   - The length of the field is 100 meters.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The fence will be 100 meters long.

**Final Answer:**
The length of the fence is 100 meters.
