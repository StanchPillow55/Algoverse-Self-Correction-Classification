==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 286." Since the question is not provided, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. Let's assume a sample math problem and solve it.

**Sample Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the dimensions (length and width) of a rectangle.
   - The length is twice the width.
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units.

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( l \) is \( 2w \).

3. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 36 units, so:
     \[
     2l + 2w = 36
     \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for Length:**
   - Substitute \( l = 2w \) into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(2w) + 2w = 36
     \]

5. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     4w + 2w = 36
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     6w = 36
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = 6
     \]

6. **Find the Length:**
   - Since \( l = 2w \), substitute \( w = 6 \) into the equation for length:
     \[
     l = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 6 units and a length of 12 units.
