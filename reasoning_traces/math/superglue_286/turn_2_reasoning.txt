==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand the context and requirements of the question. However, the question provided, "Sample reasoning question 286," does not contain specific details or numerical information to work with. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example and solving it step-by-step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A store sells apples and oranges. An apple costs $0.50, and an orange costs $0.75. If a customer buys a total of 20 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends $12.00, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of fruits is 20: 
     \[
     x + y = 20
     \]
   - The total cost is $12.00:
     \[
     0.50x + 0.75y = 12.00
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have two equations:
   \[
   x + y = 20 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]
   \[
   0.50x + 0.75y = 12.00 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

   From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 20 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 20 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   0.50x + 0.75(20 - x) = 12.00
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   0.50x + 15 - 0.75x = 12.00
   \]
   \[
   -0.25x + 15 = 12.00
   \]
   \[
   -0.25x = 12.00 - 15
   \]
   \[
   -0.25x = -3.00
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{-3.00}{-0.25}
   \]
   \[
   x = 12
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 12 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( y \):
   \[
   12 + y = 20
   \]
   \[
   y = 20 - 12
   \]
   \[
   y = 8
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the total cost:
   \[
   0.50(12) + 0.75(8) = 6.00 + 6.00 = 12.00
   \]

   The calculations are correct, and both conditions are satisfied.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 12 apples and 8 oranges.
