   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Since no specific problem was provided, let's solve a simple example problem:

**Example Problem:**
Find the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 10.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the sum of even numbers between 1 and 10.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - List the even numbers between 1 and 10.
   - Add them together.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Even numbers between 1 and 10 are: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
   - Calculate the sum: 
     \[
     2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify that all even numbers between 1 and 10 are included.
   - Recalculate the sum to ensure accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 10 is 30.
