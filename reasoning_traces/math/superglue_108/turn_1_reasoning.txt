==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 108" might entail. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The profit from each unit of Product A is $5, and the profit from each unit of Product B is $8. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of Product A and 80 units of Product B per day. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of both products combined cannot exceed 150 units per day. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of Product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of Product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The objective is to maximize the profit, \( P \).
   - Profit from Product A = \( 5x \).
   - Profit from Product B = \( 8y \).
   - Total Profit, \( P = 5x + 8y \).

3. **Constraints:**
   - \( x \leq 100 \) (Product A production limit).
   - \( y \leq 80 \) (Product B production limit).
   - \( x + y \leq 150 \) (Total production limit).

4. **Graphical Solution Method:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is the area where all constraints overlap.

5. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are potential candidates for maximizing the profit.
   - Solve the system of inequalities to find the corner points:
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (100, 50) \).
     - Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (70, 80) \).
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 80 \): \( (0, 80) \).
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( y = 0 \): \( (100, 0) \).

6. **Calculate Profit at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( (100, 50) \): \( P = 5(100) + 8(50) = 500 + 400 = 900 \).
   - \( (70, 80) \): \( P = 5(70) + 8(80) = 350 + 640 = 990 \).
   - \( (0, 80) \): \( P = 5(0) + 8(80) = 0 + 640 = 640 \).
   - \( (100, 0) \): \( P = 5(100) + 8(0) = 500 + 0 = 500 \).

7. **Determine Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit of $990 occurs at the point \( (70, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 70 units of Product A and 80 units of Product B, resulting in a maximum profit of $990.
