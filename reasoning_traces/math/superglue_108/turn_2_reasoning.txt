Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 108" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume a generic approach to tackle a reasoning-based math problem. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem Statement:**  
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 50 meters long and 30 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller, equal-sized square plots for planting. What is the largest possible side length of the square plots?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to divide a rectangular field into the largest possible square plots.
   - The side length of these squares should be the largest possible integer that can evenly divide both the length and the width of the rectangle.

2. **Identify the Dimensions:**
   - Length of the field = 50 meters
   - Width of the field = 30 meters

3. **Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**
   - The largest side length of the square plots will be the greatest common divisor of the two dimensions of the rectangle.
   - We need to find the GCD of 50 and 30.

4. **Calculate the GCD:**
   - List the factors of each number:
     - Factors of 50: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50
     - Factors of 30: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30
   - Identify the common factors: 1, 2, 5, 10
   - The greatest common factor is 10.

5. **Verify the GCD:**
   - Use the Euclidean algorithm to confirm:
     - \( 50 \div 30 = 1 \) remainder \( 20 \)
     - \( 30 \div 20 = 1 \) remainder \( 10 \)
     - \( 20 \div 10 = 2 \) remainder \( 0 \)
   - The last non-zero remainder is 10, confirming the GCD is 10.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The largest possible side length of the square plots is 10 meters.

### Final Answer:
The largest possible side length of the square plots is **10 meters**.
