==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 108" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem and create a sample problem to solve.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of products: A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $50, and the profit from each unit of product B is $70. The company can produce a maximum of 200 units of product A and 150 units of product B per week. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B cannot exceed 300 units per week. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we will use linear programming, a method to achieve the best outcome in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - We want to maximize the profit, \( P \).
   - The profit function is given by:
     \[
     P = 50x + 70y
     \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     1. \( x \leq 200 \) (cannot produce more than 200 units of A)
     2. \( y \leq 150 \) (cannot produce more than 150 units of B)
     3. \( x + y \leq 300 \) (total production cannot exceed 300 units)

4. **Non-negativity Constraints:**
   - \( x \geq 0 \)
   - \( y \geq 0 \)

5. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is the area where all constraints overlap.

6. **Find the Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are where the lines intersect:
     1. Intersection of \( x = 200 \) and \( x + y = 300 \): \( (200, 100) \)
     2. Intersection of \( y = 150 \) and \( x + y = 300 \): \( (150, 150) \)
     3. Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 150 \): \( (0, 150) \)
     4. Intersection of \( x = 200 \) and \( y = 0 \): \( (200, 0) \)

7. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(200, 100) = 50(200) + 70(100) = 10000 + 7000 = 17000 \)
   - \( P(150, 150) = 50(150) + 70(150) = 7500 + 10500 = 18000 \)
   - \( P(0, 150) = 50(0) + 70(150) = 0 + 10500 = 10500 \)
   - \( P(200, 0) = 50(200) + 70(0) = 10000 + 0 = 10000 \)

8. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 18000 \) at the point \( (150, 150) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 150 units of product A and 150 units of product B, resulting in a maximum profit of $18,000.
