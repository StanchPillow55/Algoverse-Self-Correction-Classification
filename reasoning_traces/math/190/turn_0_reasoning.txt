==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Dallas, Darcy, and Dexter, given the relationships between their ages.

1. **Determine Dexter's Current Age:**
   - We are told that Dexter is currently 8 years old.

2. **Determine Darcy's Current Age:**
   - Darcy is twice as old as Dexter. Since Dexter is 8 years old, we calculate Darcy's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Darcy's age} = 2 \times \text{Dexter's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16
     \]
   - Therefore, Darcy is currently 16 years old.

3. **Determine Dallas's Age Last Year:**
   - Last year, Dallas was 3 times the age of his sister Darcy. To find Darcy's age last year, we subtract 1 from her current age:
     \[
     \text{Darcy's age last year} = 16 - 1 = 15
     \]
   - Since Dallas was 3 times Darcy's age last year, we calculate Dallas's age last year as follows:
     \[
     \text{Dallas's age last year} = 3 \times \text{Darcy's age last year} = 3 \times 15 = 45
     \]

4. **Determine Dallas's Current Age:**
   - To find Dallas's current age, we add 1 year to his age last year:
     \[
     \text{Dallas's current age} = \text{Dallas's age last year} + 1 = 45 + 1 = 46
     \]

Therefore, Dallas is currently 46 years old.

**Final Answer: Dallas is 46 years old.**
