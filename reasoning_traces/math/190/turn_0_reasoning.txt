==================================================

To determine how many peaches John collects in 3 hours, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert hours to minutes**: Since John collects peaches at a rate of 2 peaches per minute, we first need to convert the time he spends collecting peaches from hours to minutes. 

   There are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, to convert 3 hours into minutes, we multiply:

   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of peaches collected**: Now that we know John collects peaches for 180 minutes and he collects 2 peaches per minute, we can calculate the total number of peaches he collects by multiplying the number of minutes by the rate of collection:

   \[
   \text{Total peaches} = \text{Number of minutes} \times \text{Peaches per minute}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total peaches} = 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total peaches} = 360 \text{ peaches}
   \]

3. **Final answer**: After performing the calculations, we find that John collects a total of 360 peaches in 3 hours.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{360}
\]
