==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify Dexter's Age**: 
   We know that Dexter is currently 8 years old.

2. **Determine Darcy's Age**: 
   The problem states that Darcy is twice as old as Dexter. Therefore, we can calculate Darcy's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Darcy's age} = 2 \times \text{Dexter's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Dallas's Age Last Year**: 
   According to the problem, last year Dallas was 3 times the age of his sister Darcy. Since we just calculated Darcy's current age to be 16, we need to find out her age last year:
   \[
   \text{Darcy's age last year} = \text{Darcy's current age} - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15 \text{ years old}
   \]
   Now we can find Dallas's age last year:
   \[
   \text{Dallas's age last year} = 3 \times \text{Darcy's age last year} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Determine Dallas's Current Age**: 
   Since we found Dallas's age last year to be 45, we can find his current age by adding 1 year:
   \[
   \text{Dallas's current age} = \text{Dallas's age last year} + 1 = 45 + 1 = 46 \text{ years old}
   \]

Now, we have worked through the problem step by step and calculated that Dallas is currently 46 years old.

**Final Answer**: Dallas is 46 years old.
