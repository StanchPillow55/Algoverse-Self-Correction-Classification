==================================================

To find out how many matches Joey played in one week, we will break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Matches Played on Monday**: 
   - Joey played 2 matches on Monday.

2. **Matches Played on Friday**: 
   - Joey played 1 match on Friday.

3. **Matches Played on Saturday**: 
   - The problem states that on Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, we can calculate the number of matches he played on Saturday as follows:
   \[
   \text{Matches on Saturday} = 2 \times \text{Matches on Monday} = 2 \times 2 = 4
   \]

4. **Total Matches Played in One Week**: 
   - Now, we will sum up all the matches Joey played throughout the week:
   \[
   \text{Total Matches} = \text{Matches on Monday} + \text{Matches on Friday} + \text{Matches on Saturday}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total Matches} = 2 + 1 + 4
   \]
   Now, we perform the addition:
   \[
   \text{Total Matches} = 2 + 1 = 3
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Matches} = 3 + 4 = 7
   \]

Thus, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is **7**.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]
