==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Determine the usable length of the tree**: 
   John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree. 
   \[
   \text{Usable length} = 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of logs**: 
   John cuts the usable part of the tree into 4-foot logs. 
   To find out how many 4-foot logs he can make from 64 feet, we divide the total usable length by the length of each log:
   \[
   \text{Number of logs} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of planks from the logs**: 
   From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can make from 16 logs is:
   \[
   \text{Total planks} = 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the planks**: 
   Each plank is sold for $1.20. To find the total revenue from selling all the planks, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.20 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Finally, we summarize the calculations to find out how much John makes from selling the planks.

**Final Answer**: John makes **$96**.
