Question ID: 909
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to establish the ages of Duncan and Adam based on the information given.

1. **Identify Duncan's current age**: 
   - We know from the problem that Duncan's current age is 60 years.

2. **Calculate Duncan's age eight years ago**:
   \[
   \text{Duncan's age eight years ago} = 60 - 8 = 52 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Set up the relationship with Adam's age**:
   - The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. We can express this relationship mathematically.
   - Let \( A \) be Adam's current age. Then, Adam's age four years ago would be:
   \[
   A - 4
   \]
   - According to the problem, we have:
   \[
   52 = 2 \times (A - 4)
   \]

4. **Solve for Adam's current age**:
   - We can now solve the equation:
   \[
   52 = 2(A - 4)
   \]
   - Distributing the 2 on the right side:
   \[
   52 = 2A - 8
   \]
   - Next, we add 8 to both sides to isolate the term with \( A \):
   \[
   52 + 8 = 2A
   \]
   \[
   60 = 2A
   \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 2 to find \( A \):
   \[
   A = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

5. **Determine Adam's age in 8 years**:
   - Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old he will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
   \[
   \text{Adam's age in 8 years} = 30 + 8 = 38
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Adam will be **38 years old** in 8 years.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{38}
\]
