==================================================

To solve the problem, we will first determine Adam's current age based on the information given about Duncan's age.

1. **Identify Duncan's current age**:
   - Duncan's current age is given as 60 years.

2. **Calculate Duncan's age eight years ago**:
   \[
   \text{Duncan's age eight years ago} = 60 - 8 = 52 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Set up the relationship between Duncan's age and Adam's age**:
   - According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. We can express this relationship mathematically:
   \[
   52 = 2 \times (\text{Adam's age four years ago})
   \]

4. **Let Adam's current age be \( x \)**:
   - Therefore, Adam's age four years ago can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Adam's age four years ago} = x - 4
   \]

5. **Substituting Adam's age into the equation**:
   \[
   52 = 2 \times (x - 4)
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - First, simplify the equation:
   \[
   52 = 2x - 8
   \]
   - Next, add 8 to both sides:
   \[
   52 + 8 = 2x
   \]
   \[
   60 = 2x
   \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 30
   \]

7. **Determine Adam's current age**:
   - Adam's current age is \( x = 30 \) years.

8. **Calculate Adam's age in 8 years**:
   \[
   \text{Adam's age in 8 years} = 30 + 8 = 38 \text{ years}
   \]

Finally, we conclude that Adam will be **38 years old** in 8 years.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{38}
\]
