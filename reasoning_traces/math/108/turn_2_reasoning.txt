Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the pills Henry took over the 14 days. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of each type of pill Henry takes daily.

Henry takes a total of 9 pills each day. Of these, 4 pills cost $1.50 each. Therefore, the remaining pills (9 - 4 = 5 pills) are the ones that cost $5.50 more than the $1.50 pills.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of each type of pill.

- **Cost of the first type of pill:**  
  Each of the 4 pills costs $1.50.  
  Total cost for these 4 pills per day = 4 pills × $1.50/pill = $6.00 per day.

- **Cost of the second type of pill:**  
  Each of the remaining 5 pills costs $1.50 + $5.50 = $7.00.  
  Total cost for these 5 pills per day = 5 pills × $7.00/pill = $35.00 per day.

### Step 3: Calculate the total daily cost.

Total cost per day = Cost of first type of pills + Cost of second type of pills  
Total cost per day = $6.00 + $35.00 = $41.00

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost over 14 days.

Henry takes these pills for 14 days, so we multiply the daily cost by 14 to find the total cost over the entire period.

Total cost over 14 days = $41.00/day × 14 days = $574.00

### Final Answer

Henry spent a total of $574.00 on the pills over the 14 days.
