Question ID: 108
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how much Henry spent in total on the pills, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of pills taken**:
   Henry took 9 pills a day for 14 days. Therefore, the total number of pills he took is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total pills} = \text{Pills per day} \times \text{Number of days} = 9 \times 14 = 126 \text{ pills}
   \]

2. **Identify the types of pills**:
   According to the problem, out of the 9 pills he took each day:
   - 4 pills cost $1.50 each.
   - The remaining pills (which is \(9 - 4 = 5\) pills) cost $5.50 more than the $1.50 pills.

3. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive pills**:
   The cost of the more expensive pills can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost of more expensive pills} = 1.50 + 5.50 = 7.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the daily cost of the pills**:
   Now we can calculate the total cost of the pills taken each day:
   - Cost of the 4 pills at $1.50 each:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 4 pills} = 4 \times 1.50 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Cost of the 5 pills at $7.00 each:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 5 pills} = 5 \times 7.00 = 35.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Total daily cost:
   \[
   \text{Total daily cost} = \text{Cost of 4 pills} + \text{Cost of 5 pills} = 6.00 + 35.00 = 41.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 14 days**:
   Finally, we can find out how much Henry spent in total over the 14 days:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total daily cost} \times \text{Number of days} = 41.00 \times 14
   \]
   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   41.00 \times 14 = 574.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Henry spent on the pills over the 14 days is:
\[
\boxed{574.00}
\]
