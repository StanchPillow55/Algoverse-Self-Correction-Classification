==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the pills that Henry took over the 14 days. We will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of pills taken
Henry took 9 pills a day for 14 days. We can calculate the total number of pills as follows:

\[
\text{Total pills} = \text{Pills per day} \times \text{Number of days} = 9 \times 14
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total pills} = 126
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of each type of pill
Out of the 9 pills taken each day, 4 pills cost $1.50 each. Therefore, the number of the other type of pill is:

\[
\text{Other pills} = \text{Total pills per day} - \text{Pills costing $1.50} = 9 - 4 = 5
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of each type of pill
1. **Cost of the $1.50 pills**:
   - Each of the 4 pills costs $1.50.
   - The total cost for the $1.50 pills per day is:

\[
\text{Cost per day for $1.50 pills} = 4 \times 1.50 = 6.00
\]

2. **Cost of the other pills**:
   - The other pills cost $5.50 more than the $1.50 pills. Therefore, the cost of the other pills is:

\[
\text{Cost of other pills} = 1.50 + 5.50 = 7.00
\]

   - The total cost for the 5 other pills per day is:

\[
\text{Cost per day for other pills} = 5 \times 7.00 = 35.00
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total daily cost
Now we can find the total cost of pills per day by adding the costs of both types of pills:

\[
\text{Total cost per day} = \text{Cost per day for $1.50 pills} + \text{Cost per day for other pills} = 6.00 + 35.00 = 41.00
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost for 14 days
To find the total cost for the 14 days, we multiply the total daily cost by the number of days:

\[
\text{Total cost for 14 days} = \text{Total cost per day} \times \text{Number of days} = 41.00 \times 14
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total cost for 14 days} = 574.00
\]

### Final Answer
Henry spent a total of **$574.00** on the pills over the 14 days.
