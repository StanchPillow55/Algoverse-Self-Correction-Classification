Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the pills Henry took over the 14 days. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of each type of pill taken daily:**
   - Henry takes a total of 9 pills each day.
   - Out of these, 4 pills cost $1.50 each.
   - Therefore, the remaining pills (9 total - 4 pills) are 5 pills, which cost $5.50 more than the $1.50 pills.

2. **Calculate the cost of each type of pill:**
   - The cost of the 4 pills is straightforward: each costs $1.50.
   - The cost of the other 5 pills is $1.50 + $5.50 = $7.00 each.

3. **Calculate the daily cost of the pills:**
   - The cost of the 4 pills at $1.50 each is: 
     \[
     4 \times 1.50 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The cost of the 5 pills at $7.00 each is:
     \[
     5 \times 7.00 = 35.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost per day for all 9 pills is:
     \[
     6.00 + 35.00 = 41.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost over 14 days:**
   - Henry takes these pills for 14 days, so the total cost is:
     \[
     41.00 \times 14 = 574.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Henry spent on the pills over the 14 days is \(\boxed{574.00}\) dollars.
