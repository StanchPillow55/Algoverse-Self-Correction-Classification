==================================================

Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year. According to the problem, he wants to make twice as many cookies this year, so he intended to bake:

\[
2x
\]

However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended. Therefore, the total number of cookies he actually baked is:

\[
2x + 15
\]

Next, he dropped 5 cookies while putting them out to cool. Thus, the number of cookies he has left after dropping some is:

\[
(2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10
\]

We know from the problem statement that after all of this, he has a total of 110 cookies. We can set up the equation:

\[
2x + 10 = 110
\]

Now, we will solve for \( x \). First, we subtract 10 from both sides:

\[
2x = 110 - 10
\]
\[
2x = 100
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = \frac{100}{2}
\]
\[
x = 50
\]

Thus, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]

To verify, we can check our calculations:
- Last year, Henry baked \( 50 \) cookies.
- This year, he intended to bake \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) cookies.
- He actually baked \( 100 + 15 = 115 \) cookies.
- After dropping 5 cookies, he has \( 115 - 5 = 110 \) cookies.

Since this matches the information given in the problem, our solution is confirmed. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]
