==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the pills Henry took over the 14 days.

### Step 1: Determine the daily cost of the pills

Henry takes 9 pills a day. We know:
- 4 of these pills cost $1.50 each.
- The remaining pills (9 - 4 = 5 pills) cost $5.50 more than the $1.50 pills.

#### Cost of the 4 pills:
Each of these 4 pills costs $1.50, so the cost for these 4 pills is:
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6.00 \text{ dollars} \]

#### Cost of the remaining 5 pills:
Each of these 5 pills costs $5.50 more than the $1.50 pills. Therefore, each of these pills costs:
\[ 1.50 + 5.50 = 7.00 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost for these 5 pills is:
\[ 5 \times 7.00 = 35.00 \text{ dollars} \]

#### Total daily cost:
The total cost for all 9 pills per day is the sum of the costs of the two groups of pills:
\[ 6.00 + 35.00 = 41.00 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for 14 days

Henry takes these pills for 14 days, so the total cost over this period is:
\[ 41.00 \times 14 = 574.00 \text{ dollars} \]

### Conclusion

Henry spent a total of $574.00 on the pills over the 14 days.

**Final Answer: $574.00**
