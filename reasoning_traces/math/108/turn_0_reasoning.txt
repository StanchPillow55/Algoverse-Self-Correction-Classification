To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of pills taken by Henry**:
   Henry took 9 pills a day for 14 days. Therefore, the total number of pills he took is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total pills} = \text{pills per day} \times \text{number of days} = 9 \times 14 = 126 \text{ pills}
   \]

2. **Identify the cost of the pills**:
   According to the problem, out of the 9 pills taken each day, 4 pills cost $1.50 each. The remaining pills (which we will calculate next) cost $5.50 more than the $1.50 pills.

   - Cost of the 4 pills:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 4 pills} = 4 \times 1.50 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   - The remaining pills each cost:
   \[
   \text{Cost of remaining pills} = 1.50 + 5.50 = 7.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   - Number of remaining pills taken each day:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pills per day} = 9 - 4 = 5 \text{ pills}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for the remaining pills**:
   - Total remaining pills taken over 14 days:
   \[
   \text{Total remaining pills} = 5 \times 14 = 70 \text{ pills}
   \]

   - Cost of the remaining pills:
   \[
   \text{Cost of remaining pills} = 70 \times 7.00 = 490.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for all pills**:
   - Total cost for all pills:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of 4 pills} + \text{Cost of remaining pills} = 6.00 + 490.00 = 496.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total amount Henry spent on the pills is:
   \[
   \boxed{496.00}
   \]
