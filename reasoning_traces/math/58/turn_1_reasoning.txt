==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of money received by the 60 students in a day based on the given information.

**Step 1: Determine the number of students in each group.**

The problem states that 2/3 of the students receive an average of $6 per day. Since there are 60 students in total, we calculate the number of students in this group as follows:

\[
\text{Number of students receiving $6 per day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40
\]

The rest of the students receive an average of $4 per day. Since there are 60 students in total, the number of students in this group is:

\[
\text{Number of students receiving $4 per day} = 60 - 40 = 20
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total daily allowance for each group.**

For the students receiving $6 per day:

\[
\text{Total for $6 group} = 40 \times 6 = 240
\]

For the students receiving $4 per day:

\[
\text{Total for $4 group} = 20 \times 4 = 80
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money for all students.**

Add the totals from each group to find the overall total:

\[
\text{Total amount for all students} = 240 + 80 = 320
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money that the 60 students receive in a day is $320.

**Final Answer:**

The total amount of money the 60 students get in a day is $320.
