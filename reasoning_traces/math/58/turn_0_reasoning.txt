To solve the problem, we need to find the total amount of money that 60 middle school students receive in a day based on the given averages for two groups of students.

1. **Identify the groups of students**:
   - According to the survey, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the students receive an average of $6 allowance per day.
   - The remaining \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the students receive an average of $4 allowance per day.

2. **Calculate the number of students in each group**:
   - Total number of students surveyed = 60.
   - Number of students receiving $6 allowance:
     \[
     \text{Number of students receiving } \$6 = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40
     \]
   - Number of students receiving $4 allowance:
     \[
     \text{Number of students receiving } \$4 = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
     \]

3. **Calculate the total allowance for each group**:
   - Total allowance for the students receiving $6:
     \[
     \text{Total for } \$6 = 40 \times 6 = 240
     \]
   - Total allowance for the students receiving $4:
     \[
     \text{Total for } \$4 = 20 \times 4 = 80
     \]

4. **Calculate the overall total allowance**:
   - Total allowance for all students:
     \[
     \text{Total allowance} = 240 + 80 = 320
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   The total amount of money that those 60 students get in a day is **$320**.
