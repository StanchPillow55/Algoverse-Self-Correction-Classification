==================================================

To find the final price of Stephen's groceries after all the fees and tip, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Bill Amount**: 
   Stephen's initial bill for groceries is $40.00.

2. **Delivery Vendor Fee**: 
   The delivery vendor adds a 25% fee to the final total. We need to calculate 25% of the initial bill.

   \[
   \text{Delivery Fee} = 25\% \text{ of } 40.00 = 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00
   \]

3. **Total After Delivery Fee**: 
   Now, we add the delivery fee to the initial bill.

   \[
   \text{Total After Delivery Fee} = \text{Initial Bill} + \text{Delivery Fee} = 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00
   \]

4. **Additional Delivery Charges**: 
   The delivery vendor also charges a flat delivery fee of $3.00. We need to add this to the total calculated in the previous step.

   \[
   \text{Total After Delivery Charges} = \text{Total After Delivery Fee} + \text{Delivery Charge} = 50.00 + 3.00 = 53.00
   \]

5. **Tip**: 
   Stephen adds a tip of $4.00. We will add this to the total from the previous step.

   \[
   \text{Final Total} = \text{Total After Delivery Charges} + \text{Tip} = 53.00 + 4.00 = 57.00
   \]

6. **Final Answer**: 
   The final price of Stephen's groceries, after all fees and the tip, is:

   \[
   \boxed{57.00}
   \]
