==================================================

First, we need to find out how many students receive an average of $6 a day and how many receive an average of $4 a day. 

According to the problem, 2/3 of the students receive an average of $6 a day. So, we multiply 60 (the total number of students) by 2/3 to find out how many students receive $6 a day:

60 * 2/3 = 40 students

This means that the remaining students receive an average of $4 a day. We subtract the number of students who receive $6 a day from the total number of students to find out how many students receive $4 a day:

60 - 40 = 20 students

Next, we calculate the total amount of money that the students receive in a day. 

We multiply the number of students who receive $6 a day by $6:

40 students * $6/student = $240

Then, we multiply the number of students who receive $4 a day by $4:

20 students * $4/student = $80

Finally, we add these two amounts together to find the total amount of money that the 60 students receive in a day:

$240 + $80 = $320

So, the total amount of money that the 60 students receive in a day is $320.
