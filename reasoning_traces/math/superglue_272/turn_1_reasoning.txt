==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 272" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear or specific, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]
   - We know \( P = 36 \).

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     36 = 4W + 2W
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     36 = 6W
     \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]

6. **Find the Length:**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 2W \) to find the length:
     \[
     L = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 12 units
