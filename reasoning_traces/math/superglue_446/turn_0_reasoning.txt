==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 446." Since I don't have access to external databases or documents, I can't directly retrieve or reference specific questions from external sources. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem.

Let's assume a hypothetical math reasoning problem and solve it step by step:

**Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 120 miles. The train travels at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour. How long does the journey take?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Distance between City A and City B: 120 miles
   - Speed of the train: 40 miles per hour

2. **Identify What You Need to Find:**
   - The time it takes for the train to travel from City A to City B.

3. **Relevant Formula:**
   - The formula to find time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

4. **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{120 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ miles per hour}}
   \]

5. **Perform the Calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{120}{40} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Interpret the Result:**
   - The train takes 3 hours to travel from City A to City B.

7. **Final Answer:**
   - The journey takes 3 hours.

This step-by-step approach can be applied to a wide range of math reasoning problems by identifying the given information, determining what needs to be found, using the appropriate formulas, and performing the necessary calculations. If you have a specific problem or more details, feel free to share, and I can help solve it accordingly.
