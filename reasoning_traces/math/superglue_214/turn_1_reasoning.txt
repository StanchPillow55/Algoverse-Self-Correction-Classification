==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 214" refers to. Since the question itself is not provided, I will assume that it is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step, using a hypothetical example.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

The equation given is a linear equation in one variable. Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

- The equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
- Subtract 3 from both sides to get rid of the constant term on the left side:
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]

**Step 3: Solve for the Variable**

Now that we have \( 2x = 8 \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

- Divide both sides by 2:
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to check if it satisfies the equation:

- Substitute \( x = 4 \) into \( 2x + 3 = 11 \):
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 11
  \]
  Simplifying the left side gives:
  \[
  8 + 3 = 11
  \]
  \[
  11 = 11
  \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This example demonstrates the process of solving a linear equation step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details so I can assist you with that particular question.
