==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 214" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume a generic approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. Let's walk through a hypothetical example of a reasoning problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Question:** A farmer has a certain number of apples. If he divides them equally among 5 baskets, he has 2 apples left over. If he divides them among 7 baskets, he has 4 apples left over. What is the smallest number of apples the farmer could have?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the smallest number of apples, say \( N \), that when divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 2, and when divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 4.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - From the problem, we have two congruences:
     \[
     N \equiv 2 \pmod{5}
     \]
     \[
     N \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
     \]

3. **Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT):**
   - The CRT can be used here because 5 and 7 are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).
   - According to CRT, there is a unique solution modulo \( 5 \times 7 = 35 \).

4. **Solve the Congruences:**
   - We need to find a number \( N \) that satisfies both congruences.
   - Start with the first congruence: \( N = 5k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \).
   - Substitute into the second congruence: 
     \[
     5k + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     5k \equiv 2 \pmod{7}
     \]
   - Find the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 7. The inverse is a number \( x \) such that \( 5x \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \).
   - By testing values, we find that \( x = 3 \) works because \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \).
   - Multiply both sides of the congruence \( 5k \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \) by 3:
     \[
     15k \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
     \]
     \[
     k \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
     \]
   - Thus, \( k = 7m + 6 \) for some integer \( m \).

5. **Substitute Back to Find \( N \):**
   - Substitute \( k = 7m + 6 \) into \( N = 5k + 2 \):
     \[
     N = 5(7m + 6) + 2 = 35m + 30 + 2 = 35m + 32
     \]
   - Therefore, \( N \equiv 32 \pmod{35} \).

6. **Find the Smallest Positive \( N \):**
   - The smallest positive \( N \) that satisfies this is \( N = 32 \).

### Final Answer:
The smallest number of apples the farmer could have is \( \boxed{32} \).
