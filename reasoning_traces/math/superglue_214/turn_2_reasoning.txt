Question ID: superglue_214
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 214" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - Base (\( b \)) = 10 units
   - Height (\( h \)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   First, multiply the base and the height:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50
   \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   Now, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

This solution involves understanding the formula for the area of a triangle, substituting the given values, performing arithmetic operations, and arriving at the final result. The final answer is that the area of the triangle is 25 square units.
