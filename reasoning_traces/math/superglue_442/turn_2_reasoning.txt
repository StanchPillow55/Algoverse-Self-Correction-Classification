==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 442" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of products: A and B. The production cost for product A is $50 per unit, and for product B, it is $70 per unit. The company sells product A for $80 per unit and product B for $100 per unit. If the company produces 100 units of product A and 150 units of product B, what is the total profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Determine the Revenue:**
   - Revenue from product A = Selling price per unit of A × Number of units of A
   - Revenue from product B = Selling price per unit of B × Number of units of B

   \[
   \text{Revenue from A} = 80 \times 100 = 8000 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Revenue from B} = 100 \times 150 = 15000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Total Revenue:**
   - Total Revenue = Revenue from A + Revenue from B

   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 8000 + 15000 = 23000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the Cost:**
   - Cost for product A = Production cost per unit of A × Number of units of A
   - Cost for product B = Production cost per unit of B × Number of units of B

   \[
   \text{Cost for A} = 50 \times 100 = 5000 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost for B} = 70 \times 150 = 10500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Total Cost:**
   - Total Cost = Cost for A + Cost for B

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 5000 + 10500 = 15500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Profit:**
   - Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

   \[
   \text{Profit} = 23000 - 15500 = 7500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The total profit for the company from producing and selling 100 units of product A and 150 units of product B is $7500.
