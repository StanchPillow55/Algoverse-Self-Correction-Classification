Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 71" might entail. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume a generic approach to solving a typical math problem. I'll demonstrate a structured approach to problem-solving, which can be applied to a variety of mathematical questions.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Without specific details, let's assume this is a typical math problem involving algebra, geometry, or arithmetic. The first step is to identify what is being asked. For instance, if the problem involves finding the value of \( x \) in an equation, we need to isolate \( x \).

### Step 2: Gather Information
Let's assume we have an equation: 

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

### Step 3: Plan a Solution
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. This involves basic algebraic manipulation.

### Step 4: Execute the Plan
1. **Subtract 3 from both sides**: This helps to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2**: This step isolates \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

\[ 
2(4) + 3 = 11 
\]

\[ 
8 + 3 = 11 
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This structured approach can be applied to a variety of mathematical problems, ensuring a clear and logical path to the solution. If you have a specific problem or additional details, feel free to provide them for a more tailored solution.
