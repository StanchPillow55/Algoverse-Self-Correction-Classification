Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I'll need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 71." Since the question is not provided in your request, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving math problems using logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning).
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Show all calculations clearly.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify each step for accuracy.
   - Check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Re-calculate if necessary to confirm the solution.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's consider an example problem to illustrate this approach:

**Example Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - Given: Length \( L = 2W \) (where \( W \) is the width), and the perimeter \( P = 36 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2L + 2W \).
   - Substitute the expression for \( L \) in terms of \( W \) into the perimeter formula.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( W \):
     \[
     36 = 4W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6W
     \]
     \[
     W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Now, find \( L \) using \( L = 2W \):
     \[
     L = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are correct, and the dimensions satisfy the given conditions.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are 12 units (length) and 6 units (width).

If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to work through it using this structured approach.
