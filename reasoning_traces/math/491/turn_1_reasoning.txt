Question ID: 491
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of blocks Jess needs to walk in order to complete her errands and arrive at work. We will then subtract the number of blocks she has already walked to find out how many more blocks she needs to walk.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the total blocks Jess needs to walk:**
   - Jess needs to walk 11 blocks to the store.
   - Then, she needs to walk 6 blocks to the gallery.
   - Finally, she needs to walk 8 blocks to arrive at work.

2. **Calculate the total number of blocks:**
   - Add the blocks for each segment of Jess's journey:
     \[
     11 \text{ blocks (to the store)} + 6 \text{ blocks (to the gallery)} + 8 \text{ blocks (to work)} = 25 \text{ blocks}
     \]

3. **Determine how many blocks Jess has already walked:**
   - According to the problem, Jess has already walked 5 blocks.

4. **Calculate the remaining blocks Jess needs to walk:**
   - Subtract the blocks Jess has already walked from the total blocks she needs to walk:
     \[
     25 \text{ total blocks} - 5 \text{ blocks already walked} = 20 \text{ blocks remaining}
     \]

Therefore, Jess must walk 20 more blocks before arriving at work.

**Final Answer: Jess must walk 20 more blocks.**
