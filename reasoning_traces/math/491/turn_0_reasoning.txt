==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many eggs Jaime can place on the trays and how many eggs will remain unplaced.

1. **Determine the capacity of the trays**: 
   Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays. Therefore, the total capacity of the trays can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = \text{Number of trays} \times \text{Capacity of each tray}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = 2 \times 24 = 48 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of eggs Jaime has**: 
   Jaime has a total of 64 eggs.

3. **Calculate the number of eggs that cannot be placed on the trays**: 
   To find out how many eggs will not fit on the trays, we subtract the total capacity of the trays from the total number of eggs Jaime has:

   \[
   \text{Eggs that cannot be placed} = \text{Total eggs} - \text{Total capacity}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Eggs that cannot be placed} = 64 - 48 = 16 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the number of eggs that Jaime will not be able to place on the trays is 

   \[
   \boxed{16}
   \]
