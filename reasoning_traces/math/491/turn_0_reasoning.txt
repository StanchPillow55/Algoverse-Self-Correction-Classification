To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of blocks Jess needs to walk in order to complete her errands and arrive at work, and then subtract the number of blocks she has already walked.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the Total Blocks Jess Needs to Walk:**
   - Jess needs to walk 11 blocks to the store.
   - Then, she needs to walk 6 blocks to the gallery.
   - Finally, she needs to walk 8 blocks to arrive at work.

   To find the total number of blocks Jess needs to walk, we add these distances together:

   \[
   11 \text{ blocks} + 6 \text{ blocks} + 8 \text{ blocks} = 25 \text{ blocks}
   \]

   So, Jess needs to walk a total of 25 blocks to complete her errands and reach work.

2. **Subtract the Blocks Jess Has Already Walked:**
   - Jess has already walked 5 blocks.

   To find out how many more blocks she needs to walk, we subtract the blocks she has already walked from the total number of blocks:

   \[
   25 \text{ blocks (total)} - 5 \text{ blocks (already walked)} = 20 \text{ blocks}
   \]

Therefore, Jess must walk 20 more blocks before arriving at work.

**Final Answer: Jess must walk 20 more blocks to arrive at work.**
