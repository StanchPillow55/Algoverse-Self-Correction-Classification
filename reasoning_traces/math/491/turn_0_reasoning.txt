==================================================

To determine how many more blocks Jess must walk before arriving at work, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total distance Jess needs to walk**:
   - Jess has to walk to the store: 11 blocks
   - Then, she walks to the gallery: 6 blocks
   - Finally, she walks to work: 8 blocks

   We can find the total distance by adding these three distances together:

   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 11 \text{ blocks} + 6 \text{ blocks} + 8 \text{ blocks}
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   11 + 6 = 17
   \]
   \[
   17 + 8 = 25
   \]

   So, the total distance Jess needs to walk is **25 blocks**.

2. **Determine how many blocks Jess has already walked**:
   - Jess has already walked 5 blocks.

3. **Calculate the remaining distance**:
   To find out how many more blocks Jess needs to walk, we subtract the distance she has already walked from the total distance:

   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance already walked}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 25 \text{ blocks} - 5 \text{ blocks}
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   25 - 5 = 20
   \]

Thus, Jess must walk **20 more blocks** before arriving at work.

**Final Answer**: Jess must walk 20 more blocks.
