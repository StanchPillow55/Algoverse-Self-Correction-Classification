Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 350" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 350 positive integers."

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify \( n \):**  
   In this problem, \( n = 350 \).

2. **Apply the formula:**

   \[
   S_{350} = \frac{350(350 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( 350 + 1 \):**

   \[
   350 + 1 = 351
   \]

4. **Multiply \( 350 \) by \( 351 \):**

   \[
   350 \times 351 = 122850
   \]

   To verify this multiplication:
   - Break it down: \( 350 \times 351 = 350 \times (350 + 1) = 350 \times 350 + 350 \times 1 \)
   - Calculate \( 350 \times 350 = 122500 \)
   - Calculate \( 350 \times 1 = 350 \)
   - Add them: \( 122500 + 350 = 122850 \)

5. **Divide by 2:**

   \[
   S_{350} = \frac{122850}{2} = 61425
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 350 positive integers is \( 61,425 \).
