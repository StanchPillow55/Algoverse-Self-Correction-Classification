==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 350," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 350" is not a clear mathematical question or equation. It seems to be a placeholder or reference to a specific problem, but without additional context or details, it's impossible to determine what the problem is about.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 350" refers to a hypothetical math problem. Since we don't have the actual problem, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

### Sample Math Problem:
Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 15 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 5 = 15
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides:

   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]

   Simplify:

   \[
   2x = 10
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now that we have \( 2x = 10 \), we can solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2.

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{10}{2}
   \]

   Simplify:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   Original equation: \( 2x + 5 = 15 \)

   Substitute \( x = 5 \):

   \[
   2(5) + 5 = 15
   \]

   Calculate:

   \[
   10 + 5 = 15
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is \( x = 5 \).
