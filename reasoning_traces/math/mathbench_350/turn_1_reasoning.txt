==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 350," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 350" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not provided here.

To proceed, let's assume this is a hypothetical math problem, and I'll create a sample problem based on the number 350. Let's say the problem is:

"Find the prime factorization of 350."

Step-by-step solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to express the number 350 as a product of prime numbers.

2. **Start with the Smallest Prime Number:**
   Begin dividing 350 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

   \[
   350 \div 2 = 175
   \]

   Since 350 is even, it is divisible by 2. So, 2 is one of the prime factors.

3. **Continue with the Next Prime Number:**
   Now, take the quotient 175 and check divisibility by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since 175 is not divisible by 3 (as the sum of its digits, 1 + 7 + 5 = 13, is not divisible by 3), we move to the next prime number, 5.

   \[
   175 \div 5 = 35
   \]

   So, 5 is another prime factor.

4. **Repeat the Process:**
   Now, take the quotient 35 and check divisibility by 5 again.

   \[
   35 \div 5 = 7
   \]

   So, 5 is again a prime factor.

5. **Check the Remaining Quotient:**
   Now, we have 7, which is a prime number itself. So, 7 is the last prime factor.

6. **Write the Prime Factorization:**
   Combining all the prime factors, we have:

   \[
   350 = 2 \times 5 \times 5 \times 7
   \]

   Or, using exponents to express repeated factors:

   \[
   350 = 2 \times 5^2 \times 7
   \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   Multiply the prime factors to ensure they give the original number:

   \[
   2 \times 5^2 \times 7 = 2 \times 25 \times 7 = 50 \times 7 = 350
   \]

   The multiplication checks out, confirming our factorization is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 350 is \(2 \times 5^2 \times 7\).
