Question ID: 2
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Betty currently has:**
   - The wallet costs $100.
   - Betty has only half of the money she needs.
   - Therefore, the amount of money Betty currently has is:
     \[
     \text{Amount Betty has} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of money Betty's parents give her:**
   - Betty's parents give her $15.

3. **Calculate the amount of money Betty's grandparents give her:**
   - Betty's grandparents give her twice as much as her parents.
   - Therefore, the amount from her grandparents is:
     \[
     \text{Amount from grandparents} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of money Betty will have after receiving the gifts:**
   - We add the amount she currently has to the amounts given by her parents and grandparents:
     \[
     \text{Total amount} = \text{Amount Betty has} + \text{Amount from parents} + \text{Amount from grandparents}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total amount} = 50 + 15 + 30 = 95 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Determine how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet:**
   - The wallet costs $100, and Betty now has $95.
   - The additional amount Betty needs is:
     \[
     \text{Amount needed} = \text{Cost of wallet} - \text{Total amount}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Amount needed} = 100 - 95 = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Betty needs **$5 more** to buy the wallet.
