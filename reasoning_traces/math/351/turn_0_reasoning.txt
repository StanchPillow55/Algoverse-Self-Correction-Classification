To solve this problem, we need to determine how many peanut butter and jelly sandwiches Jackson ate during the school year, given the schedule and the days he missed.

1. **Determine the total number of Wednesdays and Fridays in the school year:**

   - There are 36 weeks in the school year.
   - Each week has 1 Wednesday and 1 Friday.
   - Therefore, the total number of Wednesdays is 36.
   - Similarly, the total number of Fridays is 36.

2. **Calculate the total number of sandwiches Jackson would have eaten if he didn't miss any days:**

   - Jackson gets 1 sandwich on each Wednesday and 1 sandwich on each Friday.
   - Total sandwiches if no days were missed = Total Wednesdays + Total Fridays
   - Total sandwiches = 36 Wednesdays + 36 Fridays = 72 sandwiches

3. **Account for the days Jackson missed:**

   - Jackson missed 1 Wednesday and 2 Fridays.
   - Therefore, he missed 1 sandwich on the Wednesday he was absent.
   - He missed 2 sandwiches on the Fridays he was absent.

4. **Calculate the total number of sandwiches Jackson actually ate:**

   - Total sandwiches missed = 1 (Wednesday) + 2 (Fridays) = 3 sandwiches
   - Total sandwiches eaten = Total sandwiches if no days were missed - Total sandwiches missed
   - Total sandwiches eaten = 72 - 3 = 69 sandwiches

Therefore, Jackson ate a total of 69 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch this school year.

**Final Answer:** Jackson ate 69 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
