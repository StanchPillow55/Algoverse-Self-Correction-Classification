==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many plant pots April will have left after fulfilling the school's request.

1. **Determine the number of plant pots needed for the daisies:**
   The school requests 30 plant pots for the daisies.

   \[
   \text{Plant pots for daisies} = 30
   \]

2. **Determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses:**
   The school asks for twice as many plant pots for the roses as they do for the daisies. Therefore, we calculate the number of pots needed for the roses as follows:

   \[
   \text{Plant pots for roses} = 2 \times \text{Plant pots for daisies} = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of plant pots needed:**
   Now, we add the number of pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots required.

   \[
   \text{Total plant pots needed} = \text{Plant pots for daisies} + \text{Plant pots for roses} = 30 + 60 = 90
   \]

4. **Determine how many plant pots April has:**
   April initially bought 100 plant pots.

   \[
   \text{Plant pots April has} = 100
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of plant pots left over:**
   To find out how many plant pots April has left after donating the required pots, we subtract the total number of pots needed from the number of pots she has.

   \[
   \text{Plant pots left over} = \text{Plant pots April has} - \text{Total plant pots needed} = 100 - 90 = 10
   \]

Thus, after donating the required plant pots to the school, April has **10 plant pots left over**.

Final answer: **10 plant pots left over**.
