To determine how many peanut butter and jelly sandwiches Jackson ate for lunch during the school year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of Wednesdays and Fridays in 36 weeks.**
   - Each week has 1 Wednesday and 1 Friday.
   - Therefore, in 36 weeks, the total number of Wednesdays is:
     \[
     36 \text{ Wednesdays}
     \]
   - Similarly, the total number of Fridays is:
     \[
     36 \text{ Fridays}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of sandwiches Jackson would have eaten if he hadn't missed any days.**
   - Since he eats one sandwich on each Wednesday and each Friday, the total number of sandwiches without any absences is:
     \[
     36 \text{ (Wednesdays)} + 36 \text{ (Fridays)} = 72 \text{ sandwiches}
     \]

3. **Account for the days Jackson missed.**
   - Jackson missed 1 Wednesday and 2 Fridays. Therefore, we need to subtract the sandwiches he didn't eat:
     - Sandwiches not eaten on Wednesdays: 1
     - Sandwiches not eaten on Fridays: 2
   - Total sandwiches not eaten:
     \[
     1 + 2 = 3 \text{ sandwiches}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of sandwiches Jackson actually ate.**
   - We subtract the sandwiches he didn't eat from the total sandwiches he would have eaten:
     \[
     72 \text{ (total sandwiches)} - 3 \text{ (missed sandwiches)} = 69 \text{ sandwiches}
     \]

5. **Final answer.**
   - Therefore, the total number of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches Jackson ate for lunch this school year is:
     \[
     \boxed{69}
     \]
