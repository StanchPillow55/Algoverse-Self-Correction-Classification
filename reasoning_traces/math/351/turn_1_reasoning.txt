==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many peanut butter and jelly sandwiches Jackson ate during the school year, given the schedule and the days he missed.

1. **Determine the Total Number of Wednesdays and Fridays in the School Year:**

   - There are 36 weeks of school.
   - Each week has 1 Wednesday and 1 Friday.
   - Therefore, there are 36 Wednesdays and 36 Fridays in the school year.

2. **Calculate the Total Number of Sandwiches if No Days Were Missed:**

   - If Jackson attended school every Wednesday and Friday, he would have eaten 1 sandwich each of those days.
   - Total sandwiches without any missed days = 36 Wednesdays + 36 Fridays = 72 sandwiches.

3. **Account for the Missed Days:**

   - Jackson missed 1 Wednesday and 2 Fridays.
   - Therefore, he missed 1 sandwich on the Wednesday he was absent and 2 sandwiches on the Fridays he was absent.
   - Total missed sandwiches = 1 (Wednesday) + 2 (Fridays) = 3 sandwiches.

4. **Calculate the Actual Number of Sandwiches Eaten:**

   - Subtract the missed sandwiches from the total possible sandwiches.
   - Actual sandwiches eaten = 72 (total possible) - 3 (missed) = 69 sandwiches.

Therefore, Jackson ate a total of 69 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch this school year.

**Final Answer: 69 sandwiches**
