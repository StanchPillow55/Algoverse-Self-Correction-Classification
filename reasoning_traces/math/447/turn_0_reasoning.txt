==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many books each person has read and then sum these amounts to find the total number of books read by Megan, Kelcie, and Greg.

1. **Determine the number of books Kelcie has read:**

   Megan has read 32 books. According to the problem, Kelcie has read \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of books that Megan has read.

   \[
   \text{Books read by Kelcie} = \frac{1}{4} \times 32 = 8
   \]

   So, Kelcie has read 8 books.

2. **Determine the number of books Greg has read:**

   Greg has read 9 more than twice the number of books that Kelcie has read. We already calculated that Kelcie has read 8 books.

   First, calculate twice the number of books Kelcie has read:

   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16
   \]

   Then, add 9 to this result to find the number of books Greg has read:

   \[
   \text{Books read by Greg} = 16 + 9 = 25
   \]

   So, Greg has read 25 books.

3. **Calculate the total number of books read by Megan, Kelcie, and Greg:**

   Now, we add up the number of books read by each person:

   \[
   \text{Total books} = \text{Books read by Megan} + \text{Books read by Kelcie} + \text{Books read by Greg}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total books} = 32 + 8 + 25 = 65
   \]

Therefore, the total number of books read by Megan, Kelcie, and Greg is \(\boxed{65}\).
