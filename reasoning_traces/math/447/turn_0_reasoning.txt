==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of books each person has read and then summing them up.

1. **Megan's Books**: 
   - We know that Megan has read 32 books this year.
   \[
   \text{Megan's books} = 32
   \]

2. **Kelcie's Books**: 
   - Kelcie has read \( \frac{1}{4} \) the amount of books that Megan has read. To find out how many books Kelcie has read, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Kelcie's books} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Megan's books} = \frac{1}{4} \times 32
   \]
   \[
   \text{Kelcie's books} = \frac{32}{4} = 8
   \]

3. **Greg's Books**: 
   - Greg has read 9 more than twice the number of books that Kelcie has read. First, we need to calculate twice the number of books Kelcie has read:
   \[
   \text{Twice Kelcie's books} = 2 \times \text{Kelcie's books} = 2 \times 8 = 16
   \]
   - Now, we add 9 to this amount to find out how many books Greg has read:
   \[
   \text{Greg's books} = 16 + 9 = 25
   \]

4. **Total Books Read**: 
   - Now we will sum the number of books read by Megan, Kelcie, and Greg:
   \[
   \text{Total books} = \text{Megan's books} + \text{Kelcie's books} + \text{Greg's books}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total books} = 32 + 8 + 25
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total books} = 65
   \]

Thus, the total number of books that Megan, Kelcie, and Greg have read is \( \boxed{65} \).
