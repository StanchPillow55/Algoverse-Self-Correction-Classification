To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boys in the family and then calculate how much money each boy receives.

### Step 1: Determine the Number of Boys and Girls

The ratio of boys to girls is given as 5:7. This means for every 5 boys, there are 7 girls. The total number of children in the family is 180.

Let's denote the number of boys as \( B \) and the number of girls as \( G \).

According to the ratio, we have:
\[
\frac{B}{G} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

We also know:
\[
B + G = 180
\]

To solve these equations, we can express \( B \) and \( G \) in terms of a common variable. Let's use \( x \) to represent the number of units in the ratio.

- Number of boys, \( B = 5x \)
- Number of girls, \( G = 7x \)

Substitute these into the total number of children equation:
\[
5x + 7x = 180
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
12x = 180
\]

Solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{180}{12} = 15
\]

Now, substitute back to find \( B \) and \( G \):
- Number of boys, \( B = 5x = 5 \times 15 = 75 \)
- Number of girls, \( G = 7x = 7 \times 15 = 105 \)

### Step 2: Calculate the Amount of Money Each Boy Receives

The boys are given a total of $3900 to share equally. We need to find out how much each boy receives.

The total amount of money is $3900, and there are 75 boys. Therefore, each boy receives:
\[
\text{Amount per boy} = \frac{3900}{75}
\]

Perform the division:
\[
\frac{3900}{75} = 52
\]

### Conclusion

Each boy receives $52. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{52}
\]
