To determine how much Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the hourly charge for the makeup artist**:
   The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.

2. **Calculate the total hours worked per day**:
   The makeup artist works for 6 hours each day.

3. **Calculate the total cost for one day**:
   \[
   \text{Cost per day} = \text{Hourly charge} \times \text{Hours worked per day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per day} = 250 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 1500 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for one week**:
   The makeup artist works 4 times a week.
   \[
   \text{Cost per week} = \text{Cost per day} \times \text{Number of days per week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per week} = 1500 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 6000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for the entire duration of the movie**:
   The movie lasts for 5 weeks.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost per week} \times \text{Number of weeks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6000 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 30000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the discount given by the makeup artist**:
   The makeup artist gives a 10% discount on the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Discount} = \text{Total cost} \times 0.10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 30000 \, \text{dollars} \times 0.10 = 3000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

7. **Calculate the final amount Jean has to pay**:
   Subtract the discount from the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Final amount} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final amount} = 30000 \, \text{dollars} - 3000 \, \text{dollars} = 27000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Jean paid for the makeup artist's services is **$27,000**.
