==================================================

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the ratio of boys to girls in the family, which is given as 5:7. This means that for every 5 boys, there are 7 girls.

### Step 1: Determine the total parts in the ratio
The total parts in the ratio can be calculated by adding the parts for boys and girls together:
\[
5 \text{ (boys)} + 7 \text{ (girls)} = 12 \text{ (total parts)}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of boys and girls
Next, we need to find out how many boys and girls there are in the family. We know the total number of children is 180. We can find the number of boys and girls by using the ratio.

To find the number of boys:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \left(\frac{5}{12}\right) \times 180
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{5 \times 180}{12} = \frac{900}{12} = 75
\]

To find the number of girls:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = \left(\frac{7}{12}\right) \times 180
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = \frac{7 \times 180}{12} = \frac{1260}{12} = 105
\]

### Step 3: Verify the total number of children
Now, we can verify that the total number of children is correct:
\[
\text{Total children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} = 75 + 105 = 180
\]
This confirms our calculations are correct.

### Step 4: Calculate how much money each boy receives
The total amount of money given to the boys is $3900. To find out how much each boy receives, we divide the total amount by the number of boys:
\[
\text{Amount per boy} = \frac{3900}{75}
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
\text{Amount per boy} = 52
\]

### Final Answer
Each boy receives **$52**.
