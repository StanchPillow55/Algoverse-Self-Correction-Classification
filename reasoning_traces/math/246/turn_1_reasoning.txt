==================================================

To find out how much Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the hourly charge for the makeup artist**:
   The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.

2. **Determine the number of hours worked per day**:
   The makeup artist works for 6 hours each day.

3. **Calculate the daily cost**:
   To find the cost for one day, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours worked:
   \[
   \text{Daily Cost} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours Worked}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Daily Cost} = 250 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 1500 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of days the makeup artist works per week**:
   The makeup artist works 4 times a week.

5. **Calculate the weekly cost**:
   To find the cost for one week, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days worked:
   \[
   \text{Weekly Cost} = \text{Daily Cost} \times \text{Days Worked}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weekly Cost} = 1500 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 6000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

6. **Determine the total duration of the movie**:
   The movie lasts for 5 weeks.

7. **Calculate the total cost for the entire movie**:
   To find the total cost for the entire duration of the movie, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Weekly Cost} \times \text{Weeks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 6000 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 30000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

8. **Apply the discount**:
   After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To calculate the discount amount, we find 10% of the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 0.10 \times \text{Total Cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 0.10 \times 30000 \, \text{dollars} = 3000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

9. **Calculate the final amount Jean has to pay**:
   To find the final amount after applying the discount, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Final Amount} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Amount} = 30000 \, \text{dollars} - 3000 \, \text{dollars} = 27000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Jean paid for the makeup artist's services is **$27,000**. 

Final Answer: **$27,000**
