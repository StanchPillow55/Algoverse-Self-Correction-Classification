To find out how much money Jason earned in the two-week period, we will calculate the earnings from each task he completed and then sum them up.

1. **Earnings from doing laundry**:
   - Jason did his laundry once.
   - Earnings for doing laundry = $3.00.
   - Total from laundry = \( 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00 \).

2. **Earnings from cleaning his room**:
   - Jason cleaned his room once.
   - Earnings for cleaning his room = $1.50.
   - Total from cleaning his room = \( 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50 \).

3. **Earnings from taking the trash to the curb**:
   - Jason took the trash out twice.
   - Earnings for taking the trash out = $0.75.
   - Total from taking out the trash = \( 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50 \).

4. **Earnings from emptying the dishwasher**:
   - Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times.
   - Earnings for emptying the dishwasher = $0.50.
   - Total from emptying the dishwasher = \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \).

Now, we will sum all the earnings from each task:

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings from laundry} + \text{Earnings from cleaning room} + \text{Earnings from taking out trash} + \text{Earnings from emptying dishwasher}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 3.00
\]

Now, we will perform the addition step-by-step:

- First, add the earnings from laundry and cleaning the room:
  \[
  3.00 + 1.50 = 4.50
  \]

- Next, add the earnings from taking out the trash:
  \[
  4.50 + 1.50 = 6.00
  \]

- Finally, add the earnings from emptying the dishwasher:
  \[
  6.00 + 3.00 = 9.00
  \]

Thus, the total amount of money Jason earned in the two-week period is:

\[
\boxed{9.00}
\]
