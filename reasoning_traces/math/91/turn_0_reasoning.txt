==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of pets Cindy has:**
   - According to the problem, Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Determine the number of pets Marcia has:**
   - The problem states that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. 
   - Since Cindy has 4 pets, we can calculate Marcia's pets as follows:
     \[
     \text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
     \]

3. **Determine the number of pets Jan has:**
   - The problem states that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   - Since we found that Marcia has 6 pets, we can calculate Jan's pets as follows:
     \[
     \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times \text{Marcia's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - Now we have the number of pets for each person:
     - Cindy: 4 pets
     - Marcia: 6 pets
     - Jan: 18 pets
   - To find the total number of pets, we add these amounts together:
     \[
     \text{Total pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Jan's pets} = 4 + 6 + 18
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     4 + 6 = 10
     \]
     \[
     10 + 18 = 28
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have together is \( \boxed{28} \).
