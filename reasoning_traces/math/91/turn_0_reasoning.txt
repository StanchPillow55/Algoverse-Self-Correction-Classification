==================================================

First, let's calculate how much John makes per hour without the performance bonus. He makes $80 a day and works for 8 hours, so his hourly wage is $80 รท 8 = $10 per hour.

If John decides to earn the performance bonus, his daily earnings increase to $80 + $20 = $100. However, his workday also increases to 8 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours.

To find out how much John makes per hour with the performance bonus, we divide his total daily earnings by the number of hours he works: $100 รท 10 = $10 per hour.

So, whether John decides to earn the performance bonus or not, his hourly wage remains the same at $10 per hour.
