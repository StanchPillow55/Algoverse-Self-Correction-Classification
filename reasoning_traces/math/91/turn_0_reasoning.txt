To determine how much John makes per hour if he decides to earn the performance bonus, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate John's total earnings with the bonus**:
   - John's daily wage without the bonus is $80.
   - If he works hard to earn the performance bonus, he receives an additional $20.
   - Therefore, his total earnings for the day with the bonus is:
     \[
     \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Base Salary} + \text{Bonus} = 80 + 20 = 100 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total hours worked with the bonus**:
   - John normally works 8 hours a day.
   - If he decides to work hard for the bonus, he works an additional 2 hours.
   - Thus, the total hours worked with the bonus is:
     \[
     \text{Total Hours} = \text{Normal Hours} + \text{Extra Hours} = 8 + 2 = 10 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate John's hourly wage with the bonus**:
   - To find out how much John makes per hour when he earns the bonus, we divide his total earnings by the total hours worked:
     \[
     \text{Hourly Wage} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{\text{Total Hours}} = \frac{100}{10} = 10 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, if John decides to earn the performance bonus, he makes **$10 per hour**.

In conclusion, John's hourly wage when he works hard to earn the bonus is **$10 per hour**.
