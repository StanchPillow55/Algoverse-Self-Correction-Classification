Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much John makes per hour if he decides to earn the performance bonus, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate John's total earnings with the bonus**:
   - Daily wage without bonus: $80
   - Performance bonus: $20
   - Total earnings with bonus = $80 + $20 = $100

2. **Calculate the total hours worked with the bonus**:
   - Regular work hours: 8 hours
   - Extra hours for the bonus: 2 hours
   - Total hours worked with bonus = 8 + 2 = 10 hours

3. **Calculate John's hourly wage with the bonus**:
   - Hourly wage = Total earnings with bonus / Total hours worked with bonus
   - Hourly wage = $100 / 10 hours = $10 per hour

Thus, if John decides to earn the bonus, he makes **$10 per hour**.
