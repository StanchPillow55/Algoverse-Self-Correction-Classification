Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 171" entails. Since the specific details of the question are not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 171" is a math problem involving algebraic expressions. Here's how we might approach solving it:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Identify what is being asked.** For example, let's say the problem asks us to solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
- **Write down the equation clearly.** 
  \[
  2x + 3 = 11
  \]

### Step 3: Isolate the Variable
- **Subtract 3 from both sides** to begin isolating \( x \).
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]

### Step 4: Solve for the Variable
- **Divide both sides by 2** to solve for \( x \).
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
- **Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation** to ensure it satisfies the equation.
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 11
  \]
  \[
  8 + 3 = 11
  \]
  \[
  11 = 11
  \]
  The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that our solution is correct.

### Step 6: State the Final Answer
- **Conclude with the final answer.**
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

This structured approach ensures that we systematically work through the problem, verify our solution, and clearly communicate the final answer. If "Sample reasoning question 171" is different, please provide more details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
