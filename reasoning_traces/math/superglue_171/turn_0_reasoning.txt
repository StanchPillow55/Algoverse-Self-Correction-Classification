==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 171" entails. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company sells Product A for $50 each and Product B for $70 each. The cost to produce Product A is $30, and the cost to produce Product B is $40. The company has a budget of $10,000 for production and wants to maximize its profit. The company can produce a maximum of 200 units of Product A and 150 units of Product B. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of Product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of Product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit from Product A is \( 50x - 30x = 20x \).
   - The profit from Product B is \( 70y - 40y = 30y \).
   - The total profit \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = 20x + 30y
     \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - Budget constraint: The total production cost should not exceed $10,000.
     \[
     30x + 40y \leq 10,000
     \]
   - Production limits:
     \[
     x \leq 200
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 150
     \]
   - Non-negativity constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - We need to graph the constraints and find the feasible region.
   - The line \( 30x + 40y = 10,000 \) can be rewritten as \( y = \frac{10,000 - 30x}{40} \).
   - Plot this line and the lines \( x = 200 \) and \( y = 150 \) on a graph.

5. **Vertices of the Feasible Region:**
   - Find the intersection points of the constraints:
     - Intersection of \( 30x + 40y = 10,000 \) and \( x = 200 \):
       \[
       30(200) + 40y = 10,000 \implies 6000 + 40y = 10,000 \implies 40y = 4000 \implies y = 100
       \]
       Point: \( (200, 100) \)
     - Intersection of \( 30x + 40y = 10,000 \) and \( y = 150 \):
       \[
       30x + 40(150) = 10,000 \implies 30x + 6000 = 10,000 \implies 30x = 4000 \implies x = \frac{4000}{30} \approx 133.33
       \]
       Point: \( (133.33, 150) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \) (origin): \( (0, 0) \)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - At \( (200, 100) \): \( P = 20(200) + 30(100) = 4000 + 3000 = 7000 \)
   - At \( (133.33, 150) \): \( P = 20(133.33) + 30(150) = 2666.6 + 4500 = 7166.6 \)
   - At \( (0, 0) \): \( P = 20(0) + 30(0) = 0 \)

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum profit is approximately $7166.6, achieved by producing approximately 133 units of Product A and 150 units of Product B.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce approximately 133 units of Product A and 150 units of Product B, resulting in a maximum profit of approximately $7166.6.
