==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 229" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, let's assume it is a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and calculation. 

For the sake of this exercise, let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step:

**Sample Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is twice its width. The perimeter of the field is 300 meters. What are the dimensions of the field?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field.
   - Let the width of the field be \( w \) meters.
   - The length of the field is twice the width, so the length is \( 2w \) meters.
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 300 meters.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute the known values into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     300 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     300 = 2 \times (3w)
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     300 = 6w
     \]

4. **Solve for \( w \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{300}{6} = 50
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length is twice the width:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 50 = 100
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 + 50) = 2 \times 150 = 300
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the field are 50 meters in width and 100 meters in length.
