==================================================

To determine the total duration of Sarah's basketball game, we need to calculate the time for the regular quarters and then add the time for the extended period due to the tie.

1. **Calculate the duration of the regular quarters:**
   - Each quarter lasts 12 minutes.
   - There are 4 quarters in a game.

   We can calculate the total time for the quarters as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total time for quarters} = \text{Number of quarters} \times \text{Duration of each quarter}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time for quarters} = 4 \times 12 \text{ minutes} = 48 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Add the extended time due to the tie:**
   - The game was extended for an additional 5 minutes.

   Now we add this extended time to the total time calculated for the quarters:
   \[
   \text{Total game time} = \text{Total time for quarters} + \text{Extended time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total game time} = 48 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 53 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   The entire game lasted a total of 53 minutes.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{53 \text{ minutes}}
\]
