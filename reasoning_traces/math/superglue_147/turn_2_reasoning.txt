==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 147" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume a generic math problem-solving approach and demonstrate how to tackle a typical math problem step by step. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 147" is a basic algebra problem. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true. The equation given is linear, and solving it involves isolating \( x \).

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) on one side of the equation and constants on the other.

**Step 3: Perform Operations**
Start by eliminating the constant term on the side with \( x \). Here, the constant is \( +5 \).

1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

2. Next, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]
Calculate the left side:
\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]
Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This approach demonstrates a structured method to solve a typical algebra problem, ensuring clarity and correctness at each step. If "Sample reasoning question 147" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details for a tailored solution.
