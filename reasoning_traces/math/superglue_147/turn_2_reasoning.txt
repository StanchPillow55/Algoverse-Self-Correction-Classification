==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 147" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume this is a hypothetical question that requires logical reasoning and mathematical problem-solving skills. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. After reaching City B, the train immediately returns to City A at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour. What is the total time taken for the round trip?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The train travels from City A to City B and back to City A.
   - The distance from City A to City B is 300 miles.
   - The speed from City A to City B is 60 miles per hour.
   - The speed from City B back to City A is 40 miles per hour.
   - We need to find the total time for the round trip.

2. **Calculate the Time from City A to City B:**
   - Use the formula: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}\).
   - Distance from City A to City B = 300 miles.
   - Speed from City A to City B = 60 miles per hour.
   - Time from City A to City B = \(\frac{300 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}\).

3. **Calculate the Time from City B to City A:**
   - Distance from City B to City A = 300 miles (same as the distance from City A to City B).
   - Speed from City B to City A = 40 miles per hour.
   - Time from City B to City A = \(\frac{300 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ miles per hour}} = 7.5 \text{ hours}\).

4. **Calculate the Total Time for the Round Trip:**
   - Total time = Time from City A to City B + Time from City B to City A.
   - Total time = 5 hours + 7.5 hours = 12.5 hours.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total time taken for the round trip is 12.5 hours.

By following these steps, we have logically reasoned through the problem and calculated the total time for the round trip. The final answer is 12.5 hours.
