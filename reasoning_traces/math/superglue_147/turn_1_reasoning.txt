Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 147" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I'll assume that "Sample reasoning question 147" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual content of the problem, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 147" is a typical algebra problem, such as solving for \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

Here's how we would solve this problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
The goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true. The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step 2: Isolate the Variable
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

#### Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2x = 8 \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.

#### Divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ x = 4 \]

### Step 4: Verify the Solution
To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

Substitute \( x = 4 \) into \( 2x + 3 = 11 \):
\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

Calculate the left side:
\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If "Sample reasoning question 147" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context of the problem so I can assist you accurately.
