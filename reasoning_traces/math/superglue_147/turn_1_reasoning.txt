==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 147" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's consider a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 60 meters long and 40 meters wide. He wants to divide this field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 120 square meters. How many such plots can he create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 60 meters (length) and 40 meters (width).
   - The area of the field is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Area of the field} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 60 \times 40 = 2400 \text{ square meters}
     \]
   - We need to divide this field into smaller plots, each with an area of 120 square meters.

2. **Calculate the Number of Plots:**
   - Each plot has an area of 120 square meters.
   - To find the number of plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
     \[
     \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{2400}{120}
     \]

3. **Perform the Division:**
   - Divide 2400 by 120:
     \[
     \frac{2400}{120} = 20
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 20 plots, each with an area of 120 square meters.

**Final Answer:**

The farmer can create 20 rectangular plots, each with an area of 120 square meters.
