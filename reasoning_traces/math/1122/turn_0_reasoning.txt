==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour based on the information given about the other workers and the total order.

1. **Identify the production rates of the workers:**
   - There are 5 workers in total.
   - 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour each.
   - 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each.
   - We need to find the production rate of the fifth worker, which we will denote as \( x \) (toys per hour).

2. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers:**
   - The total production from the 2 workers who produce 6 toys/hour:
     \[
     2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} = 12 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]
   - The total production from the 2 workers who produce 4 toys/hour:
     \[
     2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} = 8 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total production rate of the first four workers is:
     \[
     12 \text{ toys/hour} + 8 \text{ toys/hour} = 20 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total production of all workers during the 10-hour shift:**
   - The total production of the first four workers over 10 hours is:
     \[
     20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys}
     \]
   - The total production of the fifth worker over 10 hours is:
     \[
     10 \text{ hours} \times x \text{ toys/hour} = 10x \text{ toys}
     \]

4. **Set up the equation for total production:**
   - The total number of toys produced by all workers is:
     \[
     200 \text{ toys} + 10x \text{ toys}
     \]
   - According to the problem, after the shift, the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys. Therefore, the total production must equal:
     \[
     400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys}
     \]
   - We can set up the equation:
     \[
     200 + 10x = 380
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 200 from both sides:
     \[
     10x = 380 - 200
     \]
     \[
     10x = 180
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 10:
     \[
     x = 18
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]
