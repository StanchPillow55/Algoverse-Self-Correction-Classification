==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 88," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 88" without providing any specific details or context. Therefore, I will assume that "Sample math problem 88" is a placeholder for an actual math problem. 

Since the problem is not specified, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 88" refers to the following problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 13 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 5 = 13
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]
   \[
   13 = 13
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \) is \( x = 4 \).
