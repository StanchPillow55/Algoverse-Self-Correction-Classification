==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 88" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I will assume a generic math problem involving the number 88. Let's consider a problem involving basic arithmetic operations with the number 88.

**Problem:**  
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 88, then multiply the result by 3. Finally, subtract 10 from the product.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 88.**  
   The number 88 consists of two digits: 8 and 8.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits.**  
   Sum = 8 + 8 = 16

3. **Multiply the sum by 3.**  
   Product = 16 Ã— 3 = 48

4. **Subtract 10 from the product.**  
   Result = 48 - 10 = 38

**Final Answer:**  
The final result of the operations is 38.

This solution assumes a hypothetical problem involving the number 88, as the original problem was not specified. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you accurately.
