==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 88," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since "Sample math problem 88" is not a specific mathematical problem, I'll assume that you want me to create a sample math problem and solve it. Let's create a problem involving basic algebra:

**Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 10 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

3. **Subtract \( 2x \) from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 10 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = 10
   \]

4. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 10 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 2(5) + 10
   \]
   Simplifying both sides:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 10 + 10
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 10 \) is \( x = 5 \).
