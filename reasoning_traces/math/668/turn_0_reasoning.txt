==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of management employees.**
2. **Determine how many of those management employees oversee the entire company.**

### Step 1: Calculate the number of management employees

We know that 20% of the employees are management. The total number of employees in the company is 50.

To find the number of management employees, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of management employees} = 20\% \text{ of } 50
\]

Calculating 20% of 50:

\[
20\% = \frac{20}{100} = 0.20
\]

Now, multiply this by the total number of employees:

\[
\text{Number of management employees} = 0.20 \times 50 = 10
\]

So, there are **10 management employees** in the company.

### Step 2: Determine how many of those management employees oversee the entire company

Next, we know that out of the management employees, only 30% oversee the entire company.

To find the number of management employees who oversee the company, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of employees overseeing the company} = 30\% \text{ of } 10
\]

Calculating 30% of 10:

\[
30\% = \frac{30}{100} = 0.30
\]

Now, multiply this by the number of management employees:

\[
\text{Number of employees overseeing the company} = 0.30 \times 10 = 3
\]

Thus, the number of employees who oversee the entire company is **3**.

### Final Answer

The final answer is that **3 employees oversee the company**.
