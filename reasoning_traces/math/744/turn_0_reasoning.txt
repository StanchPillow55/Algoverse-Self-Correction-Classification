==================================================

To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day of the week, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom. We will then divide that total by the number of days in a week.

1. **Calculate the total number of animals:**
   - Dogs: 8
   - Cats: 5
   - Birds: 3
   - Horses: 12

   We add these numbers together to find the total:

   \[
   \text{Total animals} = \text{Dogs} + \text{Cats} + \text{Birds} + \text{Horses}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total animals} = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total animals} = 28
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days in a week:**
   There are 7 days in a week.

3. **Calculate the number of animals groomed each day:**
   To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week:

   \[
   \text{Animals per day} = \frac{\text{Total animals}}{\text{Days in a week}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Animals per day} = \frac{28}{7}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Animals per day} = 4
   \]

Thus, Melissa will groom **4 animals each day** of the week.

Final answer: **4 animals per day**.
