==================================================

To solve the problem, I'll need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 364." Since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to assist you with that.

Let's assume a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We are given a linear equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) and need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies this equation.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides** to eliminate the constant term on the left side:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2** to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 3: Verify the Solution**

Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a different problem or need further assistance, please provide the specific details, and I'll be glad to help!
