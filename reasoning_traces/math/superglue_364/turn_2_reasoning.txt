==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 364" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 240 square meters. How many such plots can he create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a large rectangular field with dimensions 120 meters by 80 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into smaller plots, each with an area of 240 square meters.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - For the farmer's field:
     \[
     \text{Total Area} = 120 \, \text{meters} \times 80 \, \text{meters} = 9600 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

3. **Determine the Number of Smaller Plots:**
   - Each smaller plot has an area of 240 square meters.
   - To find the number of plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
     \[
     \text{Number of Plots} = \frac{\text{Total Area}}{\text{Area of One Plot}} = \frac{9600 \, \text{square meters}}{240 \, \text{square meters}}
     \]
   - Perform the division:
     \[
     \text{Number of Plots} = \frac{9600}{240} = 40
     \]

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Multiply the number of plots by the area of one plot to ensure it equals the total area:
     \[
     40 \, \text{plots} \times 240 \, \text{square meters/plot} = 9600 \, \text{square meters}
     \]
   - The calculation is correct.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 40 smaller plots, each with an area of 240 square meters.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 240 square meters.
