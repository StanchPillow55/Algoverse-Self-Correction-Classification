==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific details about "Sample reasoning question 364." Since the question is not provided, I'll outline a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. If you have a specific problem, please provide the details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.

### General Approach to Solving a Math Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram
     - Writing an equation
     - Looking for patterns
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations and consider alternative methods to confirm results.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's consider an example problem to illustrate these steps:

**Example Problem:**
A car travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. How far does it travel in 3 hours?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the distance traveled by the car.
   - We know the speed is 60 miles per hour and the time is 3 hours.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for distance: \(\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}\).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the given values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours}
     \]
   - Calculate the distance:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 180 \, \text{miles}
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - The units of speed (miles/hour) and time (hours) are consistent, resulting in a distance in miles.
   - The calculation \(60 \times 3 = 180\) is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The car travels 180 miles in 3 hours.
