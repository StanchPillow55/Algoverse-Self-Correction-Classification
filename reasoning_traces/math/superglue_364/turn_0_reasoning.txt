To solve the problem, I need more context or details about "Sample reasoning question 364." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by solving a sample problem step by step.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a rectangle where the length (L) is 3 times the width (W).
   - The perimeter (P) of the rectangle is 48 units.
   - We need to find the dimensions: the length and the width.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \( P = 2L + 2W \).
   - We know \( L = 3W \) (since the length is 3 times the width).
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     2(3W) + 2W = 48
     \]

3. **Simplify and Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     6W + 2W = 48
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     8W = 48
     \]
   - Solve for \( W \) by dividing both sides by 8:
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

4. **Find the Length:**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute \( W = 6 \) into the equation for \( L \):
     \[
     L = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the rectangle are:
     - Width = 6 units
     - Length = 18 units

This is a complete solution to the sample problem, demonstrating the process of understanding, setting up equations, solving, and verifying the solution.
