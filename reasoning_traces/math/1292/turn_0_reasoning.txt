To solve the problem, we need to determine Jackie's height before she grew 3 inches over the summer. We will break down the information given step by step.

1. **Determine Albert's Height**: 
   We know from the problem that Albert is 36 inches tall.

2. **Determine Anne's Height**: 
   The problem states that Anne is twice the size of Albert. Therefore, we can calculate Anne's height as follows:
   \[
   \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times \text{Albert's height} = 2 \times 36 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Determine Jackie's Current Height**: 
   The problem states that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. Thus, we can calculate Jackie's current height:
   \[
   \text{Jackie's current height} = \text{Anne's height} - 2 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} - 2 \text{ inches} = 70 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Determine Jackie's Height Before Summer**: 
   We know that Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer. To find her height before summer, we subtract the growth from her current height:
   \[
   \text{Jackie's height before summer} = \text{Jackie's current height} - 3 \text{ inches} = 70 \text{ inches} - 3 \text{ inches} = 67 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now we have all the necessary calculations completed. 

**Final Answer**: Jackie was 67 inches tall before summer.
