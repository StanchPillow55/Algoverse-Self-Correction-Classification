Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amount**: Ian starts with $100 from the lottery.

2. **Payment to Colin**: Ian pays Colin $20.
   \[
   \text{Amount left after paying Colin} = 100 - 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Payment to Helen**: Ian pays Helen twice as much as he paid Colin. Since he paid Colin $20, the amount paid to Helen is:
   \[
   \text{Payment to Helen} = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]
   Now, we calculate how much money Ian has left after paying Helen:
   \[
   \text{Amount left after paying Helen} = 80 - 40 = 40
   \]

4. **Payment to Benedict**: Ian pays Benedict half as much as he paid to Helen. Since he paid Helen $40, the amount paid to Benedict is:
   \[
   \text{Payment to Benedict} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   Now, we calculate how much money Ian has left after paying Benedict:
   \[
   \text{Amount left after paying Benedict} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

5. **Final Amount**: After all payments, Ian has $20 left.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]
