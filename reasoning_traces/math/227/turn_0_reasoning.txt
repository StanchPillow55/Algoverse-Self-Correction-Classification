==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to carefully track how much money Ian pays to each person and how much he has left after each payment.

1. **Initial Amount:**
   - Ian starts with $100.

2. **Payment to Colin:**
   - Ian pays $20 to Colin.
   - After this payment, the amount of money Ian has left is:
     \[
     100 - 20 = 80
     \]
   - So, Ian has $80 left after paying Colin.

3. **Payment to Helen:**
   - Ian pays twice as much to Helen as he paid to Colin.
   - Since he paid $20 to Colin, the amount he pays to Helen is:
     \[
     2 \times 20 = 40
     \]
   - After paying Helen, the amount of money Ian has left is:
     \[
     80 - 40 = 40
     \]
   - So, Ian has $40 left after paying Helen.

4. **Payment to Benedict:**
   - Ian pays half as much to Benedict as he paid to Helen.
   - Since he paid $40 to Helen, the amount he pays to Benedict is:
     \[
     \frac{40}{2} = 20
     \]
   - After paying Benedict, the amount of money Ian has left is:
     \[
     40 - 20 = 20
     \]
   - So, Ian has $20 left after paying Benedict.

5. **Final Amount:**
   - After all the payments, Ian has $20 left.

Therefore, the final answer is that Ian has \(\boxed{20}\) dollars left after paying off his debts.
