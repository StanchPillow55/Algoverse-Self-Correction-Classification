To solve the problem, we will define the number of cookies each person has based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( K \) be the number of cookies Katarina has.
   - Let \( M \) be the number of cookies Max has.
   - Let \( C \) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on the Problem:**
   - From the problem, we know that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max:
     \[
     K = M - 5
     \]
   - We also know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:
     \[
     M = C + 12
     \]
   - Additionally, Summer has 23 more cookies than Max:
     \[
     S = M + 23
     \]
   - Finally, we are given that Katarina has 68 cookies:
     \[
     K = 68
     \]

3. **Substituting for Max's Cookies:**
   - Using the equation \( K = M - 5 \) and substituting \( K = 68 \):
     \[
     68 = M - 5
     \]
   - Solving for \( M \):
     \[
     M = 68 + 5 = 73
     \]

4. **Finding the Cookie Monster's Cookies:**
   - Now we can find the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has using \( M = C + 12 \):
     \[
     73 = C + 12
     \]
   - Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     C = 73 - 12 = 61
     \]

5. **Finding Summer's Cookies:**
   - Now we can find the number of cookies Summer has using \( S = M + 23 \):
     \[
     S = 73 + 23 = 96
     \]

6. **Calculating the Total Number of Cookies:**
   - Now we have:
     - \( K = 68 \) (Katarina)
     - \( M = 73 \) (Max)
     - \( C = 61 \) (Cookie Monster)
     - \( S = 96 \) (Summer)
   - The total number of cookies is:
     \[
     \text{Total} = K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
     \]

7. **Performing the Addition:**
   - First, add \( K \) and \( M \):
     \[
     68 + 73 = 141
     \]
   - Next, add \( C \):
     \[
     141 + 61 = 202
     \]
   - Finally, add \( S \):
     \[
     202 + 96 = 298
     \]

8. **Final Answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is:
     \[
     \boxed{298}
     \]
