==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to follow a structured approach. However, the problem you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 372," doesn't contain any specific details or numbers to work with. Therefore, I'll outline a general approach to solving math problems and provide an example problem to demonstrate the process.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning).
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution answers the question posed.
   - Check calculations for errors.
   - Consider whether the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.

### Example Problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- To isolate \( x \), we can use basic algebraic operations: subtraction and division.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
1. Start with the equation: 
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 4: Review/Check the Solution**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
