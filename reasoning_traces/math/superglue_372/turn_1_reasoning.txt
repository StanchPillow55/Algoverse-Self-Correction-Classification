Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 372" entails. Since the problem statement doesn't provide explicit details about the question, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem and demonstrate a structured approach to solving a typical math problem. Let's assume it's a problem involving basic algebra.

**Problem Assumption:**
Let's assume the problem is as follows:
"Find the value of \( x \) if \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing the same operation on both sides of the equation to maintain equality.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).

This structured approach can be applied to a wide range of algebraic problems, ensuring clarity and correctness in solving equations. If "Sample reasoning question 372" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details for a more specific solution.
