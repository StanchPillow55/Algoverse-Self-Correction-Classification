Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 372" as it is not provided in the prompt. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking down the steps involved in reasoning and calculations. Let's assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step.

### Problem Statement (Hypothetical)
Let's assume the problem is: "Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Calculate the left side:
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or question number, please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem for you.
