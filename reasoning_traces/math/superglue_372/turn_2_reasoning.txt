==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 372" entails. However, since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies this equation.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

Given equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:
\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]
\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 3: Solve for the Variable**
Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it completely. Since \( x \) is multiplied by 2, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( x \).

\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]
\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

Original equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

Substitute \( x = 4 \):
\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]
\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]
\[ 11 = 11 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 4.

This step-by-step approach can be applied to a wide range of math problems, ensuring clarity and accuracy in finding the solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide additional details or context.
