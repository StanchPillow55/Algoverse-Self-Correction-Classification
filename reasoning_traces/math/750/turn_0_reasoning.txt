To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented out by Candy over two 4-week months, considering the different rental rates for weekdays and weekends.

### Step 1: Determine the number of weekdays and weekends in two 4-week months.

A typical month has about 4 weeks. Therefore, two months will have:
\[
2 \text{ months} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 8 \text{ weeks}
\]

In 8 weeks, we can calculate the number of weekdays and weekends. Each week has 7 days, which consist of 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days:
- Total days in 8 weeks:
\[
8 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 56 \text{ days}
\]

- Total weekdays in 8 weeks:
\[
8 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ weekdays/week} = 40 \text{ weekdays}
\]

- Total weekends in 8 weeks:
\[
8 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ weekend days/week} = 16 \text{ weekend days}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends.

- **Chairs rented on weekdays**: 
Candy rents out 60 chairs each weekday. Therefore, for 40 weekdays:
\[
\text{Total chairs rented on weekdays} = 60 \text{ chairs/day} \times 40 \text{ weekdays} = 2400 \text{ chairs}
\]

- **Chairs rented on weekends**: 
Candy rents out 100 chairs each weekend day. Therefore, for 16 weekend days:
\[
\text{Total chairs rented on weekends} = 100 \text{ chairs/day} \times 16 \text{ weekend days} = 1600 \text{ chairs}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months.

Now, we add the total chairs rented on weekdays and weekends:
\[
\text{Total chairs rented} = \text{Total chairs rented on weekdays} + \text{Total chairs rented on weekends}
\]
\[
\text{Total chairs rented} = 2400 \text{ chairs} + 1600 \text{ chairs} = 4000 \text{ chairs}
\]

### Final Answer:
Candy will be able to rent out a total of **4000 chairs** in two 4-week months.
