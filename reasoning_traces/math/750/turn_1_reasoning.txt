==================================================

To find out how many chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the total number of weekdays and weekends in those months and then use the rental rates for each day type.

1. **Determine the number of weeks in two 4-week months:**
   \[
   2 \text{ months} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 8 \text{ weeks}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of days in 8 weeks:**
   \[
   8 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 56 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of weekdays and weekends in 8 weeks:**
   - Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.
   \[
   \text{Weekdays in 8 weeks} = 8 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ weekdays/week} = 40 \text{ weekdays}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weekends in 8 weeks} = 8 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ weekend days/week} = 16 \text{ weekend days}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekdays:**
   - Candy rents out 60 chairs each weekday.
   \[
   \text{Chairs rented on weekdays} = 40 \text{ weekdays} \times 60 \text{ chairs/weekday} = 2400 \text{ chairs}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekends:**
   - Candy rents out 100 chairs each weekend day.
   \[
   \text{Chairs rented on weekends} = 16 \text{ weekend days} \times 100 \text{ chairs/weekend day} = 1600 \text{ chairs}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:**
   \[
   \text{Total chairs rented} = \text{Chairs rented on weekdays} + \text{Chairs rented on weekends}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total chairs rented} = 2400 \text{ chairs} + 1600 \text{ chairs} = 4000 \text{ chairs}
   \]

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is **4000 chairs**.
