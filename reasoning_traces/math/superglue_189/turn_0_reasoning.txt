==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 189" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day. The profit from selling one Type A widget is $5, and the profit from selling one Type B widget is $8. The company wants to maximize its profit, but it must produce at least 20 Type A widgets and at least 10 Type B widgets each day. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up the Constraints:**
   - The total number of widgets produced cannot exceed 100: 
     \[
     x + y \leq 100
     \]
   - At least 20 Type A widgets must be produced:
     \[
     x \geq 20
     \]
   - At least 10 Type B widgets must be produced:
     \[
     y \geq 10
     \]

3. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = 5x + 8y
     \]
   - We want to maximize \( P \).

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the lines \( x + y = 100 \), \( x = 20 \), and \( y = 10 \) on a graph.
   - Identify the feasible region that satisfies all constraints.

5. **Find the Vertices of the Feasible Region:**
   - The intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( x = 20 \) gives the point \( (20, 80) \).
   - The intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( y = 10 \) gives the point \( (90, 10) \).
   - The intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( y = 10 \) gives the point \( (20, 10) \).

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - At \( (20, 80) \): 
     \[
     P = 5(20) + 8(80) = 100 + 640 = 740
     \]
   - At \( (90, 10) \): 
     \[
     P = 5(90) + 8(10) = 450 + 80 = 530
     \]
   - At \( (20, 10) \): 
     \[
     P = 5(20) + 8(10) = 100 + 80 = 180
     \]

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit of 740 occurs at the point \( (20, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 20 Type A widgets and 80 Type B widgets per day, resulting in a maximum profit of $740.
