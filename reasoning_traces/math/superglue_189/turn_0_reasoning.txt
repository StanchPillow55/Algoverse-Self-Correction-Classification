==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 189" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. In one month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and made $29,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The total number of widgets sold is 500. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - The total revenue from selling the widgets is $29,000. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 29000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 500 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   50x + 70y &= 29000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 500 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   50x + 70(500 - x) = 29000
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   50x + 35000 - 70x = 29000
   \]
   \[
   -20x + 35000 = 29000
   \]
   \[
   -20x = 29000 - 35000
   \]
   \[
   -20x = -6000
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{-6000}{-20}
   \]
   \[
   x = 300
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 300 \) back into the expression for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 500 - 300
   \]
   \[
   y = 200
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**

   The company sold 300 Type A widgets and 200 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 300 Type A widgets and 200 Type B widgets.
