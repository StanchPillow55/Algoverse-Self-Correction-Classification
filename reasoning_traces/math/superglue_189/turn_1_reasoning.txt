==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 189" might entail. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is 20 meters longer than its width. The area of the field is 1120 square meters. What are the dimensions of the field?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the field in meters.
   - Then the length of the field will be \( w + 20 \) meters.

2. **Write the Equation for Area:**
   - The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
     \]
   - Substituting the given values, we have:
     \[
     1120 = (w + 20) \times w
     \]

3. **Expand and Rearrange the Equation:**
   - Expanding the right side of the equation gives:
     \[
     1120 = w^2 + 20w
     \]
   - Rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:
     \[
     w^2 + 20w - 1120 = 0
     \]

4. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 20 \), and \( c = -1120 \):
     \[
     w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = 20^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-1120) = 400 + 4480 = 4880
     \]
   - Find the square root of the discriminant:
     \[
     \sqrt{4880} \approx 69.83
     \]
   - Substitute back into the quadratic formula:
     \[
     w = \frac{-20 \pm 69.83}{2}
     \]
   - This gives two potential solutions for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{-20 + 69.83}{2} \approx 24.915
     \]
     \[
     w = \frac{-20 - 69.83}{2} \approx -44.915
     \]

5. **Select the Valid Solution:**
   - Since a width cannot be negative, we discard \( w \approx -44.915 \).
   - Therefore, the width \( w \approx 24.915 \) meters.

6. **Calculate the Length:**
   - Using the width to find the length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = w + 20 \approx 24.915 + 20 = 44.915 \text{ meters}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the field are approximately 24.915 meters in width and 44.915 meters in length.
