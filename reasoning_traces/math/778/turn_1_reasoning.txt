Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit he picked and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate the cost of peaches:**
   - Price per pound of peaches = $2.00
   - Pounds of peaches picked = 6
   - Total cost for peaches = Price per pound × Pounds picked
   \[
   \text{Total cost for peaches} = 2.00 \times 6 = 12.00
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of plums:**
   - Price per pound of plums = $1.00
   - Pounds of plums picked = 8
   - Total cost for plums = Price per pound × Pounds picked
   \[
   \text{Total cost for plums} = 1.00 \times 8 = 8.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of apricots:**
   - Price per pound of apricots = $3.00
   - Pounds of apricots picked = 6
   - Total cost for apricots = Price per pound × Pounds picked
   \[
   \text{Total cost for apricots} = 3.00 \times 6 = 18.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Total cost for peaches + Total cost for plums + Total cost for apricots
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 12.00 + 8.00 + 18.00 = 38.00
   \]

Thus, Winston spent a total of **$38.00** on fruit.

Final Answer: **$38.00**
