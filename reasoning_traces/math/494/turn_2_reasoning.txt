To solve the problem, we need to determine how much the smaller house (5,200 sq. ft.) is being expanded by, given that the total square footage of both houses after the expansion is 16,000 sq. ft.

Let's denote the amount by which the smaller house is expanded as \( x \) (in square feet).

1. **Calculate the new square footage of the smaller house:**
   The original square footage of the smaller house is 5,200 sq. ft. After the expansion, its new square footage will be:
   \[
   5,200 + x
   \]

2. **Calculate the total square footage of both houses after the expansion:**
   The larger house has a square footage of 7,300 sq. ft. Therefore, the total square footage of both houses after the expansion will be:
   \[
   (5,200 + x) + 7,300
   \]

3. **Set up the equation for the total square footage:**
   We know that the total square footage of both houses after the expansion is 16,000 sq. ft. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   (5,200 + x) + 7,300 = 16,000
   \]

4. **Combine like terms:**
   First, we can combine the constant terms on the left side:
   \[
   5,200 + 7,300 = 12,500
   \]
   So the equation simplifies to:
   \[
   12,500 + x = 16,000
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   To isolate \( x \), we subtract 12,500 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x = 16,000 - 12,500
   \]
   \[
   x = 3,500
   \]

Thus, the smaller house is being expanded by **3,500 sq. ft.** 

**Final Answer:**
The smaller house is being expanded by **3,500 sq. ft.**
