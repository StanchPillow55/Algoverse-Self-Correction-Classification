To solve the problem, we need to determine how much the smaller house (5,200 sq. ft.) is being expanded by, given that the total square footage of both houses after the expansion is 16,000 sq. ft.

1. **Identify the current square footage of both houses:**
   - Smaller house: 5,200 sq. ft.
   - Larger house: 7,300 sq. ft.

2. **Calculate the current total square footage of both houses:**
   \[
   \text{Current total square footage} = \text{Smaller house} + \text{Larger house} = 5,200 + 7,300 = 12,500 \text{ sq. ft.}
   \]

3. **Determine the new total square footage after the expansion:**
   - New total square footage = 16,000 sq. ft.

4. **Calculate the increase in total square footage:**
   \[
   \text{Increase in total square footage} = \text{New total square footage} - \text{Current total square footage}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Increase in total square footage} = 16,000 - 12,500 = 3,500 \text{ sq. ft.}
   \]

5. **Determine how much the smaller house is being expanded:**
   Since the problem states that the smaller house is being expanded, we can assume that the entire increase in total square footage (3,500 sq. ft.) is added to the smaller house.

Thus, the smaller house is being expanded by:
\[
\text{Expansion of smaller house} = 3,500 \text{ sq. ft.}
\]

6. **Final answer:**
The smaller house is being expanded by **3,500 sq. ft.**
