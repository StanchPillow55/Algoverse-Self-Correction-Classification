Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much the smaller house is being expanded by, given the new total square footage of both houses.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Initial Square Footage of Each House:**
   - The smaller house has an initial square footage of 5,200 sq. ft.
   - The larger house has an initial square footage of 7,300 sq. ft.

2. **Calculate the Initial Total Square Footage of Both Houses:**
   \[
   \text{Initial total square footage} = 5,200 \, \text{sq. ft.} + 7,300 \, \text{sq. ft.} = 12,500 \, \text{sq. ft.}
   \]

3. **Determine the New Total Square Footage After Expansion:**
   - We are given that the new total square footage of both houses is 16,000 sq. ft.

4. **Calculate the Increase in Total Square Footage:**
   \[
   \text{Increase in total square footage} = 16,000 \, \text{sq. ft.} - 12,500 \, \text{sq. ft.} = 3,500 \, \text{sq. ft.}
   \]

5. **Determine How Much the Smaller House is Being Expanded:**
   - Since the problem states that the smaller house is being expanded, the entire increase in square footage (3,500 sq. ft.) is attributed to the expansion of the smaller house.

Therefore, the smaller house is being expanded by 3,500 sq. ft.

**Final Answer:**
The smaller house is being expanded by 3,500 sq. ft.
