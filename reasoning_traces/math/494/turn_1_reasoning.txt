==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much the smaller house (5,200 sq. ft.) is being expanded by, given that the total square footage of both houses after the expansion is 16,000 sq. ft.

### Step 1: Define the variables
Let:
- \( S \) = original size of the smaller house = 5,200 sq. ft.
- \( L \) = original size of the larger house = 7,300 sq. ft.
- \( E \) = the amount by which the smaller house is expanded (in sq. ft.)

### Step 2: Set up the equation
After the expansion, the new size of the smaller house will be \( S + E \). The size of the larger house remains the same at \( L \).

The total square footage of both houses after the expansion is given as 16,000 sq. ft. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(S + E) + L = 16,000
\]

### Step 3: Substitute the known values
Substituting the known values of \( S \) and \( L \):

\[
(5,200 + E) + 7,300 = 16,000
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the equation
Now, combine the constants on the left side:

\[
5,200 + 7,300 + E = 16,000
\]

Calculating \( 5,200 + 7,300 \):

\[
12,500 + E = 16,000
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( E \)
To find \( E \), we need to isolate it:

\[
E = 16,000 - 12,500
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
E = 3,500
\]

### Conclusion
The smaller house is being expanded by **3,500 sq. ft.** 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3,500}
\]
