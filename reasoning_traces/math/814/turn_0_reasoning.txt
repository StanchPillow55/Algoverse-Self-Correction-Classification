To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Jack and his friends spend on playing games at the arcade over a period of 4 hours. We will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the playing time for each person

1. **Jack**: 
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
   - In 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, we can calculate how many quarters Jack uses:
     \[
     \text{Number of quarters Jack uses} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters}
     \]

2. **Friend 1 (significantly worse)**:
   - This friend can only play half as long as Jack. Therefore, they can play for:
     \[
     \text{Playing time} = \frac{20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - In 4 hours (240 minutes), the number of quarters this friend uses is:
     \[
     \text{Number of quarters} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters}
     \]

3. **Friend 2 (significantly worse)**:
   - This friend also plays for half as long as Jack, so they also play for 10 minutes.
   - The number of quarters this friend uses is the same as Friend 1:
     \[
     \text{Number of quarters} = 24 \text{ quarters}
     \]

4. **Friend 3 (significantly better)**:
   - This friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack. Therefore, they can play for:
     \[
     \text{Playing time} = 20 \text{ minutes} \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - In 4 hours (240 minutes), the number of quarters this friend uses is:
     \[
     \text{Number of quarters} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of quarters used

Now we will sum the number of quarters used by all four players:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Friend 1: 24 quarters
- Friend 2: 24 quarters
- Friend 3: 8 quarters

Total quarters used:
\[
\text{Total quarters} = 12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money spent

Each quarter is worth $0.25. Therefore, the total amount of money spent can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Total money spent} = \text{Total quarters} \times 0.25 = 68 \times 0.25 = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of money used by Jack and his friends to play games at the arcade for 4 hours is:
\[
\boxed{17 \text{ dollars}}
\]
