==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Jack and his friends spend on playing games at the arcade over a period of 4 hours. We will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the playing time for each person

1. **Jack's playing time**:
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
   - In 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, we can calculate how many quarters Jack uses:
     \[
     \text{Number of quarters Jack uses} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters}
     \]

2. **Friend 1's playing time** (significantly worse):
   - This friend can only play half as long as Jack, which means:
     \[
     \text{Playing time} = \frac{20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - The number of quarters this friend uses in 4 hours:
     \[
     \text{Number of quarters Friend 1 uses} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters}
     \]

3. **Friend 2's playing time** (also significantly worse):
   - This friend has the same playing time as Friend 1, so:
     \[
     \text{Number of quarters Friend 2 uses} = 24 \text{ quarters}
     \]

4. **Friend 3's playing time** (significantly better):
   - This friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack:
     \[
     \text{Playing time} = 20 \text{ minutes} \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - The number of quarters this friend uses in 4 hours:
     \[
     \text{Number of quarters Friend 3 uses} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of quarters used

Now we can sum the number of quarters used by each player:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Friend 1: 24 quarters
- Friend 2: 24 quarters
- Friend 3: 8 quarters

Total quarters used:
\[
\text{Total quarters} = 12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}
\]

### Step 3: Convert quarters to dollars

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we can convert the total number of quarters to dollars:
\[
\text{Total money used} = 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of money used by Jack and his friends at the arcade is:
\[
\boxed{17 \text{ dollars}}
\]
