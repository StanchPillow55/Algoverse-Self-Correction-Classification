==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 207" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I will assume that "Sample reasoning question 207" refers to a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations.

Let's assume a hypothetical problem for demonstration purposes:

**Problem:** A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. A customer buys a total of 10 fruits, spending exactly $25. How many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

To solve this problem, we will use a system of equations. Let's define:
- \( a \) as the number of apples
- \( o \) as the number of oranges

We have two pieces of information that can be translated into equations:
1. The total number of fruits is 10:
   \[
   a + o = 10
   \]

2. The total cost is $25:
   \[
   2a + 3o = 25
   \]

Now, we will solve this system of equations.

**Step 1: Solve the first equation for one variable.**

From the first equation:
\[
a + o = 10 \implies a = 10 - o
\]

**Step 2: Substitute the expression for \( a \) into the second equation.**

Substitute \( a = 10 - o \) into the second equation:
\[
2(10 - o) + 3o = 25
\]

**Step 3: Simplify and solve for \( o \).**

Distribute the 2:
\[
20 - 2o + 3o = 25
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
20 + o = 25
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
o = 5
\]

**Step 4: Substitute back to find \( a \).**

Substitute \( o = 5 \) back into the equation \( a = 10 - o \):
\[
a = 10 - 5 = 5
\]

**Conclusion:**

The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.
