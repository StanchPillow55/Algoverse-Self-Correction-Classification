==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 207" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that involves logical reasoning. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"207 people are attending a conference. Each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. How many handshakes occur in total?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have 207 people.
   - Each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once.
   - We need to find the total number of handshakes.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The problem of finding the number of handshakes can be solved using combinations.
   - The formula for combinations is given by \( C(n, 2) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), where \( n \) is the total number of people.
   - This formula calculates the number of ways to choose 2 people out of \( n \) to form a handshake.

3. **Apply the Formula:**
   - Here, \( n = 207 \).
   - Plug \( n \) into the formula: 
     \[
     C(207, 2) = \frac{207 \times 206}{2}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - First, calculate \( 207 \times 206 \):
     \[
     207 \times 206 = 42642
     \]
   - Then, divide by 2 to find the number of handshakes:
     \[
     \frac{42642}{2} = 21321
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The total number of handshakes that occur is 21,321.

**Final Answer:**

The total number of handshakes that occur is 21,321.
