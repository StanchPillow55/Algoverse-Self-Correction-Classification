Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 5" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a hypothetical problem for demonstration purposes:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the area of a right triangle with a base of 6 units and a height of 8 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a right triangle.
   - We are given the base (b) = 6 units and the height (h) = 8 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**
   - The area \( A \) of a triangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   - Substitute \( b = 6 \) and \( h = 8 \) into the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 8
     \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - First, multiply the base and height:
     \[
     6 \times 8 = 48
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the right triangle is 24 square units.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the right triangle. This approach can be applied to a variety of math problems by identifying the relevant formulas and systematically working through the calculations. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help!
