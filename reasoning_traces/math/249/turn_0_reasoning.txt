==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many dandelion puffs Caleb had left after giving some away, and then divide the remaining puffs equally among his 3 friends. Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Count of Dandelion Puffs:**
   Caleb originally picked 40 dandelion puffs.

2. **Dandelion Puffs Given Away:**
   - Caleb gave 3 puffs to his mom.
   - He gave another 3 puffs to his sister.
   - He gave 5 puffs to his grandmother.
   - He gave 2 puffs to his dog.

   To find out how many puffs he gave away in total, we add these numbers together:
   \[
   3 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 13
   \]

3. **Remaining Dandelion Puffs:**
   To find out how many puffs Caleb had left after giving some away, we subtract the total number of puffs given away from the original number of puffs:
   \[
   40 - 13 = 27
   \]

4. **Dividing the Remaining Puffs Among Friends:**
   Caleb has 27 dandelion puffs left, and he wants to divide them equally among his 3 friends. To find out how many puffs each friend receives, we divide the remaining puffs by the number of friends:
   \[
   \frac{27}{3} = 9
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   Each of Caleb's friends receives 9 dandelion puffs.

Therefore, the final answer is that each friend received 9 dandelion puffs.
