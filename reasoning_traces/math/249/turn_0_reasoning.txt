==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of dandelion puffs Caleb originally picked.**
   - Caleb picked a total of 40 dandelion puffs.

2. **Calculate the total number of dandelion puffs given away.**
   - Caleb gave away:
     - 3 to his mom
     - 3 to his sister
     - 5 to his grandmother
     - 2 to his dog
   - We can add these amounts together:
     \[
     3 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 13
     \]
   - So, Caleb gave away a total of 13 dandelion puffs.

3. **Calculate the number of dandelion puffs remaining after giving some away.**
   - To find the remaining dandelion puffs, we subtract the number given away from the original total:
     \[
     40 - 13 = 27
     \]
   - Therefore, Caleb has 27 dandelion puffs left.

4. **Divide the remaining dandelion puffs equally among his 3 friends.**
   - To find out how many dandelion puffs each friend receives, we divide the remaining puffs by the number of friends:
     \[
     \frac{27}{3} = 9
     \]
   - Each friend receives 9 dandelion puffs.

5. **State the final answer.**
   - Each friend received **9 dandelion puffs**.

Thus, the final answer is that each friend received **9 dandelion puffs**.
