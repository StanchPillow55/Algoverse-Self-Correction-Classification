To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cookies Sue and her sister ate on each day.**

   - **Sister's Cookies:**
     - On Monday, the sister ate 5 cookies.
     - On Tuesday, the sister ate 13 cookies.

   - **Sue's Cookies:**
     - On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister.
       \[
       \text{Sue's cookies on Monday} = 4 \times \text{Sister's cookies on Monday} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies}
       \]
     - On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister.
       \[
       \text{Sue's cookies on Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Sister's cookies on Tuesday} = 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies}
       \]

2. **Calculate the total number of cookies eaten by Sue and her sister over the two days.**

   - **Total Cookies for the Sister:**
     \[
     \text{Total cookies for sister} = \text{Monday cookies} + \text{Tuesday cookies} = 5 + 13 = 18 \text{ cookies}
     \]

   - **Total Cookies for Sue:**
     \[
     \text{Total cookies for Sue} = \text{Monday cookies} + \text{Tuesday cookies} = 20 + 26 = 46 \text{ cookies}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total calories consumed by each person.**

   - Each cookie has 200 calories.
   - **Calories for the Sister:**
     \[
     \text{Calories for sister} = \text{Total cookies for sister} \times 200 = 18 \times 200 = 3600 \text{ calories}
     \]

   - **Calories for Sue:**
     \[
     \text{Calories for Sue} = \text{Total cookies for Sue} \times 200 = 46 \times 200 = 9200 \text{ calories}
     \]

4. **Determine how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister.**

   \[
   \text{Difference in calories} = \text{Calories for Sue} - \text{Calories for sister} = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 \text{ calories}
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   Sue consumed **5600 more calories** than her sister.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5600}
\]
