==================================================

To solve the problem, we start by using the given ratio of men to women, which is 5:9. This means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women.

1. **Determine the total parts in the ratio**:
   The total parts in the ratio of men to women is:
   \[
   5 + 9 = 14 \text{ parts}
   \]

2. **Calculate the value of one part**:
   Since the total number of passengers on the bus is 84, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total number of passengers by the total parts:
   \[
   \text{Value of one part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of men and women**:
   Now we can find the number of men and women using the value of one part:
   - Number of men:
   \[
   \text{Number of men} = 5 \times 6 = 30
   \]
   - Number of women:
   \[
   \text{Number of women} = 9 \times 6 = 54
   \]

4. **Determine how many women remain after 20 women alight**:
   Initially, there are 54 women on the bus. If 20 women alight, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women:
   \[
   \text{Remaining women} = 54 - 20 = 34
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   The number of women that have remained on the bus after 20 women alight is:
   \[
   \boxed{34}
   \]
