==================================================

To find out how many beads Adrianne has altogether, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from her mother, sister, and friend, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Beads from Mother**: 
   Adrianne received 20 metallic beads from her mother.
   \[
   \text{Beads from Mother} = 20
   \]

2. **Beads from Sister**: 
   Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, we can calculate the number of beads from her sister as follows:
   \[
   \text{Beads from Sister} = \text{Beads from Mother} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

3. **Beads from Friend**: 
   Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave. Therefore, we calculate the number of beads from her friend as:
   \[
   \text{Beads from Friend} = 2 \times \text{Beads from Mother} = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

4. **Total Beads**: 
   Now, we can find the total number of beads by adding the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:
   \[
   \text{Total Beads} = \text{Beads from Mother} + \text{Beads from Sister} + \text{Beads from Friend}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total Beads} = 20 + 30 + 40
   \]

5. **Calculating the Total**:
   \[
   \text{Total Beads} = 20 + 30 = 50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Beads} = 50 + 40 = 90
   \]

Thus, the total number of beads Adrianne has altogether is:
\[
\boxed{90}
\]
