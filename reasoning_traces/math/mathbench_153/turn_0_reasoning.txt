==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 153" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a sample math problem with the number 153 and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Determine if the number 153 is an Armstrong number.

**Definition:**

An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

**Steps to Solve:**

1. **Identify the number of digits in 153:**

   The number 153 has 3 digits.

2. **Break down the number into its individual digits:**

   The digits in 153 are 1, 5, and 3.

3. **Raise each digit to the power of the number of digits (3 in this case):**

   - \(1^3 = 1\)
   - \(5^3 = 125\)
   - \(3^3 = 27\)

4. **Calculate the sum of these powers:**

   \[
   1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
   \]

5. **Compare the sum to the original number:**

   The sum of the cubes of the digits is 153, which is equal to the original number.

**Conclusion:**

Since the sum of the cubes of its digits equals the original number, 153 is indeed an Armstrong number.

**Final Answer:**

153 is an Armstrong number.
