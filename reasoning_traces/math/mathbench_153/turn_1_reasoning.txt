Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 153," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 153" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "153" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 153:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To isolate the term with \( x \), we first need to eliminate the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   Now, to solve for \( x \), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3:

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
