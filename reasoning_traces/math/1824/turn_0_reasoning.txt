To find the total number of food items donated by the five companies, we will calculate the donations from each company step by step.

1. **Foster Farms**:
   - Foster Farms donated 45 dressed chickens.
   - **Donation from Foster Farms**: 45 chickens.

2. **American Summits**:
   - American Summits donated twice the number of bottled water than the number of dressed chickens donated by Foster Farms.
   - Since Foster Farms donated 45 chickens, American Summits donated:
     \[
     2 \times 45 = 90 \text{ bottles of water}
     \]
   - **Donation from American Summits**: 90 bottles of water.

3. **Hormel**:
   - Hormel donated three times the number of dressed chickens that Foster Farms donated.
   - Therefore, Hormel donated:
     \[
     3 \times 45 = 135 \text{ dressed chickens}
     \]
   - **Donation from Hormel**: 135 chickens.

4. **Boudin Butchers**:
   - Boudin Butchers donated one-third of the number of dressed chickens that Hormel donated.
   - Since Hormel donated 135 chickens, Boudin Butchers donated:
     \[
     \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ dressed chickens}
     \]
   - **Donation from Boudin Butchers**: 45 chickens.

5. **Del Monte Foods**:
   - Del Monte Foods donated 30 fewer bottles of water than American Summits.
   - Since American Summits donated 90 bottles of water, Del Monte Foods donated:
     \[
     90 - 30 = 60 \text{ bottles of water}
     \]
   - **Donation from Del Monte Foods**: 60 bottles of water.

Now, we will sum all the donations to find the total number of food items donated:

- Total chickens donated:
  \[
  45 \text{ (Foster Farms)} + 135 \text{ (Hormel)} + 45 \text{ (Boudin Butchers)} = 225 \text{ chickens}
  \]

- Total bottles of water donated:
  \[
  90 \text{ (American Summits)} + 60 \text{ (Del Monte Foods)} = 150 \text{ bottles of water}
  \]

Finally, we add the total number of chickens and bottles of water to get the total number of food items donated:
\[
225 \text{ (chickens)} + 150 \text{ (bottles of water)} = 375 \text{ food items}
\]

Thus, the total number of food items donated by the companies is:
\[
\boxed{375}
\]
