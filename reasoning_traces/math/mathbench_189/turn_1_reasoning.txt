==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 189" refers to. Since no specific details about the problem are provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 189" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's how we can approach it:

**Problem Statement:**
Solve the quadratic equation: \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the quadratic equation:**
   The given equation is \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\). This is a standard quadratic equation in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

2. **Check if the equation can be simplified:**
   We can simplify the equation by dividing all terms by 2 (the greatest common factor):
   \[
   \frac{2x^2}{2} - \frac{4x}{2} - \frac{6}{2} = 0 \Rightarrow x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
   \]

3. **Factor the quadratic equation:**
   We need to find two numbers that multiply to \(-3\) (the constant term) and add to \(-2\) (the coefficient of the linear term). These numbers are \(-3\) and \(1\).

   Therefore, we can factor the equation as:
   \[
   (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for \(x\) using the zero-product property:**
   According to the zero-product property, if the product of two factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. Thus, we set each factor equal to zero and solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 1 = 0
   \]

   Solving these equations gives:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]

5. **Verify the solutions:**
   Substitute \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\) back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it.

   - For \(x = 3\):
     \[
     2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
     \]
     This checks out.

   - For \(x = -1\):
     \[
     2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
     \]
     This also checks out.

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
