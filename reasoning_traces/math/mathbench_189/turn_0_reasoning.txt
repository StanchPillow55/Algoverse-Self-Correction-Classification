==================================================

It seems like you have referenced "Sample math problem 189," but without additional context or details about the specific problem, I can't provide a solution. However, I can guide you on how to approach solving a math problem step by step. If you can provide the specific details of the problem, I can offer a more tailored solution. Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

### General Steps for Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given information or constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Determine the type of problem (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Choose an appropriate strategy (e.g., drawing a diagram, writing an equation, using a formula).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps of your chosen strategy.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and signs.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your calculations.
   - Ensure your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Double-check your final answer.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's solve a sample problem for illustration:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We will isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).

If you provide the specific details of "Sample math problem 189," I can apply this structured approach to solve it.
