Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many plums Tanya originally bought. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of each type of fruit Tanya bought:**
   - Pears: 6
   - Granny Smith apples: 4
   - Pineapples: 2
   - Plums: Let's denote the number of plums as \( x \).

2. **Calculate the total number of fruits Tanya initially had:**
   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = 6 \, (\text{pears}) + 4 \, (\text{apples}) + 2 \, (\text{pineapples}) + x \, (\text{plums}) = 12 + x
   \]

3. **Understand what happened as Tanya walked home:**
   - Half of the fruit fell out of the bag. Therefore, the number of fruits that fell out is half of the total number of fruits.
   - The number of fruits that remained in the bag is 9.

4. **Set up the equation based on the information given:**
   - If half of the fruits fell out, then the other half remained in the bag. Thus, the number of fruits remaining in the bag is:
   \[
   \frac{12 + x}{2} = 9
   \]

5. **Solve the equation for \( x \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   12 + x = 18
   \]
   - Subtract 12 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 18 - 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

Therefore, Tanya originally bought 6 plums.

**Final Answer: Tanya bought 6 plums.**
