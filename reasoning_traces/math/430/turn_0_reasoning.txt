==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many plums Tanya bought based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the total number of fruits Tanya bought:**
   - Pears: 6
   - Granny Smith apples: 4
   - Pineapples: 2
   - Plums: Let \( p \) represent the number of plums.

   The total number of fruits Tanya bought can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = 6 + 4 + 2 + p = 12 + p
   \]

2. **Determine how many fruits fell out of the bag:**
   According to the problem, half of the fruit fell out of the bag. Therefore, the number of fruits that fell out is:
   \[
   \text{Fruits that fell out} = \frac{1}{2} \times (12 + p) = \frac{12 + p}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many fruits remained in the bag:**
   After half of the fruits fell out, the number of fruits remaining in the bag is:
   \[
   \text{Fruits remaining} = (12 + p) - \frac{12 + p}{2}
   \]
   To simplify this, we can rewrite it as:
   \[
   \text{Fruits remaining} = \frac{2(12 + p)}{2} - \frac{12 + p}{2} = \frac{2(12 + p) - (12 + p)}{2} = \frac{(2 \times 12 + 2p - 12 - p)}{2} = \frac{12 + p}{2}
   \]

4. **Set the remaining fruits equal to the number given in the problem:**
   We know from the problem that there were 9 pieces of fruit remaining in the bag. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{12 + p}{2} = 9
   \]

5. **Solve for \( p \):**
   To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   12 + p = 18
   \]
   Now, isolate \( p \) by subtracting 12 from both sides:
   \[
   p = 18 - 12 = 6
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   Tanya bought 6 plums.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
