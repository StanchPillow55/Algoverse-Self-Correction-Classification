To determine how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for in order to make a total of $135, we can break the problem down into steps.

1. **Calculate the total income from selling eggplants:**
   Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each. We can calculate the total income from the eggplants as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total income from eggplants} = \text{Number of eggplants} \times \text{Price per eggplant}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total income from eggplants} = 20 \times 3 = 60
   \]

   So, Bennet makes $60 from selling the eggplants.

2. **Determine how much more money Bennet needs to reach his goal:**
   Bennet wants to make a total of $135. We can find out how much more he needs after selling the eggplants:

   \[
   \text{Amount needed from corn} = \text{Total desired income} - \text{Income from eggplants}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount needed from corn} = 135 - 60 = 75
   \]

   Therefore, Bennet needs to make $75 from selling the ears of corn.

3. **Calculate the price per ear of corn:**
   Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we can use the following formula:

   \[
   \text{Price per ear of corn} = \frac{\text{Amount needed from corn}}{\text{Number of ears of corn}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price per ear of corn} = \frac{75}{25} = 3
   \]

   Thus, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

4. **Final answer:**
   Bennet should sell each ear of corn for **$3**.
