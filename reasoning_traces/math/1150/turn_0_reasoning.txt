==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Roses**: Patricia starts with 30 roses.

   \[
   \text{Initial Roses} = 30
   \]

2. **Roses Given to Mother**: Patricia gives 24 roses to her mother. We need to subtract the number of roses she gave away from her initial amount.

   \[
   \text{Roses after giving to mother} = \text{Initial Roses} - \text{Roses Given to Mother}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Roses after giving to mother} = 30 - 24 = 6
   \]

3. **Roses Bought**: After giving away the roses, Patricia buys 15 more roses. We need to add the number of roses she bought to the number of roses she has left after giving some to her mother.

   \[
   \text{Total Roses Now} = \text{Roses after giving to mother} + \text{Roses Bought}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Roses Now} = 6 + 15 = 21
   \]

4. **Final Count**: After performing the calculations, we find that Patricia now has 21 roses.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{21}
\]
