Let \( x \) be the total number of gumballs Hector purchased.

1. **Gumballs given to Todd**: Hector gave 4 gumballs to Todd.
   \[
   \text{Gumballs left after giving to Todd} = x - 4
   \]

2. **Gumballs given to Alisha**: Hector gave twice as many gumballs to Alisha as he gave to Todd. Since he gave Todd 4 gumballs, he gave Alisha:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ gumballs}
   \]
   Now, we calculate how many gumballs Hector has left after giving to Alisha:
   \[
   \text{Gumballs left after giving to Alisha} = (x - 4) - 8 = x - 12
   \]

3. **Gumballs given to Bobby**: Hector gave Bobby 5 less than four times the number of gumballs he gave to Alisha. Since he gave Alisha 8 gumballs, he gave Bobby:
   \[
   4 \times 8 - 5 = 32 - 5 = 27 \text{ gumballs}
   \]
   Now, we calculate how many gumballs Hector has left after giving to Bobby:
   \[
   \text{Gumballs left after giving to Bobby} = (x - 12) - 27 = x - 39
   \]

4. **Remaining gumballs**: According to the problem, Hector had 6 gumballs remaining after giving gumballs to Todd, Alisha, and Bobby. Therefore, we set up the equation:
   \[
   x - 39 = 6
   \]

5. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x - 39 = 6 \\
   x = 6 + 39 \\
   x = 45
   \]

Thus, the total number of gumballs that Hector purchased is \( \boxed{45} \).
