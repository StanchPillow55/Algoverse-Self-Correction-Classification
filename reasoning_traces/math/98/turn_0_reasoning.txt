Question ID: 98
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Hector gave 4 gumballs to Todd.

He then gave twice as many as he had given Todd to Alisha. This means he gave 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 gumballs to Alisha.

He then gave 5 less than four times as many to Bobby as he had given to Alisha. This means he gave 4 * 8 - 5 = <<4*8-5=27>>27 gumballs to Bobby.

In the end, Hector had 6 gumballs remaining.

To find the total number of gumballs that Hector purchased, we add up all the gumballs he gave away and the ones he has left. This gives us 4 (Todd) + 8 (Alisha) + 27 (Bobby) + 6 (remaining) = <<4+8+27+6=45>>45 gumballs.

Therefore, Hector purchased a total of 45 gumballs.
