==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the information given step by step.

1. **Understanding the Initial Situation**:
   - There are originally 30 cars on the motorway.

2. **Cars that Exit**:
   - 5 cars take an exit to avoid the traffic jam. 
   - Therefore, the number of cars remaining in the traffic jam after these cars exit is:
     \[
     30 - 5 = 25 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. **Cars Driving Through**:
   - We know that some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes, and then 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam.
   - Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

4. **Total Cars Driving Through**:
   - The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the second 15 minutes:
     \[
     x + 20
     \]

5. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - Since there are 25 cars remaining after the 5 cars exited, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam cannot exceed the number of cars that were left in the jam. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     x + 20 \leq 25
     \]

6. **Solving the Inequality**:
   - To find the maximum number of cars that could have driven through in the first 15 minutes, we can solve the inequality:
     \[
     x + 20 \leq 25
     \]
     Subtracting 20 from both sides gives:
     \[
     x \leq 25 - 20
     \]
     \[
     x \leq 5
     \]

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The maximum number of cars that could have driven through in the first 15 minutes is 5. Since we are not given any additional constraints or information that would suggest fewer cars drove through, we can conclude that the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is:
     \[
     \boxed{5}
     \] 

Thus, the final answer is that 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.
