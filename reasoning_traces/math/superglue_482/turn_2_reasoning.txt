==================================================

To solve a problem effectively, it's crucial to understand the question and break it down into manageable parts. However, the problem you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 482," lacks specific details or context. Therefore, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving a typical math problem, which you can apply to various scenarios.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify what is being asked. Look for keywords that indicate operations or relationships.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations and ensure all parts of the problem have been addressed.

### Example Problem:

Let's apply this approach to a hypothetical math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- To isolate \( x \), we can perform inverse operations to simplify the equation.

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. Start with the equation: 
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

By following this structured approach, you can tackle a wide range of math problems systematically. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help!
