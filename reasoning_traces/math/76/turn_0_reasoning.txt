==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of vegetables produced in the garden, which includes potatoes, cucumbers, and peppers.

1. **Identify the number of potatoes**:
   The problem states that the garden produced 237 potatoes.

   \[
   \text{Potatoes} = 237
   \]

2. **Determine the number of cucumbers**:
   The problem states that there are 60 fewer cucumbers than potatoes. Therefore, we can calculate the number of cucumbers as follows:

   \[
   \text{Cucumbers} = \text{Potatoes} - 60 = 237 - 60 = 177
   \]

3. **Determine the number of peppers**:
   The problem states that there are twice as many peppers as cucumbers. We can calculate the number of peppers as follows:

   \[
   \text{Peppers} = 2 \times \text{Cucumbers} = 2 \times 177 = 354
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of vegetables**:
   Now that we have the number of potatoes, cucumbers, and peppers, we can find the total number of vegetables produced in the garden by adding these quantities together:

   \[
   \text{Total Vegetables} = \text{Potatoes} + \text{Cucumbers} + \text{Peppers}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Vegetables} = 237 + 177 + 354
   \]

   We can perform the addition step-by-step:

   - First, add potatoes and cucumbers:
     \[
     237 + 177 = 414
     \]

   - Now, add the result to the number of peppers:
     \[
     414 + 354 = 768
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   The total number of vegetables produced in the garden is:

   \[
   \boxed{768}
   \]
