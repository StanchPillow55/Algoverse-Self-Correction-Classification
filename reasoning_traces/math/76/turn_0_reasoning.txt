==================================================

The problem tells us that the garden produced 237 potatoes and 60 fewer cucumbers than potatoes. To find out how many cucumbers were produced, we subtract 60 from the number of potatoes:

237 potatoes - 60 = 177 cucumbers

The problem also tells us that the garden produced twice as many peppers as cucumbers. To find out how many peppers were produced, we multiply the number of cucumbers by 2:

177 cucumbers * 2 = 354 peppers

To find the total number of vegetables produced, we add the number of potatoes, cucumbers, and peppers:

237 potatoes + 177 cucumbers + 354 peppers = 768 vegetables

So, the garden produced 768 vegetables.
