==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many face masks Johnny bought based on the information provided about Mike's purchase.

1. **Identify how many masks Mike bought**:
   - According to the problem, Mike bought 5 face masks.

2. **Determine how many masks Johnny bought**:
   - The problem states that Johnny bought "2 more than thrice as many as Mike."
   - First, we need to calculate "thrice as many as Mike." Since Mike bought 5 masks, we calculate:
     \[
     3 \times 5 = 15
     \]
   - Now, we need to find "2 more than" this amount:
     \[
     15 + 2 = 17
     \]

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

Final answer: Johnny bought **17 face masks**.
