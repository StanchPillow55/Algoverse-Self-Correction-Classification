To solve the problem, we will calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values to find the total number of doorbell rings.

1. **First Friend**: 
   - The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
   \[
   \text{First Friend} = 20
   \]

2. **Second Friend**: 
   - The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend. 
   - To find how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell, we first calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the first friend's presses:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
   \]
   - Now, we add this to the first friend's presses:
   \[
   \text{Second Friend} = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Fourth Friend**: 
   - The problem states that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
   \[
   \text{Fourth Friend} = 60
   \]

4. **Third Friend**: 
   - The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
   - We calculate this by adding 10 to the number of times the fourth friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   \text{Third Friend} = 60 + 10 = 70
   \]

5. **Total Doorbell Rings**: 
   - Now we will sum the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{First Friend} + \text{Second Friend} + \text{Third Friend} + \text{Fourth Friend}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total} = 20 + 25 + 70 + 60
   \]

   - Performing the addition step-by-step:
   \[
   20 + 25 = 45
   \]
   \[
   45 + 70 = 115
   \]
   \[
   115 + 60 = 175
   \]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings made is:
\[
\boxed{175}
\]
