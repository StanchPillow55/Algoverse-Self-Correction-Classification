To solve the problem, we need to determine how many sales were made in the stationery section of the craft store, given the total sales and the proportions of sales in the other sections.

1. **Identify the total sales**: The total number of sales made today is given as 36.

2. **Calculate sales in the fabric section**: 
   - The craft store makes a third of its sales in the fabric section. 
   - To find the number of sales in the fabric section, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Sales in fabric} = \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
     \]

3. **Calculate sales in the jewelry section**: 
   - The craft store makes a quarter of its sales in the jewelry section.
   - To find the number of sales in the jewelry section, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Sales in jewelry} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
     \]

4. **Calculate total sales in fabric and jewelry sections**: 
   - Now we add the sales from the fabric and jewelry sections to find the total sales in these two sections:
     \[
     \text{Total sales in fabric and jewelry} = 12 + 9 = 21
     \]

5. **Calculate sales in the stationery section**: 
   - The rest of the sales are in the stationery section. To find the number of sales in the stationery section, we subtract the total sales in the fabric and jewelry sections from the total sales:
     \[
     \text{Sales in stationery} = \text{Total sales} - \text{Total sales in fabric and jewelry}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Sales in stationery} = 36 - 21 = 15
     \]

6. **Final answer**: The number of sales in the stationery section is:
   \[
   \boxed{15}
   \]
