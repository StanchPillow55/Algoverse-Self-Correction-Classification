==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sales were made in the stationery section of the craft store. We know the total sales and the proportions of sales made in the fabric and jewelry sections. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of sales:**
   The craft store made a total of 36 sales today.

2. **Determine the sales in the fabric section:**
   According to the problem, a third of the sales are made in the fabric section. Therefore, we calculate the number of sales in the fabric section as follows:
   \[
   \text{Sales in fabric section} = \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]

3. **Determine the sales in the jewelry section:**
   The problem states that a quarter of the sales are made in the jewelry section. We calculate the number of sales in the jewelry section as follows:
   \[
   \text{Sales in jewelry section} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
   \]

4. **Calculate the sales in the stationery section:**
   The rest of the sales are made in the stationery section. To find this, we subtract the sales in the fabric and jewelry sections from the total sales:
   \[
   \text{Sales in stationery section} = 36 - (\text{Sales in fabric section} + \text{Sales in jewelry section})
   \]
   Substitute the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Sales in stationery section} = 36 - (12 + 9) = 36 - 21 = 15
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   The number of sales made in the stationery section is 15.

Therefore, the craft store made 15 sales in the stationery section today.
