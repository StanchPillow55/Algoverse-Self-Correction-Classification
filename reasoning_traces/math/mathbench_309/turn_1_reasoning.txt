Question ID: mathbench_309
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 309" entails. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 309" is as follows:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x - 7 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   We have a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). The goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Start by getting all terms involving \( x \) on one side and constant terms on the other side. We can do this by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x - 7 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = -7
   \]

3. **Isolate \( x \):**
   Next, subtract 5 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = -7 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying further, we get:
   \[
   x = -12
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = -12 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(-12) + 5 = 2(-12) - 7
   \]
   Calculate each side:
   \[
   -36 + 5 = -24 - 7
   \]
   \[
   -31 = -31
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x - 7 \) is \( x = -12 \).
