==================================================

To determine how long it will take for the cell phone to fully charge from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the total percentage of charge needed to reach full charge.

1. **Calculate the percentage needed to reach full charge:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage needed} = 100\% - 60\% = 40\%
   \]

2. **Determine the charging rate:**
   The phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. This means that for every 3 minutes, the charge increases by 1%.

3. **Calculate the total time needed to charge 40%:**
   Since it takes 3 minutes to charge 1%, we can find the total time for 40% by multiplying the percentage needed by the time per percentage:
   \[
   \text{Total time (in minutes)} = 40\% \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Convert minutes to hours:**
   To convert minutes into hours, we divide the total minutes by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
   \[
   \text{Total time (in hours)} = \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, it will take **2 hours** for the phone to fully charge from 60% to 100%.

Final answer: **2 hours**.
