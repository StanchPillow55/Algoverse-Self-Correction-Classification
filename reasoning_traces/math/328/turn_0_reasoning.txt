To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of tires on the used car lot's vehicles, given the information about the number of cars and motorcycles.

### Step 1: Determine the number of motorcycles and cars.

We know that:
- The total number of vehicles (cars and motorcycles) is 24.
- A third of the vehicles are motorcycles.

Let's denote the number of motorcycles as \( M \) and the number of cars as \( C \).

From the problem, we have:
\[ M + C = 24 \]
\[ M = \frac{1}{3} \times 24 = 8 \]

Therefore, there are 8 motorcycles.

Using the total number of vehicles, we can find the number of cars:
\[ C = 24 - M = 24 - 8 = 16 \]

So, there are 16 cars.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of tires.

#### Motorcycles:
Each motorcycle has 2 tires. Therefore, the total number of tires from motorcycles is:
\[ 2 \times M = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

#### Cars:
Each car has 4 tires. Therefore, the total number of tires from cars is:
\[ 4 \times C = 4 \times 16 = 64 \]

Additionally, a quarter of the cars have a spare tire. Let's calculate the number of cars with a spare tire:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

Each of these 4 cars has an additional tire (the spare tire), so the total number of spare tires is:
\[ 1 \times 4 = 4 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of tires.

Add the tires from motorcycles, cars, and spare tires:
\[ \text{Total tires} = \text{Motorcycle tires} + \text{Car tires} + \text{Spare tires} \]
\[ \text{Total tires} = 16 + 64 + 4 = 84 \]

### Final Answer:
The total number of tires on the used car lotâ€™s vehicles is 84.
