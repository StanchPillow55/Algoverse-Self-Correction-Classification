==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of tires on the vehicles at the used car lot. We'll break this down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of motorcycles:**
   We know that there are 24 vehicles in total, and a third of these are motorcycles. 

   \[
   \text{Number of motorcycles} = \frac{1}{3} \times 24 = 8
   \]

2. **Determine the number of cars:**
   Since there are 24 vehicles in total and 8 of them are motorcycles, we can find the number of cars by subtracting the number of motorcycles from the total number of vehicles.

   \[
   \text{Number of cars} = 24 - 8 = 16
   \]

3. **Determine the number of cars with spare tires:**
   We are told that a quarter of the cars have a spare tire included. 

   \[
   \text{Number of cars with spare tires} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4
   \]

4. **Determine the total number of tires on the vehicles:**
   - Each motorcycle typically has 2 tires. Therefore, the total number of tires from motorcycles is:

   \[
   \text{Tires from motorcycles} = 8 \times 2 = 16
   \]

   - Each car typically has 4 tires. Therefore, the total number of tires from cars is:

   \[
   \text{Tires from cars} = 16 \times 4 = 64
   \]

   - Additionally, we need to account for the spare tires. We have 4 cars that come with a spare tire, which adds 1 extra tire for each of those cars:

   \[
   \text{Spare tires} = 4
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of tires:**
   Now we can sum the tires from motorcycles, cars, and spare tires:

   \[
   \text{Total tires} = \text{Tires from motorcycles} + \text{Tires from cars} + \text{Spare tires}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total tires} = 16 + 64 + 4 = 84
   \]

Thus, the total number of tires on the used car lotâ€™s vehicles is \( \boxed{84} \).
