==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 459" refers to. Since I don't have the specific details of this problem, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help solve it.

Let's assume a sample math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Simplifying the left side gives:
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
