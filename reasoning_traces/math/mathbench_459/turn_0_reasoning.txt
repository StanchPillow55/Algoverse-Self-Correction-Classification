==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 459" entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I can't provide a solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to approach solving a math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen method step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
