Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand the context and details of the question. However, the question provided, "Sample reasoning question 280," lacks specific details or numerical data to work with. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 240 square meters. How many such plots can the farmer create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 120 meters by 80 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into smaller plots, each with an area of 240 square meters.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width.
   - For the field: Area = 120 meters × 80 meters = 9600 square meters.

3. **Determine the Number of Smaller Plots:**
   - Each smaller plot has an area of 240 square meters.
   - To find the number of plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot.
   - Number of plots = Total Area of the Field / Area of One Plot
   - Number of plots = 9600 square meters / 240 square meters = 40 plots.

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Multiply the number of plots by the area of one plot to ensure it equals the total area of the field.
   - 40 plots × 240 square meters/plot = 9600 square meters, which matches the total area of the field.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 40 smaller plots, each with an area of 240 square meters, from the field.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 240 square meters.
