==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 280," we need to first understand what the question is asking. However, the question as presented is not clear or specific. It seems to be a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here.

Since there is no specific mathematical problem or context given, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem using a structured reasoning process. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the area of a rectangle with a length of 10 units and a width of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a rectangle.
   - The formula for the area of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]

2. **Identify Given Information:**
   - Length (\(L\)) = 10 units
   - Width (\(W\)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   - Using the formula for the area of a rectangle:
     \[
     \text{Area} = 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Multiply the length by the width:
     \[
     \text{Area} = 50 \text{ square units}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Double-check the multiplication to ensure accuracy:
     - \(10 \times 5 = 50\), which is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the rectangle is 50 square units.

By following these steps, we ensure that we have a clear understanding of the problem, correctly apply the relevant mathematical formula, and verify our calculations to arrive at the correct solution.
