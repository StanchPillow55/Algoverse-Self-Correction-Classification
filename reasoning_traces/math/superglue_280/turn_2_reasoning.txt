Question ID: superglue_280
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 280" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem, using a hypothetical example.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 280" is a logic puzzle involving numbers. Here's a possible interpretation and solution:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
You are given a sequence of numbers: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and you need to find the next number in the sequence.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - Look at the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32.
   - Notice that each number is double the previous number.

2. **Verify the Pattern:**
   - 2 × 2 = 4
   - 4 × 2 = 8
   - 8 × 2 = 16
   - 16 × 2 = 32

3. **Apply the Pattern:**
   - To find the next number, multiply the last number in the sequence by 2.
   - 32 × 2 = 64

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The next number in the sequence is 64.

**Final Answer:**
64

This example demonstrates a logical approach to solving a reasoning problem involving numerical sequences. If "Sample reasoning question 280" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details, and I can adjust the solution accordingly.
