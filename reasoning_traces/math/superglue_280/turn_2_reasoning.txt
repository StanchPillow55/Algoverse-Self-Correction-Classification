Question ID: superglue_280
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 280" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem step by step. Let's assume a sample problem for demonstration purposes:

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even numbers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   The sequence of the first 20 positive even numbers is: 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 40.

2. **Recognize the Pattern:**
   This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Use the Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence:**
   The formula for the sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   where \( a_n \) is the \( n \)-th term.

4. **Find the \( n \)-th Term:**
   The \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \times d
   \]
   For \( n = 20 \):
   \[
   a_{20} = 2 + (20-1) \times 2 = 2 + 38 = 40
   \]

5. **Calculate the Sum:**
   Substitute the values into the sum formula:
   \[
   S_{20} = \frac{20}{2} \times (2 + 40) = 10 \times 42 = 420
   \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   The sum of the first 20 positive even numbers is 420.

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve an arithmetic sequence problem by identifying the sequence, using the appropriate formulas, and performing the calculations systematically. If "Sample reasoning question 280" refers to a different problem, please provide more context or details for a specific solution.
