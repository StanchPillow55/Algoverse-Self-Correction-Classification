To find out how many more petals the African daisies have compared to the orchids, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of petals for the orchids.**
   - Joelle has 5 orchids.
   - Each orchid has 5 petals.
   - Therefore, the total number of petals from the orchids can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total petals from orchids} = \text{Number of orchids} \times \text{Petals per orchid}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total petals from orchids} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ petals}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies.**
   - Joelle has 4 African daisies.
   - Each African daisy has 10 petals.
   - Therefore, the total number of petals from the daisies can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total petals from daisies} = \text{Number of daisies} \times \text{Petals per daisy}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total petals from daisies} = 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ petals}
     \]

3. **Determine how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids.**
   - We will subtract the total number of petals from the orchids from the total number of petals from the daisies:
     \[
     \text{Difference in petals} = \text{Total petals from daisies} - \text{Total petals from orchids}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference in petals} = 40 - 25 = 15
     \]

Thus, the African daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

**Final Answer: 15 petals**
