Question ID: 180
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of votes received by the loser in the election for class representative.

1. **Identify the total number of votes**: According to the problem, the total number of students who voted is 80.

2. **Determine the number of votes received by the winner**: The winner received \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80
   \]
   To perform the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{4} = \frac{240}{4} = 60
   \]
   Thus, the winner received 60 votes.

3. **Calculate the number of votes received by the loser**: Since there are only two candidates, the number of votes received by the loser can be found by subtracting the number of votes received by the winner from the total number of votes:
   \[
   \text{Votes for the loser} = \text{Total votes} - \text{Votes for the winner}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
   \]

4. **Final answer**: The number of votes the loser got is \( \boxed{20} \).
