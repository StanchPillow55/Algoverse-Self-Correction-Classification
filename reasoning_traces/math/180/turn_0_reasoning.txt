==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to carefully track Derek's spending step by step and determine how much money he has left after his purchases.

1. **Initial Amount:**
   Derek starts with $960.

2. **Spending on Textbooks:**
   Derek spends half of his initial amount on textbooks. To find out how much he spends on textbooks, we calculate half of $960:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on textbooks} = \frac{1}{2} \times 960 = 480
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount After Buying Textbooks:**
   After spending $480 on textbooks, we subtract this amount from the initial $960 to find out how much money he has left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 960 - 480 = 480
   \]

4. **Spending on School Supplies:**
   Derek spends a quarter of the remaining amount on school supplies. To find out how much he spends on school supplies, we calculate a quarter of the remaining $480:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on school supplies} = \frac{1}{4} \times 480 = 120
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount After Buying School Supplies:**
   After spending $120 on school supplies, we subtract this amount from the remaining $480 to find out how much money he has left:
   \[
   \text{Final remaining amount} = 480 - 120 = 360
   \]

Thus, after buying his textbooks and school supplies, Derek has $360 left.

**Final Answer:**
Derek has $360 left.
