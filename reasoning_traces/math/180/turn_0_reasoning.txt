==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Amount**: Derek starts with $960.

2. **Spending on Textbooks**: 
   - Derek spends half of his initial amount on textbooks. 
   - Half of $960 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Amount spent on textbooks} = \frac{1}{2} \times 960 = 480
     \]
   - After spending on textbooks, we calculate how much money he has left:
     \[
     \text{Money left after textbooks} = 960 - 480 = 480
     \]

3. **Spending on School Supplies**: 
   - Next, Derek spends a quarter of the remaining amount on school supplies. 
   - A quarter of the remaining $480 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Amount spent on school supplies} = \frac{1}{4} \times 480 = 120
     \]
   - Now, we calculate how much money he has left after buying school supplies:
     \[
     \text{Money left after school supplies} = 480 - 120 = 360
     \]

4. **Final Amount**: 
   - After all his purchases, the amount of money Derek has left is $360.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{360}
\]
