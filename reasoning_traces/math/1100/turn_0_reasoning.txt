==================================================

To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, we will first calculate the total time he spends on lunches and breaks in one day, and then multiply that by the number of days he works.

### Step 1: Calculate daily break and lunch time

1. **Lunch time**: Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch each day.
   \[
   \text{Lunch time} = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Break time**: Bobby takes 2 breaks of 15 minutes each day.
   \[
   \text{Break time per day} = 2 \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Total daily time for lunch and breaks**:
   \[
   \text{Total daily time} = \text{Lunch time} + \text{Break time} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate total time over 5 days

Now, we will calculate the total time for 5 days:
\[
\text{Total time over 5 days} = 60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Convert total time from minutes to hours

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[
\text{Total time in hours} = \frac{300 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

After calculating the total time Bobby spends on lunches and breaks over 5 days, we find that the total is:
\[
\boxed{5} \text{ hours}
\]
