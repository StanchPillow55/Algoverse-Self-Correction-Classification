==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 36." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Let's consider a sample math reasoning problem:

**Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. On the return trip from City B to City A, the train travels at a speed of 40 miles per hour. If the total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours, what is the distance between City A and City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B in miles.

2. **Express Time for Each Leg of the Trip:**
   - Time taken to travel from City A to City B at 60 mph is \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - Time taken to travel from City B to City A at 40 mph is \( \frac{d}{40} \) hours.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total travel time for the round trip is given as 5 hours. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = 5
     \]

4. **Find a Common Denominator:**
   - The common denominator for 60 and 40 is 120. Rewrite the equation with this common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = 5
     \]

5. **Combine the Fractions:**
   - Combine the fractions on the left side:
     \[
     \frac{2d + 3d}{120} = 5
     \]
     \[
     \frac{5d}{120} = 5
     \]

6. **Solve for \( d \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 120 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     5d = 5 \times 120
     \]
     \[
     5d = 600
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( d \):
     \[
     d = \frac{600}{5}
     \]
     \[
     d = 120
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.

**Final Answer:**
The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.
