==================================================

To effectively assist you, I'll need more specific details about "Sample reasoning question 36." Since I don't have access to external documents or specific question sets, I'll demonstrate how to approach a general math problem using a structured reasoning process. If you provide the specific details of the question, I can tailor the solution to that problem.

Let's consider a sample math problem and solve it step by step:

**Sample Problem:**

A car travels from Town A to Town B at a speed of 60 km/h and returns from Town B to Town A at a speed of 40 km/h. What is the average speed of the car for the entire journey?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The car travels two legs of a journey: from A to B and back from B to A.
   - We need to find the average speed for the entire journey.

2. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let the distance from A to B be \( d \) km.

3. **Calculate the Time for Each Leg:**
   - Time from A to B: \( \text{Time}_{AB} = \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - Time from B to A: \( \text{Time}_{BA} = \frac{d}{40} \) hours.

4. **Total Distance and Total Time:**
   - Total distance traveled = \( d + d = 2d \) km.
   - Total time taken = \( \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} \).

5. **Find a Common Denominator for Time:**
   - The common denominator of 60 and 40 is 120.
   - Convert times to have the same denominator:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{AB} = \frac{d}{60} = \frac{2d}{120}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Time}_{BA} = \frac{d}{40} = \frac{3d}{120}
     \]
   - Total time = \( \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = \frac{5d}{120} = \frac{d}{24} \) hours.

6. **Calculate the Average Speed:**
   - Average speed is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{2d}{\frac{d}{24}} = 2d \times \frac{24}{d} = 48 \text{ km/h}
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The average speed of the car for the entire journey is 48 km/h.

**Final Answer:**
The average speed of the car for the entire journey is 48 km/h.
