==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 36" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a total of 36 animals, consisting of chickens and cows. If the total number of legs is 100, how many chickens and how many cows does the farmer have?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( c \) represent the number of cows.
   - Let \( h \) represent the number of chickens.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know the total number of animals is 36. Therefore, the first equation is:
     \[
     c + h = 36
     \]
   - Cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs. The total number of legs is 100. Therefore, the second equation is:
     \[
     4c + 2h = 100
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - First, solve the first equation for one of the variables. Let's solve for \( h \):
     \[
     h = 36 - c
     \]
   - Substitute \( h = 36 - c \) into the second equation:
     \[
     4c + 2(36 - c) = 100
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( c \):
     \[
     4c + 72 - 2c = 100
     \]
     \[
     2c + 72 = 100
     \]
     \[
     2c = 100 - 72
     \]
     \[
     2c = 28
     \]
     \[
     c = 14
     \]

4. **Find the Number of Chickens:**
   - Substitute \( c = 14 \) back into the equation \( h = 36 - c \):
     \[
     h = 36 - 14
     \]
     \[
     h = 22
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of legs:
     - Cows: \( 14 \times 4 = 56 \) legs
     - Chickens: \( 22 \times 2 = 44 \) legs
     - Total legs: \( 56 + 44 = 100 \), which matches the given condition.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The farmer has 14 cows and 22 chickens.

This step-by-step approach ensures that all calculations are shown and the reasoning is clearly explained. The final answer is consistent with the conditions provided in the problem.
