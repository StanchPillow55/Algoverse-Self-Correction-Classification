==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 36" entails. However, since I don't have access to external databases or specific documents, I will assume this is a hypothetical math problem and demonstrate how to solve a typical reasoning question step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 36" is a logic-based math problem. Here's a hypothetical example and how to solve it:

**Problem:**
A farmer has chickens and cows. Together, they have 30 heads and 100 legs. How many chickens and how many cows does the farmer have?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have two types of animals: chickens and cows.
   - Chickens have 1 head and 2 legs each.
   - Cows have 1 head and 4 legs each.
   - Total heads = 30
   - Total legs = 100

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( w \) be the number of cows.

3. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads equation is:
     \[
     c + w = 30
     \]
   - The total number of legs equation is:
     \[
     2c + 4w = 100
     \]

4. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   - From the first equation, express \( w \) in terms of \( c \):
     \[
     w = 30 - c
     \]

   - Substitute \( w = 30 - c \) into the second equation:
     \[
     2c + 4(30 - c) = 100
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( c \):
     \[
     2c + 120 - 4c = 100
     \]
     \[
     -2c + 120 = 100
     \]
     \[
     -2c = 100 - 120
     \]
     \[
     -2c = -20
     \]
     \[
     c = 10
     \]

   - Substitute \( c = 10 \) back into the equation for \( w \):
     \[
     w = 30 - 10 = 20
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of legs:
     \[
     2(10) + 4(20) = 20 + 80 = 100
     \]
   - Both conditions (heads and legs) are satisfied.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The farmer has 10 chickens and 20 cows.

This is a complete reasoning and solution process for a typical math problem involving logical reasoning and algebra. If "Sample reasoning question 36" refers to a different problem, please provide more details or context, and I can adjust the solution accordingly.
