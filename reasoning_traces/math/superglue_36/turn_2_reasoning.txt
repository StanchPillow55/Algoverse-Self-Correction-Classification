Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand the context and content of "Sample reasoning question 36" as well as the specific instruction "devils_advocate_v1." However, since I don't have access to external databases or specific documents, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem step-by-step. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 36" is a hypothetical math problem. I'll create a sample problem for demonstration purposes:

**Sample Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. After reaching City B, it immediately returns to City A at a speed of 40 miles per hour. The total round trip takes 5 hours. What is the distance between City A and City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B.

2. **Calculate Time for Each Leg of the Journey:**
   - Time taken to travel from City A to City B at 60 mph: \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - Time taken to travel from City B to City A at 40 mph: \( \frac{d}{40} \) hours.

3. **Set Up the Equation for Total Time:**
   - The total time for the round trip is given as 5 hours. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = 5
     \]

4. **Find a Common Denominator:**
   - The common denominator for 60 and 40 is 120. Rewrite the equation:
     \[
     \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = 5
     \]

5. **Combine the Fractions:**
   - Combine the fractions on the left side:
     \[
     \frac{5d}{120} = 5
     \]

6. **Solve for \( d \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 120 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     5d = 600
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( d \):
     \[
     d = 120
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Calculate the time for each leg of the journey with \( d = 120 \):
     - Time from City A to City B: \( \frac{120}{60} = 2 \) hours.
     - Time from City B to City A: \( \frac{120}{40} = 3 \) hours.
   - Total time: \( 2 + 3 = 5 \) hours, which matches the given total time.

**Final Answer:**
The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.

This approach demonstrates a structured method to solve a reasoning problem by defining variables, setting up equations, solving them, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
