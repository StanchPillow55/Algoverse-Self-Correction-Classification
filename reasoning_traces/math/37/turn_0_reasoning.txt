To determine how much each of the five friends will pay if they split the bill equally, we first need to calculate the total cost of their order. We will do this by calculating the cost of each item ordered and then summing those costs.

1. **Calculate the cost of the hamburgers:**
   - Number of hamburgers: 5
   - Cost per hamburger: $3
   \[
   \text{Total cost of hamburgers} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the French fries:**
   - Number of sets of French fries: 4
   - Cost per set of French fries: $1.20
   \[
   \text{Total cost of French fries} = 4 \times 1.20 = 4.80 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the sodas:**
   - Number of cups of soda: 5
   - Cost per cup of soda: $0.50
   \[
   \text{Total cost of sodas} = 5 \times 0.50 = 2.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the platter of spaghetti:**
   - Number of platters of spaghetti: 1
   - Cost per platter of spaghetti: $2.70
   \[
   \text{Total cost of spaghetti} = 1 \times 2.70 = 2.70 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Sum all the costs to find the total bill:**
   \[
   \text{Total bill} = \text{Total cost of hamburgers} + \text{Total cost of French fries} + \text{Total cost of sodas} + \text{Total cost of spaghetti}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total bill} = 15 + 4.80 + 2.50 + 2.70
   \]

   Now, let's calculate this step by step:
   - First, add the cost of hamburgers and French fries:
   \[
   15 + 4.80 = 19.80
   \]
   - Next, add the cost of sodas:
   \[
   19.80 + 2.50 = 22.30
   \]
   - Finally, add the cost of spaghetti:
   \[
   22.30 + 2.70 = 25.00
   \]

   Thus, the total bill is:
   \[
   \text{Total bill} = 25.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate how much each friend pays by splitting the total bill equally:**
   - Number of friends: 5
   \[
   \text{Amount each friend pays} = \frac{\text{Total bill}}{\text{Number of friends}} = \frac{25.00}{5}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount each friend pays} = 5.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, each friend will pay **$5.00**. 

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{5.00}
\]
