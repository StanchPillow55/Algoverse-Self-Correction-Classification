Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of food.

For the hamburgers, we multiply the number of hamburgers by the cost of each hamburger:
5 hamburgers * $3/hamburger = $15

For the French fries, we multiply the number of sets of fries by the cost of each set:
4 sets of fries * $1.20/set = $4.80

For the soda, we multiply the number of cups by the cost of each cup:
5 cups of soda * $0.5/cup = $2.5

The spaghetti platter costs $2.7.

Next, we add up all these amounts to find the total cost of the meal:
$15 (for hamburgers) + $4.80 (for fries) + $2.5 (for soda) + $2.7 (for spaghetti) = $25

Finally, to find out how much each friend will pay, we divide the total cost by the number of friends:
$25 / 5 friends = $5

So, each friend will pay $5.
