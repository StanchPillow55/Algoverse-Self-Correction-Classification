To solve the problem, we need to determine how many Lego sets John has left after selling them and using the money to buy video games.

1. **Calculate the total money John makes from selling his Lego sets:**
   - John has 13 Lego sets.
   - He sells each Lego set for $15.
   - Therefore, the total money he makes from selling all his Lego sets is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total money from Lego sets} = \text{Number of Lego sets} \times \text{Price per Lego set}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total money from Lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the video games:**
   - John buys 8 video games.
   - Each video game costs $20.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the video games is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of video games} = \text{Number of video games} \times \text{Price per video game}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost of video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160
     \]

3. **Calculate the total money John has after buying the video games:**
   - John initially made $195 from selling the Lego sets.
   - He spends $160 on video games.
   - After buying the video games, the remaining money is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining money} = \text{Total money from Lego sets} - \text{Total cost of video games}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Remaining money} = 195 - 160 = 35
     \]

4. **Account for the remaining money:**
   - According to the problem, after buying the video games, John has $5 left.
   - This means that the remaining money after buying the video games should equal $5, which is consistent with our calculation:
     \[
     \text{Remaining money} = 35
     \]
   - However, we need to check if this aligns with the problem statement. The problem states he has $5 left after buying the video games, which means he must have spent $160 on video games and had $5 left, confirming that he had $195 initially.

5. **Determine how many Lego sets John has left:**
   - The problem does not indicate that John has sold any Lego sets; it states that he plans to sell all his toys. Therefore, since he has not sold any Lego sets yet, he still has all 13 Lego sets.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{John still has } 13 \text{ Lego sets.}
\]
