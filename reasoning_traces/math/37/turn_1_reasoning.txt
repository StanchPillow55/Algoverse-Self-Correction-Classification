==================================================

To determine how much each of the five friends will pay if they split the bill equally, we first need to calculate the total cost of their orders. We will break down the costs for each item and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the cost of hamburgers:**
   - Number of hamburgers: 5
   - Cost per hamburger: $3
   - Total cost for hamburgers = Number of hamburgers × Cost per hamburger
   \[
   \text{Total cost for hamburgers} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of French fries:**
   - Number of sets of French fries: 4
   - Cost per set of French fries: $1.20
   - Total cost for French fries = Number of sets × Cost per set
   \[
   \text{Total cost for French fries} = 4 \times 1.20 = 4.80 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of soda:**
   - Number of cups of soda: 5
   - Cost per cup of soda: $0.50
   - Total cost for soda = Number of cups × Cost per cup
   \[
   \text{Total cost for soda} = 5 \times 0.50 = 2.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the platter of spaghetti:**
   - Number of platters: 1
   - Cost per platter: $2.70
   - Total cost for spaghetti = Number of platters × Cost per platter
   \[
   \text{Total cost for spaghetti} = 1 \times 2.70 = 2.70 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the meal:**
   Now we sum all the individual costs calculated above:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for hamburgers} + \text{Total cost for French fries} + \text{Total cost for soda} + \text{Total cost for spaghetti}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 15 + 4.80 + 2.50 + 2.70
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 25.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate how much each friend pays:**
   Since there are 5 friends, we divide the total cost by the number of friends to find out how much each person will pay:
   \[
   \text{Cost per person} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of friends}} = \frac{25.00}{5}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per person} = 5.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, each friend will pay **$5.00**. 

Final answer: Each friend pays **$5.00**.
