==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to follow the steps carefully and calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his Lego sets, how much he spends on video games, and finally, how much money he has left.

1. **Calculate the total money from selling Lego sets:**
   - John has 13 Lego sets.
   - He sells each Lego set for $15.
   - The total money from selling all Lego sets can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total money from Lego sets} = \text{Number of Lego sets} \times \text{Price per Lego set}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total money from Lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195
     \]

2. **Calculate the total money spent on video games:**
   - John buys 8 video games.
   - Each video game costs $20.
   - The total money spent on video games can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total money spent on video games} = \text{Number of video games} \times \text{Price per video game}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total money spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160
     \]

3. **Calculate the total money John has after buying video games:**
   - We know that after buying the video games, John has $5 left.
   - Therefore, we can express the total money he has after selling the Lego sets as:
     \[
     \text{Total money after selling Lego sets} = \text{Total money spent on video games} + \text{Money left}
     \]
     \[
     195 = 160 + 5
     \]
   - This confirms our calculations are consistent since \( 160 + 5 = 165 \) does not equal 195. 

4. **Re-evaluate the situation:**
   - Since the calculations show that John has $195 from selling Lego sets, and he spends $160 on video games, he should have:
     \[
     195 - 160 = 35
     \]
   - This means he should have $35 left, not $5. 

5. **Conclusion about Lego sets:**
   - The problem states that John has 13 Lego sets and does not mention that he sold any of them before the transactions. Therefore, he still has all 13 Lego sets.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{John still has } 13 \text{ Lego sets.}
\]
