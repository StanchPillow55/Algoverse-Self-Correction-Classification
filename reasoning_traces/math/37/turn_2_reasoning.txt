Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how much each of the five friends will pay if they split the bill equally, we first need to calculate the total cost of the food they ordered. We will break down the costs step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of hamburgers:**
   - They ordered 5 pieces of hamburgers, and each hamburger costs $3.
   - Total cost for hamburgers = Number of hamburgers × Cost per hamburger
   \[
   \text{Total cost for hamburgers} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of French fries:**
   - They ordered 4 sets of French fries, and each set costs $1.20.
   - Total cost for French fries = Number of sets × Cost per set
   \[
   \text{Total cost for French fries} = 4 \times 1.20 = 4.8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of soda:**
   - They ordered 5 cups of soda, and each cup costs $0.50.
   - Total cost for soda = Number of cups × Cost per cup
   \[
   \text{Total cost for soda} = 5 \times 0.5 = 2.5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of spaghetti:**
   - They ordered 1 platter of spaghetti, which costs $2.70.
   - Total cost for spaghetti = Number of platters × Cost per platter
   \[
   \text{Total cost for spaghetti} = 1 \times 2.7 = 2.7 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the meal:**
   - Now we add up all the individual costs to find the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of hamburgers} + \text{Cost of French fries} + \text{Cost of soda} + \text{Cost of spaghetti}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 15 + 4.8 + 2.5 + 2.7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 25 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate how much each friend pays:**
   - Since there are 5 friends, we divide the total cost by the number of friends to find out how much each person pays.
   \[
   \text{Cost per person} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of friends}} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, each friend will pay **$5.00**. 

Final answer: **$5.00** per person.
