==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total travel time for the man's first route if all three stoplights are red, and then compare it to the travel time of the second route.

**Step-by-step Calculation:**

1. **First Route (with stoplights):**
   - Base travel time with all green lights: 10 minutes.
   - Each red light adds 3 minutes to the travel time.
   - If all 3 stoplights are red, the additional time is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Additional time} = 3 \text{ lights} \times 3 \text{ minutes per red light} = 9 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Total travel time for the first route with all red lights:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 10 \text{ minutes} + 9 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Second Route (no stoplights):**
   - Travel time: 14 minutes.

3. **Comparison:**
   - We need to find how much longer the first route takes compared to the second route when all stoplights are red:
     \[
     \text{Difference in time} = 19 \text{ minutes (first route)} - 14 \text{ minutes (second route)} = 5 \text{ minutes}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
If all 3 stoplights are red, the man's trip on the first route will be 5 minutes longer than the second route.
