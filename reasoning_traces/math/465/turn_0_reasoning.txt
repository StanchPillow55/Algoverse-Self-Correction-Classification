To solve the problem, we need to analyze the two routes the man can take and calculate the time it will take if all stoplights on the first route are red.

1. **Understanding the first route:**
   - The first route has 3 stoplights.
   - If all stoplights are green, the trip takes 10 minutes.
   - Each red light adds an additional 3 minutes to the trip.

2. **Calculating the time if all stoplights are red:**
   - Since there are 3 stoplights and they are all red, we need to calculate the additional time added due to the red lights.
   - The additional time for each red light is 3 minutes.
   - Therefore, for 3 red lights, the total additional time is:
     \[
     \text{Total additional time} = 3 \text{ lights} \times 3 \text{ minutes/light} = 9 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculating the total time for the first route with all red lights:**
   - The total time for the first route when all lights are red is the initial time (10 minutes) plus the additional time (9 minutes):
     \[
     \text{Total time with red lights} = 10 \text{ minutes} + 9 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Understanding the second route:**
   - The second route takes a fixed time of 14 minutes with no stoplights.

5. **Comparing the two routes:**
   - We need to find out how much longer the first route takes compared to the second route when all stoplights are red.
   - The time taken for the first route with all red lights is 19 minutes, and the time for the second route is 14 minutes.
   - The difference in time is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Time for first route} - \text{Time for second route} = 19 \text{ minutes} - 14 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - If the man chooses the first route and all 3 stoplights are red, his trip will be 5 minutes longer than if he took the second route.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{5 minutes}
\]
