==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to compare the time it takes for the man to travel home using the two different routes, considering the conditions given for the first route.

**Step 1: Analyze the first route.**

- The first route takes 10 minutes if all three stoplights are green.
- Each red light adds 3 minutes to the trip.

Let's calculate the time it takes if all three stoplights are red:

- If one light is red, the trip takes \(10 + 3 = 13\) minutes.
- If two lights are red, the trip takes \(10 + 3 + 3 = 16\) minutes.
- If all three lights are red, the trip takes \(10 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 19\) minutes.

Thus, if all three stoplights are red, the trip on the first route takes 19 minutes.

**Step 2: Analyze the second route.**

- The second route takes 14 minutes and does not have any stoplights.

**Step 3: Compare the two routes when all stoplights are red on the first route.**

- Time for the first route with all red lights: 19 minutes.
- Time for the second route: 14 minutes.

**Step 4: Calculate the difference in time.**

To find out how much longer the trip will be if the man chooses the first route and all stoplights are red, we subtract the time for the second route from the time for the first route:

\[ 19 \text{ minutes (first route with all red lights)} - 14 \text{ minutes (second route)} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

**Final Answer:**

If the man chooses the first route and all 3 stoplights are red, his trip will be 5 minutes longer than if he takes the second route.
