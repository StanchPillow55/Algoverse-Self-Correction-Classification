==================================================

To determine how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings for the trousers, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total cost of the trousers**: 
   Adam bought trousers for $30.

2. **Calculate the amount given by his mother**: 
   Adam's mother gave him $6.

3. **Calculate the amount given by his father**: 
   Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Father's contribution} = 2 \times \text{Mother's contribution} = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]
   So, Adam's father gave him $12.

4. **Calculate the total amount given to Adam**: 
   Now we add the contributions from both his mother and father:
   \[
   \text{Total contribution} = \text{Mother's contribution} + \text{Father's contribution} = 6 + 12 = 18
   \]

5. **Determine how much Adam needs to contribute from his savings**: 
   To find out how much Adam had to contribute, we subtract the total contribution from the total cost of the trousers:
   \[
   \text{Adam's contribution} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total contribution} = 30 - 18 = 12
   \]

Thus, Adam had to contribute **$12** from his savings.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
