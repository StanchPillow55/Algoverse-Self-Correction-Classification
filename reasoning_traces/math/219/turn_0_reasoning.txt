To determine how many hotdogs Lisa needs to eat per minute to at least tie Joey Chestnut's record of 75 hotdogs in 10 minutes, we can break the problem down into several steps.

1. **Understanding the Time Frame**: 
   - Joey Chestnut's record is 75 hotdogs in 10 minutes.
   - This means he eats at a rate of \( \frac{75 \text{ hotdogs}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 7.5 \text{ hotdogs per minute} \).

2. **Lisa's Progress**:
   - Lisa has eaten 20 hotdogs halfway through the time, which means she has eaten these in 5 minutes (since halfway through 10 minutes is 5 minutes).
   - Therefore, her current rate of eating is \( \frac{20 \text{ hotdogs}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 4 \text{ hotdogs per minute} \).

3. **Calculating Remaining Time**:
   - Since Lisa has already used 5 minutes, she has 5 minutes left to eat more hotdogs.

4. **Calculating How Many More Hotdogs She Needs**:
   - To tie Joey's record, Lisa needs to eat a total of 75 hotdogs.
   - She has already eaten 20 hotdogs, so the number of hotdogs she still needs to eat is:
     \[
     75 \text{ hotdogs} - 20 \text{ hotdogs} = 55 \text{ hotdogs}
     \]

5. **Calculating the Required Rate**:
   - Lisa has 5 minutes left to eat these 55 hotdogs. To find out how many hotdogs she needs to eat per minute, we divide the remaining hotdogs by the remaining time:
     \[
     \text{Required rate} = \frac{55 \text{ hotdogs}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 11 \text{ hotdogs per minute}
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - To at least tie Joey Chestnut's record, Lisa needs to eat **11 hotdogs per minute** for the remaining 5 minutes.

Thus, the final answer is:
**Lisa needs to eat 11 hotdogs per minute to at least tie Joey Chestnut's record.**
