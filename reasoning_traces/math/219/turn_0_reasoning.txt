To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hotdogs Lisa needs to eat per minute in the remaining time to tie Joey Chestnut's record of 75 hotdogs in 10 minutes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of hotdogs Lisa needs to eat:**
   - Joey Chestnut's record is 75 hotdogs in 10 minutes. To tie this record, Lisa also needs to eat 75 hotdogs.

2. **Calculate how many hotdogs Lisa has already eaten:**
   - Lisa has eaten 20 hotdogs halfway through the time. Since the total time is 10 minutes, halfway through is 5 minutes.

3. **Calculate how many hotdogs Lisa still needs to eat:**
   - Total hotdogs needed to tie the record: 75
   - Hotdogs already eaten: 20
   - Hotdogs still needed: \( 75 - 20 = 55 \)

4. **Determine the remaining time:**
   - Total time is 10 minutes.
   - Time elapsed is 5 minutes.
   - Remaining time: \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) minutes

5. **Calculate the rate of hotdog consumption needed:**
   - Lisa needs to eat 55 more hotdogs in the remaining 5 minutes.
   - To find the rate per minute, divide the number of hotdogs by the number of minutes:
   \[
   \text{Rate per minute} = \frac{55 \text{ hotdogs}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 11 \text{ hotdogs per minute}
   \]

Therefore, Lisa will need to eat 11 hotdogs per minute in the remaining 5 minutes to tie Joey Chestnut's record.

**Final Answer:**
Lisa needs to eat 11 hotdogs per minute for the remaining 5 minutes to tie the record.
