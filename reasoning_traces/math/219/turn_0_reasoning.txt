Question ID: 219
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will start by defining the scores of each student based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the scores of each student:**
   - Let \( N \) be the score of Naomi.
   - Let \( Y \) be the score of Yuri.
   - Let \( B \) be the score of Brianna.
   - Let \( J \) be the score of Jojo.

   From the problem, we know:
   - \( N = 68 \) (Naomi's score)
   - \( Y = \frac{1}{2}N + 10 \) (Yuri's score)
   - \( B = N + 17 \) (Brianna's score)

2. **Calculate Yuri's score:**
   \[
   Y = \frac{1}{2}N + 10 = \frac{1}{2}(68) + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]

3. **Calculate Brianna's score:**
   \[
   B = N + 17 = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

4. **Now, we have the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:**
   - Naomi: \( N = 68 \)
   - Yuri: \( Y = 44 \)
   - Brianna: \( B = 85 \)

5. **Calculate the total score of the three students:**
   \[
   \text{Total score of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = N + Y + B = 68 + 44 + 85
   \]
   \[
   = 68 + 44 = 112
   \]
   \[
   = 112 + 85 = 197
   \]

6. **The total score of all four students is given as 251 points. Therefore, we can find Jojo's score:**
   \[
   J = \text{Total score} - \text{Total score of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna}
   \]
   \[
   J = 251 - 197 = 54
   \]

7. **Final answer:**
   Jojo scored \( \boxed{54} \) points.
