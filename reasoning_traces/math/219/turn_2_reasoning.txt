Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hotdogs Lisa needs to eat per minute in the remaining time to tie Joey Chestnut's record of 75 hotdogs in 10 minutes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Total Goal:**
   - Joey Chestnut's record is 75 hotdogs in 10 minutes.

2. **Determine Lisa's Progress:**
   - Lisa has eaten 20 hotdogs halfway through the time. Since the total time is 10 minutes, halfway is 5 minutes.

3. **Calculate Remaining Hotdogs Needed:**
   - To tie the record, Lisa needs to eat a total of 75 hotdogs.
   - She has already eaten 20 hotdogs.
   - Therefore, the number of hotdogs she still needs to eat is:
     \[
     75 - 20 = 55 \text{ hotdogs}
     \]

4. **Determine Remaining Time:**
   - Since she is halfway through the 10-minute period, she has 5 minutes remaining.

5. **Calculate the Required Eating Rate:**
   - Lisa needs to eat 55 hotdogs in the remaining 5 minutes.
   - To find out how many hotdogs she needs to eat per minute, we divide the remaining hotdogs by the remaining time:
     \[
     \frac{55 \text{ hotdogs}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 11 \text{ hotdogs per minute}
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Lisa needs to eat 11 hotdogs per minute for the remaining 5 minutes to tie Joey Chestnut's record.

Therefore, the final answer is that Lisa needs to eat **11 hotdogs per minute** for the remaining time to at least tie the record.
