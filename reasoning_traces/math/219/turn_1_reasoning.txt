==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hotdogs Lisa must eat per minute in the remaining time to tie Joey Chestnut's record of 75 hotdogs in 10 minutes.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of hotdogs Lisa needs to eat.**

Joey Chestnut's record is 75 hotdogs in 10 minutes. To tie this record, Lisa must also eat 75 hotdogs in 10 minutes.

**Step 2: Calculate how many hotdogs Lisa has eaten so far.**

Lisa has eaten 20 hotdogs halfway through the time. Since the total time is 10 minutes, halfway through is 5 minutes.

**Step 3: Determine how many hotdogs Lisa still needs to eat.**

Lisa needs to eat a total of 75 hotdogs. She has already eaten 20 hotdogs, so she needs to eat:

\[ 75 - 20 = 55 \text{ hotdogs} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining time Lisa has to eat these hotdogs.**

Since she is halfway through the 10-minute period, she has 5 minutes remaining.

**Step 5: Calculate the rate at which Lisa needs to eat the remaining hotdogs.**

Lisa needs to eat 55 hotdogs in the remaining 5 minutes. To find out how many hotdogs per minute she needs to eat, we divide the number of hotdogs by the number of minutes:

\[ \frac{55 \text{ hotdogs}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 11 \text{ hotdogs per minute} \]

**Final Answer:**

Lisa needs to eat 11 hotdogs per minute for the remaining 5 minutes to tie Joey Chestnut's record.
