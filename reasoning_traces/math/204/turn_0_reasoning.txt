==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pages are in each of Jack's 6 books, given that the total thickness of the stack of books is 12 inches and that 80 pages correspond to 1 inch of thickness.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages in the stack of books.

Since we know that 80 pages are equivalent to 1 inch, we can find out how many pages correspond to the total thickness of 12 inches.

\[
\text{Total pages} = \text{Thickness in inches} \times \text{Pages per inch}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Total pages} = 12 \text{ inches} \times 80 \text{ pages/inch}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total pages} = 12 \times 80 = 960 \text{ pages}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the average number of pages per book.

Now that we know the total number of pages in the stack of books is 960, we need to find out how many pages are in each of the 6 books on average.

To find the average number of pages per book, we divide the total number of pages by the number of books:

\[
\text{Average pages per book} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Number of books}}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Average pages per book} = \frac{960 \text{ pages}}{6 \text{ books}}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Average pages per book} = 160 \text{ pages}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the average number of pages in each book is:

\[
\boxed{160}
\]
