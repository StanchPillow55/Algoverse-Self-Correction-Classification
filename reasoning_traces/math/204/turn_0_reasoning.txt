==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the average number of pages per book in Jack's stack of books. We are given the following information:

1. The total thickness of the stack of books is 12 inches.
2. 80 pages correspond to 1 inch of thickness.
3. There are 6 books in the stack.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Pages

First, we need to find out how many pages are in the entire stack of books. Since 80 pages make up 1 inch, we can calculate the total number of pages in 12 inches as follows:

\[
\text{Total number of pages} = 80 \, \text{pages/inch} \times 12 \, \text{inches}
\]

\[
\text{Total number of pages} = 960 \, \text{pages}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Average Number of Pages per Book

Now that we know the total number of pages in the stack, we can find the average number of pages per book. Since there are 6 books, we divide the total number of pages by the number of books:

\[
\text{Average number of pages per book} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Number of books}}
\]

\[
\text{Average number of pages per book} = \frac{960 \, \text{pages}}{6 \, \text{books}}
\]

\[
\text{Average number of pages per book} = 160 \, \text{pages/book}
\]

### Conclusion

After performing the calculations, we find that on average, each book in Jack's stack contains 160 pages.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{160}
\]
