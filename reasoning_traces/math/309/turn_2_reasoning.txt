Question ID: 309
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of words Carl can type in 7 days, given his typing speed and the number of hours he types each day.

**Step 1: Determine Carl's typing speed in words per hour.**

Carl types at a speed of 50 words per minute. To find out how many words he types in an hour, we need to multiply his typing speed by the number of minutes in an hour:

\[
50 \text{ words/minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3000 \text{ words/hour}
\]

So, Carl types 3000 words in one hour.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of words Carl types in one day.**

Carl types for 4 hours each day. To find out how many words he types in a day, we multiply the number of words he types in an hour by the number of hours he types each day:

\[
3000 \text{ words/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 12000 \text{ words/day}
\]

Therefore, Carl types 12,000 words in one day.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of words Carl types in 7 days.**

Now, we need to find out how many words Carl types in 7 days. We do this by multiplying the number of words he types in a day by the number of days:

\[
12000 \text{ words/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 84000 \text{ words}
\]

So, Carl can type a total of 84,000 words in 7 days.

**Final Answer:**

Carl can type 84,000 words in 7 days.
