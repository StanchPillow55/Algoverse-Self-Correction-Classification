Question ID: 309
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of words Carl can type in 7 days, given his typing speed and daily typing duration.

**Step 1: Determine Carl's daily typing output.**

Carl types at a speed of 50 words per minute. He types continuously for 4 hours each day. First, we need to convert the hours into minutes because his typing speed is given in words per minute.

\[
4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, calculate the number of words Carl types in one day:

\[
50 \text{ words/minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 12,000 \text{ words/day}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of words typed in 7 days.**

Now that we know Carl types 12,000 words per day, we can find out how many words he types in 7 days by multiplying his daily output by the number of days:

\[
12,000 \text{ words/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 84,000 \text{ words}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Carl can type a total of 84,000 words in 7 days.
