Question ID: 309
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many words Carl can type in 7 days, given his typing speed and daily typing duration.

**Step 1: Determine Carl's daily typing output.**

Carl types at a speed of 50 words per minute. He types continuously for 4 hours per day. First, we need to convert the hours into minutes because his typing speed is given in words per minute.

\[ 
4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} 
\]

Now, calculate how many words Carl types in one day:

\[ 
50 \text{ words per minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 12,000 \text{ words per day} 
\]

**Step 2: Determine Carl's weekly typing output.**

Carl types for 7 days. To find out how many words he types in 7 days, multiply his daily output by the number of days:

\[ 
12,000 \text{ words per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 84,000 \text{ words} 
\]

**Final Answer:**

Carl can type 84,000 words in 7 days.
