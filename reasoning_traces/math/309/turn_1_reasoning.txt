Question ID: 309
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how many words Carl can type in 7 days, we can break the problem down into a few steps.

1. **Calculate the number of words typed in one hour:**
   Carl types at a speed of 50 words per minute. 
   To find out how many words he types in one hour, we multiply his typing speed by the number of minutes in an hour:
   \[
   \text{Words per hour} = 50 \text{ words/minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3000 \text{ words/hour}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of words typed in one day:**
   Carl types for 4 hours each day. Therefore, the total number of words he types in one day is:
   \[
   \text{Words per day} = 3000 \text{ words/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 12000 \text{ words/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of words typed in 7 days:**
   Now, we multiply the number of words he types in one day by the number of days (7 days):
   \[
   \text{Total words in 7 days} = 12000 \text{ words/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 84000 \text{ words}
   \]

Thus, the total number of words Carl can type in 7 days is \( \boxed{84000} \).
