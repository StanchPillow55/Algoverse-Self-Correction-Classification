==================================================

To determine how many new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to analyze the growth of arms and legs separately based on the given time intervals.

1. **Growth of Arms**:
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every 3 days.
   - To find out how many arms are grown in 15 days, we divide the total number of days by the interval for arm growth:
     \[
     \text{Number of arms} = \frac{15 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ days/arm}} = 5 \text{ arms}
     \]

2. **Growth of Legs**:
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every 5 days.
   - To find out how many legs are grown in 15 days, we divide the total number of days by the interval for leg growth:
     \[
     \text{Number of legs} = \frac{15 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ days/leg}} = 3 \text{ legs}
     \]

3. **Total New Limbs**:
   - Now, we add the number of arms and legs grown to find the total number of new limbs:
     \[
     \text{Total new limbs} = \text{Number of arms} + \text{Number of legs} = 5 + 3 = 8
     \]

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow a total of **8 new limbs**.

Final answer: **8**
