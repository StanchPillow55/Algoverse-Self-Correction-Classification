==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many words Carl can type in 7 days, given his typing speed and daily typing duration.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Carl's typing speed per minute:**
   - Carl types at a speed of 50 words per minute.

2. **Calculate the number of minutes Carl types per day:**
   - Carl types continuously for 4 hours per day.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes/day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of words Carl types per day:**
   - Since Carl types 50 words per minute, in 240 minutes he types:
     \[
     50 \text{ words/minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes/day} = 12,000 \text{ words/day}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of words Carl types in 7 days:**
   - If Carl types 12,000 words per day, then in 7 days he types:
     \[
     12,000 \text{ words/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 84,000 \text{ words}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Carl can type a total of 84,000 words in 7 days.
