To solve the problem, we need to determine how many words Carl can type in 7 days given his typing speed and the number of hours he types each day.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of words typed in one hour.**

Carl types at a speed of 50 words per minute. To find out how many words he types in one hour, we need to convert hours to minutes:

\[
1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we can calculate the number of words he types in one hour:

\[
\text{Words per hour} = \text{Words per minute} \times \text{Minutes per hour} = 50 \text{ words/minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Words per hour} = 50 \times 60 = 3000 \text{ words}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of words typed in one day.**

Carl types for 4 hours each day. Therefore, the total number of words he types in one day is:

\[
\text{Words per day} = \text{Words per hour} \times \text{Hours per day} = 3000 \text{ words/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Words per day} = 3000 \times 4 = 12000 \text{ words}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of words typed in 7 days.**

Now, we need to find out how many words Carl can type in 7 days:

\[
\text{Words in 7 days} = \text{Words per day} \times \text{Days} = 12000 \text{ words/day} \times 7 \text{ days}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Words in 7 days} = 12000 \times 7 = 84000 \text{ words}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Carl can type a total of **84,000 words** in 7 days.
