==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 141" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by using a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends $24, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( o \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The total number of fruits is 10:  
     \[
     a + o = 10
     \]
   - The total cost is $24:  
     \[
     2a + 3o = 24
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   1) & \quad a + o = 10 \\
   2) & \quad 2a + 3o = 24
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Step 1:** Solve Equation 1 for one of the variables, say \( a \):
   \[
   a = 10 - o
   \]

   **Step 2:** Substitute \( a = 10 - o \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   2(10 - o) + 3o = 24
   \]

   **Step 3:** Simplify and solve for \( o \):
   \[
   20 - 2o + 3o = 24
   \]
   \[
   20 + o = 24
   \]
   \[
   o = 24 - 20
   \]
   \[
   o = 4
   \]

   **Step 4:** Substitute \( o = 4 \) back into the expression for \( a \):
   \[
   a = 10 - o = 10 - 4 = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Check the total number of fruits:
     \[
     a + o = 6 + 4 = 10
     \]
   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     2a + 3o = 2(6) + 3(4) = 12 + 12 = 24
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 6 apples and 4 oranges.
