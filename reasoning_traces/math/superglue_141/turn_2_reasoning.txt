Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 141" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem using logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. Let's assume a sample math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

2. **Identify Given Values:**
   - Base (\(b\)) = 10 units
   - Height (\(h\)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   - Plug the given values into the area formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Next, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle using the given base and height. This methodical approach ensures that we understand each part of the problem and apply the correct mathematical operations to arrive at the solution.

**Final Answer:**
The area of the triangle is 25 square units.
