==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 141" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 240 square meters. How many such plots can the farmer create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Area of the Field:**

   The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
   \]
   For the farmer's field:
   \[
   A = 120 \, \text{m} \times 80 \, \text{m} = 9600 \, \text{m}^2
   \]

2. **Determine the Number of Plots:**

   Each plot has an area of 240 square meters. To find out how many such plots can fit into the field, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
   \[
   \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{9600 \, \text{m}^2}{240 \, \text{m}^2}
   \]

3. **Perform the Division:**

   \[
   \frac{9600}{240} = 40
   \]

   Therefore, the farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 240 square meters.

**Final Answer:**

The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 240 square meters.
