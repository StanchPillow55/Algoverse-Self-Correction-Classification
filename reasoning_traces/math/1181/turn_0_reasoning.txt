Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's translate these statements into equations.

### Step 1: Set up the first equation

From the first statement, we know that in 7 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 7 \). Therefore, Wendy's age can be expressed as:

\[
W = 5(C + 7)
\]

### Step 2: Set up the second equation

From the second statement, in 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \), and we know that this will be a third of Wendy's current age \( W \):

\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} W
\]

### Step 3: Substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation

We can substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} (5(C + 7))
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the equation

Now, simplify the right side:

\[
C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7)
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)
\]

Expanding both sides:

\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 5: Rearrange the equation

Now, let's rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):

\[
3C + 75 - 35 = 5C
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3C + 40 = 5C
\]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:

\[
40 = 5C - 3C
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
40 = 2C
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( C \)

Now, divide both sides by 2:

\[
C = 20
\]

### Step 7: Conclusion

Colin's current age is \( \boxed{20} \).

### Verification

To ensure our solution is correct, we can verify it with the original statements:

1. **Wendy's age**: If \( C = 20 \), then in 7 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 7 = 27 \). Thus, Wendy's age will be \( W = 5 \times 27 = 135 \).
2. **Colin's age in 25 years**: In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \). We check if this is a third of Wendy's current age: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \).

Both statements hold true, confirming that Colin's current age is indeed \( \boxed{20} \).
