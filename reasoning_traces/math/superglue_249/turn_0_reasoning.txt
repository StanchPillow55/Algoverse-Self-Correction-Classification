==================================================

To solve a reasoning problem, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the question "Sample reasoning question 249" does not provide specific details or context about the problem. Therefore, I will outline a general approach to solving reasoning problems and provide an example to illustrate the process.

### General Approach to Solving Reasoning Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Plan a Strategy:**
   - Consider different approaches to solve the problem.
   - Choose the most efficient method based on the given information.

3. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out the calculations or logical steps needed to solve the problem.
   - Keep track of your work to ensure accuracy.

4. **Review and Verify:**
   - Check your solution to ensure it answers the question.
   - Verify that all calculations and reasoning are correct.

### Example Problem:

**Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 km/h and returns from City B to City A at a speed of 40 km/h. What is the average speed of the train for the entire journey?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the average speed for the entire journey.
   - The train travels two different legs of the journey at different speeds.

2. **Plan a Strategy:**
   - Use the formula for average speed: 
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
     \]
   - Calculate the total distance and total time separately.

3. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Let the distance between City A and City B be \( D \) km.
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B is \( \frac{D}{60} \) hours.
   - The time taken to return from City B to City A is \( \frac{D}{40} \) hours.
   - Total distance for the round trip is \( 2D \).
   - Total time for the round trip is:
     \[
     \frac{D}{60} + \frac{D}{40} = \frac{2D}{120} + \frac{3D}{120} = \frac{5D}{120} = \frac{D}{24} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Average speed is:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{2D}{\frac{D}{24}} = 2D \times \frac{24}{D} = 48 \text{ km/h}
     \]

4. **Review and Verify:**
   - The calculations are consistent and logical.
   - The average speed for the entire journey is 48 km/h.

**Final Answer:**
The average speed of the train for the entire journey is 48 km/h.
