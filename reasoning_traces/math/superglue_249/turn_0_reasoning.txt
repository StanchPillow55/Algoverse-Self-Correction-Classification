To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to follow a structured approach. However, the question you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 249," does not contain specific details or numbers to work with. Therefore, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem:** A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by constructing a fence parallel to the shorter side. How long will the fence be?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - We need to divide this field into two equal parts using a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - Imagine the rectangle with its longer side (100 meters) as the base.
   - The shorter side (60 meters) is the width.
   - The fence will be parallel to the width, meaning it will run along the length of the field.

3. **Determine the Length of the Fence:**
   - Since the fence is parallel to the shorter side, it will span the entire length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the fence will be equal to the length of the field.

4. **Calculate the Length of the Fence:**
   - The length of the field is given as 100 meters.
   - Hence, the length of the fence will also be 100 meters.

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Dividing the field into two equal parts means each part will have an area of half the total area of the field.
   - Total area of the field = Length × Width = 100 meters × 60 meters = 6000 square meters.
   - Area of each part after division = 6000 square meters / 2 = 3000 square meters.
   - With the fence running along the length, each part will be 100 meters long and 30 meters wide, confirming the division is correct.

### Final Answer:
The length of the fence required to divide the field into two equal parts is **100 meters**.

This structured approach ensures that all aspects of the problem are considered, calculations are verified, and the solution is clearly communicated.
