==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 249" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $5, and the profit from each unit of product B is $8. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 150 units per day. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit \( P \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     P = 5x + 8y
     \]
   - We want to maximize \( P \).

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 100
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 80
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 150
     \]
   - Additionally, \( x \geq 0 \) and \( y \geq 0 \) since negative production is not possible.

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines:
     - \( x = 100 \)
     - \( y = 80 \)
     - \( x + y = 150 \)

5. **Vertices of the Feasible Region:**
   - The vertices of the feasible region are found by solving the system of equations formed by the intersections of the constraint lines:
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (100, 50) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (70, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( y = 80 \): \( (100, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \): \( (0, 0) \)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - \( P(100, 50) = 5(100) + 8(50) = 500 + 400 = 900 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 5(70) + 8(80) = 350 + 640 = 990 \)
   - \( P(100, 80) = 5(100) + 8(80) = 500 + 640 = 1140 \)
   - \( P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = 0 \)

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum profit of $1140 occurs at the vertex \( (100, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $1140.
