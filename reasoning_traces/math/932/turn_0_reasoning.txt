==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of people involved**: 
   - Maria invited 4 friends.
   - Including Maria, the total number of people is:
     \[
     4 \text{ (friends)} + 1 \text{ (Maria)} = 5 \text{ people}
     \]

2. **Calculate the initial number of water balloons**:
   - Each friend received 2 water balloons. Therefore, the total number of water balloons given to the friends is:
     \[
     4 \text{ (friends)} \times 2 \text{ (balloons per friend)} = 8 \text{ balloons}
     \]
   - Maria has 1 water balloon for herself. So, the total number of balloons at this point is:
     \[
     8 \text{ (balloons for friends)} + 1 \text{ (balloon for Maria)} = 9 \text{ balloons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the additional balloons given by Maria's mom**:
   - Maria's mom gave each person (5 people) 3 more balloons. Therefore, the total number of additional balloons given is:
     \[
     5 \text{ (people)} \times 3 \text{ (balloons per person)} = 15 \text{ additional balloons}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of balloons after receiving the additional balloons**:
   - We add the initial total of balloons to the additional balloons received:
     \[
     9 \text{ (initial balloons)} + 15 \text{ (additional balloons)} = 24 \text{ total balloons}
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - The total number of water balloons that the girls had is:
     \[
     \boxed{24}
     \]
