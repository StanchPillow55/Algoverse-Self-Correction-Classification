==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 366," we need to first understand what the problem entails. However, the problem statement is not provided in your question. Without specific details about what "Sample math problem 366" involves, I can't provide a direct solution.

To proceed, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step-by-step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 366" involves solving a quadratic equation. Here's how we would tackle it:

### Sample Problem:
Solve the quadratic equation: \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the coefficients**:
   The given quadratic equation is in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where:
   - \(a = 2\)
   - \(b = -4\)
   - \(c = -6\)

2. **Calculate the discriminant**:
   The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by:
   \[
   \Delta = b^2 - 4ac
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
   \]

3. **Determine the nature of the roots**:
   Since the discriminant is positive (\(\Delta = 64\)), the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

4. **Use the quadratic formula**:
   The roots of the quadratic equation can be found using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

5. **Calculate the roots**:
   - First root:
     \[
     x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   - Second root:
     \[
     x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

### Final Answer:
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
