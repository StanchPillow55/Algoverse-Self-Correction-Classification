==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 366" refers to. Since this isn't a standard problem description, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem details, I can't provide a specific solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 366" is a typical math problem involving algebra. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to approach solving an algebraic equation:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully.** Identify what is being asked and what information is given.
- **Identify the variables.** Determine what quantities are unknown and assign variables to them.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
- **Translate the problem into an equation.** Use the information given to form an algebraic equation.
- **Ensure all units are consistent.** If the problem involves measurements, make sure all units are the same.

### Step 3: Solve the Equation
- **Simplify the equation.** Combine like terms and simplify both sides of the equation if necessary.
- **Isolate the variable.** Use algebraic operations to get the variable on one side of the equation.
- **Perform inverse operations.** If the variable is multiplied by a number, divide both sides by that number. If it's added to a number, subtract that number from both sides.

### Step 4: Check Your Solution
- **Substitute the solution back into the original equation.** Ensure that it satisfies the equation.
- **Verify the solution makes sense.** Consider the context of the problem to ensure the solution is reasonable.

### Step 5: State the Final Answer
- **Write the solution clearly.** Include units if applicable and ensure the answer is in the correct form.

### Example Problem
Let's solve a simple algebraic equation as an example:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \).

**Step 2: Set Up the Equation**
- The equation is already given: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 3: Solve the Equation**
1. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
2. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 4: Check Your Solution**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 11
  \]
  \[
  8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, so the solution is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
