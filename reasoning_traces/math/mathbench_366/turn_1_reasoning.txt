==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 366" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I will assume it involves a common mathematical concept or operation. Let's assume it involves solving a basic algebraic equation, as this is a typical type of problem one might encounter.

Let's consider the following algebraic equation as a sample problem:

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

We will solve for \( x \) step by step:

### Step 1: Isolate the Variable Term
The goal is to solve for \( x \). To do this, we need to isolate the term containing \( x \) on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

The equation is:
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:
\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2x = 8 \]

### Step 2: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it completely. Since \( x \) is multiplied by 2, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( x \).

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ x = 4 \]

### Step 3: Verify the Solution
To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

Substitute \( x = 4 \) into the original equation:
\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

Calculate the left side:
\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is:
\[ x = 4 \]

This completes the problem-solving process with all steps and reasoning clearly explained.
