==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the weight of the bag of potatoes**:
   - Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed **5 pounds**.

2. **Calculate the weight of the bag of sweet potatoes**:
   - The problem states that the bag of sweet potatoes weighed **2 times as much as the potatoes**.
   - Therefore, the weight of the sweet potatoes can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times \text{Weight of potatoes} = 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the weight of the bag of carrots**:
   - The problem states that the bag of carrots weighed **3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes**.
   - We already calculated the weight of the sweet potatoes to be **10 pounds**. Thus, we can find the weight of the carrots:
     \[
     \text{Weight of carrots} = \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the weight of the bag of carrots that Daisy bought is **7 pounds**.

In conclusion, Daisy bought **7 pounds of carrots**.
