==================================================

It seems like "Sample math problem 21" is not a specific math problem but rather a placeholder or reference to a problem that wasn't provided. To help you effectively, I need the actual details or specifics of the math problem you're referring to. 

If you have a particular math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to work through it step by step, showing all calculations and reasoning.
