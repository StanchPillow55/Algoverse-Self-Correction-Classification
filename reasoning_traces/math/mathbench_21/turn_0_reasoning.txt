==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 21" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 21:**

*Problem Statement:*

A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**

   Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.  
   Then the length \( l \) of the rectangle is \( 3w \) (since the length is 3 times the width).

2. **Write the Perimeter Formula:**

   The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
   \[
   P = 2l + 2w
   \]

3. **Substitute Known Values:**

   We know the perimeter is 48 units, so:
   \[
   48 = 2(3w) + 2w
   \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**

   Simplify the expression on the right:
   \[
   48 = 6w + 2w
   \]
   \[
   48 = 8w
   \]

5. **Solve for \( w \):**

   Divide both sides of the equation by 8 to solve for \( w \):
   \[
   w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
   \]

6. **Find the Length \( l \):**

   Since \( l = 3w \), substitute the value of \( w \):
   \[
   l = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
   \[
   P = 2l + 2w = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
   \]
   The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 6 units
- Length = 18 units
