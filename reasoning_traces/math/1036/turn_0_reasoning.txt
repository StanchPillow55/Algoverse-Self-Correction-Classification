==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of apples in two boxes.**
2. **Calculate how many packs can be made with the total number of apples, given that each pack contains eight apples.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of apples

We know that there are 40 apples in one box. Uncle Franky ordered two boxes of apples. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of apples as follows:

\[
\text{Total apples} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Apples per box}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total apples} = 2 \times 40 = 80
\]

So, Uncle Franky has a total of 80 apples.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of packs

Next, we need to find out how many packs of apples can be made if each pack contains 8 apples. We can calculate this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[
\text{Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total apples}}{\text{Apples per pack}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of packs} = \frac{80}{8} = 10
\]

### Final Answer

Uncle Franky can make **10 packs** of apples with the two boxes of apples.
