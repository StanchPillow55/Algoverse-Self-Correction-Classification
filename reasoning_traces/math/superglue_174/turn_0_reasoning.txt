==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 174" refers to. Since I don't have the specific content of this question, I'll guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems that involve reasoning. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.

### Generic Approach to Solving Math Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given information or constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Determine what mathematical concepts or formulas might be applicable.
   - Consider drawing diagrams or making tables if it helps visualize the problem.
   - Break the problem into smaller, more manageable parts if necessary.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Perform calculations step by step.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.
   - Be systematic to avoid missing any part of the problem.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify each step of your calculations.
   - Check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Review the problem to ensure all parts have been addressed.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, ensuring it answers the question posed.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem:

Let's apply this approach to a sample problem:

**Problem:**
A car travels 150 miles in 3 hours. What is the average speed of the car in miles per hour?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the average speed.
   - We know the distance traveled is 150 miles and the time taken is 3 hours.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for average speed: \(\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}\).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Plug the known values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Check the calculation: \(150 \div 3 = 50\).
   - The units are consistent, and the answer makes sense.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The average speed of the car is 50 miles per hour.

If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details, and I can help solve that particular problem.
