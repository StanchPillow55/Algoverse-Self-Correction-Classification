==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 174" refers to. However, without specific details or context about what "Sample reasoning question 174" entails, I cannot provide a direct solution. Instead, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem step by step, showing all calculations and reasoning.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 174" is a math problem involving algebra. Here's a hypothetical problem and its solution:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. The equation is currently:
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To remove the constant term on the left side, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This is a demonstration of how to solve a typical algebraic equation. If you have a specific problem or more details about "Sample reasoning question 174," please provide them, and I can offer a tailored solution.
