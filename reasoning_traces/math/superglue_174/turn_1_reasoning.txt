Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 174" refers to. Since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem using a structured reasoning process. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are asked to find the area of a triangle.
   - We are given the base and height of the triangle.

2. **Recall the Formula:**
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - Base = 10 units
   - Height = 5 units
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - First, multiply the base and height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

**Conclusion:**

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle to be 25 square units. This structured approach ensures that we understand the problem, recall the necessary formulas, substitute the given values correctly, and perform the calculations accurately.
