==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand the context and details provided in the question. However, the question as presented, "Sample reasoning question 174," lacks specific details or numerical data to work with. Therefore, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step, demonstrating the reasoning process.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 240 square meters. How many such plots can the farmer create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 120 meters (length) and 80 meters (width).
   - The area of the field is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Area of the field} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 120 \times 80 = 9600 \text{ square meters}
     \]
   - Each smaller plot should have an area of 240 square meters.

2. **Calculate the Number of Plots:**
   - To find out how many 240 square meter plots can fit into the 9600 square meter field, we divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
     \[
     \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{9600}{240}
     \]

3. **Perform the Division:**
   - Simplify the division:
     \[
     \frac{9600}{240} = 40
     \]

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - To ensure the calculation is correct, multiply the number of plots by the area of one plot to see if it equals the total area of the field:
     \[
     40 \times 240 = 9600
     \]
   - The calculation checks out, confirming that the division was performed correctly.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 240 square meters, from the 9600 square meter field.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 240 square meters.
