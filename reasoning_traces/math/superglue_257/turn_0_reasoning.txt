To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 257" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math reasoning problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular sections, each with an area of 240 square meters, to plant different crops. How many such sections can he create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 120 meters by 80 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into smaller rectangles, each with an area of 240 square meters.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of the field is given by the formula for the area of a rectangle: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     \text{Area} = 120 \, \text{meters} \times 80 \, \text{meters} = 9600 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

3. **Determine the Number of Sections:**
   - Each section has an area of 240 square meters.
   - To find the number of sections, divide the total area of the field by the area of one section:
     \[
     \text{Number of sections} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of one section}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Number of sections} = \frac{9600 \, \text{square meters}}{240 \, \text{square meters}} = 40
     \]

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Multiply the number of sections by the area of one section to ensure it equals the total area:
     \[
     40 \times 240 = 9600 \, \text{square meters}
     \]
   - The calculation is correct.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can divide the field into 40 sections, each with an area of 240 square meters.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 sections, each with an area of 240 square meters.
