==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 257" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem or a widely recognized question, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample reasoning question 257" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Sample reasoning question 257: A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 180 miles, at a constant speed. On the return trip from City B to City A, the train travels at a speed that is 20 miles per hour faster and takes 1 hour less than the trip from City A to City B. What is the speed of the train from City A to City B?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the speed of the train from City A to City B in miles per hour.
   - The speed of the train from City B to City A is \( x + 20 \) miles per hour.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{180}{x}
     \]
   - The time taken to travel from City B to City A is:
     \[
     \frac{180}{x + 20}
     \]
   - According to the problem, the return trip takes 1 hour less:
     \[
     \frac{180}{x} - \frac{180}{x + 20} = 1
     \]

3. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To solve the equation, first clear the fractions by finding a common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{180(x + 20) - 180x}{x(x + 20)} = 1
     \]
   - Simplify the numerator:
     \[
     180x + 3600 - 180x = 3600
     \]
   - The equation becomes:
     \[
     \frac{3600}{x(x + 20)} = 1
     \]
   - Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     3600 = x(x + 20)
     \]
   - Expand and rearrange the equation:
     \[
     x^2 + 20x - 3600 = 0
     \]

4. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 20 \), and \( c = -3600 \).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = 20^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-3600) = 400 + 14400 = 14800
     \]
   - Calculate \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{14800}}{2}
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm 121.24}{2}
     \]
   - Calculate the two possible solutions:
     \[
     x = \frac{101.24}{2} = 50.62 \quad \text{(approximately)}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-141.24}{2} = -70.62 \quad \text{(not feasible as speed cannot be negative)}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The speed of the train from City A to City B is approximately 50.62 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The speed of the train from City A to City B is approximately 50.62 miles per hour.
