==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 257" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. Let's assume a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"John has twice as many apples as Mary. Together, they have 36 apples. How many apples does each person have?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( M \) represent the number of apples Mary has.
   - Since John has twice as many apples as Mary, John has \( 2M \) apples.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of apples is 36. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     M + 2M = 36
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     3M = 36
     \]

4. **Solve for \( M \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate \( M \):
     \[
     M = \frac{36}{3} = 12
     \]

5. **Find the Number of Apples John Has:**
   - Since John has twice as many apples as Mary, calculate:
     \[
     2M = 2 \times 12 = 24
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the total number of apples adds up to 36:
     \[
     M + 2M = 12 + 24 = 36
     \]
   - The solution satisfies the condition given in the problem.

**Final Answer:**
- Mary has 12 apples.
- John has 24 apples.

This approach demonstrates how to solve a reasoning-based math problem by defining variables, setting up equations, solving for unknowns, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details.
