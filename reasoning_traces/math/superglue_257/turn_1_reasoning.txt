==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 257" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem using logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 257" is a typical math problem. For illustration purposes, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it:

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a linear equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).
   - Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \):**
   - The coefficient of \( x \) is 3. Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is 5.

This example demonstrates a systematic approach to solving a linear equation by isolating the variable, performing arithmetic operations, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help!
