Question ID: 1225
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to establish a relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies Carly makes, and then determine how many cupcakes she made based on the total number of treats needed for her class.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
   - Let \( b \) be the number of brownies Carly makes.

2. **Set Up the Relationship**:
   According to the problem, Carly makes "2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes." This can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

3. **Determine Total Treats Needed**:
   Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats needed is:
   \[
   \text{Total treats} = 5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ treats/person} = 10 \text{ treats}
   \]

4. **Set Up the Total Treats Equation**:
   The total number of treats Carly makes is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
   \[
   c + b = 10
   \]

5. **Substitute the Relationship into the Total Treats Equation**:
   We can substitute the expression for \( b \) from step 2 into the total treats equation:
   \[
   c + (3c - 2) = 10
   \]

6. **Combine Like Terms**:
   Simplifying the equation gives:
   \[
   c + 3c - 2 = 10
   \]
   \[
   4c - 2 = 10
   \]

7. **Solve for \( c \)**:
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   4c = 12
   \]
   Now, divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   c = 3
   \]

8. **Calculate \( b \)**:
   Now that we have \( c \), we can find \( b \) using the relationship we established earlier:
   \[
   b = 3c - 2 = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7
   \]

9. **Check the Total**:
   Finally, we should check that the total number of treats is correct:
   \[
   c + b = 3 + 7 = 10
   \]
   This matches the total treats needed.

Thus, the number of cupcakes Carly made is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]
