Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to establish a relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies Carly makes, and then use that relationship to find out how many cupcakes she made.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
   - According to the problem, Carly makes "2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes." We can express the number of brownies \( b \) in terms of cupcakes:
     \[
     b = 3c - 2
     \]

2. **Determine Total Treats**:
   - Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats needed is:
     \[
     \text{Total treats} = 5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ treats/person} = 10 \text{ treats}
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - The total number of treats (cupcakes + brownies) must equal 10:
     \[
     c + b = 10
     \]
   - Now, substitute the expression for \( b \) from step 1 into this equation:
     \[
     c + (3c - 2) = 10
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation**:
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     c + 3c - 2 = 10
     \]
     \[
     4c - 2 = 10
     \]

5. **Solve for \( c \)**:
   - Add 2 to both sides:
     \[
     4c = 12
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 4:
     \[
     c = 3
     \]

6. **Calculate the Number of Brownies**:
   - Now that we know \( c \), we can find \( b \):
     \[
     b = 3c - 2 = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7
     \]

7. **Verify the Total**:
   - Check that the total number of treats is correct:
     \[
     c + b = 3 + 7 = 10
     \]
   - This matches the total number of treats needed.

Thus, the final answer is that Carly made \( \boxed{3} \) cupcakes.
