Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( c \). According to the problem, Carly makes "2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes." We can express the number of brownies \( b \) in terms of \( c \):

\[
b = 3c - 2
\]

Next, we need to determine the total number of treats Carly makes. Each person in her class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is:

\[
\text{Total treats} = 5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ treats/person} = 10 \text{ treats}
\]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies:

\[
c + b = 10
\]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into this equation:

\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Now, simplify the equation:

\[
c + 3c - 2 = 10
\]
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]

Next, we will isolate \( c \) by adding 2 to both sides:

\[
4c = 10 + 2
\]
\[
4c = 12
\]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( c \):

\[
c = \frac{12}{4} = 3
\]

So, Carly made \( 3 \) cupcakes. 

To find the number of brownies, we can substitute \( c \) back into the equation for \( b \):

\[
b = 3c - 2 = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7
\]

Now, let's verify the total number of treats:

\[
c + b = 3 + 7 = 10
\]

This matches the total number of treats calculated earlier. 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\] 

Carly made 3 cupcakes.
