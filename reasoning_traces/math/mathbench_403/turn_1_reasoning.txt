Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I first need to understand what "Sample math problem 403" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I will assume it is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual content of "Sample math problem 403," I will demonstrate how to approach solving a generic math problem by outlining a structured method.

### Step-by-Step Approach to Solving a Math Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note down any given information or data.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Determine the type of problem (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Decide on the appropriate method or formula to use.
   - Consider drawing diagrams or making tables if necessary.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen method step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and conversion factors if applicable.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Double-check calculations and logic.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's create a simple example problem to illustrate this process:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - This is a linear equation. We can solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \implies 2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \implies x = 4
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

By following this structured approach, you can solve a wide range of math problems systematically. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 403," please provide the details, and I can apply this method to solve it.
