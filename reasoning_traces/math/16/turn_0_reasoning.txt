==================================================

The problem states that the profit from a business transaction is shared between Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5. This means that for every 7 parts of the profit, Mike gets 2 parts and Johnson gets 5 parts.

We know that Johnson's share is $2500, which corresponds to 5 parts of the total profit. Therefore, 1 part of the profit is equal to $2500 / 5 = $500.

Since Mike's share is 2 parts of the total profit, his share is $500 * 2 = $1000.

However, Mike spends $200 on a shirt. Therefore, after buying the shirt, Mike will have $1000 - $200 = $800 left.

So, Mike will have $800 after spending some of his share on a shirt.
