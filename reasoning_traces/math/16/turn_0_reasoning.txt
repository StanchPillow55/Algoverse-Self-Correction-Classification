To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Mike receives from the profit and then calculate how much he has left after spending $200 on a shirt.

1. **Understanding the Profit Sharing Ratio**:
   The profit is shared between Mike and Johnson in the ratio of 2:5. This means that for every 2 parts Mike receives, Johnson receives 5 parts.

2. **Calculating Total Parts**:
   To find the total number of parts in the ratio, we add the parts for Mike and Johnson:
   \[
   \text{Total parts} = 2 + 5 = 7 \text{ parts}
   \]

3. **Finding Johnson's Share**:
   We know that Johnson received $2500. Since Johnson's share corresponds to 5 parts of the total 7 parts, we can express Johnson's share in terms of the total profit:
   \[
   \text{Value of one part} = \frac{\text{Johnson's share}}{\text{Johnson's parts}} = \frac{2500}{5} = 500
   \]

4. **Calculating the Total Profit**:
   Now that we know the value of one part, we can find the total profit by multiplying the value of one part by the total number of parts:
   \[
   \text{Total profit} = \text{Value of one part} \times \text{Total parts} = 500 \times 7 = 3500
   \]

5. **Finding Mike's Share**:
   Since Mike's share corresponds to 2 parts, we can calculate Mike's share as follows:
   \[
   \text{Mike's share} = \text{Value of one part} \times \text{Mike's parts} = 500 \times 2 = 1000
   \]

6. **Calculating Mike's Remaining Amount After Purchase**:
   Mike spends $200 on a shirt. Therefore, we need to subtract this amount from Mike's share:
   \[
   \text{Mike's remaining amount} = \text{Mike's share} - \text{Cost of shirt} = 1000 - 200 = 800
   \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have:
   \[
   \boxed{800}
   \]
