==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total distance covered by each train over the two days of travel.

### Day 1: Traveling Westward
Both trains travel westward for 80 miles. 

- **Distance covered by each train on Day 1**: 
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 80 \text{ miles}
  \]

### Day 2: Traveling Northward
The next day, both trains travel northward for 150 miles.

- **Distance covered by each train on Day 2**: 
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 150 \text{ miles}
  \]

### Total Distance Calculation
To find the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we add the distances from both days:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles}
\]

### Conclusion
Each train covers a total distance of 230 miles over the two days.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{230 \text{ miles}}
\]
