==================================================

The problem states that Mike and Johnson share profits in the ratio 2:5. This means that for every 7 parts of the profit (2+5), Mike gets 2 parts and Johnson gets 5 parts. 

We know that Johnson's share is $2500, which corresponds to 5 parts of the total profit. Therefore, we can calculate the value of one part of the profit by dividing Johnson's share by 5:

$2500 / 5 = $500

So, one part of the profit is worth $500. 

Since Mike's share of the profit is 2 parts, we can calculate his share by multiplying the value of one part by 2:

$500 * 2 = $1000

So, Mike's share of the profit is $1000. 

However, the problem states that Mike spends $200 of his share on a shirt. Therefore, we subtract this amount from his share to find out how much he has left:

$1000 - $200 = $800

So, after spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have $800 left. 

Therefore, the final answer is $800.
