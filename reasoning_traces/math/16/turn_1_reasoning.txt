Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total distance covered by each train over the two days of travel.

### Day 1:
Both trains travel westward for 80 miles.

- **Distance covered by each train on Day 1**: 
  \[
  \text{Distance} = 80 \text{ miles}
  \]

### Day 2:
The next day, both trains travel northward for 150 miles.

- **Distance covered by each train on Day 2**: 
  \[
  \text{Distance} = 150 \text{ miles}
  \]

### Total Distance Calculation:
Now, we need to find the total distance covered by each train over the two days. We can do this by adding the distances covered on both days.

- **Total distance for each train**:
  \[
  \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance on Day 1} + \text{Distance on Day 2}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total Distance} = 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total Distance} = 230 \text{ miles}
  \]

### Conclusion:
Each train covers a total distance of 230 miles over the two days.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Total distance covered by each train in two days} = 230 \text{ miles}
\]
