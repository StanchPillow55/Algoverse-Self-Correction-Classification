==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 62." However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical reasoning problem, assuming it involves mathematical reasoning or logic.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given data or conditions.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - Determine if it is a problem involving algebra, geometry, logic, probability, etc.
   - Recognize any patterns or sequences if applicable.

3. **Formulate a Plan:**
   - Decide on the best strategy to tackle the problem.
   - This could involve setting up equations, drawing diagrams, or listing possibilities.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out the necessary calculations or logical deductions.
   - Ensure each step follows logically from the previous one.

5. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step for accuracy.
   - Ensure the solution satisfies all given conditions.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem:

**Problem Statement:**
If the sum of a number and twice another number is 18, and the difference between twice the first number and the second number is 3, find the two numbers.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Let the first number be \( x \).
   - Let the second number be \( y \).

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the first condition: \( x + 2y = 18 \).
   - From the second condition: \( 2x - y = 3 \).

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have:
     \[
     x + 2y = 18 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]
     \[
     2x - y = 3 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \]

   - Solve Equation 1 for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 18 - 2y
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 18 - 2y \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     2(18 - 2y) - y = 3
     \]
     \[
     36 - 4y - y = 3
     \]
     \[
     36 - 5y = 3
     \]
     \[
     5y = 33
     \]
     \[
     y = \frac{33}{5} = 6.6
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 6.6 \) back into \( x = 18 - 2y \):
     \[
     x = 18 - 2(6.6)
     \]
     \[
     x = 18 - 13.2
     \]
     \[
     x = 4.8
     \]

4. **Check the Solution:**
   - Verify with the original equations:
     - \( x + 2y = 18 \):
       \[
       4.8 + 2(6.6) = 4.8 + 13.2 = 18
       \]
     - \( 2x - y = 3 \):
       \[
       2(4.8) - 6.6 = 9.6 - 6.6 = 3
       \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The two numbers are \( x = 4.8 \) and \( y = 6.6 \).

This approach outlines a structured method to solve reasoning problems. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details.
