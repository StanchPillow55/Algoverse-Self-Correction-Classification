==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 62" refers to. However, since no specific details or context about "Sample reasoning question 62" are provided, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem using a structured reasoning process. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 62" is a typical math problem. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - We are given the base (b) of the triangle as 10 units.
   - We are given the height (h) of the triangle as 5 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**
   - The formula for the area \( A \) of a triangle is given by:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   - Substitute \( b = 10 \) and \( h = 5 \) into the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, calculate the product of the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Next, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle using the given dimensions. This structured approach ensures that we understand the problem, recall relevant formulas, substitute values correctly, perform calculations accurately, and arrive at the correct solution.
