==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 461" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I will assume that this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's consider a common type of math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and made $30,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of widgets sold is 500. This gives us our first equation:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue from selling these widgets is $30,000. The revenue from Type A widgets is \( 50x \) and from Type B widgets is \( 70y \). This gives us our second equation:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 30,000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 500 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   50x + 70y &= 30,000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   - Solve Equation 1 for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     50x + 70(500 - x) = 30,000
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     50x + 35,000 - 70x = 30,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x + 35,000 = 30,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = 30,000 - 35,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = -5,000
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-5,000}{-20}
     \]
     \[
     x = 250
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 250 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( y \):
     \[
     250 + y = 500
     \]
     \[
     y = 500 - 250
     \]
     \[
     y = 250
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**

The company sold 250 Type A widgets and 250 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 250 Type A widgets and 250 Type B widgets.
