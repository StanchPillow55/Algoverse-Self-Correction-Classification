To solve the problem, I need more information about what "Sample reasoning question 305" entails. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 305" is a typical math problem. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it as an example:

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the entire field and also divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side. How much fencing material does he need in total?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is rectangular with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - We need to calculate the perimeter of the field to determine the fencing needed around it.
   - Additionally, we need to divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substitute the given dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 + 60) = 2 \times 160 = 320 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Additional Fence Needed to Divide the Field:**
   - Since the field is divided into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side, the additional fence will be along the length of the field.
   - The length of this additional fence is equal to the length of the field, which is 100 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Fencing Required:**
   - Total fencing required is the sum of the perimeter and the additional fence:
     \[
     \text{Total fencing} = \text{Perimeter} + \text{Additional fence}
     \]
   - Substitute the calculated values:
     \[
     \text{Total fencing} = 320 + 100 = 420 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The farmer needs a total of 420 meters of fencing material.

This step-by-step approach ensures that we understand the problem, apply the correct formulas, and perform the necessary calculations to arrive at the final answer. If you have a specific problem or more details about "Sample reasoning question 305," please provide them, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
