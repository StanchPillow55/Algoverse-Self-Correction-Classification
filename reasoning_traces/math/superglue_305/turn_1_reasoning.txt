==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 305" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, let's assume it involves a mathematical reasoning problem. Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company wants to produce a total of 100 widgets at a total cost of $600. How many of each type of widget should the company produce?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We have two conditions:
     1. The total number of widgets is 100: 
        \[
        x + y = 100
        \]
     2. The total cost is $600:
        \[
        5x + 8y = 600
        \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - From the first equation, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 100 - x
     \]
   - Substitute \( y = 100 - x \) into the second equation:
     \[
     5x + 8(100 - x) = 600
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     5x + 800 - 8x = 600
     \]
     \[
     -3x + 800 = 600
     \]
     \[
     -3x = 600 - 800
     \]
     \[
     -3x = -200
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-200}{-3} = \frac{200}{3} \approx 66.67
     \]

4. **Check for Integer Solution:**
   - Since \( x \) must be an integer (you can't produce a fraction of a widget), let's check the nearest integers:
     - If \( x = 66 \):
       \[
       y = 100 - 66 = 34
       \]
       \[
       5(66) + 8(34) = 330 + 272 = 602 \quad (\text{not } 600)
       \]
     - If \( x = 67 \):
       \[
       y = 100 - 67 = 33
       \]
       \[
       5(67) + 8(33) = 335 + 264 = 599 \quad (\text{not } 600)
       \]

5. **Re-evaluate the Problem:**
   - Since neither integer solution satisfies the cost equation exactly, re-check calculations or constraints. If the problem allows for rounding or approximation, choose the closest solution.

**Final Answer:**
Given the constraints and integer requirement, the closest feasible solution is:
- Produce 67 Type A widgets and 33 Type B widgets, resulting in a total cost of $599, which is the closest to $600 given integer constraints.
