Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To tackle this problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 100" refers to. Without specific details or context, it's challenging to provide a precise solution. However, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by assuming a hypothetical scenario. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 100" is a math problem involving basic arithmetic or algebra. 

### Hypothetical Problem Statement:
Let's assume the problem is: "If 100 is divided by a number \( x \), the result is 25. What is the value of \( x \)?"

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given that dividing 100 by a number \( x \) results in 25.
   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
     \[
     \frac{100}{x} = 25
     \]

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - We need to solve for \( x \). To do this, we can set up the equation based on the given information:
     \[
     \frac{100}{x} = 25
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - To isolate \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( x \) to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     100 = 25x
     \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 25 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{100}{25}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Result:**
   - Perform the division:
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the condition:
     \[
     \frac{100}{4} = 25
     \]
   - Since the left-hand side equals the right-hand side, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is 4.

This solution demonstrates a structured approach to solving a basic algebraic problem. If "Sample reasoning question 100" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details or context for a more accurate solution.
