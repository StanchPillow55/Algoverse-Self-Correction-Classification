==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 100" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear, I'll assume it is a placeholder for a mathematical problem that needs solving. Let's create a hypothetical problem based on this and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 100" refers to the following problem:

"Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - From 1 to 100, the even numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

2. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the last term \( a_n = 100 \).
   - The common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms:**
   - Use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plug in the known values to solve for \( n \):
     \[
     100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = 50
     \]
   - There are 50 even numbers from 1 to 100.

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   - Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 2550
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100 is 2550.
