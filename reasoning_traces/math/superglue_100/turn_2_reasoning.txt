==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 100," we need to first understand what the question is asking. However, the phrase "Sample reasoning question 100" is not a clear mathematical problem or question. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not fully provided here.

Since there is no specific mathematical problem or context given, I will interpret this as a request to demonstrate how to solve a typical math problem involving reasoning. Let's assume we are dealing with a basic algebra problem, which is a common type of reasoning question.

**Example Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To begin isolating \( x \), we first eliminate the constant term on the left side by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This example demonstrates a typical process of solving a linear equation using basic algebraic operations. If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you accordingly.
