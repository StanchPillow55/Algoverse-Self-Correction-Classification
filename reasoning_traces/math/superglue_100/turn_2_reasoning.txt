==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify the question. The question provided is "Sample reasoning question 100." However, this doesn't provide any specific mathematical problem or context to solve. It seems like a placeholder or an incomplete question.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 100" is meant to refer to a hypothetical or generic math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step-by-step.

### Sample Problem:
Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Calculate the sum of the first 100 positive integers.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 100 positive integers. These integers are 1, 2, 3, ..., 100.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this problem, \( n = 100 \). Substitute 100 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{100(100 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - Calculate \( 100 + 1 = 101 \).
   - Multiply 100 by 101:
     \[
     100 \times 101 = 10100
     \]
   - Divide the result by 2:
     \[
     S = \frac{10100}{2} = 5050
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure the calculation is correct, let's verify using a different method. The sum of an arithmetic series can also be calculated by pairing numbers from the start and end:
   - Pair (1, 100), (2, 99), ..., (50, 51).
   - Each pair sums to 101.
   - There are 50 such pairs.
   - Total sum = \( 50 \times 101 = 5050 \).

### Final Answer:
The sum of the first 100 positive integers is \( \boxed{5050} \).

This solution demonstrates the use of a known formula for the sum of an arithmetic series and verifies the result through an alternative method. If the original question intended something different, please provide additional details or context for further assistance.
