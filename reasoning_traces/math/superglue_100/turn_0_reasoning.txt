==================================================

It seems like the question "Sample reasoning question 100" is not fully clear or specific. However, I will interpret this as a request to solve a sample math problem that involves reasoning, and I'll create a problem involving the number 100. Let's consider the following problem:

**Problem:**

If a number is increased by 20% and then decreased by 20%, what is the final value of the number if the original number is 100?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to understand the effect of successive percentage changes on a number.

1. **Increase by 20%:**

   - Start with the original number: \( x = 100 \).
   - Increase by 20% means you add 20% of the original number to itself.
   - Calculate 20% of 100: 
     \[
     0.20 \times 100 = 20
     \]
   - Add this to the original number:
     \[
     100 + 20 = 120
     \]

2. **Decrease by 20%:**

   - Now, take the new number, which is 120.
   - Decrease by 20% means you subtract 20% of the current number from itself.
   - Calculate 20% of 120:
     \[
     0.20 \times 120 = 24
     \]
   - Subtract this from 120:
     \[
     120 - 24 = 96
     \]

3. **Conclusion:**

   After increasing the original number by 20% and then decreasing the result by 20%, the final value is 96.

**Final Answer:**

The final value of the number after a 20% increase followed by a 20% decrease is 96.
