==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 100" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. Each Type A widget requires 2 hours of labor and 3 units of material, while each Type B widget requires 1 hour of labor and 4 units of material. The company has a maximum of 100 hours of labor and 120 units of material available per week. If the profit from each Type A widget is $40 and from each Type B widget is $30, how many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Write the Constraints:**
   - Labor constraint: \( 2x + y \leq 100 \)
   - Material constraint: \( 3x + 4y \leq 120 \)
   - Non-negativity constraints: \( x \geq 0 \), \( y \geq 0 \)

3. **Objective Function:**
   - Maximize profit \( P = 40x + 30y \)

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Convert inequalities to equations to find boundary lines:
     - \( 2x + y = 100 \)
     - \( 3x + 4y = 120 \)

5. **Find Intersections:**
   - Solve \( 2x + y = 100 \) and \( 3x + 4y = 120 \) simultaneously:
     - Multiply the first equation by 4: \( 8x + 4y = 400 \)
     - Subtract the second equation: \( 8x + 4y - 3x - 4y = 400 - 120 \)
     - \( 5x = 280 \)
     - \( x = 56 \)
     - Substitute \( x = 56 \) into \( 2x + y = 100 \):
       - \( 2(56) + y = 100 \)
       - \( 112 + y = 100 \)
       - \( y = -12 \) (not feasible since \( y \geq 0 \))

6. **Find Feasible Region:**
   - Check intersections with axes:
     - For \( 2x + y = 100 \):
       - \( x = 0 \), \( y = 100 \)
       - \( y = 0 \), \( x = 50 \)
     - For \( 3x + 4y = 120 \):
       - \( x = 0 \), \( y = 30 \)
       - \( y = 0 \), \( x = 40 \)

7. **Vertices of Feasible Region:**
   - \( (0, 0) \), \( (0, 30) \), \( (40, 0) \), \( (24, 18) \) (intersection of \( 2x + y = 100 \) and \( 3x + 4y = 120 \))

8. **Evaluate Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - \( P(0, 0) = 40(0) + 30(0) = 0 \)
   - \( P(0, 30) = 40(0) + 30(30) = 900 \)
   - \( P(40, 0) = 40(40) + 30(0) = 1600 \)
   - \( P(24, 18) = 40(24) + 30(18) = 960 + 540 = 1500 \)

9. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum profit is $1600, achieved by producing 40 Type A widgets and 0 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 40 Type A widgets and 0 Type B widgets to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $1600.
