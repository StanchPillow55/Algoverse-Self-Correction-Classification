Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 415," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not provided here, so I'll create a hypothetical math problem based on the number 415 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Find the sum of the digits of the number 415, and then determine if this sum is a prime number.

**Step 1: Find the sum of the digits of 415.**

The number 415 consists of three digits: 4, 1, and 5. To find the sum of these digits, we simply add them together:

\[
4 + 1 + 5 = 10
\]

**Step 2: Determine if the sum (10) is a prime number.**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Let's check if 10 is a prime number:

- The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.
- Since 10 has divisors other than 1 and itself (specifically 2 and 5), it is not a prime number.

**Conclusion:**

The sum of the digits of 415 is 10, and 10 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the digits of 415 is 10, and it is not a prime number.
