Question ID: mathbench_415
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 415, let's first clarify what the problem is asking. Since "Sample math problem 415" is not a standard problem statement, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem details, I'll create a hypothetical problem involving the number 415 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Find the sum of the digits of the number 415 and determine if the sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 415:**
   - The number 415 consists of the digits 4, 1, and 5.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Sum = 4 + 1 + 5

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add 4 and 1: 
     \[
     4 + 1 = 5
     \]
   - Then, add the result to 5:
     \[
     5 + 5 = 10
     \]

4. **Determine if the sum (10) is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The number 10 has divisors 1, 2, 5, and 10.
   - Since 10 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of the number 415 is 10, and 10 is not a prime number.
