==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 415," we need more specific information about what the problem entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll demonstrate how to solve a hypothetical math problem that involves the number 415. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Find the sum of the digits of the number 415, and then determine if this sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 415:**
   - The number 415 consists of the digits 4, 1, and 5.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(4 + 1 + 5\).

   \[
   4 + 1 + 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Determine if the sum is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The number 10 is greater than 1, but it has divisors other than 1 and itself (specifically, 2 and 5).
   - Therefore, 10 is not a prime number.

**Conclusion:**

- The sum of the digits of 415 is 10.
- The sum, 10, is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the digits of 415 is 10, and 10 is not a prime number.
