==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many people voted by midday.**
2. **Calculate how many people remained after midday.**
3. **Determine how many people voted by 16:00.**
4. **Calculate how many people remained after 16:00.**

### Step 1: Determine how many people voted by midday.

Initially, there are 5000 people in line. By midday, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the people had voted.

To find out how many people voted by midday, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of people who voted by midday} = \frac{2}{5} \times 5000
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
\]

So, 2000 people had voted by midday.

### Step 2: Calculate how many people remained after midday.

To find the number of people remaining after midday, we subtract the number of people who voted from the initial total:

\[
\text{Remaining people} = 5000 - 2000 = 3000
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many people voted by 16:00.

By 16:00, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining people had voted. The number of remaining people is 3000, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of people who voted by 16:00} = \frac{2}{3} \times 3000
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000
\]

So, 2000 people had voted by 16:00.

### Step 4: Calculate how many people remained after 16:00.

Now, we need to find out how many people are left after 16:00. We subtract the number of people who voted by 16:00 from the number of remaining people after midday:

\[
\text{Remaining people after 16:00} = 3000 - 2000 = 1000
\]

### Final Answer

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

\[
\boxed{1000}
\]
