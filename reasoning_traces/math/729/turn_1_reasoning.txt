Question ID: 729
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Number of People**: At 8:00, there are 5000 people in line.

2. **People Who Voted by Midday**: By midday, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the people had voted. We calculate how many that is:
   \[
   \text{People who voted by midday} = \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
   \]

3. **Remaining People After Midday**: To find out how many people are left after midday, we subtract the number of people who voted from the initial number:
   \[
   \text{Remaining people} = 5000 - 2000 = 3000
   \]

4. **People Who Voted by 16:00**: By 16:00, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining people had voted. We calculate how many that is:
   \[
   \text{People who voted by 16:00} = \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000
   \]

5. **Remaining People After 16:00**: Now, we find out how many people are left after 16:00 by subtracting the number of people who voted by 16:00 from the remaining people after midday:
   \[
   \text{Remaining people after 16:00} = 3000 - 2000 = 1000
   \]

6. **Final Answer**: The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
   \[
   \boxed{1000}
   \] 

Thus, the final answer is 1000 people who had not voted by 16:00.
