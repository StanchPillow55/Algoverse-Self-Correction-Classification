==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to analyze Christina's mood records over the past thirty days. Let's break down the information given step by step.

1. **Total Days**: Christina recorded her mood for 30 days.

2. **Mood Counts**:
   - Good days: 12
   - Bad days: 8
   - Neutral days: To find this, we subtract the number of good and bad days from the total days:
     \[
     \text{Neutral days} = \text{Total days} - (\text{Good days} + \text{Bad days}) = 30 - (12 + 8) = 30 - 20 = 10
     \]

3. **Mood Distribution**:
   - First 8 days: All good (8 good days)
   - Second 8 days: All bad (8 bad days)
   - Third 8 days: All neutral (8 neutral days)
   - This accounts for 24 days (8 good + 8 bad + 8 neutral).

4. **Remaining Days**: After the first 24 days, we have:
   \[
   \text{Remaining days} = 30 - 24 = 6 \text{ days}
   \]

5. **Next 3 Days**: The problem states that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. This means:
   - 1 good day
   - 1 neutral day
   - 1 good day
   - Therefore, in these 3 days, there are 2 good days and 1 neutral day.

6. **Total Good Days**: Now we can calculate the total number of good days:
   - From the first 24 days, Christina had 8 good days (from the first 8 days).
   - From the next 3 days, she had 2 additional good days.
   - Therefore, the total number of good days is:
   \[
   \text{Total good days} = 8 + 2 = 10
   \]

7. **Remaining Good Days**: Christina originally had 12 good days recorded. To find out how many good days are left in the month, we subtract the total good days she has already recorded from the original total:
   \[
   \text{Good days left} = \text{Original good days} - \text{Total good days recorded} = 12 - 10 = 2
   \]

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is \( \boxed{2} \).
