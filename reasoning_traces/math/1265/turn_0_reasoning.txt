To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed for 4 gallons of lemonade:**
   - According to the recipe, 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
   - Therefore, for 4 gallons of lemonade, Tim will need:
     \[
     4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of lemons needed for 4 cups of lemon juice:**
   - We know that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - To find out how many lemons are needed for 4 cups, we can set up a proportion:
     \[
     \text{Lemons needed} = 6 \text{ lemons/cup} \times 4 \text{ cups} = 24 \text{ lemons}
     \]

3. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed for the extra gallon of lemonade:**
   - Allen wants an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart. This means it will require twice the amount of lemon juice compared to the regular lemonade.
   - Since 1 gallon of regular lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice, the extra gallon will require:
     \[
     2 \times 1 \text{ cup} = 2 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra 2 cups of lemon juice:**
   - Using the same ratio (6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice), we can find the number of lemons needed for 2 cups:
     \[
     \text{Lemons needed} = 6 \text{ lemons/cup} \times 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ lemons}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of lemons needed:**
   - Now we add the lemons needed for the 4 gallons and the extra gallon:
     \[
     \text{Total lemons} = 24 \text{ lemons} + 12 \text{ lemons} = 36 \text{ lemons}
     \]

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim will need is \( \boxed{36} \).
