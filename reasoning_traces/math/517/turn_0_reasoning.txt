==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to find out how many cookies Kelsie made based on the information given about Josh and Suzanne.

1. **Determine the number of cookies Josh made:**
   We know that Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. Since Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Josh made as follows:

   \[
   \text{Josh's cookies} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Suzanne's cookies}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Josh's cookies} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
   \]

   So, Josh made 9 cookies.

2. **Determine the number of cookies Kelsie made:**
   The problem states that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. This means we need to calculate twice the number of cookies Josh made:

   \[
   \text{Kelsie's cookies} = 2 \times \text{Josh's cookies}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Kelsie's cookies} = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]

   Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

3. **Final Answer:**
   The number of cookies Kelsie made is \( \boxed{18} \).
