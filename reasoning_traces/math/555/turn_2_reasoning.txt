Question ID: 555
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we first need to calculate how much money he earns in a week.

1. **Calculate daily earnings**:
   - John earns $2 per hour.
   - He works 5 hours a day.
   - Daily earnings = Hourly wage × Hours worked per day
   \[
   \text{Daily earnings} = 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 10 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate weekly earnings**:
   - John works 4 days a week.
   - Weekly earnings = Daily earnings × Days worked per week
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine how many weeks to save $80**:
   - We need to find out how many weeks it will take for John to save $80.
   - To find the number of weeks, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings.
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Total savings goal}}{\text{Weekly earnings}} = \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks}
   \]

Thus, it will take John **2 weeks** to save $80.

Final answer: **2 weeks**.
