To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to first calculate how much money he earns in a week.

1. **Calculate John's daily earnings:**
   - John earns $2 per hour.
   - He works 5 hours a day.
   - Therefore, his daily earnings can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Daily Earnings} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours Worked per Day} = 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate John's weekly earnings:**
   - John works 4 days a week.
   - Therefore, his weekly earnings can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Weekly Earnings} = \text{Daily Earnings} \times \text{Days Worked per Week} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week}
     \]

3. **Determine how many weeks it will take to save $80:**
   - We need to find out how many weeks it will take for John to save $80 given his weekly earnings.
   - We can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Number of Weeks} = \frac{\text{Total Savings Goal}}{\text{Weekly Earnings}} = \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks}
     \]

Thus, it will take John **2 weeks** to save $80.

Final answer: **2 weeks**.
