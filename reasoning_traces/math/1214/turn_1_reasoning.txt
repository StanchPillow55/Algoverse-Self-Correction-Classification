==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day based on the information provided.

1. **Calculate the total number of diaper changes per day**:
   - Jordan has 2 children.
   - Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.
   - Therefore, the total number of diaper changes per day is:
     \[
     \text{Total diaper changes} = \text{Number of children} \times \text{Diaper changes per child}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total diaper changes} = 2 \times 5 = 10
     \]

2. **Determine how many diapers Jordan's wife changes**:
   - It is stated that Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.
   - Therefore, the number of diapers changed by his wife is:
     \[
     \text{Diapers changed by wife} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Total diaper changes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Diapers changed by wife} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5
     \]

3. **Calculate how many diapers Jordan changes**:
   - Since the total number of diaper changes is 10 and his wife changes 5, the number of diapers changed by Jordan is:
     \[
     \text{Diapers changed by Jordan} = \text{Total diaper changes} - \text{Diapers changed by wife}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Diapers changed by Jordan} = 10 - 5 = 5
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Jordan changes **5 diapers per day**.
