To solve the problem, we need to determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the number of children and diaper changes per child**:
   - Jordan has 2 children.
   - Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.

2. **Calculate the total number of diaper changes per day**:
   - Total diaper changes = Number of children × Diaper changes per child
   - Total diaper changes = 2 children × 5 diaper changes/child = 10 diaper changes per day

3. **Determine how many diapers Jordan's wife changes**:
   - It is stated that Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.
   - Diapers changed by wife = Total diaper changes / 2
   - Diapers changed by wife = 10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes

4. **Calculate how many diapers Jordan changes**:
   - Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, Jordan will change the other half.
   - Diapers changed by Jordan = Total diaper changes - Diapers changed by wife
   - Diapers changed by Jordan = 10 diaper changes - 5 diaper changes = 5 diaper changes

Thus, Jordan changes **5 diapers per day**.

Final answer: Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.
