==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 213," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 213" is not specific enough for me to determine the exact mathematical question or context. 

Since I don't have the details of "Sample math problem 213," I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 213" is a typical algebra problem involving solving for \( x \) in an equation. Here's an example problem:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 5 = 13
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to get:

   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   \[
   2(4) + 5 = 13
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \) is \( x = 4 \).
