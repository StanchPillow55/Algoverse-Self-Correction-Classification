Question ID: mathbench_213
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 213, we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 213" is not clear or specific enough to determine what the actual question is. Therefore, I'll assume that "213" is a placeholder for a typical math problem, and I'll create a problem based on the number 213.

Let's consider a problem involving the number 213:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 213 and determine if the sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 213:**
   - The number 213 consists of the digits 2, 1, and 3.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(2 + 1 + 3\).

   \[
   2 + 1 + 3 = 6
   \]

3. **Determine if the sum is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The number 6 is greater than 1, but it has divisors other than 1 and itself (specifically, 2 and 3), so it is not a prime number.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sum of the digits of 213 is 6, and 6 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of 213 is 6, and it is not a prime number.
