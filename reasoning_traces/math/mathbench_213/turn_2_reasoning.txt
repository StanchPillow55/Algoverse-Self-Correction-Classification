Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 213," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not clear from the given text. Let's assume "Sample math problem 213" refers to a specific math problem that needs solving. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem with the number 213 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 213, and then multiply the result by 3.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 213:**
   - The number 213 consists of three digits: 2, 1, and 3.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Sum = 2 + 1 + 3

   Let's perform the addition:
   - 2 + 1 = 3
   - 3 + 3 = 6

   Therefore, the sum of the digits is 6.

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Result = 6 × 3

   Let's perform the multiplication:
   - 6 × 3 = 18

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The final result after multiplying the sum of the digits by 3 is 18.

Therefore, the solution to the hypothetical problem is 18. If "Sample math problem 213" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details or context so I can assist you more accurately.
