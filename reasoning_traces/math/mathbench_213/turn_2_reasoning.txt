Question ID: mathbench_213
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 213" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a hypothetical math problem with the number 213 involved. Let's create a problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 213, then multiply the result by 3. Finally, subtract 10 from the product.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 213:**
   - The number 213 consists of the digits 2, 1, and 3.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Sum = 2 + 1 + 3
   - Sum = 6

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Product = 6 Ã— 3
   - Product = 18

4. **Subtract 10 from the product:**
   - Result = 18 - 10
   - Result = 8

**Final Answer:**
The final result after performing all the operations is 8.

This solution assumes a hypothetical problem based on the number 213. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you accurately.
