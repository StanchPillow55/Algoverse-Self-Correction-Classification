To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 213" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't specified, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 213. Let's create a problem involving 213 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**  
Find the sum of the digits of the number 213, and then multiply the result by 3. What is the final result?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 213:**
   - The number 213 consists of the digits 2, 1, and 3.

2. **Calculate the sum of these digits:**
   - Sum = 2 + 1 + 3

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - 2 + 1 = 3
   - 3 + 3 = 6

   So, the sum of the digits is 6.

4. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Result = 6 × 3

5. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - 6 × 3 = 18

Therefore, the final result after multiplying the sum of the digits by 3 is 18.

**Final Answer:**  
18
