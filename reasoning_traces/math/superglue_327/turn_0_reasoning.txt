==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 327" refers to. Since the question is not fully specified, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $5, and the profit from each unit of product B is $7. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of both products cannot exceed 150 units per day. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - We want to maximize the profit function \( P \), where:
     \[
     P = 5x + 7y
     \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 100 \quad \text{(cannot produce more than 100 units of A)}
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 80 \quad \text{(cannot produce more than 80 units of B)}
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 150 \quad \text{(total production cannot exceed 150 units)}
     \]
   - Additionally, \( x \geq 0 \) and \( y \geq 0 \) since negative production is not possible.

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is a polygon bounded by the lines \( x = 100 \), \( y = 80 \), and \( x + y = 150 \).

5. **Vertices of the Feasible Region:**
   - Calculate the intersection points of the constraints to find the vertices of the feasible region:
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (100, 50) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (70, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( y = 80 \): \( (100, 80) \)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - \( P(100, 50) = 5(100) + 7(50) = 500 + 350 = 850 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 5(70) + 7(80) = 350 + 560 = 910 \)
   - \( P(100, 80) = 5(100) + 7(80) = 500 + 560 = 1060 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 1060 \), which occurs at the point \( (100, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $1060.
