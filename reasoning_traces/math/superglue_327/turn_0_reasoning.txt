==================================================

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding, as "Sample reasoning question 327" doesn't provide specific details about the problem to be solved. To help you effectively, I need more information or context about the problem. 

However, I can guide you on how to approach a typical math problem by outlining a general problem-solving strategy. Here's a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read Carefully**: Make sure you understand what is being asked. Identify the key information and what the problem is asking you to find.
- **Identify Given Data**: Note down all the numbers, variables, and any other given information.

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- **Choose a Strategy**: Decide on the best method to solve the problem. This could involve algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, breaking the problem into smaller parts, or using a formula.

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- **Execute the Strategy**: Follow through with the plan you devised. Perform calculations carefully and step-by-step.
- **Show All Work**: Write down each step of your calculations to keep track of your work and make it easier to review.

### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- **Verify Your Solution**: Check your calculations and ensure that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
- **Reflect on the Solution**: Consider whether there is another way to solve the problem or if the solution can be simplified.

### Example Problem
Let's apply this approach to a sample math problem:

**Problem**: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- We can solve this equation by isolating \( x \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
1. Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 4: Review/Check Your Work**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer**: \( x = 4 \)
