==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 327" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:  
     \[ P = 2L + 2W \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know \( P = 48 \) and \( L = 3W \).
   - Substitute these into the perimeter formula:  
     \[ 48 = 2(3W) + 2W \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression:  
     \[ 48 = 6W + 2W \]
   - Combine like terms:  
     \[ 48 = 8W \]

5. **Solve for W (Width):**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for W:  
     \[ W = \frac{48}{8} \]
     \[ W = 6 \]

6. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute the value of W:  
     \[ L = 3 \times 6 \]
     \[ L = 18 \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with these dimensions:  
     \[ P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48 \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 18 units

This approach demonstrates a clear, step-by-step method to solve a mathematical problem, ensuring all calculations and reasoning are shown.
