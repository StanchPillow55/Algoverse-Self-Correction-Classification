To solve the problem, we need to determine Herbert's current age based on the information given about Kris's age.

1. **Identify Kris's age**: The problem states that Kris is currently 24 years old.

2. **Determine Herbert's age**: We know that Herbert is 10 years younger than Kris. Therefore, we can calculate Herbert's current age by subtracting 10 from Kris's age:
   \[
   \text{Herbert's age} = \text{Kris's age} - 10
   \]
   Substituting Kris's age:
   \[
   \text{Herbert's age} = 24 - 10 = 14
   \]
   So, Herbert is currently 14 years old.

3. **Calculate Herbert's age next year**: To find out how old Herbert will be next year, we simply add 1 year to his current age:
   \[
   \text{Herbert's age next year} = \text{Herbert's current age} + 1
   \]
   Substituting Herbert's current age:
   \[
   \text{Herbert's age next year} = 14 + 1 = 15
   \]

Thus, Herbert will be 15 years old next year.

**Final Answer**: Herbert will be 15 years old next year.
