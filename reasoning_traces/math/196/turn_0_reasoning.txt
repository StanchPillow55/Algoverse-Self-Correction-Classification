==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine Herbert's current age and then calculate how old he will be next year.

1. **Identify Kris's current age:**
   - According to the problem, Kris is currently 24 years old.

2. **Determine Herbert's current age:**
   - The problem states that Herbert is 10 years younger than Kris.
   - To find Herbert's current age, we subtract 10 years from Kris's age:
     \[
     \text{Herbert's current age} = \text{Kris's age} - 10 = 24 - 10 = 14
     \]

3. **Calculate Herbert's age next year:**
   - To find out how old Herbert will be next year, we add 1 year to his current age:
     \[
     \text{Herbert's age next year} = \text{Herbert's current age} + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15
     \]

Therefore, Herbert will be 15 years old next year.

**Final Answer: Herbert will be 15 years old next year.**
