==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used after distributing them to the restaurants.

1. **Identify the total amount of carrots**: We start with 200 pounds of carrots.

2. **Determine how many pounds each restaurant will receive**: Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots.

3. **Calculate the total amount of carrots distributed**: Since there are 40 restaurants, we can calculate the total amount of carrots distributed by multiplying the number of restaurants by the amount each restaurant receives:
   \[
   \text{Total distributed} = \text{Number of restaurants} \times \text{Pounds per restaurant}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total distributed} = 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining carrots**: To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the total distributed from the initial amount of carrots:
   \[
   \text{Carrots not used} = \text{Total carrots} - \text{Total distributed}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Carrots not used} = 200 - 80 = 120 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Final answer**: Therefore, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
   \[
   \boxed{120}
   \]
