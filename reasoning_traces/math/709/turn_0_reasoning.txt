To solve the problem, we need to determine how many quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream can be produced in 48 hours.

### Step 1: Calculate the production rate for chocolate ice cream.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the rate of production per hour, we divide the total quarts by the total hours:

\[
\text{Rate of chocolate ice cream} = \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the production rate for vanilla ice cream.

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. Similarly, we find the rate of production per hour:

\[
\text{Rate of vanilla ice cream} = \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total production for each type of ice cream in 48 hours.

**Chocolate Ice Cream:**
Using the rate we calculated, we can find out how much chocolate ice cream is produced in 48 hours:

\[
\text{Total chocolate ice cream in 48 hours} = 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
\]

**Vanilla Ice Cream:**
Now, we calculate the total production of vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:

\[
\text{Total vanilla ice cream in 48 hours} = 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total production of both types of ice cream.

Now, we add the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream produced in 48 hours:

\[
\text{Total ice cream} = \text{Total chocolate ice cream} + \text{Total vanilla ice cream}
\]
\[
\text{Total ice cream} = 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
\]

### Final Answer:
The total amount of ice cream produced in 48 hours is **3000 quarts**.
