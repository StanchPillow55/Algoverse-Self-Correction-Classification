To solve the problem, we need to determine how much candy Ginger and Amy each have after two weeks, and then find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger at that point.

1. **Determine the number of days in two weeks:**
   \[
   2 \text{ weeks} = 2 \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Calculate how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks:**
   Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day. Therefore, in 14 days, she will eat:
   \[
   \text{Candy eaten by Ginger} = 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Calculate how much candy Ginger has left after two weeks:**
   Ginger starts with 100 pieces of candy. After eating 56 pieces, she has:
   \[
   \text{Candy left for Ginger} = 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Calculate how much candy Amy eats in two weeks:**
   Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day. Therefore, in 14 days, she will eat:
   \[
   \text{Candy eaten by Amy} = 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Calculate how much candy Amy has left after two weeks:**
   Amy starts with 100 pieces of candy. After eating 42 pieces, she has:
   \[
   \text{Candy left for Amy} = 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces}
   \]

6. **Determine how much more candy Amy has than Ginger:**
   Now we find the difference in the amount of candy they have left:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Candy left for Amy} - \text{Candy left for Ginger} = 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Thus, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

**Final Answer:**
Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks.
