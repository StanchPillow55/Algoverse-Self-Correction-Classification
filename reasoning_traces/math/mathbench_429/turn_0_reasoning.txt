==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 429" refers to. Since this is not a standard problem description, I'll assume it might be a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem in a textbook or resource that isn't provided here. Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 429 and solve it.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Find the sum of the digits of the number 429, and then determine if this sum is a prime number.

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 429:**
   - The number 429 consists of three digits: 4, 2, and 9.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(4 + 2 + 9\).

   \[
   4 + 2 + 9 = 15
   \]

3. **Determine if the sum (15) is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - Check the divisibility of 15:
     - 15 is divisible by 1, 3, 5, and 15.
     - Since 15 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sum of the digits of 429 is 15.
   - 15 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of 429 is 15, and 15 is not a prime number.
