==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 429" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I will assume that "429" is the number we need to work with, and I'll create a math problem involving this number. Let's consider a problem involving basic arithmetic operations with the number 429.

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 429, then multiply the result by 3. Finally, subtract 15 from the product.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 429:**
   - The number 429 consists of the digits 4, 2, and 9.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Sum = 4 + 2 + 9

   Let's calculate this step:
   \[
   4 + 2 = 6
   \]
   \[
   6 + 9 = 15
   \]

   So, the sum of the digits is 15.

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Product = 15 \times 3

   Let's calculate this step:
   \[
   15 \times 3 = 45
   \]

   So, the product is 45.

4. **Subtract 15 from the product:**
   - Result = 45 - 15

   Let's calculate this step:
   \[
   45 - 15 = 30
   \]

   So, the result after subtracting 15 is 30.

**Final Answer:**
The final result after performing all the operations is 30.
