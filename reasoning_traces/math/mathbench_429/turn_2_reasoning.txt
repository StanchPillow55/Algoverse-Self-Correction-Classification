==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 429, we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 429" is not a specific question, I'll assume it refers to a generic math problem that involves the number 429. Let's create a problem involving this number and solve it step by step.

### Problem:
Find the prime factorization of the number 429.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to express 429 as a product of prime numbers.

2. **Check for Divisibility:**
   - **Divisibility by 2:** 429 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - **Divisibility by 3:** Check if the sum of the digits (4 + 2 + 9 = 15) is divisible by 3. Since 15 is divisible by 3, 429 is also divisible by 3.

3. **Divide by 3:**
   \[
   429 \div 3 = 143
   \]
   So, 429 = 3 × 143.

4. **Factor 143:**
   - **Divisibility by 2:** 143 is odd, so not divisible by 2.
   - **Divisibility by 3:** Sum of the digits (1 + 4 + 3 = 8) is not divisible by 3.
   - **Divisibility by 5:** 143 does not end in 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5.
   - **Divisibility by 7:** Perform the division:
     \[
     143 \div 7 = 20.4286 \quad (\text{not an integer, so not divisible by 7})
     \]
   - **Divisibility by 11:** Check the alternating sum of digits: (1 - 4 + 3 = 0), which is divisible by 11.

5. **Divide by 11:**
   \[
   143 \div 11 = 13
   \]
   So, 143 = 11 × 13.

6. **Verify Primality of Remaining Factors:**
   - 11 is a prime number.
   - 13 is a prime number.

7. **Combine the Factors:**
   The prime factorization of 429 is:
   \[
   429 = 3 \times 11 \times 13
   \]

### Final Answer:
The prime factorization of 429 is \(3 \times 11 \times 13\).
