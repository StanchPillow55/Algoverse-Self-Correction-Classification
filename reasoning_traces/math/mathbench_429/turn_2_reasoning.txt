Question ID: mathbench_429
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 429, we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 429" is not specific enough to determine what the problem actually is. Therefore, I will assume that the problem number 429 is a placeholder for a specific math problem that needs to be solved.

Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I will create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 429" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 429:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 100 positive integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 100 positive integers. These integers are 1, 2, 3, ..., 100.

2. **Using the Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Series:**
   The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Value of \( n \):**
   In this problem, \( n = 100 \). Substitute 100 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{100(100 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Expression:**
   \[
   S = \frac{100 \times 101}{2}
   \]
   \[
   S = \frac{10100}{2}
   \]
   \[
   S = 5050
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 100 positive integers is 5050.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 100 positive integers is 5050.
