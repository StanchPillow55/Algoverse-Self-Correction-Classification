==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 429, we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 429" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. Since no specific details or numbers are provided, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. 

Let's consider a hypothetical math problem involving the number 429. Suppose the problem is:

"Find the sum of the digits of the number 429."

To solve this problem, we need to break down the number 429 into its individual digits and then add those digits together.

1. **Identify the digits of the number 429:**
   - The number 429 consists of three digits: 4, 2, and 9.

2. **Add the digits together:**
   - Sum = 4 + 2 + 9

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add 4 and 2:
     \[
     4 + 2 = 6
     \]
   - Next, add the result to 9:
     \[
     6 + 9 = 15
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sum of the digits of the number 429 is 15.

Therefore, the final answer to the problem is 15.
