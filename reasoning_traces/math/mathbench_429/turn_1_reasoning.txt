==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 429," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 429" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not provided here.

To proceed, I will assume that "Sample math problem 429" is a reference to a specific math problem that you have in mind. Since I don't have the details of the problem, I will create a hypothetical math problem related to the number 429 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Determine if the number 429 is a prime number. If it is not, find its prime factorization.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Definition of a Prime Number:**
   A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Check if 429 is Prime:**
   To determine if 429 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and 429.

3. **Check Divisibility by Small Prime Numbers:**
   We will check divisibility by small prime numbers up to the approximate square root of 429. The square root of 429 is approximately 20.7, so we will check divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to 20.

   - **Divisibility by 2:** 429 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - **Divisibility by 3:** Sum of digits of 429 is 4 + 2 + 9 = 15, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 429 is divisible by 3.

4. **Divide 429 by 3:**
   \[
   429 \div 3 = 143
   \]
   So, 429 = 3 × 143.

5. **Check if 143 is Prime:**
   We need to check if 143 is a prime number by checking divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 143, which is approximately 11.95.

   - **Divisibility by 2:** 143 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - **Divisibility by 3:** Sum of digits of 143 is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8, which is not divisible by 3.
   - **Divisibility by 5:** 143 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
   - **Divisibility by 7:** Perform the division:
     \[
     143 \div 7 = 20.4286 \ldots
     \]
     143 is not divisible by 7.
   - **Divisibility by 11:** Check using the alternating sum rule: (1 - 4 + 3) = 0, which is divisible by 11.

6. **Divide 143 by 11:**
   \[
   143 \div 11 = 13
   \]
   So, 143 = 11 × 13.

7. **Verify Primality of 13:**
   13 is a prime number.

8. **Prime Factorization of 429:**
   Combining all the factors, we have:
   \[
   429 = 3 \times 11 \times 13
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The number 429 is not a prime number. Its prime factorization is \( 3 \times 11 \times 13 \).
