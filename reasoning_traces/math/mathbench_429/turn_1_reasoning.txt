==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 429" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I will assume it is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's consider a common type of math problem that might be labeled as "Sample math problem 429" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 429" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation, as this is a common type of math problem. Here is a sample quadratic equation:

\[ x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \]

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients**

In the quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the coefficients are:
- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = -5 \)
- \( c = 6 \)

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula**

The quadratic formula is given by:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the discriminant**

The discriminant (\( \Delta \)) is the part under the square root in the quadratic formula:

\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \]

Substitute the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

\[ \Delta = (-5)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 6 \]
\[ \Delta = 25 - 24 \]
\[ \Delta = 1 \]

Since the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots.

**Step 4: Calculate the roots using the quadratic formula**

Substitute the values into the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{1}}{2 \times 1} \]
\[ x = \frac{5 \pm 1}{2} \]

Calculate the two possible values for \( x \):

1. \( x = \frac{5 + 1}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)
2. \( x = \frac{5 - 1}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \)

**Step 5: State the final answer**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \) are:

\[ x = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad x = 2 \]

These are the roots of the equation. Therefore, the final answer is:

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the equation are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 2 \).
