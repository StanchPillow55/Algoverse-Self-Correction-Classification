To determine how much James pays for insurance per year after the increase due to his accident, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the normal cost of insurance**: 
   The normal cost of insurance is given as $120 per month.

2. **Calculate the increase in cost due to the accident**: 
   The problem states that the cost is 60% more than the normal cost. To find 60% of the normal cost, we can use the following calculation:

   \[
   \text{Increase} = \text{Normal Cost} \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Increase} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72
   \]

3. **Calculate the new cost of insurance**: 
   Now, we add the increase to the normal cost to find the new monthly cost:

   \[
   \text{New Cost} = \text{Normal Cost} + \text{Increase} = 120 + 72
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   \text{New Cost} = 120 + 72 = 192
   \]

   So, James will now pay $192 per month for insurance.

4. **Calculate the annual cost of insurance**: 
   To find out how much James pays for insurance in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year (12):

   \[
   \text{Annual Cost} = \text{New Cost} \times 12 = 192 \times 12
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Annual Cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304
   \]

Thus, the total amount James pays for insurance in a year is **$2304**.

**Final Answer**: James pays $2304 a year for insurance.
