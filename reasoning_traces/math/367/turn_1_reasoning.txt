==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of Emily's salary she would need to allocate to ensure that all of her 10 employees receive a salary of $35,000 per year.

### Step 1: Calculate the total salary needed for the employees

First, we need to find out how much money is required to pay all 10 employees at the new salary of $35,000 each.

\[
\text{Total salary for employees} = \text{Number of employees} \times \text{New salary per employee}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total salary for employees} = 10 \times 35,000 = 350,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the current total salary for the employees

Next, we calculate how much Emily is currently spending on her employees, who are currently making $20,000 each.

\[
\text{Current total salary for employees} = \text{Number of employees} \times \text{Current salary per employee}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Current total salary for employees} = 10 \times 20,000 = 200,000
\]

### Step 3: Determine the additional amount needed

Now, we need to find out how much additional money is required to raise the employees' salaries from $20,000 to $35,000.

\[
\text{Additional amount needed} = \text{Total salary for employees} - \text{Current total salary for employees}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Additional amount needed} = 350,000 - 200,000 = 150,000
\]

### Step 4: Adjust Emily's salary

Emily currently makes $1,000,000 per year. If she decides to allocate $150,000 from her salary to cover the additional amount needed for her employees, we can calculate her new salary.

\[
\text{New salary for Emily} = \text{Current salary} - \text{Additional amount needed}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{New salary for Emily} = 1,000,000 - 150,000 = 850,000
\]

### Final Answer

Therefore, if Emily takes part of her salary to ensure all of her employees make $35,000 per year, her new salary would be:

\[
\boxed{850,000}
\]
