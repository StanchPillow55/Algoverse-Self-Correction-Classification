Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of Emily's salary should be redistributed to her employees so that each employee earns $35,000 per year instead of $20,000 per year.

1. **Calculate the current total salary for all employees:**

   Each employee currently earns $20,000 per year. With 10 employees, the total salary for all employees is:
   \[
   10 \times 20,000 = 200,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the desired total salary for all employees:**

   Each employee should earn $35,000 per year. With 10 employees, the total desired salary for all employees is:
   \[
   10 \times 35,000 = 350,000
   \]

3. **Determine the additional amount needed to meet the desired salary:**

   The additional amount required to increase the total salary from $200,000 to $350,000 is:
   \[
   350,000 - 200,000 = 150,000
   \]

4. **Adjust Emily's salary:**

   Emily needs to take $150,000 from her salary to cover the increase in her employees' salaries. Her original salary is $1,000,000. Therefore, her new salary will be:
   \[
   1,000,000 - 150,000 = 850,000
   \]

Thus, if Emily redistributes part of her salary to ensure each of her employees earns $35,000 per year, her new salary would be **$850,000**.
