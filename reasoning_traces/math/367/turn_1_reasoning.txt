Question ID: 367
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will define variables and set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting.
   - Let \( z \) be the number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
   - Let \( o \) be the number of customers kicked out for other reasons.

2. **Information Given**:
   - From the problem, we know that:
     - \( x = 3 \) (3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks).
     - The number of shoplifters \( y \) is given by the equation: 
       \[
       y = 4x - 5
       \]
     - The number of customers kicked out for physical violence \( z \) is given by:
       \[
       z = 3y
       \]
     - The total number of customers kicked out is 50:
       \[
       x + y + z + o = 50
       \]

3. **Calculate \( y \)**:
   - Substitute \( x = 3 \) into the equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
     \]

4. **Calculate \( z \)**:
   - Now substitute \( y = 7 \) into the equation for \( z \):
     \[
     z = 3(7) = 21
     \]

5. **Substitute into the Total Equation**:
   - Now we can substitute \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) into the total equation:
     \[
     3 + 7 + 21 + o = 50
     \]

6. **Solve for \( o \)**:
   - Combine the known values:
     \[
     31 + o = 50
     \]
   - Now, isolate \( o \):
     \[
     o = 50 - 31 = 19
     \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   - The number of customers kicked out for other reasons is \( \boxed{19} \).
