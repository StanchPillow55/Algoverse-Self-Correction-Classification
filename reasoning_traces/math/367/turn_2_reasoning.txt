Question ID: 367
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of Emily's salary she would need to allocate to ensure that all of her 10 employees earn $35,000 per year. We will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total salary needed for the employees at $35,000 each.**
2. **Determine how much Emily would need to reduce her salary to cover this increase.**
3. **Calculate Emily's new salary after the reduction.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total salary needed for the employees

Emily has 10 employees, and each employee will earn $35,000 per year. Therefore, the total salary needed for all employees is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total salary for employees} = \text{Number of employees} \times \text{Salary per employee}
\]

\[
\text{Total salary for employees} = 10 \times 35,000 = 350,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the current total salary for the employees

Currently, each of Emily's 10 employees makes $20,000 per year. The current total salary for all employees is:

\[
\text{Current total salary for employees} = 10 \times 20,000 = 200,000
\]

### Step 3: Determine the additional amount needed

To find out how much more money is needed to raise the employees' salaries from $20,000 to $35,000, we subtract the current total salary from the total salary needed:

\[
\text{Additional amount needed} = \text{Total salary for employees} - \text{Current total salary for employees}
\]

\[
\text{Additional amount needed} = 350,000 - 200,000 = 150,000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Emily's new salary

Emily currently makes $1,000,000 per year. If she allocates $150,000 from her salary to cover the additional salary for her employees, her new salary will be:

\[
\text{Emily's new salary} = \text{Current salary} - \text{Additional amount needed}
\]

\[
\text{Emily's new salary} = 1,000,000 - 150,000 = 850,000
\]

### Final Answer

Emily's new salary, after reallocating part of her salary to ensure her employees make $35,000 per year, would be:

\[
\boxed{850,000}
\]
