==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of Emily's salary should be redistributed to her employees so that each of them earns $35,000 per year. We will then calculate Emily's new salary after this redistribution.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Current Salary of Employees:**
   - Each employee currently makes $20,000 per year.
   - There are 10 employees.
   - Total current salary for all employees = 10 employees × $20,000/employee = $200,000.

2. **Desired Salary for Employees:**
   - Each employee should make $35,000 per year.
   - Total desired salary for all employees = 10 employees × $35,000/employee = $350,000.

3. **Additional Amount Needed:**
   - Additional amount needed to increase all employees' salaries to $35,000 = Total desired salary - Total current salary.
   - Additional amount needed = $350,000 - $200,000 = $150,000.

4. **Emily's Current Salary:**
   - Emily currently makes $1,000,000 per year.

5. **Emily's New Salary:**
   - Emily will use $150,000 of her salary to increase her employees' salaries.
   - Emily's new salary = Emily's current salary - Additional amount needed.
   - Emily's new salary = $1,000,000 - $150,000 = $850,000.

### Conclusion:

After redistributing part of her salary to ensure all her employees make $35,000 per year, Emily's new salary would be $850,000.

**Final Answer: Emily's new salary would be $850,000.**
