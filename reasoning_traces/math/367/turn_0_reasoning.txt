To determine how much Emily's salary would be if she reallocates part of her salary to ensure all of her employees earn $35,000 per year, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the current total salary of the employees**:
   Emily has 10 employees, each making $20,000 per year. Therefore, the total salary for all employees is:
   \[
   \text{Total salary of employees} = \text{Number of employees} \times \text{Salary per employee} = 10 \times 20,000 = 200,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the new total salary for the employees**:
   If each employee is to earn $35,000 per year, the new total salary for all employees would be:
   \[
   \text{New total salary of employees} = \text{Number of employees} \times \text{New salary per employee} = 10 \times 35,000 = 350,000
   \]

3. **Determine the additional amount needed**:
   To find out how much more money is needed to raise the employees' salaries from $20,000 to $35,000, we subtract the current total salary from the new total salary:
   \[
   \text{Additional amount needed} = \text{New total salary} - \text{Current total salary} = 350,000 - 200,000 = 150,000
   \]

4. **Calculate Emily's new salary**:
   Emily currently makes $1,000,000 per year. If she reallocates $150,000 of her salary to cover the additional amount needed for her employees, her new salary would be:
   \[
   \text{Emily's new salary} = \text{Current salary} - \text{Amount reallocated} = 1,000,000 - 150,000 = 850,000
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, if Emily reallocates part of her salary to ensure all of her employees make $35,000 per year, her new salary would be:
   \[
   \boxed{850,000}
   \]
