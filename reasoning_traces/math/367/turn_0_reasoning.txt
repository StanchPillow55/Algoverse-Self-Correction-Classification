==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks**:
   - We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.

2. **Determine the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting**:
   - According to the problem, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is equal to four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of shoplifters.
   - Therefore, we can express this as:
     \[
     S = 4 \times 3 - 5
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     S = 12 - 5 = 7
     \]
   - So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

3. **Determine the number of customers kicked out for physical violence**:
   - The problem states that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence.
   - Let \( V \) be the number of customers kicked out for physical violence.
   - Thus, we can express this as:
     \[
     V = 3 \times S = 3 \times 7
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     V = 21
     \]
   - So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence.

4. **Calculate the total number of customers kicked out**:
   - Now we can find the total number of customers kicked out by adding the numbers from each category:
     \[
     \text{Total kicked out} = \text{Mask refusals} + \text{Shoplifters} + \text{Violence}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total kicked out} = 3 + 7 + 21
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     \text{Total kicked out} = 31
     \]

5. **Determine the number of customers kicked out for other reasons**:
   - The problem states that a total of 50 people were kicked out of Walmart.
   - To find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the total we calculated from the overall total:
     \[
     \text{Other reasons} = \text{Total kicked out} - \text{Total known reasons}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Other reasons} = 50 - 31
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     \text{Other reasons} = 19
     \]

Finally, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is \( \boxed{19} \).
