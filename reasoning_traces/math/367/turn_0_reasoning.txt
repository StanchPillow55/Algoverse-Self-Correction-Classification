To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of Emily's salary should be redistributed to her employees so that each employee earns $35,000 per year. We will then calculate Emily's new salary after this redistribution.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Current Salary of Employees:**
   - Each employee currently makes $20,000 per year.
   - There are 10 employees.
   - Total current salary for all employees = \( 10 \times 20,000 = 200,000 \) dollars per year.

2. **Desired Salary for Employees:**
   - Each employee should make $35,000 per year.
   - Total desired salary for all employees = \( 10 \times 35,000 = 350,000 \) dollars per year.

3. **Additional Amount Needed:**
   - Additional amount needed for all employees to reach the desired salary = Total desired salary - Total current salary
   - Additional amount needed = \( 350,000 - 200,000 = 150,000 \) dollars per year.

4. **Emily's Current Salary:**
   - Emily currently makes $1,000,000 per year.

5. **Emily's New Salary Calculation:**
   - Emily will use part of her salary to cover the additional $150,000 needed for her employees.
   - Emily's new salary = Emily's current salary - Additional amount needed
   - Emily's new salary = \( 1,000,000 - 150,000 = 850,000 \) dollars per year.

### Conclusion:

After redistributing part of her salary to ensure all her employees make $35,000 per year, Emily's new salary would be $850,000 per year.

**Final Answer: Emily's new salary would be $850,000 per year.**
