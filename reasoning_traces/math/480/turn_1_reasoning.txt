To solve this problem, we need to calculate Kirt's total earnings over a period of 3 years, taking into account the salary increase after the first year. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Determine Kirt's initial annual salary

Kirt's initial monthly salary is $6000. To find his annual salary for the first year, we multiply his monthly salary by the number of months in a year:

\[ 
\text{Initial annual salary} = 6000 \, \text{dollars/month} \times 12 \, \text{months/year} = 72,000 \, \text{dollars/year}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the salary increase after one year

After one year, Kirt's salary increases by 30%. To find the new monthly salary after the increase, we calculate 30% of the initial monthly salary and add it to the initial monthly salary:

\[ 
\text{Increase amount} = 6000 \, \text{dollars/month} \times 0.30 = 1800 \, \text{dollars/month}
\]

\[ 
\text{New monthly salary} = 6000 \, \text{dollars/month} + 1800 \, \text{dollars/month} = 7800 \, \text{dollars/month}
\]

### Step 3: Determine Kirt's annual salary for the second and third years

With the new monthly salary, we calculate the annual salary for the second and third years:

\[ 
\text{New annual salary} = 7800 \, \text{dollars/month} \times 12 \, \text{months/year} = 93,600 \, \text{dollars/year}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate total earnings over 3 years

Now, we calculate the total earnings over the 3-year period. This includes the initial annual salary for the first year and the new annual salary for the second and third years:

\[ 
\text{Total earnings} = \text{First year earnings} + \text{Second year earnings} + \text{Third year earnings}
\]

\[ 
\text{Total earnings} = 72,000 \, \text{dollars} + 93,600 \, \text{dollars} + 93,600 \, \text{dollars}
\]

\[ 
\text{Total earnings} = 72,000 \, \text{dollars} + 187,200 \, \text{dollars}
\]

\[ 
\text{Total earnings} = 259,200 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Kirt's total earnings after 3 years are $259,200.
