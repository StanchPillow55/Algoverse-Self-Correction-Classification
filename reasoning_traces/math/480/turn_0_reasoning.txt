To find Kirt's total earnings after 3 years, we will first calculate his salary after the increase and then determine his total earnings over the 3-year period.

### Step 1: Calculate the salary increase
Kirt's initial monthly salary is $6000. After one year, his salary increases by 30%. 

To find the amount of the increase:
\[
\text{Increase} = \text{Initial Salary} \times \text{Percentage Increase}
\]
\[
\text{Increase} = 6000 \times 0.30 = 1800
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the new salary after the increase
Now, we add the increase to the initial salary to find Kirt's new monthly salary:
\[
\text{New Salary} = \text{Initial Salary} + \text{Increase}
\]
\[
\text{New Salary} = 6000 + 1800 = 7800
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total earnings over 3 years
Kirt's earnings can be broken down into two parts:
1. Earnings for the first year (12 months at $6000)
2. Earnings for the next two years (24 months at $7800)

#### Earnings for the first year:
\[
\text{Earnings for Year 1} = 6000 \times 12 = 72000
\]

#### Earnings for the next two years:
\[
\text{Earnings for Year 2} = 7800 \times 12 = 93600
\]
\[
\text{Earnings for Year 3} = 7800 \times 12 = 93600
\]

### Step 4: Calculate total earnings for 3 years
Now we sum the earnings from all three years:
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings for Year 1} + \text{Earnings for Year 2} + \text{Earnings for Year 3}
\]
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = 72000 + 93600 + 93600
\]
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = 72000 + 187200 = 259200
\]

### Final Answer
Kirt's total earnings after 3 years is \(\boxed{259200}\).
