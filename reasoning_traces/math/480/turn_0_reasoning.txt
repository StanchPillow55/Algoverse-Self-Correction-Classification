To solve this problem, we need to calculate Kirt's total earnings over a period of 3 years, considering his initial salary and the increase after the first year. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate Kirt's initial annual salary
Kirt's initial monthly salary is $6000. To find his annual salary, we multiply his monthly salary by the number of months in a year:

\[
\text{Initial annual salary} = 6000 \times 12 = 72000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the salary increase after one year
After one year, Kirt's salary increases by 30%. To find the new monthly salary, we calculate 30% of his initial monthly salary and add it to the initial salary:

\[
\text{Increase in monthly salary} = 6000 \times 0.30 = 1800
\]

\[
\text{New monthly salary} = 6000 + 1800 = 7800
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Kirt's new annual salary after the increase
With the new monthly salary, we calculate the annual salary for the second and third years:

\[
\text{New annual salary} = 7800 \times 12 = 93600
\]

### Step 4: Calculate total earnings over 3 years
Now, we calculate the total earnings over the 3-year period. This includes one year at the initial salary and two years at the increased salary:

- Earnings for the first year: $72,000
- Earnings for the second year: $93,600
- Earnings for the third year: $93,600

Add these amounts together to find the total earnings over 3 years:

\[
\text{Total earnings over 3 years} = 72000 + 93600 + 93600 = 259200
\]

### Final Answer
Kirt's total earnings after 3 years are $259,200.
