==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate Kirt's total earnings over the course of three years, taking into account his salary increase after the first year.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Initial Salary:**
   - Kirt's initial monthly salary is $6000.

2. **First Year Earnings:**
   - Since his salary remains constant during the first year, we calculate his earnings for the first year as follows:
   \[
   \text{First Year Earnings} = \text{Monthly Salary} \times \text{Number of Months in a Year} = 6000 \times 12 = 72000
   \]
   - Therefore, Kirt earns $72,000 in the first year.

3. **Salary Increase:**
   - After the first year, Kirt receives a 30% salary increase. We calculate the new salary as follows:
   \[
   \text{Salary Increase} = \text{Initial Salary} \times \text{Percentage Increase} = 6000 \times 0.30 = 1800
   \]
   - New Monthly Salary after the increase:
   \[
   \text{New Monthly Salary} = \text{Initial Salary} + \text{Salary Increase} = 6000 + 1800 = 7800
   \]

4. **Second and Third Year Earnings:**
   - With the new salary, we calculate Kirt's earnings for each of the next two years:
   \[
   \text{Earnings for One Year at New Salary} = \text{New Monthly Salary} \times \text{Number of Months in a Year} = 7800 \times 12 = 93600
   \]
   - Therefore, Kirt earns $93,600 in each of the second and third years.

5. **Total Earnings Over Three Years:**
   - We sum up the earnings for each year to find the total earnings over the three years:
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = \text{First Year Earnings} + \text{Second Year Earnings} + \text{Third Year Earnings} = 72000 + 93600 + 93600
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = 72000 + 93600 \times 2 = 72000 + 187200 = 259200
   \]

### Final Answer:
Kirt's total earnings after 3 years are $259,200.
