2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Creating an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your calculations.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Ensure that all parts of the problem have been addressed.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's consider a simple example problem:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length of 10 units and a width of 5 units. What is the area of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a rectangle.
   - We are given the length (10 units) and the width (5 units).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the area of a rectangle: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the given values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ square units}
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Recalculate to ensure accuracy:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - The calculation is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the rectangle is 50 square units.
