To find out how many pets Larry has, we will break down the problem step by step, calculating the number of each type of pet he has.

1. **Cats**: 
   - Larry has 3 cats.
   \[
   \text{Cats} = 3
   \]

2. **Dogs**: 
   - Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, we calculate the number of dogs as follows:
   \[
   \text{Dogs} = 3 \times \text{Cats} = 3 \times 3 = 9
   \]

3. **Rabbits**: 
   - Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, we calculate the number of rabbits as follows:
   \[
   \text{Rabbits} = \text{Dogs} - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7
   \]

4. **Fish**: 
   - Larry has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, we calculate the number of fish as follows:
   \[
   \text{Fish} = 3 \times \text{Rabbits} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

5. **Gerbils**: 
   - Larry has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. Therefore, we calculate the number of gerbils as follows:
   \[
   \text{Gerbils} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Fish} = \frac{1}{3} \times 21 = 7
   \]

Now that we have calculated the number of each type of pet, we can sum them up to find the total number of pets Larry has:

\[
\text{Total Pets} = \text{Cats} + \text{Dogs} + \text{Rabbits} + \text{Fish} + \text{Gerbils}
\]
Substituting the values we found:
\[
\text{Total Pets} = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7
\]

Now we perform the addition step by step:
- First, add the cats and dogs:
\[
3 + 9 = 12
\]
- Next, add the rabbits:
\[
12 + 7 = 19
\]
- Then, add the fish:
\[
19 + 21 = 40
\]
- Finally, add the gerbils:
\[
40 + 7 = 47
\]

Thus, the total number of pets Larry has is:
\[
\boxed{47}
\]
