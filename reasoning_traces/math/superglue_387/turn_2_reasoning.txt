==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 387." However, since the problem statement itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is 10 meters longer than its width. The area of the field is 600 square meters. What are the dimensions of the field?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the field in meters.
   - Then, the length of the field is \( w + 10 \) meters.

2. **Write the Equation for Area:**
   - The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values, we have:
     \[
     600 = (w + 10) \times w
     \]

3. **Expand and Simplify the Equation:**
   - Expanding the right-hand side:
     \[
     600 = w^2 + 10w
     \]

4. **Rearrange the Equation:**
   - Bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:
     \[
     w^2 + 10w - 600 = 0
     \]

5. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - We can solve this using the quadratic formula, where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 10 \), and \( c = -600 \):
     \[
     w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = 10^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-600) = 100 + 2400 = 2500
     \]
   - Since the discriminant is a perfect square, we proceed:
     \[
     w = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{2500}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     w = \frac{-10 \pm 50}{2}
     \]
   - This gives two potential solutions for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \quad \text{or} \quad w = \frac{-60}{2} = -30
     \]

6. **Interpret the Solutions:**
   - Since a width cannot be negative, we discard \( w = -30 \).
   - Thus, \( w = 20 \).

7. **Find the Length:**
   - Substitute \( w = 20 \) back into the expression for the length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = w + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the area with these dimensions:
     \[
     \text{Area} = 30 \times 20 = 600 \, \text{square meters}
     \]
   - The calculated area matches the given area, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the field are 20 meters in width and 30 meters in length.
