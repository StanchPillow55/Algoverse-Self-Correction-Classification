Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 387" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details or numbers, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a reasoning or logic-based question. 

Let's break down the steps typically involved in solving a reasoning problem:

1. **Understand the Problem**: 
   - Identify what is being asked. 
   - Determine if there are any specific conditions or constraints.

2. **Gather Information**: 
   - List any known facts or data.
   - Identify any patterns or relationships.

3. **Develop a Plan**: 
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem.
   - Choose the most efficient method based on the information available.

4. **Execute the Plan**: 
   - Carry out the calculations or logical steps.
   - Keep track of your work to ensure accuracy.

5. **Review and Verify**: 
   - Check your work for errors.
   - Ensure the solution meets all the conditions of the problem.

6. **State the Final Answer**: 
   - Clearly present the solution.

Since the problem is labeled "Sample reasoning question 387" without additional context, let's assume it's a logic puzzle or a mathematical reasoning question. I'll create a hypothetical example to illustrate the process:

**Example Problem**: 
"Three friends, Alex, Blake, and Casey, are sitting in a row. Alex is not sitting at either end. Blake is sitting to the right of Alex. Who is sitting in the middle?"

**Solution**:

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - We have three people: Alex, Blake, and Casey.
   - Alex is not at either end.
   - Blake is to the right of Alex.

2. **Gather Information**:
   - If Alex is not at either end, Alex must be in the middle.
   - Blake is to the right of Alex, so Blake must be at the right end.

3. **Develop a Plan**:
   - Determine the seating arrangement based on the given conditions.

4. **Execute the Plan**:
   - Since Alex is in the middle and Blake is to the right of Alex, the arrangement must be: Casey, Alex, Blake.

5. **Review and Verify**:
   - Check that all conditions are satisfied:
     - Alex is not at either end (correct, Alex is in the middle).
     - Blake is to the right of Alex (correct, Blake is at the right end).

6. **State the Final Answer**:
   - Alex is sitting in the middle.

In this hypothetical example, the final answer is that Alex is sitting in the middle. 

Since the original problem did not provide specific details, this example demonstrates the typical reasoning process for solving such problems. If you have a specific problem or more details, please provide them for a more targeted solution.
