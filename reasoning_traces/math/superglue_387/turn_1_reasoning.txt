Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 387" refers to. Unfortunately, without additional context or specific details about the problem, it's impossible to provide a precise solution. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a typical math problem.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 387" is a math problem involving basic arithmetic or algebra. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving a typical math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution answers the question.
   - Check the calculations for errors.
   - Consider whether the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.

Since we don't have the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 387," let's create a hypothetical example to illustrate the process:

**Example Problem:**
A farmer has 387 apples. He wants to distribute them equally among 9 baskets. How many apples will each basket contain?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to divide 387 apples equally among 9 baskets.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use division to find out how many apples each basket will contain.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Divide 387 by 9.
   - \( 387 \div 9 = 43 \)

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Multiply the number of apples per basket by the number of baskets to ensure it equals the total number of apples.
   - \( 43 \times 9 = 387 \), which matches the original number of apples.

**Final Answer:**
Each basket will contain 43 apples.

If you have a specific problem or additional details about "Sample reasoning question 387," please provide them, and I can offer a more tailored solution.
