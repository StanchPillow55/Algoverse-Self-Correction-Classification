==================================================

To solve the problem, I first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 387" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a mathematical problem that requires step-by-step reasoning. Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and earned $30,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of widgets sold is 500. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue from selling these widgets is $30,000. Therefore, the revenue equation is:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 30,000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 500 \\
     50x + 70y &= 30,000
     \end{align*}
     \]

   - Solve the first equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into the second equation:
     \[
     50x + 70(500 - x) = 30,000
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     50x + 35,000 - 70x = 30,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x + 35,000 = 30,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = 30,000 - 35,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = -5,000
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-5,000}{-20} = 250
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 250 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - 250 = 250
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of widgets:
     \[
     x + y = 250 + 250 = 500
     \]
   - Check the total revenue:
     \[
     50(250) + 70(250) = 12,500 + 17,500 = 30,000
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 250 Type A widgets and 250 Type B widgets.
