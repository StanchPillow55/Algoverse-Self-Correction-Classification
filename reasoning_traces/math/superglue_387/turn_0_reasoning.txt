==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 387" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I will create a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces 387 units of a product each day. Each unit requires 3 hours of labor to produce. If the company employs 9 workers, each working 8 hours a day, how many days will it take to produce 387 units?

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total labor hours required to produce 387 units:**

   Each unit requires 3 hours of labor. Therefore, for 387 units, the total labor hours required is:
   \[
   387 \text{ units} \times 3 \text{ hours/unit} = 1161 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total labor hours available per day:**

   The company employs 9 workers, and each worker works 8 hours a day. Therefore, the total labor hours available per day is:
   \[
   9 \text{ workers} \times 8 \text{ hours/worker} = 72 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of days required to produce 387 units:**

   To find out how many days it will take to complete 1161 hours of work with 72 hours available per day, we divide the total hours required by the hours available per day:
   \[
   \frac{1161 \text{ hours}}{72 \text{ hours/day}} \approx 16.125 \text{ days}
   \]

   Since the company cannot work a fraction of a day, they will need to work for 17 full days to complete the production of 387 units.

**Final Answer:**

It will take the company 17 days to produce 387 units.
