To solve the problem, we need to determine how many squares Marla colors green in her grid. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of squares in the grid:**
   - The grid has 10 rows and 15 squares in each row.
   - Total squares = Number of rows × Number of squares per row
   \[
   \text{Total squares} = 10 \times 15 = 150
   \]

2. **Identify the squares colored red:**
   - Marla colors 4 rows of 6 squares in the middle of the grid with red.
   - The middle rows can be identified as rows 4, 5, 6, and 7 (since there are 10 rows total).
   - Each of these 4 rows has 6 squares colored red.
   - Total red squares = Number of red rows × Number of red squares per row
   \[
   \text{Total red squares} = 4 \times 6 = 24
   \]

3. **Identify the squares colored blue:**
   - Marla colors all squares in the first 2 rows and the last 2 rows with blue.
   - The first 2 rows are rows 1 and 2, and the last 2 rows are rows 9 and 10.
   - Each of these 4 rows has 15 squares.
   - Total blue squares = Number of blue rows × Number of squares per row
   \[
   \text{Total blue squares} = 4 \times 15 = 60
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of squares colored red and blue:**
   - We need to add the number of red squares and blue squares.
   \[
   \text{Total colored squares} = \text{Total red squares} + \text{Total blue squares}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total colored squares} = 24 + 60 = 84
   \]

5. **Determine the number of squares colored green:**
   - To find the number of squares colored green, we subtract the total colored squares from the total squares in the grid.
   \[
   \text{Total green squares} = \text{Total squares} - \text{Total colored squares}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total green squares} = 150 - 84 = 66
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Marla colors **66 squares green**.
