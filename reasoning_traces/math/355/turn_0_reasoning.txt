==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many squares Marla colors green on the grid. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the Total Number of Squares
The grid has 10 rows, and each row contains 15 squares. Therefore, the total number of squares in the grid is calculated as follows:

\[
10 \text{ rows} \times 15 \text{ squares per row} = 150 \text{ squares}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Squares Colored Red
Marla colors 4 rows of 6 squares in the middle of the grid with red. Since there are 10 rows, the middle 4 rows are rows 4, 5, 6, and 7. In each of these rows, she colors 6 squares red. Therefore, the total number of red squares is:

\[
4 \text{ rows} \times 6 \text{ squares per row} = 24 \text{ red squares}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Squares Colored Blue
Marla colors all squares on the first 2 rows and the last 2 rows with blue. Each of these rows has 15 squares. Therefore, the total number of blue squares is:

\[
(2 \text{ rows} + 2 \text{ rows}) \times 15 \text{ squares per row} = 4 \text{ rows} \times 15 \text{ squares per row} = 60 \text{ blue squares}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Squares Colored Green
The remaining squares are colored green. To find the number of green squares, we subtract the number of red and blue squares from the total number of squares:

\[
150 \text{ total squares} - 24 \text{ red squares} - 60 \text{ blue squares} = 66 \text{ green squares}
\]

### Conclusion
Marla colors 66 squares green. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{66}
\]
