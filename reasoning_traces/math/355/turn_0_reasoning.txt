Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will first define the heights of the trees based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the height of the shortest tree:**
   - The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.
   - Let \( h_1 = 6 \) feet.

2. **Determine the height of the second tree:**
   - The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree.
   - Therefore, the height of the second tree \( h_2 \) can be calculated as:
   \[
   h_2 = h_1 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the combined height of the two shorter trees:**
   - The combined height of the shortest tree and the second tree is:
   \[
   \text{Combined height} = h_1 + h_2 = 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Determine the height of the tallest tree:**
   - The tallest tree has a height that is twice the combined height of the two shorter trees.
   - Therefore, the height of the tallest tree \( h_3 \) is:
   \[
   h_3 = 2 \times \text{Combined height} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet}
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - The height of the tallest tree is \( \boxed{34} \) feet.
