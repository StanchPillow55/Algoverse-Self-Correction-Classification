==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 49" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details or context, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by breaking it down into logical steps. Let's assume a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 49 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 49 positive integers. This is a classic problem that can be solved using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

2. **Identify the Arithmetic Series:**
   The series of the first 49 positive integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 49.

3. **Use the Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Series:**
   The formula for the sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) positive integers is:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms.

4. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 49 \). Substitute 49 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{49(49 + 1)}{2}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Sum:**
   First, calculate \( 49 + 1 \):
   \[
   49 + 1 = 50
   \]
   Next, multiply 49 by 50:
   \[
   49 \times 50 = 2450
   \]
   Finally, divide by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S = \frac{2450}{2} = 1225
   \]

6. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure accuracy, let's verify using a different approach. The sum of the first \( n \) integers can also be verified by pairing numbers from the start and end of the series:
   - Pair: (1 + 49), (2 + 48), ..., (24 + 26), and the middle number 25.
   - Each pair sums to 50, and there are 24 such pairs.
   - So, the sum of pairs is \( 24 \times 50 = 1200 \).
   - Add the middle number 25: \( 1200 + 25 = 1225 \).

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 49 positive integers is 1225.
