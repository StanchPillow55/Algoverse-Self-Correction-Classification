==================================================

To solve the problem titled "Sample reasoning question 49," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is missing, so let's assume a generic math problem to demonstrate the process of solving it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**

The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

- Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left:
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**

Now that we have \( 2x = 8 \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[
x = \frac{8}{2}
\]
Simplifying the right side gives:
\[
x = 4
\]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
Calculating the left side:
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
