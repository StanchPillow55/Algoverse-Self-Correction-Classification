To find out how much Tom pays for car washes in a year, we can break the problem down into a few simple steps.

1. **Determine the monthly cost of car washes**:
   Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. We can calculate the total monthly cost by multiplying the number of car washes by the cost per wash.

   \[
   \text{Monthly Cost} = \text{Number of Car Washes} \times \text{Cost per Car Wash}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Cost} = 4 \times 15
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Cost} = 60
   \]

   So, Tom pays $60 each month for car washes.

2. **Calculate the annual cost of car washes**:
   To find out how much Tom pays in a year, we need to multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year (which is 12).

   \[
   \text{Annual Cost} = \text{Monthly Cost} \times \text{Number of Months}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Annual Cost} = 60 \times 12
   \]
   \[
   \text{Annual Cost} = 720
   \]

Therefore, Tom pays a total of $720 for car washes in a year.

**Final Answer**: Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.
