==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets for the couple and their two children, taking into account the discounts for the children. Then, we will determine how much change they will receive after paying with $500.

### Step 1: Determine the cost of tickets

1. **Regular ticket price**: $109
2. **Discount for children under 12**: $5

### Step 2: Calculate the ticket prices for each family member

- **Adults**: The couple consists of 2 adults, and they will pay the full ticket price.
  - Cost for 2 adults = 2 × $109 = $218

- **Children**: The couple has two children, ages 6 and 10. Both children qualify for the discount since they are under 12 years old.
  - Discounted ticket price for children = $109 - $5 = $104
  - Cost for 2 children = 2 × $104 = $208

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of tickets

Now, we add the costs for the adults and the children:
- Total cost = Cost for adults + Cost for children
- Total cost = $218 + $208 = $426

### Step 4: Calculate the change from $500

The couple paid $500 for the tickets. To find out how much change they will receive, we subtract the total cost from the amount they paid:
- Change = Amount paid - Total cost
- Change = $500 - $426 = $74

### Final Answer

The couple will receive **$74** in change after purchasing the tickets.
