==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets for the family and then determine how much change they will receive from $500.

**Step 1: Determine the cost of each ticket.**

- **Adult tickets:** The regular ticket price is $109. Since there are two adults (the couple), the cost for the adult tickets is:
  \[
  2 \times 109 = 218
  \]

- **Children's tickets:** Children below 12 years old receive a $5 discount on the regular ticket price. Therefore, the ticket price for each child is:
  \[
  109 - 5 = 104
  \]
  Since there are two children, the cost for the children's tickets is:
  \[
  2 \times 104 = 208
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost for the family.**

Add the cost of the adult tickets and the children's tickets:
\[
218 + 208 = 426
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the change from $500.**

The family gave the cashier $500. To find the change they will receive, subtract the total cost of the tickets from the amount given:
\[
500 - 426 = 74
\]

Therefore, the change the family will receive is $74.

**Final Answer:**
The family will receive $74 in change.
