Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many minutes Carolyn spends practicing both the piano and the violin in a month with four weeks.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Daily Practice Time:**
   - Carolyn practices the piano for 20 minutes each day.
   - She practices the violin for three times as long as the piano. Therefore, the time spent on the violin each day is:
     \[
     3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate Total Daily Practice Time:**
   - Total practice time per day (piano + violin) is:
     \[
     20 \text{ minutes (piano)} + 60 \text{ minutes (violin)} = 80 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate Weekly Practice Time:**
   - Carolyn practices six days a week. Therefore, the total practice time per week is:
     \[
     80 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 480 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

4. **Calculate Monthly Practice Time:**
   - A month with four weeks means Carolyn practices for four weeks. Therefore, the total practice time in a month is:
     \[
     480 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1920 \text{ minutes}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Carolyn spends 1920 minutes practicing in a month with four weeks.
