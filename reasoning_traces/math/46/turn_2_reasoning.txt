Question ID: 46
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many minutes Carolyn spends practicing both the piano and the violin in a month with four weeks. We'll break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine Daily Practice Time

1. **Piano Practice:**
   Carolyn practices the piano for 20 minutes a day.

2. **Violin Practice:**
   Carolyn practices the violin for three times as long as she practices the piano. Therefore, the time she spends practicing the violin each day is:
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Total Daily Practice:**
   The total time Carolyn spends practicing both instruments each day is the sum of her piano and violin practice times:
   \[
   20 \text{ minutes (piano)} + 60 \text{ minutes (violin)} = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 2: Determine Weekly Practice Time

Carolyn practices six days a week. Therefore, the total time she spends practicing in one week is:
\[
80 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 480 \text{ minutes/week}
\]

### Step 3: Determine Monthly Practice Time

A month with four weeks means Carolyn practices for four weeks. Therefore, the total time she spends practicing in a month is:
\[
480 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1920 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Conclusion

After calculating the total practice time for each step, we find that Carolyn spends 1920 minutes practicing the piano and violin in a month with four weeks.

**Final Answer: 1920 minutes**
