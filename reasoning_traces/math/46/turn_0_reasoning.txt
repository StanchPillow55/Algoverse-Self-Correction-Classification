==================================================

First, let's calculate how long Carolyn practices the violin each day. Since she practices the violin for three times as long as she practices the piano, she practices the violin for 20 minutes * 3 = <<20*3=60>>60 minutes each day.

So, in total, Carolyn practices the piano and the violin for 20 minutes + 60 minutes = <<20+60=80>>80 minutes each day.

Since she practices six days a week, she practices for a total of 80 minutes/day * 6 days/week = <<80*6=480>>480 minutes each week.

Finally, since there are four weeks in a month, Carolyn practices for a total of 480 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = <<480*4=1920>>1920 minutes in a month.

So, Carolyn spends 1920 minutes practicing in a month with four weeks.
