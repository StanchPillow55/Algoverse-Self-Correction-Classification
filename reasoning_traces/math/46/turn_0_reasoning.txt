==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much time Carolyn spends practicing both the piano and the violin in a month with four weeks. We will break this down step by step.

1. **Determine the daily practice time for the violin:**
   Carolyn practices the piano for 20 minutes a day. The problem states that she practices the violin for three times as long as she practices the piano. Therefore, we calculate the time spent on the violin as follows:

   \[
   \text{Violin practice time} = 3 \times \text{Piano practice time} = 3 \times 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total daily practice time:**
   Now, we can find the total time Carolyn spends practicing both instruments in one day:

   \[
   \text{Total daily practice time} = \text{Piano practice time} + \text{Violin practice time} = 20 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Determine the weekly practice time:**
   Carolyn practices six days a week. To find out how much time she spends practicing in one week, we multiply her total daily practice time by the number of days she practices:

   \[
   \text{Weekly practice time} = \text{Total daily practice time} \times \text{Number of practice days} = 80 \text{ minutes} \times 6 = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the monthly practice time:**
   Since the problem specifies that we are considering a month with four weeks, we can find the total practice time for the month by multiplying the weekly practice time by the number of weeks:

   \[
   \text{Monthly practice time} = \text{Weekly practice time} \times \text{Number of weeks} = 480 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 1920 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total amount of time Carolyn spends practicing in a month with four weeks is:

   \[
   \boxed{1920} \text{ minutes}
   \]
