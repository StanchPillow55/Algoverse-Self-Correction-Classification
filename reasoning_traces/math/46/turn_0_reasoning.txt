==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased. We will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Count of Post-it Notes**: 
   Candice starts with 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

2. **Post-it Notes Used**: 
   At work, she places a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, the number of Post-it notes she used is 220.

3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: 
   After using some Post-it notes, we know that she has 23 Post-it notes remaining overall.

4. **Total Post-it Notes After Purchase**: 
   Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased. After buying the package, the total number of Post-it notes she has is:
   \[
   80 + x
   \]

5. **Equation Setup**: 
   After placing the Post-it notes on the coffee cups, the number of Post-it notes she has left is given by:
   \[
   (80 + x) - 220 = 23
   \]
   This equation states that the total number of Post-it notes she had after the purchase, minus the 220 used, equals the 23 remaining.

6. **Solving the Equation**:
   We can simplify the equation:
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   x - 140 = 23
   \]
   Now, add 140 to both sides:
   \[
   x = 23 + 140
   \]
   \[
   x = 163
   \]

7. **Conclusion**: 
   The number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is \( \boxed{163} \). 

This means Candice bought a package containing 163 Post-it notes.
