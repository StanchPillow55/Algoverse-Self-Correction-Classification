Question ID: 790
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of groups formed**: 
   Since there are 90 people and each group consists of 9 people, we can calculate the number of groups by dividing the total number of people by the number of people per group.

   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90 \text{ people}}{9 \text{ people/group}} = 10 \text{ groups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells**: 
   According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total number of groups brought back seashells. We need to find \( \frac{3}{5} \) of 10 groups.

   \[
   \text{Groups that brought back seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \text{ groups}
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of seashells brought back**: 
   Each member of the groups that brought back seashells brought back 2 seashells. Since each group has 9 members, we first calculate the total number of members in the 6 groups.

   \[
   \text{Total members in 6 groups} = 6 \text{ groups} \times 9 \text{ members/group} = 54 \text{ members}
   \]

   Now, we can calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these members.

   \[
   \text{Total seashells} = 54 \text{ members} \times 2 \text{ seashells/member} = 108 \text{ seashells}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   After performing all the calculations, we find that the total number of seashells brought back is:

   \[
   \boxed{108}
   \]
