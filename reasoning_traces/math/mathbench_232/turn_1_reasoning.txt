==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 232," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 232" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact mathematical question or context. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that might be detailed elsewhere.

Since we don't have the actual details of "Sample math problem 232," let's consider a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. I'll create a sample math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is 5.
