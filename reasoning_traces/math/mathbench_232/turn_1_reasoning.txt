==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 232," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by outlining a step-by-step process. Let's assume a sample problem for illustration purposes:

**Sample Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides results in:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

By following these steps, we have systematically solved the problem and verified our solution. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 232," please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem using a similar approach.
