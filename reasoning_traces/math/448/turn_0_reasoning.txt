To find the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost per sneaker**:
   The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576. To find the cost per sneaker, we divide the total cost by the number of sneakers:

   \[
   \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of sneakers}} = \frac{576}{48} = 12
   \]

   So, the cost per sneaker is $12.

2. **Calculate the revenue from the flash sale**:
   The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each during the flash sale. To find the total revenue from this sale, we multiply the number of sneakers sold by the price per sneaker:

   \[
   \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sneakers sold to the department store**:
   The total number of sneakers is 48. After selling 17 sneakers at the flash sale, the number of sneakers left is:

   \[
   \text{Sneakers left} = 48 - 17 = 31
   \]

4. **Calculate the revenue from the department store**:
   The remaining 31 sneakers were sold to a department store for $25 each. To find the total revenue from this sale, we multiply the number of sneakers sold by the price per sneaker:

   \[
   \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775
   \]

5. **Calculate total revenue**:
   Now, we add the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the department store to find the total revenue:

   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from flash sale} + \text{Revenue from department store} = 340 + 775 = 1115
   \]

6. **Calculate total cost**:
   The total cost for the case of sneakers was $576, which we already know.

7. **Calculate profit**:
   Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost:

   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539
   \]

Thus, the salesman's profit is \(\boxed{539}\) dollars.
