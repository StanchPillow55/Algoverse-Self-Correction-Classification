==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of marbles in each jar and then find the total number of marbles in all three jars.

**Step 1: Determine the number of marbles in Jar A.**

We are given that Jar A has 28 marbles.

\[
\text{Marbles in Jar A} = 28
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of marbles in Jar B.**

We are told that Jar B has 12 more marbles than Jar A. Therefore, we add 12 to the number of marbles in Jar A to find the number of marbles in Jar B.

\[
\text{Marbles in Jar B} = \text{Marbles in Jar A} + 12 = 28 + 12 = 40
\]

**Step 3: Determine the number of marbles in Jar C.**

Jar C has twice as many marbles as Jar B. To find the number of marbles in Jar C, we multiply the number of marbles in Jar B by 2.

\[
\text{Marbles in Jar C} = 2 \times \text{Marbles in Jar B} = 2 \times 40 = 80
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of marbles in all jars.**

Now, we add the number of marbles in each jar to find the total number of marbles.

\[
\text{Total marbles} = \text{Marbles in Jar A} + \text{Marbles in Jar B} + \text{Marbles in Jar C} = 28 + 40 + 80
\]

\[
\text{Total marbles} = 148
\]

Therefore, the total number of marbles in all three jars is \(\boxed{148}\).
