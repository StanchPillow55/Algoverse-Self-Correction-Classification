==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of marbles in each jar and then find the total number of marbles across all jars.

1. **Determine the number of marbles in Jar A:**
   - Jar A has 28 marbles.

2. **Determine the number of marbles in Jar B:**
   - Jar B has 12 more marbles than Jar A.
   - Therefore, the number of marbles in Jar B can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Marbles in Jar B} = \text{Marbles in Jar A} + 12 = 28 + 12 = 40
     \]

3. **Determine the number of marbles in Jar C:**
   - Jar C has twice as many marbles as Jar B.
   - Therefore, the number of marbles in Jar C can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Marbles in Jar C} = 2 \times \text{Marbles in Jar B} = 2 \times 40 = 80
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of marbles:**
   - Now we add the number of marbles in all three jars together:
     \[
     \text{Total marbles} = \text{Marbles in Jar A} + \text{Marbles in Jar B} + \text{Marbles in Jar C}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total marbles} = 28 + 40 + 80
     \]

5. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add the marbles in Jar A and Jar B:
     \[
     28 + 40 = 68
     \]
   - Next, add the result to the number of marbles in Jar C:
     \[
     68 + 80 = 148
     \]

Thus, the total number of marbles in all jars is \( \boxed{148} \).
