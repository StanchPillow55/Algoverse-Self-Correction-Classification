To find Sheila's new balance on her credit card after her transactions, we will follow these steps:

1. **Initial Charge**: Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise.
   \[
   \text{Initial Balance} = 85.00
   \]

2. **Return of Item**: She returned one item that cost $15.00. We need to subtract this amount from her initial balance.
   \[
   \text{Balance after return} = 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

3. **Purchase of Frying Pan**: The frying pan is on sale for 20% off the original price of $20.00. First, we calculate the discount:
   \[
   \text{Discount on frying pan} = 20\% \text{ of } 20.00 = 0.20 \times 20.00 = 4.00
   \]
   Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
   \[
   \text{Sale price of frying pan} = 20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]

4. **Purchase of Towels**: The set of towels is 10% off the original price of $30.00. We calculate the discount:
   \[
   \text{Discount on towels} = 10\% \text{ of } 30.00 = 0.10 \times 30.00 = 3.00
   \]
   Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
   \[
   \text{Sale price of towels} = 30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]

5. **Total of New Purchases**: Now we add the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels to find the total amount she charged after the return.
   \[
   \text{Total new purchases} = \text{Sale price of frying pan} + \text{Sale price of towels} = 16.00 + 27.00 = 43.00
   \]

6. **Final Balance Calculation**: We now add the total of the new purchases to the balance after the return.
   \[
   \text{New Balance} = \text{Balance after return} + \text{Total new purchases} = 70.00 + 43.00 = 113.00
   \]

Thus, Sheila's new balance on her credit card is:
\[
\boxed{113.00}
\]
