==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample math problem 500" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume that "500" is the number we need to work with. Let's explore some mathematical operations and concepts involving the number 500.

### Step 1: Basic Properties of 500
- **Even or Odd**: 500 is an even number because it ends in 0.
- **Prime or Composite**: 500 is a composite number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself.

### Step 2: Prime Factorization
To find the prime factorization of 500, we divide it by the smallest prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. **Divide by 2** (smallest prime number):
   \[
   500 \div 2 = 250
   \]
2. **Divide by 2** again:
   \[
   250 \div 2 = 125
   \]
3. **Divide by 5** (next smallest prime number):
   \[
   125 \div 5 = 25
   \]
4. **Divide by 5** again:
   \[
   25 \div 5 = 5
   \]
5. **Divide by 5** one more time:
   \[
   5 \div 5 = 1
   \]

Thus, the prime factorization of 500 is:
\[
500 = 2^2 \times 5^3
\]

### Step 3: Divisors of 500
To find the divisors of 500, we use its prime factorization \(2^2 \times 5^3\). The divisors are all combinations of these prime factors raised to powers from 0 up to their respective maximum in the factorization.

- Powers of 2: \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2\)
- Powers of 5: \(5^0, 5^1, 5^2, 5^3\)

The divisors are:
\[
1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, 500
\]

### Step 4: Sum of Divisors
To find the sum of all divisors of 500, we add them up:
\[
1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 25 + 50 + 100 + 125 + 250 + 500 = 992
\]

### Step 5: Other Properties
- **Square Root**: The square root of 500 is approximately \(22.36\).
- **Logarithm**: The base-10 logarithm of 500 is approximately \(2.69897\).

### Final Answer
The prime factorization of 500 is \(2^2 \times 5^3\), and the sum of its divisors is 992. These are some of the key mathematical properties of the number 500.
