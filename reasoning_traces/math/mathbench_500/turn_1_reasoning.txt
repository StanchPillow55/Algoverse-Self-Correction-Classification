==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 500," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete or unclear. It simply states "Sample math problem 500," which does not provide enough information to identify the mathematical operations or concepts involved.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 500" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Since we don't have the actual problem, I'll demonstrate how to approach solving a generic math problem by considering a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem
If the problem is a basic arithmetic problem involving the number 500, it could be something like:

**Example Problem:** What is 500 plus 250?

**Solution:**
1. Identify the operation: Addition.
2. Perform the addition: \(500 + 250 = 750\).
3. State the final answer: The sum of 500 and 250 is 750.

### Possibility 2: Algebraic Problem
If the problem involves algebra, it might be something like:

**Example Problem:** Solve for \(x\) in the equation \(x + 500 = 1000\).

**Solution:**
1. Identify the operation needed to isolate \(x\): Subtraction.
2. Subtract 500 from both sides of the equation: 
   \[
   x + 500 - 500 = 1000 - 500
   \]
3. Simplify the equation: 
   \[
   x = 500
   \]
4. State the final answer: The value of \(x\) is 500.

### Possibility 3: Word Problem
If the problem is a word problem involving the number 500, it might be something like:

**Example Problem:** A store had 500 apples. They sold 200 apples. How many apples are left?

**Solution:**
1. Identify the operation: Subtraction.
2. Perform the subtraction: \(500 - 200 = 300\).
3. State the final answer: There are 300 apples left.

### Conclusion
Since the original problem statement "Sample math problem 500" does not specify the type of problem, the examples above illustrate how to approach different types of math problems involving the number 500. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you further.
