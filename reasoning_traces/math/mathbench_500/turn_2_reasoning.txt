==================================================

Certainly! Let's tackle the problem step by step. However, it seems like the problem statement "Sample math problem 500" is not clear. It appears to be a placeholder or an incomplete problem statement. To proceed, I'll assume you want to solve a problem involving the number 500. Let's consider a few possibilities:

1. **Factorization of 500**: 
   - To factor 500, we start by dividing by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
   - \( 500 \div 2 = 250 \)
   - \( 250 \div 2 = 125 \)
   - 125 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next prime number, which is 3. 
   - 125 is not divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 1 + 2 + 5 = 8, is not divisible by 3).
   - Next, we try 5, the next prime number.
   - \( 125 \div 5 = 25 \)
   - \( 25 \div 5 = 5 \)
   - \( 5 \div 5 = 1 \)
   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 500 is \( 2^2 \times 5^3 \).

2. **Finding the square root of 500**:
   - The square root of 500 can be simplified by recognizing that 500 = 100 Ã— 5.
   - The square root of 100 is 10, so:
   \[
   \sqrt{500} = \sqrt{100 \times 5} = \sqrt{100} \times \sqrt{5} = 10\sqrt{5}
   \]

3. **Calculating 500 as a percentage of another number**:
   - If you want to find what percentage 500 is of another number, say \( x \), you use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{500}{x} \right) \times 100
   \]
   - Without a specific \( x \), we can't calculate a specific percentage.

4. **Solving a simple equation involving 500**:
   - Consider the equation \( x + 250 = 500 \).
   - To solve for \( x \), subtract 250 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 500 - 250 = 250
   \]

Since the problem statement was not specific, I've explored a few mathematical operations involving the number 500. If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more details, and I can solve that particular problem for you.
