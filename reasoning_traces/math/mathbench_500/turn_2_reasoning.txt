==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what is being asked. The problem statement is "Sample math problem 500." This is quite vague, but for the sake of this exercise, let's assume that we are dealing with a simple arithmetic problem involving the number 500.

Let's consider a few possible interpretations and solve them:

### Interpretation 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations

1. **Addition**: What is 500 + 500?
   - Calculation: \( 500 + 500 = 1000 \)
   - Explanation: We are simply adding two numbers together.

2. **Subtraction**: What is 500 - 250?
   - Calculation: \( 500 - 250 = 250 \)
   - Explanation: We subtract 250 from 500 to find the difference.

3. **Multiplication**: What is 500 \(\times\) 2?
   - Calculation: \( 500 \times 2 = 1000 \)
   - Explanation: We multiply 500 by 2 to find the product.

4. **Division**: What is 500 รท 5?
   - Calculation: \( 500 \div 5 = 100 \)
   - Explanation: We divide 500 by 5 to find the quotient.

### Interpretation 2: Factorization

- **Prime Factorization of 500**:
  - Start by dividing 500 by the smallest prime number, 2:
    - \( 500 \div 2 = 250 \)
  - Divide 250 by 2:
    - \( 250 \div 2 = 125 \)
  - 125 is not divisible by 2, so try the next prime number, 3. It is not divisible by 3, so try 5:
    - \( 125 \div 5 = 25 \)
  - Divide 25 by 5:
    - \( 25 \div 5 = 5 \)
  - Finally, divide 5 by 5:
    - \( 5 \div 5 = 1 \)
  - Prime factorization of 500 is \( 2^2 \times 5^3 \).

### Interpretation 3: Solving an Equation Involving 500

- **Equation**: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( x + 500 = 1000 \).
  - Calculation: 
    - Subtract 500 from both sides: \( x + 500 - 500 = 1000 - 500 \)
    - Simplify: \( x = 500 \)
  - Explanation: We isolate \( x \) by subtracting 500 from both sides of the equation.

### Final Answer

Since the problem statement is not specific, we have explored various interpretations involving the number 500. Each interpretation provides a different mathematical insight:

1. Basic arithmetic operations yield results like 1000, 250, and 100.
2. The prime factorization of 500 is \( 2^2 \times 5^3 \).
3. Solving the equation \( x + 500 = 1000 \) gives \( x = 500 \).

If you have a specific context or additional details for the problem, please provide them for a more targeted solution.
