It seems like there might be a misunderstanding with the problem statement "Sample math problem 500." This doesn't provide enough information to solve a specific math problem. However, I can create a sample math problem involving the number 500 and solve it step by step. Let's consider the following problem:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 500.

**Solution:**

To find the sum of all integers from 1 to 500, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula for the sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) integers is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)
\]

where:
- \( n \) is the number of terms,
- \( a \) is the first term,
- \( l \) is the last term.

In this problem:
- The first term \( a = 1 \),
- The last term \( l = 500 \),
- The number of terms \( n = 500 \).

Plug these values into the formula:

\[
S = \frac{500}{2} \times (1 + 500)
\]

Calculate the terms inside the parentheses:

\[
1 + 500 = 501
\]

Now substitute back into the formula:

\[
S = \frac{500}{2} \times 501
\]

Calculate \(\frac{500}{2}\):

\[
\frac{500}{2} = 250
\]

Now multiply by 501:

\[
S = 250 \times 501
\]

To calculate \(250 \times 501\), we can break it down:

\[
250 \times 501 = 250 \times (500 + 1) = 250 \times 500 + 250 \times 1
\]

Calculate each term separately:

\[
250 \times 500 = 125000
\]
\[
250 \times 1 = 250
\]

Add these results together:

\[
125000 + 250 = 125250
\]

Therefore, the sum of all integers from 1 to 500 is \( \boxed{125250} \).
