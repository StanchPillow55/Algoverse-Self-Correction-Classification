It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. However, I will assume you want me to solve a math problem involving the number 500. Let's consider a problem where we need to find the prime factorization of 500. I will show all the steps and reasoning involved in solving this problem.

### Problem: Find the prime factorization of 500.

**Step 1: Understand the problem**

Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of its prime factors. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Step 2: Start with the smallest prime number**

The smallest prime number is 2. Check if 500 is divisible by 2.

\[ 500 \div 2 = 250 \]

Since 500 is divisible by 2, we write:

\[ 500 = 2 \times 250 \]

**Step 3: Continue factoring 250**

Now, take 250 and check if it is divisible by 2.

\[ 250 \div 2 = 125 \]

Since 250 is divisible by 2, we write:

\[ 250 = 2 \times 125 \]

So far, we have:

\[ 500 = 2 \times 2 \times 125 \]

**Step 4: Factor 125**

Next, we need to factor 125. Since 125 is not divisible by 2, we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Check if 125 is divisible by 3.

\[ 125 \div 3 \approx 41.67 \]

Since 125 is not divisible by 3, we move to the next prime number, which is 5. Check if 125 is divisible by 5.

\[ 125 \div 5 = 25 \]

Since 125 is divisible by 5, we write:

\[ 125 = 5 \times 25 \]

So far, we have:

\[ 500 = 2 \times 2 \times 5 \times 25 \]

**Step 5: Factor 25**

Now, factor 25. Since 25 is not divisible by 2 or 3, check if it is divisible by 5.

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Since 25 is divisible by 5, we write:

\[ 25 = 5 \times 5 \]

Now, we have:

\[ 500 = 2 \times 2 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 \]

**Step 6: Write the final prime factorization**

Combine the factors:

\[ 500 = 2^2 \times 5^3 \]

### Final Answer:

The prime factorization of 500 is \( 2^2 \times 5^3 \).
