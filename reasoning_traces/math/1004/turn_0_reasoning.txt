To solve the problem, we need to determine how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha, and then find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each of their boxes.

1. **Determine the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter:**
   - Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter.
   - The total number of chocolate bars can be expressed as:
     \[
     4x = 64
     \]
   - To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 4:
     \[
     x = \frac{64}{4} = 16
     \]
   - Therefore, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

2. **Determine the number of chocolate bars in each box for Martha:**
   - Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of chocolate bars in each box for Martha.
   - The total number of chocolate bars can be expressed as:
     \[
     7y = 56
     \]
   - To find \( y \), we divide both sides by 7:
     \[
     y = \frac{56}{7} = 8
     \]
   - Therefore, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

3. **Calculate the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box:**
   - Now we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = x - y = 16 - 8 = 8
     \]

Thus, Peter has **8 more chocolate bars** in each box than Martha.

**Final Answer: 8**
