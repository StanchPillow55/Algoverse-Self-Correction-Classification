==================================================

To determine how much money Gabriel still needs to buy the car and the phone, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the car and the phone.**
   - Cost of the car: $10,000
   - Cost of the phone: $800
   - Total cost = Cost of the car + Cost of the phone
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 10,000 + 800 = 10,800
   \]

2. **Calculate Gabriel's total available funds.**
   - Money Gabriel has from working: $5,000
   - Money his brother gave him: $200
   - Total available funds = Money from working + Money from brother
   \[
   \text{Total available funds} = 5,000 + 200 = 5,200
   \]

3. **Determine how much more money Gabriel needs.**
   - Amount needed = Total cost - Total available funds
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = 10,800 - 5,200 = 5,600
   \]

Thus, Gabriel still needs **$5,600** to buy both the car and the phone.

**Final Answer: $5,600**
