Question ID: 841
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much money Gabriel still needs to buy a car and a phone, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:**
   - Cost of the car: $10,000
   - Cost of the phone: $800
   - Total cost = Cost of the car + Cost of the phone
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 10,000 + 800 = 10,800
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has:**
   - Money from working on weekends: $5,000
   - Money from his brother: $200
   - Total money = Money from work + Money from brother
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 5,000 + 200 = 5,200
   \]

3. **Determine how much more money Gabriel needs:**
   - Amount needed = Total cost - Total money
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = 10,800 - 5,200 = 5,600
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
Gabriel still needs **$5,600** to buy the car and the phone.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5600}
\]
