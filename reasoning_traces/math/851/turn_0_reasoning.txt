==================================================

To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.**
   - James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
     \[
     \text{Total pairs of shoes} = 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year}
     \]

2. **Find out how much James spends on shoes each year.**
   - According to the problem, James spends a total of $2640 on shoes each year.

3. **Calculate the average cost per pair of shoes.**
   - To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
     \[
     \text{Average cost per pair} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Total pairs of shoes}} = \frac{2640}{24}
     \]

4. **Perform the division to find the average cost.**
   - Now we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{2640}{24} = 110
     \]

Thus, James pays an average of **$110** for each pair of shoes.

**Final Answer: $110**
