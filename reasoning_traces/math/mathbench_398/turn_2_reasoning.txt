Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 398" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 398:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[ 3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5 \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[ 3x = 15 \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:

   \[ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3} \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[ x = 5 \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

   \[ 3(5) + 5 = 20 \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]

   \[ 20 = 20 \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
