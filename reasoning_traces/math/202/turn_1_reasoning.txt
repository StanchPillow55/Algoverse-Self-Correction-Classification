==================================================

To solve the problem of how much money Susie will have after putting 20% more into her piggy bank, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Susie currently has $200 in her piggy bank.
   - She plans to add 20% more money to the existing amount.

2. **Calculate 20% of the Current Amount:**
   - To find 20% of $200, we use the formula for percentage:
     \[
     \text{Percentage of a number} = \left(\frac{\text{Percentage}}{100}\right) \times \text{Number}
     \]
   - Here, the percentage is 20, and the number is $200.
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 200 = \left(\frac{20}{100}\right) \times 200
     \]
   - Simplify the fraction:
     \[
     \frac{20}{100} = 0.2
     \]
   - Multiply 0.2 by 200:
     \[
     0.2 \times 200 = 40
     \]

3. **Add the Additional Amount to the Original Amount:**
   - Susie will add $40 to her original $200.
   - Therefore, the total amount in the piggy bank will be:
     \[
     200 + 40 = 240
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - After adding 20% more money to her piggy bank, Susie will have a total of $240.

Thus, the final answer is that Susie will have **$240** in her piggy bank.
