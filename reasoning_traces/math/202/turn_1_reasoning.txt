==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Susie will have after adding 20% more to her initial amount of $200.

**Step 1: Calculate 20% of $200.**

To find 20% of $200, we use the formula for calculating a percentage of a number:

\[
\text{Percentage of a number} = \left(\frac{\text{Percentage}}{100}\right) \times \text{Number}
\]

In this case, the percentage is 20, and the number is $200. Plugging these values into the formula gives:

\[
\text{20% of } 200 = \left(\frac{20}{100}\right) \times 200
\]

Simplifying the fraction \(\frac{20}{100}\) gives:

\[
\frac{20}{100} = 0.20
\]

Now, multiply 0.20 by 200:

\[
0.20 \times 200 = 40
\]

So, 20% of $200 is $40.

**Step 2: Add the 20% to the original amount.**

Now that we know 20% of $200 is $40, we add this amount to the original $200 to find out how much money Susie will have in total:

\[
200 + 40 = 240
\]

**Conclusion:**

After adding 20% more money to her piggy bank, Susie will have $240.

**Final Answer:**

Susie will have $240 in her piggy bank.
