==================================================

To solve the problem of how much money Susie will have after adding 20% more to her piggy bank, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Initial Amount:**
   Susie currently has $200 in her piggy bank.

2. **Calculate 20% of the Initial Amount:**
   To find 20% of $200, we use the formula for percentage:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of an amount} = \left(\frac{\text{Percentage}}{100}\right) \times \text{Amount}
   \]
   Substituting the values, we get:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 200 = \left(\frac{20}{100}\right) \times 200 = 0.2 \times 200 = 40
   \]

3. **Add the 20% to the Initial Amount:**
   Now, we add the calculated 20% ($40) to the initial amount ($200):
   \[
   200 + 40 = 240
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   After adding 20% more money to her piggy bank, Susie will have $240.

Therefore, the final answer is that Susie will have **$240** in her piggy bank.
