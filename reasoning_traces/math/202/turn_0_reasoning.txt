To determine how much money Susie will have after putting 20% more money into her piggy bank, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial amount of money Susie has**: 
   - Susie currently has $200.

2. **Calculate 20% of the initial amount**:
   - To find 20% of $200, we can use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \frac{\text{Percentage Rate}}{100} \times \text{Initial Amount}
     \]
   - Here, the percentage rate is 20, and the initial amount is $200:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 200 = \frac{20}{100} \times 200
     \]
   - Simplifying this:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 200 = 0.20 \times 200 = 40
     \]

3. **Add the 20% increase to the initial amount**:
   - Now, we add the calculated 20% (which is $40) to the initial amount of $200:
     \[
     \text{New Amount} = \text{Initial Amount} + \text{Increase}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{New Amount} = 200 + 40 = 240
     \]

4. **State the final answer**:
   - After putting 20% more money into her piggy bank, Susie will have $240.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]
