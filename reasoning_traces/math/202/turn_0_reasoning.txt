To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Susie will have after she adds 20% more to the $200 she already has in her piggy bank.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the initial amount of money:**
   Susie currently has $200 in her piggy bank.

2. **Determine the percentage increase:**
   Susie plans to add 20% more money to her piggy bank.

3. **Calculate the amount of money that represents 20% of $200:**
   To find 20% of $200, we use the formula for percentage:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of an amount} = \left(\frac{\text{Percentage}}{100}\right) \times \text{Total Amount}
   \]
   Plugging in the values, we get:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 200 = \left(\frac{20}{100}\right) \times 200
   \]
   Simplifying the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{20}{100} = 0.2
   \]
   Now, multiply by 200:
   \[
   0.2 \times 200 = 40
   \]

4. **Add the calculated amount to the initial amount:**
   Susie will add $40 to her initial $200. Therefore, the total amount of money she will have is:
   \[
   200 + 40 = 240
   \]

### Final Answer:
Susie will have $240 in her piggy bank after adding 20% more money.
