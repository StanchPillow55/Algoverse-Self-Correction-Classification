==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 132," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it stands. Without a specific question or context, it's impossible to provide a detailed solution or reasoning.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 132" refers to a generic math problem. Since no specific details are given, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 132."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers between 1 and 132 are 2, 4, 6, ..., 132.
   - These numbers form an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

2. **Find the Number of Terms:**
   - The last term of the sequence is 132.
   - We use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence: 
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Setting \( a_n = 132 \), we solve for \( n \):
     \[
     132 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     132 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     132 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{132}{2} = 66
     \]
   - There are 66 even numbers between 1 and 132.

3. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{66} = \frac{66}{2} \cdot (2 + 132)
     \]
     \[
     S_{66} = 33 \cdot 134
     \]
   - Calculate \( 33 \times 134 \):
     \[
     33 \times 134 = 33 \times (100 + 30 + 4)
     \]
     \[
     = 33 \times 100 + 33 \times 30 + 33 \times 4
     \]
     \[
     = 3300 + 990 + 132
     \]
     \[
     = 4422
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 132 is 4422.
