==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 132" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear or specific, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math reasoning problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. After reaching City B, the train immediately returns to City A at a speed of 40 miles per hour. What is the total time taken for the round trip?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Determine the time taken to travel from City A to City B:**

   - Distance from City A to City B = 300 miles
   - Speed from City A to City B = 60 miles per hour

   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the time taken to travel from City B back to City A:**

   - Distance from City B to City A = 300 miles (same as the distance from City A to City B)
   - Speed from City B to City A = 40 miles per hour

   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ miles per hour}} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time for the round trip:**

   - Time from City A to City B = 5 hours
   - Time from City B to City A = 7.5 hours

   \[
   \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ hours} + 7.5 \text{ hours} = 12.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The total time taken for the round trip is 12.5 hours.
