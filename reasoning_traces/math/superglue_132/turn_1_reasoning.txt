Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 132" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem, which involves understanding the problem, devising a plan, carrying out the plan, and then reviewing the solution.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Without specific details, let's assume "Sample reasoning question 132" is a typical math problem involving basic arithmetic, algebra, or geometry. For illustration, let's consider a simple algebra problem:

**Example Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
The goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. This typically involves inverse operations to simplify the equation.

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. **Subtract 3 from both sides**: 
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2**:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

### Step 4: Review the Solution
To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
Simplifying the left side:
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

### Final Answer
The solution to the example problem is \( x = 4 \).

Since the original problem "Sample reasoning question 132" was not specified, the above steps illustrate a general method for solving a typical algebraic equation. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can offer a precise solution.
