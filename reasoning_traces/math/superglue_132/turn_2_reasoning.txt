==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 132," we need to first understand what the question is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete and lacks specific details or context. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example and solving it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
A store sells apples at $2 each and bananas at $1.50 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and bananas and spends a total of $17, how many apples and how many bananas did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of bananas.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of fruits is 10:
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
   - We also know the total cost is $17:
     \[
     2x + 1.5y = 17
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have two equations:
     1. \( x + y = 10 \)
     2. \( 2x + 1.5y = 17 \)

   - Solve the first equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 10 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 10 - x \) into the second equation:
     \[
     2x + 1.5(10 - x) = 17
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 15 - 1.5x = 17
     \]
     \[
     0.5x + 15 = 17
     \]
     \[
     0.5x = 2
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 10 - 4 = 6
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of fruits:
     \[
     x + y = 4 + 6 = 10 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]
   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     2x + 1.5y = 2(4) + 1.5(6) = 8 + 9 = 17 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The customer bought 4 apples and 6 bananas.

This example illustrates how to approach a typical math problem involving systems of equations. If you have a specific problem or additional details, please provide them, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
