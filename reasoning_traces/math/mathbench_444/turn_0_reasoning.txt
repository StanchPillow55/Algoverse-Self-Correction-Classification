==================================================

To solve the sample math problem labeled as "444," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem with the number 444 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 444, and then determine if this sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 444:**
   - The number 444 consists of three digits: 4, 4, and 4.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(4 + 4 + 4\).

   \[
   4 + 4 + 4 = 12
   \]

3. **Determine if the sum (12) is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - Check the divisibility of 12:
     - 12 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.
     - Since 12 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sum of the digits of 444 is 12.
   - 12 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of 444 is 12, and 12 is not a prime number.
