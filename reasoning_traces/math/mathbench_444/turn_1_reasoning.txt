Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 444" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem description, I'll assume it is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem statement, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 444" is the following problem:

**Problem:**  
Find the sum of the first 444 positive integers.

**Solution:**

To find the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

Where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers.

For this problem, \( n = 444 \). Plugging this value into the formula gives:

\[
S_{444} = \frac{444(444 + 1)}{2}
\]

First, calculate \( 444 + 1 \):

\[
444 + 1 = 445
\]

Next, multiply 444 by 445:

\[
444 \times 445 = 197580
\]

Now, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:

\[
S_{444} = \frac{197580}{2} = 98790
\]

Thus, the sum of the first 444 positive integers is \( 98790 \).

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 444 positive integers is \( 98790 \).
