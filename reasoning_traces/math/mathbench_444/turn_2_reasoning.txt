Question ID: mathbench_444
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 444" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem based on the number 444 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 444, then multiply the result by 3. Finally, subtract 12 from the product.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 444:**
   - The number 444 consists of three digits: 4, 4, and 4.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \( 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 \).

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Multiply the sum obtained in step 2 by 3: \( 12 \times 3 = 36 \).

4. **Subtract 12 from the product:**
   - Subtract 12 from the result obtained in step 3: \( 36 - 12 = 24 \).

**Final Answer:**

The final result of the hypothetical problem is 24.
