To determine how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows he can create for both the red tulips and the blue tulips based on the quantities he has and the number of tulips that fit in each row.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of rows for red tulips.**

Jackson has 36 red tulips, and he can fit 6 red tulips in each row. To find out how many rows he can plant, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row:

\[
\text{Number of rows for red tulips} = \frac{\text{Total red tulips}}{\text{Red tulips per row}} = \frac{36}{6}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{36}{6} = 6
\]

So, Jackson can plant **6 rows of red tulips**.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of rows for blue tulips.**

Jackson has 24 blue tulips, and he can fit 8 blue tulips in each row. Similarly, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips per row:

\[
\text{Number of rows for blue tulips} = \frac{\text{Total blue tulips}}{\text{Blue tulips per row}} = \frac{24}{8}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{24}{8} = 3
\]

So, Jackson can plant **3 rows of blue tulips**.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of rows.**

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips together to find the total number of rows Jackson will plant:

\[
\text{Total rows} = \text{Rows of red tulips} + \text{Rows of blue tulips} = 6 + 3
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
6 + 3 = 9
\]

Thus, the total number of rows of flowers that Jackson will plant is **9**.

**Final Answer:**

Jackson will plant a total of **9 rows of flowers**.
