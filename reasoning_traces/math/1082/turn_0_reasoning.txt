==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break down James's journey step by step.

1. **Determine the distance to the store**: 
   - James's home is 4 miles from the store. Therefore, the distance from his home to the store is 4 miles.

2. **Calculate the halfway point**: 
   - Halfway to the store would be half of 4 miles, which is:
     \[
     \text{Halfway distance} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time to walk to the halfway point**:
   - James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to walk 2 miles (the halfway point), we can use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Time to halfway} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the time to walk back home**:
   - After reaching the halfway point, James realizes he forgot something and needs to walk back home. The distance back home is also 2 miles.
   - Using the same formula for time:
     \[
     \text{Time to walk back} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Total time spent walking**:
   - The total time James spent walking is the sum of the time to reach the halfway point and the time to walk back home:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time to halfway} + \text{Time to walk back} = 0.5 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Since James did not reach the store after walking back home, we conclude that he did not spend any time walking towards the store after returning home. Therefore, the time it took him to reach the store is still 0 hours.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{It took James } 0 \text{ hours to reach the store.}
\]
