==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about the "Sample reasoning question 2" you mentioned. Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating an example and solving it step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details.

Example Problem:
A car travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. The distance between the two cities is 180 miles. How long does it take for the car to travel from City A to City B?

Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the car to travel from City A to City B.
   - We know the speed of the car is 60 miles per hour.
   - The distance between the cities is 180 miles.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Distance = 180 miles
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 180 by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To ensure the calculation is correct, consider the units:
     - The units of distance (miles) divided by the units of speed (miles per hour) result in hours, which is the correct unit for time.
   - The calculation checks out, as dividing 180 by 60 indeed gives 3.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The car takes 3 hours to travel from City A to City B.

This is the complete reasoning and solution for the example problem. If you have a specific question or need further assistance, please provide more details.
