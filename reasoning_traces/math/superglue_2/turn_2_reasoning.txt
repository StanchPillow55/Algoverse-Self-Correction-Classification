==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 2" entails. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem, using a hypothetical math problem as an example.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller, equal-sized square plots. What is the largest possible side length of each square plot?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - We need to divide this rectangle into square plots of equal size.
   - The goal is to find the largest possible side length for these square plots.

2. **Identify the Mathematical Concept:**
   - The problem requires finding the largest square that can fit into both the length and the width of the rectangle without leaving any remainder.
   - This is equivalent to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two dimensions of the rectangle.

3. **Calculate the GCD:**
   - To find the GCD of 100 and 60, we can use the Euclidean algorithm:
     - Divide 100 by 60, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 40.
     - Now, divide 60 by 40, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 20.
     - Next, divide 40 by 20, which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0.
     - Since the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.
   - Therefore, the GCD of 100 and 60 is 20.

4. **Interpret the Result:**
   - The largest possible side length for the square plots is 20 meters.
   - This means the field can be divided into square plots each measuring 20 meters by 20 meters.

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if 100 and 60 are both divisible by 20:
     - 100 รท 20 = 5
     - 60 รท 20 = 3
   - Both results are integers, confirming that 20 meters is indeed the largest possible side length for the square plots.

**Final Answer:**
The largest possible side length of each square plot is 20 meters.
