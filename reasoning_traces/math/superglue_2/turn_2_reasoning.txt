==================================================

Certainly! Let's work through the problem step by step, even though the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 2" are not provided. I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem, which you can adapt to your specific question.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
First, identify what the problem is asking. Look for keywords and important information. If it's a word problem, determine what quantities are involved and what is being asked.

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
Decide on a strategy to solve the problem. This might involve setting up equations, drawing diagrams, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
Execute the steps you have planned. This involves performing calculations, solving equations, or logically deducing the answer.

### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
Verify your solution to ensure it makes sense and that all calculations are correct. Check if the answer satisfies the conditions of the problem.

### Example Problem
Let's apply this approach to a sample problem:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We have a rectangle with a length (L) and width (W).
- The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
- The perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units.

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2L + 2W \).
- Substitute the given information into the formula.

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:
   \[
   36 = 2(2W) + 2W
   \]
2. Simplify and solve for \( W \):
   \[
   36 = 4W + 2W
   \]
   \[
   36 = 6W
   \]
   \[
   W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
   \]
3. Find \( L \) using \( L = 2W \):
   \[
   L = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
  \[
  P = 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
  \]
- The calculations are correct, and the perimeter matches the given value.

### Final Answer
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width \( W = 6 \) units
- Length \( L = 12 \) units

This approach can be adapted to solve various types of math problems by following the structured steps of understanding, planning, executing, and reviewing. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through it using this method.
