==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand the context and the requirements. The problem statement is quite vague as it stands: "Sample reasoning question 2." Without additional context or specific details, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem-solving scenario. 

To demonstrate a structured approach, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step. Let's consider the following problem:

**Problem:**  
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to create a path that is 2 meters wide around the inside perimeter of the field. What is the area of the path?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - A path of 2 meters wide is to be constructed around the inside perimeter of the field.
   - We need to find the area of this path.

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - Imagine the field as a large rectangle.
   - The path is a smaller rectangle inside the field, 2 meters away from each side.

3. **Calculate the Dimensions of the Inner Rectangle:**
   - The path reduces the length and width of the field by 2 meters on each side.
   - New length of the inner rectangle = 100 - 2 - 2 = 96 meters.
   - New width of the inner rectangle = 60 - 2 - 2 = 56 meters.

4. **Calculate the Area of the Entire Field:**
   - Area of the entire field = Length × Width = 100 meters × 60 meters = 6000 square meters.

5. **Calculate the Area of the Inner Rectangle:**
   - Area of the inner rectangle = New Length × New Width = 96 meters × 56 meters = 5376 square meters.

6. **Calculate the Area of the Path:**
   - Area of the path = Area of the entire field - Area of the inner rectangle.
   - Area of the path = 6000 square meters - 5376 square meters = 624 square meters.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The area of the path is 624 square meters.

**Final Answer:**
The area of the path is 624 square meters.
