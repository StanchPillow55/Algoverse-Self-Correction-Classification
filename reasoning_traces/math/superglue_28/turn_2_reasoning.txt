==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 28" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by assuming a hypothetical problem. Let's assume the problem is:

**Problem:**
If \( x + 2y = 10 \) and \( 3x - y = 5 \), find the values of \( x \) and \( y \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We have a system of linear equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   1) & \quad x + 2y = 10 \\
   2) & \quad 3x - y = 5
   \end{align*}
   \]
   Our goal is to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy both equations.

2. **Choose a Method to Solve the System:**
   We can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

3. **Align the Equations for Elimination:**
   We want to eliminate one of the variables. Let's eliminate \( y \). To do this, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( y \):
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   1) & \quad x + 2y = 10 \\
   2') & \quad 6x - 2y = 10
   \end{align*}
   \]

4. **Add the Equations:**
   Add equation (1) and equation (2'):
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   (x + 2y) + (6x - 2y) &= 10 + 10 \\
   7x &= 20
   \end{align*}
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Divide both sides by 7:
   \[
   x = \frac{20}{7}
   \]

6. **Substitute \( x \) Back to Find \( y \):**
   Substitute \( x = \frac{20}{7} \) into equation (1):
   \[
   \frac{20}{7} + 2y = 10
   \]
   Subtract \(\frac{20}{7}\) from both sides:
   \[
   2y = 10 - \frac{20}{7}
   \]
   Convert 10 to a fraction with a denominator of 7:
   \[
   10 = \frac{70}{7}
   \]
   So,
   \[
   2y = \frac{70}{7} - \frac{20}{7} = \frac{50}{7}
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   y = \frac{50}{7} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{50}{14} = \frac{25}{7}
   \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = \frac{20}{7} \) and \( y = \frac{25}{7} \) back into the original equations to verify:
   - For equation (1): 
     \[
     \frac{20}{7} + 2\left(\frac{25}{7}\right) = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{50}{7} = \frac{70}{7} = 10
     \]
   - For equation (2):
     \[
     3\left(\frac{20}{7}\right) - \frac{25}{7} = \frac{60}{7} - \frac{25}{7} = \frac{35}{7} = 5
     \]

Both equations are satisfied, confirming our solution.

**Final Answer:**
The values of \( x \) and \( y \) are \( x = \frac{20}{7} \) and \( y = \frac{25}{7} \).
