==================================================

It seems like you've referenced a specific question, "Sample reasoning question 28," but I don't have access to external documents or specific question sets. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems, which you can apply to your specific question.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what is unknown.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram
     - Creating an equation
     - Looking for patterns
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Review calculations for errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's apply this approach to a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - The perimeter is given as 36 units.
   - The length is twice the width.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
   - Let \( w \) be the width. Then the length is \( 2w \).
   - Substitute these into the perimeter formula.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   \[
   P = 2 \times (2w + w) = 36
   \]
   \[
   2 \times 3w = 36
   \]
   \[
   6w = 36
   \]
   \[
   w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
   \]
   - The width \( w \) is 6 units.
   - The length is \( 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12 \) units.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Check the perimeter with these dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are correct, and the perimeter matches the given value.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the rectangle are 12 units by 6 units.
