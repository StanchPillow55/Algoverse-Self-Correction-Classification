==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 28" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example and solving it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 28" is a math problem involving algebraic expressions. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

**Step 3: Perform Inverse Operations**

1. **Subtract 5 from both sides**: This will help eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 3**: This will isolate \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

Substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( 3x + 5 = 20 \):

\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]

Simplify the left side:

\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
