To determine how much James's favorite basketball player gets paid for the week, we need to calculate his average points per game over the five games he played. 

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. **List the points scored in each game:**
   - Game 1: 30 points
   - Game 2: 28 points
   - Game 3: 32 points
   - Game 4: 34 points
   - Game 5: 26 points

2. **Calculate the total points scored:**
   We add the points from all five games:
   \[
   \text{Total Points} = 30 + 28 + 32 + 34 + 26
   \]

   Performing the addition step-by-step:
   - \(30 + 28 = 58\)
   - \(58 + 32 = 90\)
   - \(90 + 34 = 124\)
   - \(124 + 26 = 150\)

   So, the total points scored is \(150\).

3. **Calculate the average points per game:**
   To find the average, we divide the total points by the number of games played:
   \[
   \text{Average Points} = \frac{\text{Total Points}}{\text{Number of Games}} = \frac{150}{5}
   \]

   Performing the division:
   \[
   \frac{150}{5} = 30
   \]

   Therefore, the average points per game is \(30\).

4. **Determine the payment based on the average:**
   According to the payment structure:
   - If the player averages 30 or more points per game, he gets paid $10,000.
   - If he averages under 30 points per game, he gets paid $8,000.

   Since the average points per game is exactly \(30\), he qualifies for the higher payment.

5. **Final payment calculation:**
   Since the average is \(30\), the player will receive:
   \[
   \text{Payment} = \$10,000
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that James's favorite basketball player gets paid **$10,000** for the week.
