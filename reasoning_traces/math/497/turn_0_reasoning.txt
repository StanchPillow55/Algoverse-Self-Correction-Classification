To determine how much James's favorite basketball player gets paid for the week, we need to calculate the average number of points he scored per game over the week. Based on this average, we can then decide whether he earns $10,000 or $8,000.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **List the points scored in each game:**
   - Game 1: 30 points
   - Game 2: 28 points
   - Game 3: 32 points
   - Game 4: 34 points
   - Game 5: 26 points

2. **Calculate the total points scored over the week:**
   \[
   \text{Total points} = 30 + 28 + 32 + 34 + 26
   \]

   Let's add these numbers:
   \[
   30 + 28 = 58
   \]
   \[
   58 + 32 = 90
   \]
   \[
   90 + 34 = 124
   \]
   \[
   124 + 26 = 150
   \]

   So, the total points scored is 150.

3. **Calculate the average points per game:**
   \[
   \text{Average points per game} = \frac{\text{Total points}}{\text{Number of games}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average points per game} = \frac{150}{5} = 30
   \]

4. **Determine the payment based on the average:**
   - If the average is 30 or more points per game, the player earns $10,000.
   - If the average is less than 30 points per game, the player earns $8,000.

   Since the average is exactly 30 points per game, the player earns $10,000.

### Final Answer:
James's favorite basketball player gets paid **$10,000** for the week.
