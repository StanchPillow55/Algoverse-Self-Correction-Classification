==================================================

To determine how much James's favorite basketball player gets paid for the week, we need to calculate his average points per game over the five games and then apply the payment criteria.

**Step 1: Calculate the total points scored over the week.**

The player scored the following points in each game:
- Game 1: 30 points
- Game 2: 28 points
- Game 3: 32 points
- Game 4: 34 points
- Game 5: 26 points

Total points = 30 + 28 + 32 + 34 + 26

Let's calculate this step by step:
- 30 + 28 = 58
- 58 + 32 = 90
- 90 + 34 = 124
- 124 + 26 = 150

So, the total points scored over the five games is 150.

**Step 2: Calculate the average points per game.**

The average points per game is calculated by dividing the total points by the number of games:

Average = Total Points / Number of Games
Average = 150 / 5
Average = 30

**Step 3: Determine the payment based on the average.**

According to the payment criteria:
- If the player averages 30 or more points per game, he gets $10,000.
- If the player averages under 30 points per game, he gets $8,000.

Since the player averaged exactly 30 points per game, he qualifies for the $10,000 payment.

**Final Answer:**

The player gets paid $10,000 for the week.
