Question ID: 497
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much James's favorite basketball player gets paid for the week, we need to calculate his average points per game over the five games he played.

1. **List the points scored in each game**:
   - Game 1: 30 points
   - Game 2: 28 points
   - Game 3: 32 points
   - Game 4: 34 points
   - Game 5: 26 points

2. **Calculate the total points scored**:
   \[
   \text{Total points} = 30 + 28 + 32 + 34 + 26
   \]

   Performing the addition step-by-step:
   - \(30 + 28 = 58\)
   - \(58 + 32 = 90\)
   - \(90 + 34 = 124\)
   - \(124 + 26 = 150\)

   Thus, the total points scored is \(150\).

3. **Calculate the average points per game**:
   The average is calculated by dividing the total points by the number of games played:
   \[
   \text{Average points} = \frac{\text{Total points}}{\text{Number of games}} = \frac{150}{5}
   \]

   Performing the division:
   \[
   \frac{150}{5} = 30
   \]

4. **Determine the payment based on the average**:
   Since the player averaged 30 points per game, he qualifies for the higher payment tier:
   - If he averages 30 or more points, he gets paid $10,000.

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, James's favorite basketball player gets paid **$10,000** for the week.
