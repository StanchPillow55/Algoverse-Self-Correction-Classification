==================================================

To determine how much James's favorite basketball player gets paid for the week, we need to calculate his average points scored over the five games.

1. **Calculate the total points scored**:
   - Game 1: 30 points
   - Game 2: 28 points
   - Game 3: 32 points
   - Game 4: 34 points
   - Game 5: 26 points

   Total points = 30 + 28 + 32 + 34 + 26

   Let's do the addition step-by-step:
   - 30 + 28 = 58
   - 58 + 32 = 90
   - 90 + 34 = 124
   - 124 + 26 = 150

   So, the total points scored is **150 points**.

2. **Calculate the average points scored**:
   The average is calculated by dividing the total points by the number of games played.

   Average points = Total points / Number of games
   Average points = 150 / 5

   Now, let's perform the division:
   - 150 รท 5 = 30

   Therefore, the average points scored is **30 points**.

3. **Determine the payment based on the average**:
   According to the payment structure:
   - If the player averages 30 or more points, he gets $10,000.
   - If he averages under 30 points, he gets $8,000.

   Since the average points scored is exactly 30, he qualifies for the higher payment.

4. **Final payment**:
   The player will receive **$10,000** for the week.

Thus, the final answer is **$10,000**.
