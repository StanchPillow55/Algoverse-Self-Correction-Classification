Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much James's favorite basketball player gets paid for the week, we need to calculate his average points per game over the five games and then apply the payment criteria.

**Step 1: Calculate the total points scored over the week.**

- Game 1: 30 points
- Game 2: 28 points
- Game 3: 32 points
- Game 4: 34 points
- Game 5: 26 points

Total points = 30 + 28 + 32 + 34 + 26 = 150 points

**Step 2: Calculate the average points per game.**

The average is calculated by dividing the total points by the number of games:

Average points per game = Total points / Number of games  
Average points per game = 150 / 5 = 30

**Step 3: Determine the payment based on the average.**

According to the payment criteria:
- If the player averages 30 or more points per game, he earns $10,000.
- If the player averages less than 30 points per game, he earns $8,000.

Since the player averaged exactly 30 points per game, he qualifies for the $10,000 payment.

**Final Answer:**

The player gets paid $10,000 for the week.
