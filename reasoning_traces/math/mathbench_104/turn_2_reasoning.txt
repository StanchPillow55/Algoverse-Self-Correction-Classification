Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 104," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 104" is not specific enough for us to determine what the actual mathematical question is. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not provided here.

To proceed, let's assume a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 104." Let's say it involves solving a quadratic equation, which is a common type of math problem.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the coefficients:**
   The given quadratic equation is in the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where:
   - \(a = 2\)
   - \(b = -4\)
   - \(c = -6\)

2. **Use the quadratic formula:**
   The quadratic formula is given by:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]

3. **Calculate the discriminant (\(b^2 - 4ac\)):**
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6)
   \]
   \[
   = 16 + 48
   \]
   \[
   = 64
   \]

4. **Calculate the roots using the quadratic formula:**
   Since the discriminant is positive, there are two real and distinct solutions.
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

5. **Find the two solutions:**
   - First solution:
     \[
     x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   - Second solution:
     \[
     x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
