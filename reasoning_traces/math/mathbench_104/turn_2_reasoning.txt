==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 104," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 104" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 4 units more than twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 104 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then, the length \( l \) can be expressed as \( l = 2w + 4 \).

2. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 104 units, so:
     \[
     2l + 2w = 104
     \]

3. **Substitute the Expression for Length:**
   - Substitute \( l = 2w + 4 \) into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(2w + 4) + 2w = 104
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**
   - Distribute the 2 in the equation:
     \[
     4w + 8 + 2w = 104
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     6w + 8 = 104
     \]
   - Subtract 8 from both sides:
     \[
     6w = 96
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 6:
     \[
     w = 16
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Substitute \( w = 16 \) back into the expression for \( l \):
     \[
     l = 2(16) + 4 = 32 + 4 = 36
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with these dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(36) + 2(16) = 72 + 32 = 104
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 16 units and a length of 36 units.
