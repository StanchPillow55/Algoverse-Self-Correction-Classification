==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 104" refers to. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 104:**

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"Calculate the sum of the first 104 positive integers."

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

Where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) integers.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify \( n \):**  
   In this problem, \( n = 104 \).

2. **Apply the formula:**  
   Substitute \( n = 104 \) into the formula:

   \[
   S_{104} = \frac{104(104 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate inside the parentheses:**  
   \( 104 + 1 = 105 \).

4. **Multiply 104 by 105:**  
   \( 104 \times 105 = 10920 \).

5. **Divide by 2:**  
   \[
   S_{104} = \frac{10920}{2} = 5460
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 104 positive integers is \( 5460 \).
