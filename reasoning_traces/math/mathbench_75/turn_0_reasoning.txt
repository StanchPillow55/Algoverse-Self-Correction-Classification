It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. However, I will assume that "Sample math problem 75" refers to a generic math problem involving the number 75. Let's create a problem involving 75 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all positive divisors of 75.

**Step 1: Find the prime factorization of 75.**

To find the prime factorization, we start by dividing 75 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 75 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we try dividing by 3:
\[ 75 \div 3 = 25 \]
So, 3 is a factor, and we have:
\[ 75 = 3 \times 25 \]

Now, factor 25:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]
So, 5 is a factor, and we have:
\[ 25 = 5 \times 5 \]

Thus, the prime factorization of 75 is:
\[ 75 = 3 \times 5^2 \]

**Step 2: Use the prime factorization to find all divisors.**

The divisors of a number can be found using its prime factorization. If a number \( n \) has the prime factorization \( n = p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the divisors are given by:
\[ (p_1^0, p_1^1, \ldots, p_1^{a_1}) \times (p_2^0, p_2^1, \ldots, p_2^{a_2}) \times \ldots \times (p_k^0, p_k^1, \ldots, p_k^{a_k}) \]

For 75, the prime factorization is \( 3^1 \times 5^2 \). Therefore, the divisors are:
\[ (3^0, 3^1) \times (5^0, 5^1, 5^2) \]

Calculating these, we get:
- \( 3^0 = 1 \), \( 3^1 = 3 \)
- \( 5^0 = 1 \), \( 5^1 = 5 \), \( 5^2 = 25 \)

The divisors are:
\[ 1 \times 1 = 1 \]
\[ 1 \times 5 = 5 \]
\[ 1 \times 25 = 25 \]
\[ 3 \times 1 = 3 \]
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

Thus, the divisors of 75 are: 1, 3, 5, 15, 25, and 75.

**Step 3: Calculate the sum of all divisors.**

Add up all the divisors:
\[ 1 + 3 + 5 + 15 + 25 + 75 = 124 \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all positive divisors of 75 is 124.
