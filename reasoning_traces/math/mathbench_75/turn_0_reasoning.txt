==================================================

It seems like the problem statement "Sample math problem 75" is incomplete or unclear. However, I will assume that you are asking for a solution to a math problem involving the number 75. Let's consider a few possible interpretations and solve them:

### Interpretation 1: Find the Prime Factorization of 75

To find the prime factorization of 75, we need to express it as a product of prime numbers.

1. **Divide by the smallest prime number**: 
   - 75 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - The next smallest prime number is 3. Check divisibility by 3: 
     - Sum of the digits of 75 is \(7 + 5 = 12\), which is divisible by 3.
   - Divide 75 by 3: 
     \[
     75 \div 3 = 25
     \]

2. **Factor 25**:
   - 25 is not divisible by 3, so try the next smallest prime number, which is 5.
   - 25 is divisible by 5:
     \[
     25 \div 5 = 5
     \]
   - 5 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 75 is:
\[
75 = 3 \times 5 \times 5 = 3 \times 5^2
\]

### Interpretation 2: Calculate 75% of a Number

If the problem is to find 75% of a given number, let's assume the number is \(x\).

1. **Convert the percentage to a decimal**:
   - 75% as a decimal is 0.75.

2. **Calculate 75% of \(x\)**:
   \[
   0.75 \times x = \frac{75}{100} \times x = \frac{3}{4} \times x
   \]

Thus, 75% of \(x\) is \(\frac{3}{4} \times x\).

### Interpretation 3: Solve a Simple Equation Involving 75

Suppose we have an equation such as \(x + 75 = 150\).

1. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   \[
   x + 75 = 150
   \]
   \[
   x = 150 - 75
   \]
   \[
   x = 75
   \]

Thus, the solution to the equation is \(x = 75\).

### Final Answer

Since the original problem statement was unclear, I provided solutions for different interpretations involving the number 75. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details, and I will be happy to help further.
