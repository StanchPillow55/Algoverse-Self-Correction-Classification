Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the sample math problem "75," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is simply "75," it seems like there might be some missing context or additional instructions needed to fully understand what is required. However, let's assume that the task is to perform some operations or analysis on the number 75. Here are a few possible interpretations and solutions:

### Interpretation 1: Prime Factorization

Let's find the prime factorization of 75.

1. **Divide by the smallest prime number, 2:**
   - 75 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.

2. **Divide by the next smallest prime number, 3:**
   - Sum of digits of 75 is \(7 + 5 = 12\), which is divisible by 3.
   - Divide 75 by 3: \(75 \div 3 = 25\).

3. **Factor 25:**
   - 25 is not divisible by 3 or 5, but it is divisible by 5.
   - Divide 25 by 5: \(25 \div 5 = 5\).

4. **Factor 5:**
   - 5 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 75 is \(3 \times 5^2\).

### Interpretation 2: Basic Arithmetic Operations

Let's perform some basic arithmetic operations with 75.

1. **Addition:**
   - \(75 + 25 = 100\)

2. **Subtraction:**
   - \(75 - 25 = 50\)

3. **Multiplication:**
   - \(75 \times 2 = 150\)

4. **Division:**
   - \(75 \div 3 = 25\)

### Interpretation 3: Properties of the Number 75

1. **Even or Odd:**
   - 75 is an odd number.

2. **Divisibility:**
   - 75 is divisible by 1, 3, 5, 15, 25, and 75.

3. **Square and Square Root:**
   - Square of 75: \(75^2 = 5625\)
   - Square root of 75: \(\sqrt{75} \approx 8.66\)

### Final Answer

Without additional context, the problem "75" can be interpreted in various ways. If the task was to find the prime factorization, the answer is:

\[ 75 = 3 \times 5^2 \]

If the task was to perform arithmetic operations or analyze properties, the results are as shown in the respective sections above. If there is a specific operation or analysis intended, please provide further instructions.
