==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 75" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 75" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I will create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 75 and solve it step by step.

Let's consider the following math problem involving the number 75:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all positive divisors of 75.

**Solution:**

Step 1: Find the prime factorization of 75.
- 75 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
- Check divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 75 is 7 + 5 = 12, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 75 is divisible by 3.
  \[
  75 \div 3 = 25
  \]
- Now, factor 25. Since 25 is a perfect square, it can be expressed as:
  \[
  25 = 5 \times 5
  \]
- Therefore, the prime factorization of 75 is:
  \[
  75 = 3 \times 5^2
  \]

Step 2: Use the prime factorization to find all divisors.
- The divisors of a number can be found using its prime factorization. For \(75 = 3^1 \times 5^2\), the divisors are of the form \(3^a \times 5^b\) where \(0 \leq a \leq 1\) and \(0 \leq b \leq 2\).

- Calculate all combinations:
  - \(a = 0, b = 0\): \(3^0 \times 5^0 = 1\)
  - \(a = 0, b = 1\): \(3^0 \times 5^1 = 5\)
  - \(a = 0, b = 2\): \(3^0 \times 5^2 = 25\)
  - \(a = 1, b = 0\): \(3^1 \times 5^0 = 3\)
  - \(a = 1, b = 1\): \(3^1 \times 5^1 = 15\)
  - \(a = 1, b = 2\): \(3^1 \times 5^2 = 75\)

- The divisors of 75 are: 1, 3, 5, 15, 25, 75.

Step 3: Calculate the sum of all divisors.
- Add all the divisors together:
  \[
  1 + 3 + 5 + 15 + 25 + 75 = 124
  \]

Therefore, the sum of all positive divisors of 75 is 124.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all positive divisors of 75 is 124.
