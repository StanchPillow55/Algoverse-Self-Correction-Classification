To determine how much money Mulan has left after her transactions, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Mulan's total money after receiving money from her father.**
   - Mulan initially has $40.
   - Her father gives her $100.
   - Total money after receiving from her father:
     \[
     40 + 100 = 140
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the items Mulan buys.**
   - Mulan buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each:
     \[
     2 \times 30 = 60
     \]
   - She also buys a bag for $20.
   - Total cost of the jeans and the bag:
     \[
     60 + 20 = 80
     \]

3. **Calculate how much money Mulan has left after her purchases.**
   - We subtract the total cost of the items from her total money:
     \[
     140 - 80 = 60
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Mulan has $60 left after her purchases.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]
