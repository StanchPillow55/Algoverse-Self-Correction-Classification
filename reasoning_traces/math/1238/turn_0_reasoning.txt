==================================================

To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost of the ingredients and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a year.

### Step 1: Calculate the weekly cost of ingredients

1. **Cost of pasta**: 
   - Bud buys 1 box of pasta for $1.00.
   - So, the cost of pasta per week = $1.00.

2. **Cost of cheddar cheese**:
   - Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese per week.
   - So, the cost of cheddar cheese per week = $3.00.

3. **Cost of gruyere cheese**:
   - Bud spends twice the amount he spends on cheddar cheese for gruyere cheese.
   - Therefore, the cost of gruyere cheese per week = 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

### Step 2: Calculate the total weekly cost

Now, we can find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one week by adding the costs of all the ingredients:

\[
\text{Total weekly cost} = \text{Cost of pasta} + \text{Cost of cheddar cheese} + \text{Cost of gruyere cheese}
\]

\[
\text{Total weekly cost} = 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the annual cost

Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, and there are 52 weeks in a year. To find the total cost for the year, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks:

\[
\text{Total annual cost} = \text{Total weekly cost} \times \text{Number of weeks}
\]

\[
\text{Total annual cost} = 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00
\]

### Final Answer

Bud spends a total of **$520.00** on making macaroni and cheese in one year.
