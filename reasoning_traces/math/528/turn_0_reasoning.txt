==================================================

Let's denote the number of chairs and sofas that Ophelia has as follows:

- Let \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has.
- Let \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has.

From the problem, we know that Ophelia has 20 sofas:

\[
S_O = 20
\]

According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Therefore, we can express the number of chairs Ophelia has in terms of the number of sofas:

\[
C_O = S_O + 2
\]

Substituting the value of \( S_O \):

\[
C_O = 20 + 2 = 22
\]

So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Next, we need to find out how many chairs and sofas Jenna has. We denote the number of chairs and sofas that Jenna has as follows:

- Let \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.
- Let \( S_J \) be the number of sofas Jenna has.

According to the problem, Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:

\[
C_J = 3 \times C_O
\]

Substituting the value of \( C_O \):

\[
C_J = 3 \times 22 = 66
\]

Now, we need to find out how many sofas Jenna has. Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can express the number of sofas Jenna has in terms of the number of chairs:

\[
S_J = C_J - 2
\]

Substituting the value of \( C_J \):

\[
S_J = 66 - 2 = 64
\]

Now we have the following totals:

- Ophelia has:
  - Sofas: \( S_O = 20 \)
  - Chairs: \( C_O = 22 \)

- Jenna has:
  - Sofas: \( S_J = 64 \)
  - Chairs: \( C_J = 66 \)

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna:

1. Total sofas:
\[
\text{Total Sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84
\]

2. Total chairs:
\[
\text{Total Chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88
\]

Finally, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs combined:

\[
\text{Total} = \text{Total Sofas} + \text{Total Chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172
\]

Thus, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is:

\[
\boxed{172}
\]
