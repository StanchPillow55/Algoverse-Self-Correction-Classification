Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's break it down step by step. However, since the question "Sample reasoning question 1" is not specific, I'll create a hypothetical math problem to demonstrate the process of solving it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - We are given the base and the height of the triangle.

2. **Recall the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**
   - The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - Base \( b = 10 \) units
   - Height \( h = 5 \) units
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

**Final Answer:**
The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

This solution demonstrates how to approach a math problem by understanding the problem, recalling relevant formulas, substituting given values, performing calculations, and stating the final answer clearly. If you have a specific problem you'd like to solve, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to assist!
