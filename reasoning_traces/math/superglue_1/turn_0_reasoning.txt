To solve the problem, we need to understand the context and the specific question being asked. Since the problem statement is "Sample reasoning question 1," it seems like a placeholder or an incomplete question. However, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning problem step by step.

Let's assume a sample math reasoning problem:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such plots can he create?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - We need to divide this field into smaller plots, each having an area of 150 square meters.
   - We need to determine how many such plots can be created.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width.
   - For the field: Area = 100 meters × 60 meters = 6000 square meters.

3. **Determine the Number of Plots:**
   - Each plot has an area of 150 square meters.
   - To find the number of plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot.
   - Number of plots = Total Area of Field / Area of One Plot
   - Number of plots = 6000 square meters / 150 square meters = 40 plots.

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Multiply the number of plots by the area of one plot to ensure it equals the total area of the field.
   - Total area from plots = 40 plots × 150 square meters/plot = 6000 square meters.
   - This matches the total area of the field, confirming our calculation is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 150 square meters.

This approach demonstrates how to break down a problem, perform calculations, and verify the results to ensure accuracy. If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
