Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify the nature of the question. Since the problem is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 1," it seems to be a hypothetical or illustrative problem rather than a specific mathematical question. However, I'll assume it's a typical math problem-solving scenario and demonstrate a structured approach to solving a generic math problem.

### Step-by-Step Problem Solving Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.
   - Clarify any terms or concepts that are not immediately clear.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.
     - Using logical reasoning.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify the solution by checking calculations.
   - Ensure the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm the result.

### Example Problem

Let's create a simple math problem to illustrate this process:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the dimensions (length and width) of the rectangle.
- We know the perimeter is 36 units.
- The length is twice the width.

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
- Let the width be \( w \).
- Then the length is \( 2w \).

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- Substitute the expressions for length and width into the perimeter formula:
  \[
  36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
  \]
- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  36 = 2 \times 3w
  \]
  \[
  36 = 6w
  \]
- Solve for \( w \):
  \[
  w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
  \]
- Since the length is twice the width:
  \[
  \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12
  \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check the Solution
- Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
  \[
  P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
  \]
- The calculations are correct, and the solution is consistent with the problem statement.

### Final Answer
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width: 6 units
- Length: 12 units

This structured approach ensures that we thoroughly understand and solve the problem, verifying each step along the way.
