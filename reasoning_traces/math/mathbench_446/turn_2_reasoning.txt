==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I'll need to know the specific details of "Sample math problem 446." Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details.

**Hypothetical Math Problem 446:**

**Problem:**  
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of a rectangle.
   - We know the relationship between the length and width: Length = 3 Ã— Width.
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is given as 48 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( W \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( L \) is \( 3W \).
   - Substitute these into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     48 = 2 \times (3W + W)
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms inside the parentheses:
     \[
     48 = 2 \times (4W)
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     48 = 8W
     \]

5. **Solve for \( W \):**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to isolate \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

6. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length \( L \) is 3 times the width:
     \[
     L = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (18 + 6) = 2 \times 24 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 6 units
- Length = 18 units
