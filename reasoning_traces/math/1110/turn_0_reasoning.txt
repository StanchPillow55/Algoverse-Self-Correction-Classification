==================================================

To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey of 9,300 miles in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days in June**: 
   June has 30 days.

2. **Calculate the total distance Soledad plans to hike in a day**:
   Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total distance she plans to hike in one day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance per day} = 125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance Soledad can hike in the entire month**:
   If she hikes 250 miles each day for 30 days, the total distance she can hike in June is:
   \[
   \text{Total distance in June} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Determine how many more miles she needs to hike**:
   Soledad wants to hike a total of 9,300 miles. We need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike beyond the 7,500 miles she can cover in June:
   \[
   \text{Additional miles needed} = 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate how many additional miles she must hike per day**:
   To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day, we divide the additional miles needed by the number of days in June:
   \[
   \text{Additional miles per day} = \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

6. **Final Calculation**:
   Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles each day on top of her planned 250 miles to reach her goal of 9,300 miles.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Soledad must hike an additional } 60 \text{ miles per day.}
\]
