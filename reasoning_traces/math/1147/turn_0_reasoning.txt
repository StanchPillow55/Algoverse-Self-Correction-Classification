==================================================

To determine how many days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we first need to calculate how many days she will need for each type of picture scene: large, medium, and small.

### Step 1: Calculate the days needed for large-sized picture scenes
Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day. She needs to create 45 large-sized picture scenes.

\[
\text{Days for large scenes} = \frac{\text{Total large scenes}}{\text{Scenes per day}} = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the days needed for medium-sized picture scenes
Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day. She needs to create 36 medium-sized picture scenes.

\[
\text{Days for medium scenes} = \frac{\text{Total medium scenes}}{\text{Scenes per day}} = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the days needed for small-sized picture scenes
Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day. She needs to create 49 small-sized picture scenes.

\[
\text{Days for small scenes} = \frac{\text{Total small scenes}}{\text{Scenes per day}} = \frac{49}{7} = 7 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total days needed
Now we need to add the days required for each type of scene to find the total number of days Lauren will need to complete the project.

\[
\text{Total days} = \text{Days for large scenes} + \text{Days for medium scenes} + \text{Days for small scenes}
\]
\[
\text{Total days} = 9 + 6 + 7 = 22 \text{ days}
\]

### Final Answer
Lauren will take a total of **22 days** to create all of the picture scenes.
