To find the total number of legs that the pets in the store have, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the legs for dogs:**
   - Each dog has 4 legs.
   - The pet store has 5 dogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of legs from dogs is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}
     \]

2. **Calculate the legs for cats:**
   - Each cat also has 4 legs.
   - The pet store has 2 cats.
   - Therefore, the total number of legs from cats is:
     \[
     2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the legs for birds:**
   - Each bird has 2 legs.
   - The pet store has 10 birds.
   - Therefore, the total number of legs from birds is:
     \[
     10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}
     \]

4. **Sum the total number of legs:**
   - Now we add the total legs from dogs, cats, and birds:
     \[
     20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}
     \]

Thus, the total number of legs in the pet store is \( \boxed{48} \).
