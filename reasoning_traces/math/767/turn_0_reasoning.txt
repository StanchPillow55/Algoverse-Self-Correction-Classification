To determine how much money Sam needs to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we can break the problem down into a series of steps.

1. **Determine the amount of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice**:
   - We know that to make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges.
   - Therefore, for 4 liters of juice, the amount of oranges required can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Oranges needed for 4 liters} = 5 \text{ kg/liter} \times 4 \text{ liters} = 20 \text{ kg}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the oranges**:
   - Each kilogram of oranges costs $3.
   - To find the total cost for 20 kilograms of oranges, we multiply the number of kilograms by the cost per kilogram:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 20 \text{ kg} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kg} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total amount of money Sam would have to spend to make 4 liters of juice is:
     \[
     \boxed{60} \text{ dollars}
     \]
