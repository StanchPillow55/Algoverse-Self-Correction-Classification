==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 351" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, let's assume it is a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills.

To demonstrate a structured approach, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step:

**Sample Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such plots can he create, and what will be the dimensions of each plot if they are all identical?

**Step 1: Calculate the total area of the field.**

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

For the farmer's field:
\[ \text{Area of the field} = 100 \, \text{meters} \times 60 \, \text{meters} = 6000 \, \text{square meters} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of plots.**

Each plot has an area of 150 square meters. To find the number of plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
\[ \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{6000}{150} \]

Perform the division:
\[ \frac{6000}{150} = 40 \]

So, the farmer can create 40 plots.

**Step 3: Determine the dimensions of each plot.**

We know each plot has an area of 150 square meters. Let's assume the dimensions of each plot are \( x \) meters by \( y \) meters, where \( x \times y = 150 \).

Since the problem states that the plots are identical, we need to find reasonable dimensions that fit the given area. One common approach is to choose dimensions that are factors of 150.

Factors of 150 include:
1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150

Let's choose dimensions that are practical for a rectangular plot. A reasonable choice could be:
\[ x = 10 \, \text{meters}, \, y = 15 \, \text{meters} \]

Verify:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \, \text{square meters} \]

This satisfies the condition for the area of each plot.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 identical plots, each with dimensions of 10 meters by 15 meters.
