==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 351" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning problem by creating a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal areas by building a fence parallel to the shorter side. How long will the fence be?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The field needs to be divided into two equal areas by a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     A = 100 \, \text{m} \times 60 \, \text{m} = 6000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

3. **Determine the Area of Each Half:**
   - Since the fence divides the field into two equal areas, each half will have an area of:
     \[
     \frac{6000 \, \text{m}^2}{2} = 3000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

4. **Determine the Dimensions of Each Half:**
   - The fence is parallel to the width (60 meters), so it will divide the length.
   - Let \( x \) be the length of each half.
   - The area of each half is given by:
     \[
     x \times 60 \, \text{m} = 3000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{3000 \, \text{m}^2}{60 \, \text{m}} = 50 \, \text{m}
     \]

5. **Length of the Fence:**
   - The fence will be parallel to the width, so its length will be equal to the width of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the fence is 60 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The length of the fence required to divide the field into two equal areas is 60 meters.
