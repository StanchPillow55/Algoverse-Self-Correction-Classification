To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, given that she invested $300 at a simple interest rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year.

### Step 1: Determine the interest rate

The problem states that the interest rate is "three-quarters of the original amount per year." This can be interpreted as follows:

- The original amount (principal) is $300.
- Three-quarters of $300 is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Interest Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225
  \]
  
However, this interpretation is incorrect for a percentage rate. Instead, we need to express this as a percentage of the principal. 

To find the interest rate as a percentage, we divide the interest amount by the principal:
\[
\text{Interest Rate} = \frac{225}{300} = 0.75 \text{ or } 75\%
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the simple interest for 3 years

The formula for calculating simple interest is:
\[
\text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t
\]
where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount ($300),
- \( r \) is the interest rate (75% or 0.75),
- \( t \) is the time in years (3 years).

Now we can substitute the values into the formula:
\[
\text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:
1. Calculate \( 300 \times 0.75 \):
   \[
   300 \times 0.75 = 225
   \]
2. Now multiply by the time (3 years):
   \[
   225 \times 3 = 675
   \]

So, the total simple interest earned over 3 years is $675.

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount after 3 years

To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we add the simple interest to the principal:
\[
\text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Simple Interest}
\]
Substituting the values we have:
\[
\text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975
\]

### Final Answer

Brenda will have a total of **$975** after 3 years.
