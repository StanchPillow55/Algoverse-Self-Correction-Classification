Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 383" might entail. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that involves reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide this field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 240 square meters. How many such plots can the farmer create?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 120 meters by 80 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into smaller plots, each having an area of 240 square meters.
   - We need to determine how many such plots can be created.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of the rectangular field is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area of the field} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 120 \, \text{m} \times 80 \, \text{m} = 9600 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

3. **Determine the Number of Plots:**
   - Each plot has an area of 240 square meters.
   - To find the number of plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
     \[
     \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{9600 \, \text{square meters}}{240 \, \text{square meters}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Division:**
   - Simplify the division:
     \[
     \frac{9600}{240} = 40
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 240 square meters, from the rectangular field.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 240 square meters.
