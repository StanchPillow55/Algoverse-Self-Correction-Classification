If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to assist with that.

### Step-by-Step Problem Solving Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.

4. **Review and Check:**
   - Once a solution is reached, review the steps taken to ensure they are logical and complete.
   - Verify the solution by substituting it back into the original problem, if applicable.
   - Consider if the answer is reasonable and if there might be alternative solutions.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, ensuring it addresses the question asked.
   - Include units or labels as necessary.

### Example Problem

Let's apply this approach to a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - The perimeter is given as 36 units.
   - The length is twice the width.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
   - Let the width be \( w \).
   - Then the length is \( 2w \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the expressions for length and width into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times 3w
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find the length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Review and Check:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are correct, and the perimeter matches the given value.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.
