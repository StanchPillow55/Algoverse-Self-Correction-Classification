==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 383" entails. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that involves logical reasoning and calculations. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A company manufactures two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day. Each Type A widget requires 2 hours of labor, and each Type B widget requires 3 hours of labor. The company has a maximum of 240 labor hours available per day. The profit from each Type A widget is $5, and the profit from each Type B widget is $7. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Constraints:**
   - The total number of widgets produced cannot exceed 100:
     \[
     x + y \leq 100
     \]
   - The total labor hours cannot exceed 240:
     \[
     2x + 3y \leq 240
     \]
   - Non-negativity constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

3. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function to maximize is:
     \[
     P = 5x + 7y
     \]

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the lines \( x + y = 100 \) and \( 2x + 3y = 240 \) on a graph.
   - Identify the feasible region that satisfies all constraints.

5. **Find the Corner Points:**
   - Solve the system of equations to find the intersection points:
     - \( x + y = 100 \)
     - \( 2x + 3y = 240 \)

   Solving these simultaneously:
   - From \( x + y = 100 \), we have \( y = 100 - x \).
   - Substitute into \( 2x + 3y = 240 \):
     \[
     2x + 3(100 - x) = 240
     \]
     \[
     2x + 300 - 3x = 240
     \]
     \[
     -x + 300 = 240
     \]
     \[
     x = 60
     \]
   - Substitute \( x = 60 \) into \( y = 100 - x \):
     \[
     y = 100 - 60 = 40
     \]

   - Other corner points are found by checking intersections with axes:
     - \( x = 0 \), \( y = 80 \) (from \( 2x + 3y = 240 \))
     - \( y = 0 \), \( x = 100 \) (from \( x + y = 100 \))

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( (60, 40) \): \( P = 5(60) + 7(40) = 300 + 280 = 580 \)
   - \( (0, 80) \): \( P = 5(0) + 7(80) = 560 \)
   - \( (100, 0) \): \( P = 5(100) + 7(0) = 500 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 580 \) at the point \( (60, 40) \).

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 60 Type A widgets and 40 Type B widgets to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $580.
