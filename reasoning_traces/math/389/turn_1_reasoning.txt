==================================================

To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of Dasha buying individual ride tickets, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha.

1. **Cost of the ride bracelet for David:**
   - The cost of the ride bracelet is $30.
   - Since the bracelet allows unlimited rides (up to 9 rides), David will pay $30 for all rides.

2. **Cost of tickets for Dasha:**
   - Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
   - Since there are 9 rides, the total number of tickets needed is:
     \[
     9 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ tickets/ride} = 18 \text{ tickets}
     \]
   - Each ticket costs $2, so the total cost for 18 tickets is:
     \[
     18 \text{ tickets} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 36 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculating the savings:**
   - Now we compare the costs:
     - David's cost: $30 (for the bracelet)
     - Dasha's cost: $36 (for the tickets)
   - To find out how much David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:
     \[
     36 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, David saves **$6** by purchasing the ride bracelet instead of Dasha buying individual ride tickets.

Final answer: **$6**.
