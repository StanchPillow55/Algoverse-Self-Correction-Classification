To find the total amount of rainfall for the town in November, we will break the problem down into two parts: the rainfall for the first 15 days and the rainfall for the remaining days of the month.

### Step 1: Calculate the rainfall for the first 15 days

During the first 15 days of November, it rained 4 inches per day. Therefore, the total rainfall for these 15 days can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Rainfall for first 15 days} = \text{Daily rainfall} \times \text{Number of days}
\]
\[
\text{Rainfall for first 15 days} = 4 \, \text{inches/day} \times 15 \, \text{days} = 60 \, \text{inches}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the average daily rainfall for the remaining days

November has a total of 30 days. Therefore, the number of days remaining after the first 15 days is:

\[
\text{Remaining days} = 30 - 15 = 15 \, \text{days}
\]

According to the problem, the average daily rainfall for the remaining 15 days is twice the amount observed during the first 15 days. Since the daily rainfall during the first 15 days was 4 inches, the average daily rainfall for the remaining days is:

\[
\text{Average daily rainfall for remaining days} = 2 \times 4 \, \text{inches} = 8 \, \text{inches/day}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total rainfall for the remaining days

Now we can calculate the total rainfall for the remaining 15 days:

\[
\text{Rainfall for remaining 15 days} = \text{Daily rainfall} \times \text{Number of days}
\]
\[
\text{Rainfall for remaining 15 days} = 8 \, \text{inches/day} \times 15 \, \text{days} = 120 \, \text{inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total rainfall for the month of November

Finally, we can find the total amount of rainfall for the entire month by adding the rainfall from the first 15 days and the rainfall from the remaining 15 days:

\[
\text{Total rainfall for November} = \text{Rainfall for first 15 days} + \text{Rainfall for remaining 15 days}
\]
\[
\text{Total rainfall for November} = 60 \, \text{inches} + 120 \, \text{inches} = 180 \, \text{inches}
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of rainfall for this town in November is:

\[
\boxed{180} \, \text{inches}
\]
