To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total rainfall for the entire month of November based on the given conditions.

### Step 1: Calculate Rainfall for the First 15 Days
We know that it rained 4 inches per day during the first 15 days of November. To find the total rainfall for these 15 days, we multiply the daily rainfall by the number of days:

\[
\text{Rainfall for first 15 days} = 4 \, \text{inches/day} \times 15 \, \text{days} = 60 \, \text{inches}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Number of Days in the Remainder of the Month
November has 30 days in total. Since we have already accounted for the first 15 days, the remainder of the month is:

\[
30 \, \text{days} - 15 \, \text{days} = 15 \, \text{days}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Average Daily Rainfall for the Remainder of the Month
The problem states that the average daily rainfall for the remainder of the month was twice the amount observed during the first 15 days. Since the daily rainfall during the first 15 days was 4 inches, the average daily rainfall for the remainder of the month is:

\[
2 \times 4 \, \text{inches/day} = 8 \, \text{inches/day}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Rainfall for the Remainder of the Month
Now, we calculate the total rainfall for the remaining 15 days using the average daily rainfall:

\[
\text{Rainfall for the remainder of the month} = 8 \, \text{inches/day} \times 15 \, \text{days} = 120 \, \text{inches}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Total Rainfall for November
Finally, we add the rainfall from the first 15 days and the remainder of the month to find the total rainfall for November:

\[
\text{Total rainfall for November} = 60 \, \text{inches} + 120 \, \text{inches} = 180 \, \text{inches}
\]

Thus, the total amount of rainfall for the town in November is \(\boxed{180}\) inches.
