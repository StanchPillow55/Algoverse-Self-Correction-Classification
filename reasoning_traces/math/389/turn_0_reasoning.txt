To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of tickets for all 9 rides, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha.

1. **Cost of the ride bracelet for David:**
   - The ride bracelet costs $30.
   - Since David buys the bracelet, his total cost is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for David} = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of tickets for Dasha:**
   - Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
   - Since there are 9 rides, the total number of tickets needed for Dasha is:
     \[
     \text{Total tickets} = 9 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ tickets/ride} = 18 \text{ tickets}
     \]
   - Each ticket costs $2, so the total cost for Dasha's tickets is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Dasha} = 18 \text{ tickets} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 36 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total cost for both David and Dasha:**
   - David's total cost is $30, and Dasha's total cost is $36. Therefore, the total amount spent by both is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 30 \text{ dollars} + 36 \text{ dollars} = 66 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost comparison:**
   - If both David and Dasha had bought tickets instead of the bracelet, we need to calculate how much it would cost for both of them to ride all 9 rides using tickets.
   - The total cost for both using tickets would be:
     \[
     \text{Total tickets for both} = 18 \text{ tickets (Dasha)} + 18 \text{ tickets (David)} = 36 \text{ tickets}
     \]
   - The cost for 36 tickets would be:
     \[
     \text{Cost for both using tickets} = 36 \text{ tickets} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 72 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculating David's savings:**
   - To find out how much David saves by buying the bracelet instead of tickets, we subtract the total cost with tickets from the total cost with the bracelet:
     \[
     \text{Savings} = \text{Cost for both using tickets} - \text{Total cost for both with bracelet}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Savings} = 72 \text{ dollars} - 66 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, David saves **$6** by buying the ride bracelet instead of tickets for both himself and Dasha. 

Final answer: **$6**
