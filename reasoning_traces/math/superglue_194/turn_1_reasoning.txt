==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 194" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I will assume a generic approach to tackle a typical reasoning problem. Let's consider a hypothetical reasoning question and solve it step-by-step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Question:** If a train travels 60 miles in 1 hour, how long will it take to travel 180 miles at the same speed?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the time it takes for a train to travel 180 miles given that it travels 60 miles in 1 hour.

2. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Speed of the train = 60 miles per hour (mph).
   - Distance to be traveled = 180 miles.

3. **Determine the Relationship:**
   - The relationship between distance, speed, and time is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - We can rearrange this formula to solve for time:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

4. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Substitute the given values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ mph}}
     \]

5. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Calculate the time:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To verify, consider that if the train travels 60 miles in 1 hour, then in 3 hours, it should travel:
     \[
     60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - The calculation checks out, confirming the solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
The train will take 3 hours to travel 180 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour.

This step-by-step approach ensures that we understand the problem, apply the correct formula, and verify our solution for accuracy.
