Question ID: superglue_194
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 194" entails. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by making reasonable assumptions about its nature. Let's assume it's a typical math problem involving algebra or arithmetic.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Since the problem is unspecified, let's assume it's a basic algebra problem. For example, let's solve the equation for \( x \):

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

#### Step 2: Isolate the Variable
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides**: This will help eliminate the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2**: This will solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 3: Verify the Solution
To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the assumed problem \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
