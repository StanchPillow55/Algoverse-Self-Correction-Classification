==================================================

To find out how many games Steve has after 3 years, we will break down the problem year by year and calculate the total number of games he accumulates.

### Year 1:
- **Initial games received**: 5 games
- **Games bought per month**: 1 game
- **Total games bought in a year**: 
  \[
  1 \text{ game/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ games}
  \]
- **Games received for Christmas**: 5 games

**Total games after Year 1**:
\[
5 \text{ (initial)} + 12 \text{ (bought)} + 5 \text{ (Christmas)} = 22 \text{ games}
\]

### Year 2:
- **Games bought per month**: 2 games
- **Total games bought in a year**: 
  \[
  2 \text{ games/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 24 \text{ games}
  \]
- **Games received for Christmas**: 5 games

**Total games after Year 2**:
\[
22 \text{ (from Year 1)} + 24 \text{ (bought)} + 5 \text{ (Christmas)} = 51 \text{ games}
\]

### Year 3:
- **Games bought per month**: 4 games
- **Total games bought in a year**: 
  \[
  4 \text{ games/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 48 \text{ games}
  \]
- **Games received for Christmas**: 5 games

**Total games after Year 3**:
\[
51 \text{ (from Year 2)} + 48 \text{ (bought)} + 5 \text{ (Christmas)} = 104 \text{ games}
\]

### Final Answer:
After 3 years, Steve has a total of **104 games**.
