To determine how many games Steve has after 3 years, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Games**: 
   Steve starts with 5 games given to him by his parents.

   \[
   \text{Initial games} = 5
   \]

2. **Games Bought in the First Year**:
   In the first year, Steve buys 1 game per month. There are 12 months in a year, so:

   \[
   \text{Games bought in the first year} = 1 \text{ game/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ games}
   \]

   He also receives 5 games for Christmas at the end of the year. Therefore, the total number of games he has after the first year is:

   \[
   \text{Total games after year 1} = \text{Initial games} + \text{Games bought in the first year} + \text{Christmas games}
   \]
   \[
   = 5 + 12 + 5 = 22 \text{ games}
   \]

3. **Games Bought in the Second Year**:
   In the second year, Steve buys 2 games per month. Again, there are 12 months in a year:

   \[
   \text{Games bought in the second year} = 2 \text{ games/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 24 \text{ games}
   \]

   He receives another 5 games for Christmas. Thus, the total number of games he has after the second year is:

   \[
   \text{Total games after year 2} = \text{Total games after year 1} + \text{Games bought in the second year} + \text{Christmas games}
   \]
   \[
   = 22 + 24 + 5 = 51 \text{ games}
   \]

4. **Games Bought in the Third Year**:
   In the third year, Steve buys 4 games per month. Again, there are 12 months in a year:

   \[
   \text{Games bought in the third year} = 4 \text{ games/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 48 \text{ games}
   \]

   He receives another 5 games for Christmas. Therefore, the total number of games he has after the third year is:

   \[
   \text{Total games after year 3} = \text{Total games after year 2} + \text{Games bought in the third year} + \text{Christmas games}
   \]
   \[
   = 51 + 48 + 5 = 104 \text{ games}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   After 3 years, Steve has a total of:

   \[
   \boxed{104} \text{ games}
   \]
