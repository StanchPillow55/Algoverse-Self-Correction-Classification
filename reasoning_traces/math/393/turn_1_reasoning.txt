Question ID: 393
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the width of the sandbox, we can use the information given about the perimeter and the relationship between the length and width.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the sandbox.
   - Since the length is twice the width, we can express the length \( l \) as:
     \[
     l = 2w
     \]

2. **Perimeter Formula**:
   The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
   \[
   P = 2l + 2w
   \]
   We know from the problem that the perimeter is 30 feet:
   \[
   2l + 2w = 30
   \]

3. **Substitute for Length**:
   Substitute \( l = 2w \) into the perimeter equation:
   \[
   2(2w) + 2w = 30
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   4w + 2w = 30
   \]
   \[
   6w = 30
   \]

4. **Solve for Width**:
   Now, divide both sides by 6 to find \( w \):
   \[
   w = \frac{30}{6} = 5
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   The width of the sandbox is:
   \[
   \boxed{5} \text{ feet}
   \]
