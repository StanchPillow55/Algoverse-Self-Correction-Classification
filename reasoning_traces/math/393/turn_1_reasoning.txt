Question ID: 393
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine what percentage of Carol's total work time was spent editing, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time spent on each activity**:
   - Time spent writing the song: 4 hours
   - Time spent recording the song: half of the writing time, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
   - Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes

2. **Convert all time to the same unit**:
   Since we have hours and minutes, we will convert everything to hours for consistency. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
   - 90 minutes in hours is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours

3. **Calculate the total time spent**:
   Now, we can sum up all the time spent on each activity:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time writing} + \text{Time recording} + \text{Time editing}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage of time spent editing**:
   To find the percentage of total work time that was spent editing, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{7.5 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100
   \]

5. **Perform the calculation**:
   First, calculate the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{1.5}{7.5} = 0.2
   \]
   Now, multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
   \[
   0.2 \times 100 = 20\%
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   Carol spent **20%** of her total work time editing the song.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20\%}
\]
