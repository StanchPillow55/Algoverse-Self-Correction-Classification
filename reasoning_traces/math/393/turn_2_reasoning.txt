Question ID: 393
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out what percentage of Carol's total work time she spent editing, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time spent on each activity**:
   - **Writing the song**: Carol spends 4 hours writing the song.
   - **Recording the song**: She spends half of the time spent writing on recording. So, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Time spent recording} = \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{2} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - **Editing the song**: She spends 90 minutes editing. We need to convert this time into hours for consistency:
     \[
     90 \text{ minutes} = \frac{90}{60} \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total work time**:
   Now we add up all the time spent on each activity:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time writing} + \text{Time recording} + \text{Time editing}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the percentage of time spent editing**:
   To find the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{7.5 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform the calculation**:
   First, we calculate the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{1.5}{7.5} = 0.2
   \]
   Then, we multiply by 100 to convert it to a percentage:
   \[
   0.2 \times 100 = 20\%
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Carol spent **20%** of her total work time editing.
