To solve this problem, we need to find the width of the rectangular sandbox given that the perimeter is 30 feet and the length is twice the width.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( w \) be the width of the sandbox.
- Since the length is twice the width, we can express the length as \( l = 2w \).

The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[
P = 2l + 2w
\]

We know from the problem statement that the perimeter is 30 feet, so we can set up the equation:
\[
2l + 2w = 30
\]

Substitute the expression for the length \( l = 2w \) into the perimeter equation:
\[
2(2w) + 2w = 30
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
4w + 2w = 30
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
6w = 30
\]

To solve for \( w \), divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[
w = \frac{30}{6} = 5
\]

Thus, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

To verify, let's check the length and the perimeter:
- The length \( l = 2w = 2 \times 5 = 10 \) feet.
- The perimeter should be \( 2l + 2w = 2(10) + 2(5) = 20 + 10 = 30 \) feet, which matches the given perimeter.

Therefore, the calculations are correct, and the width of the sandbox is \(\boxed{5}\) feet.
