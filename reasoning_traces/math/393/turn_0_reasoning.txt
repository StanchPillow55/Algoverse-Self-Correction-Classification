==================================================

To find out what percentage of Carol's total work time was spent editing, we will first calculate the total time she spent on each activity and then determine the percentage of time spent editing.

1. **Calculate the time spent on each activity:**
   - Time spent writing the song: 4 hours
   - Time spent recording the song: Half of the writing time, which is:
     \[
     \text{Time spent recording} = \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{2} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes. We need to convert this into hours for consistency:
     \[
     90 \text{ minutes} = \frac{90}{60} \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total work time:**
   Now we will add up all the time spent on each activity:
   \[
   \text{Total work time} = \text{Time writing} + \text{Time recording} + \text{Time editing}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total work time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total work time} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the percentage of time spent editing:**
   To find the percentage of her total work time that was spent editing, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of time spent editing} = \left(\frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total work time}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of time spent editing} = \left(\frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{7.5 \text{ hours}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage of time spent editing} = \left(\frac{1.5}{7.5}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage of time spent editing} = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\%
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Carol spent **20%** of her total work time editing.
