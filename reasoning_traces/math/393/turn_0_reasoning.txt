To solve the problem, we need to find the width of the rectangular sandbox given the perimeter and the relationship between the length and width.

Let's denote:
- The width of the sandbox as \( w \) (in feet).
- The length of the sandbox as \( l \) (in feet).

According to the problem, we know two things:
1. The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet.
2. The length is twice the width, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   l = 2w
   \]

The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[
P = 2l + 2w
\]

Substituting the known perimeter into the formula, we have:
\[
30 = 2l + 2w
\]

Now, we can substitute \( l \) with \( 2w \) in the perimeter equation:
\[
30 = 2(2w) + 2w
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
30 = 4w + 2w
\]
\[
30 = 6w
\]

Next, we solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:
\[
w = \frac{30}{6} = 5
\]

Now that we have found the width, we can also find the length for verification:
Using \( l = 2w \):
\[
l = 2(5) = 10
\]

Now, let's check the perimeter with these dimensions:
\[
P = 2l + 2w = 2(10) + 2(5) = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

Thus, the width of the sandbox is:
\[
\boxed{5} \text{ feet}
\]
