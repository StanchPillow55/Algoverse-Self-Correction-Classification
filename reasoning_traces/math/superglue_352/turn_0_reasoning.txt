==================================================

To solve a math problem, I need the specific details or context of the problem. Since "Sample reasoning question 352" doesn't provide any specific information or numbers to work with, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem by walking through an example. 

Let's consider the following problem:

**Problem:**
A car travels from Town A to Town B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. The distance between Town A and Town B is 180 miles. How long does it take for the car to travel from Town A to Town B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the time it takes for a car to travel a certain distance at a given speed. The distance is 180 miles, and the speed is 60 miles per hour.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]

3. **Plug in the Values:**
   Substitute the given values into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
   \]

4. **Calculate:**
   Perform the division:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Verify:**
   To ensure the calculation is correct, consider the units. We divided miles by miles per hour, which correctly results in hours. Additionally, multiplying the time by the speed should give us the original distance:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ miles per hour} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]
   This confirms our calculation is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The car takes 3 hours to travel from Town A to Town B.

This example demonstrates how to approach a math problem by understanding the problem, identifying the relevant formula, substituting the given values, performing the calculation, verifying the result, and stating the final answer. If you have a specific problem or question, please provide the details, and I can work through that problem for you.
