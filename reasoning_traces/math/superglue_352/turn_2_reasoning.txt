Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 352." However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by breaking down the steps and showing the reasoning process.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 352" involves solving a mathematical equation or problem. Here is a step-by-step approach to tackling such problems:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read Carefully**: Ensure you understand what the problem is asking. Identify the key information and what you need to find.
- **Identify Variables**: Determine what variables or unknowns are involved in the problem.

### Step 2: Plan a Strategy
- **Choose a Method**: Decide on the best method to solve the problem. This could involve algebraic manipulation, drawing diagrams, or applying specific mathematical formulas or theorems.
- **Break Down the Problem**: If the problem is complex, break it down into smaller, more manageable parts.

### Step 3: Execute the Plan
- **Perform Calculations**: Carry out the necessary calculations step by step. Show all work to ensure clarity and accuracy.
- **Check Each Step**: Verify each step to avoid errors. If you encounter a mistake, backtrack to find where it occurred.

### Step 4: Review and Conclude
- **Verify the Solution**: Once you have a solution, check it against the problem to ensure it makes sense and satisfies all conditions.
- **State the Final Answer**: Clearly write down the final answer, ensuring it is in the correct form and units (if applicable).

### Example Problem
Let's apply this process to a simple algebra problem:

**Problem**: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

#### Step 2: Plan a Strategy
- We will isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

#### Step 3: Execute the Plan
1. Start with the equation:  
   \[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):  
   \[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]  
   \[ 2x = 8 \]

3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):  
   \[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]  
   \[ x = 4 \]

#### Step 4: Review and Conclude
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:  
  \[ 2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 \]
- The solution satisfies the equation.

**Final Answer**: \( x = 4 \)

This example illustrates a structured approach to solving a math problem. If you have a specific "Sample reasoning question 352" in mind, please provide the details, and I can apply this method to solve it.
