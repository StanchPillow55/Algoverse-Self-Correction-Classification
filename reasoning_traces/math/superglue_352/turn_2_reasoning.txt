==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 352" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, let's assume it is a generic math problem that involves reasoning and calculations. I will create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. Last month, the company produced a total of 500 widgets and made a profit of $3,000. How many of each type of widget did the company produce?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of widgets produced is 500:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - The profit is calculated as the difference between the total revenue and the total production cost. The profit is $3,000:
     \[
     (10x + 15y) - (5x + 8y) = 3000
     \]

3. **Simplify the Profit Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression for profit:
     \[
     10x + 15y - 5x - 8y = 3000
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     5x + 7y = 3000
     \]

4. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system of equations:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 500 \\
     5x + 7y &= 3000
     \end{align*}
     \]

   - Solve the first equation for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 500 - y
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 500 - y \) into the second equation:
     \[
     5(500 - y) + 7y = 3000
     \]

   - Distribute and simplify:
     \[
     2500 - 5y + 7y = 3000
     \]

   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     2y = 500
     \]

   - Solve for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 250
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 250 \) back into the equation for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 500 - 250 = 250
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The company produced 250 Type A widgets and 250 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company produced 250 Type A widgets and 250 Type B widgets.
