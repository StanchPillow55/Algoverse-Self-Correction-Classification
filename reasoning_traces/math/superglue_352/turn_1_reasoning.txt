Question ID: superglue_352
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 352" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume this is a typical algebra problem involving solving for \( x \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

Let's assume the problem is: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 3: Solve for the Variable**

Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.

\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

Calculate the left side:

\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

Since the original problem statement was vague, this example demonstrates a typical approach to solving an algebraic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 352" refers to a specific problem, please provide more details for a tailored solution.
