==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first break down the information provided and understand what is being asked. However, the problem statement "Sample reasoning question 352" is not specific enough for me to determine the exact nature of the problem. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that might exist in a textbook or a database.

Since I don't have the actual details of "Sample reasoning question 352," I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem involves basic arithmetic or algebra, as these are common in reasoning questions.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem Statement:**  
A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends $25, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( o \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of fruits is 10:
     \[
     a + o = 10
     \]
   - We also know the total cost is $25:
     \[
     2a + 3o = 25
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have two equations:
     1. \( a + o = 10 \)
     2. \( 2a + 3o = 25 \)

   - Solve the first equation for one variable, say \( a \):
     \[
     a = 10 - o
     \]

   - Substitute \( a = 10 - o \) into the second equation:
     \[
     2(10 - o) + 3o = 25
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( o \):
     \[
     20 - 2o + 3o = 25
     \]
     \[
     20 + o = 25
     \]
     \[
     o = 25 - 20
     \]
     \[
     o = 5
     \]

   - Substitute \( o = 5 \) back into the equation for \( a \):
     \[
     a = 10 - o = 10 - 5 = 5
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of fruits:
     \[
     a + o = 5 + 5 = 10
     \]
   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     2a + 3o = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming that the solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.
