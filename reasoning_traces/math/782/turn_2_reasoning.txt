==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break down the information given and calculate the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week.

1. **Determine the usual riding frequency:**
   - Chase and Rider ride their bikes **thrice a day** for **5 days**.
   - The number of rides in these 5 days can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Rides in 5 days} = 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}
     \]

2. **Determine the riding frequency on the additional days:**
   - On **two other days**, they ride **twice** the usual number of rides.
   - The usual number of rides per day is 3, so twice that would be:
     \[
     \text{Rides on special days} = 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day}
     \]
   - For the two special days, the total number of rides is:
     \[
     \text{Rides in 2 special days} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total rides for the week:**
   - Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the special days:
     \[
     \text{Total rides in a week} = \text{Rides in 5 days} + \text{Rides in 2 special days}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total rides in a week} = 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is:
     \[
     \boxed{27}
     \]
