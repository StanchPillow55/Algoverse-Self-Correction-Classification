To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week based on the information provided.

1. **Determine the usual riding frequency:**
   - Chase and Rider ride their bikes **thrice a day** for **5 days**.
   - The number of rides in these 5 days can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Rides in 5 days} = 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}
     \]

2. **Determine the riding frequency on the other two days:**
   - On the two other days, they ride **twice the times they do on usual days**.
   - Since they usually ride thrice a day, on these two days, they ride:
     \[
     2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day}
     \]
   - The number of rides in these 2 days can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Rides in 2 days} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total rides for the week:**
   - Now, we can find the total number of rides for the entire week by adding the rides from the first 5 days and the rides from the last 2 days:
     \[
     \text{Total rides} = \text{Rides in 5 days} + \text{Rides in 2 days}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total rides} = 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}
     \]

Thus, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is \( \boxed{27} \).
