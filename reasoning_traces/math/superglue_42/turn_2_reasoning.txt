Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 42" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating an example problem and solving it step-by-step.

**Example Problem:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - We are given the base (\(b\)) of the triangle as 10 units.
   - We are given the height (\(h\)) of the triangle as 5 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**
   - The formula to calculate the area (\(A\)) of a triangle is:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   - Substitute \(b = 10\) and \(h = 5\) into the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle using the given dimensions. This approach can be adapted to solve various types of math problems by identifying the relevant formulas, substituting known values, and performing the necessary calculations.
