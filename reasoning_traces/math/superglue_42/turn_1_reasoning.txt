Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand the context and requirements of the question. However, the question provided, "Sample reasoning question 42," lacks specific details or numerical data to work with. Therefore, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem, using a hypothetical example.

### Hypothetical Problem:
Let's assume the problem is: "If a train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, how long will it take to travel 180 miles?"

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for a train to travel a certain distance at a constant speed.
   - Given:
     - Speed of the train = 60 miles per hour
     - Distance to travel = 180 miles

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The basic formula relating distance, speed, and time is:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - We need to solve for time, so we rearrange the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - Plug the given values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 180 by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To ensure the solution is correct, check the calculation:
     - If the train travels 60 miles in one hour, then in three hours, it should travel:
       \[
       60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
       \]
   - The calculation checks out, confirming the solution is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The train will take 3 hours to travel 180 miles at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.

### Conclusion:
By following a structured approach, we solved the hypothetical problem using basic arithmetic and algebraic manipulation. This method can be applied to a wide range of similar problems involving distance, speed, and time. If you have a specific problem or additional details, please provide them so I can offer a more tailored solution.
