==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 42" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical problem and work through it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem Statement:** A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by constructing a fence parallel to the shorter side. What is the length of the fence?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The task is to divide the field into two equal parts using a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - Imagine the rectangle with the longer side (100 meters) as the base.
   - The shorter side (60 meters) is the width.
   - The fence will be parallel to the 60-meter side, effectively cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles.

3. **Determine the Area of the Field:**
   - The area of the entire field is given by the formula for the area of a rectangle: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 100 \, \text{m} \times 60 \, \text{m} = 6000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

4. **Divide the Field into Two Equal Parts:**
   - Since the field is to be divided into two equal parts, each part will have an area of:
     \[
     \text{Area of each part} = \frac{6000 \, \text{m}^2}{2} = 3000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

5. **Determine the Dimensions of Each Part:**
   - Each part will still have the same width of 60 meters.
   - Let \( x \) be the length of each part. Then:
     \[
     x \times 60 \, \text{m} = 3000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{3000 \, \text{m}^2}{60 \, \text{m}} = 50 \, \text{m}
     \]

6. **Length of the Fence:**
   - The fence is parallel to the 60-meter side and spans the entire length of the field, which is 100 meters.

### Final Answer:
The length of the fence required to divide the field into two equal parts is **100 meters**.
