To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 256" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume that "256" is the number we need to work with, and I'll create a math problem involving this number. Let's solve a problem involving finding the square root of 256.

### Problem: Find the square root of 256.

**Step 1: Understand the problem.**

We need to find a number which, when multiplied by itself, gives 256. This number is called the square root of 256.

**Step 2: Recall the definition of a square root.**

The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).

**Step 3: Calculate the square root of 256.**

To find the square root of 256, we can use the fact that 256 is a perfect square. We can try to factor 256 into smaller numbers to see if we can find its square root.

**Step 4: Factor 256.**

Let's factor 256:

1. 256 is even, so divide by 2:
   \[
   256 \div 2 = 128
   \]

2. 128 is even, so divide by 2:
   \[
   128 \div 2 = 64
   \]

3. 64 is even, so divide by 2:
   \[
   64 \div 2 = 32
   \]

4. 32 is even, so divide by 2:
   \[
   32 \div 2 = 16
   \]

5. 16 is even, so divide by 2:
   \[
   16 \div 2 = 8
   \]

6. 8 is even, so divide by 2:
   \[
   8 \div 2 = 4
   \]

7. 4 is even, so divide by 2:
   \[
   4 \div 2 = 2
   \]

8. Finally, 2 is a prime number.

The prime factorization of 256 is:
\[
256 = 2^8
\]

**Step 5: Use the prime factorization to find the square root.**

Since \( 256 = 2^8 \), the square root of 256 can be found by taking half of the exponent in the prime factorization:
\[
\sqrt{256} = \sqrt{2^8} = 2^{8/2} = 2^4 = 16
\]

**Step 6: Verify the result.**

To verify, we can square 16 to see if we get 256:
\[
16 \times 16 = 256
\]

The calculation is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The square root of 256 is 16.
