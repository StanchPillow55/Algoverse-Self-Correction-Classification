==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 256" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it involves the number 256 and explore a few common mathematical problems or operations involving this number. Let's consider a few possibilities:

### 1. **Finding the Square Root of 256**

One common problem involving numbers is finding their square roots. Let's calculate the square root of 256.

\[
\sqrt{256}
\]

To find the square root, we look for a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives 256. We can try a few numbers:

- \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \)
- \( 15 \times 15 = 225 \)
- \( 16 \times 16 = 256 \)

Thus, the square root of 256 is 16.

### 2. **Expressing 256 as a Power of 2**

Another common problem is expressing a number as a power of another number. Let's express 256 as a power of 2.

We know that:

\[
2^8 = 256
\]

Therefore, 256 can be expressed as \( 2^8 \).

### 3. **Prime Factorization of 256**

Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of prime numbers. Let's find the prime factorization of 256.

Starting with 256, we divide by the smallest prime number, which is 2:

\[
256 \div 2 = 128
\]
\[
128 \div 2 = 64
\]
\[
64 \div 2 = 32
\]
\[
32 \div 2 = 16
\]
\[
16 \div 2 = 8
\]
\[
8 \div 2 = 4
\]
\[
4 \div 2 = 2
\]
\[
2 \div 2 = 1
\]

Counting the number of 2s, we see that 256 is composed of eight 2s multiplied together. Thus, the prime factorization of 256 is:

\[
256 = 2^8
\]

### Conclusion

Based on the common mathematical operations involving the number 256, we have:

1. The square root of 256 is 16.
2. 256 can be expressed as \( 2^8 \).
3. The prime factorization of 256 is \( 2^8 \).

If you have a specific problem involving the number 256, please provide more details, and I can solve that particular problem.
