To solve the problem, we need to determine the total cost of the phones John is buying for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife. 

1. **Identify the number of phones**: 
   - John is buying phones for himself (1), his wife (1), and his 2 kids (2). 
   - Total number of phones = 1 (John) + 1 (wife) + 2 (kids) = 4 phones.

2. **Determine the price of the phones**:
   - The price of each phone is $600.
   - According to the problem, the first 2 phones are at full price, and any phones after the first 2 are at half price.

3. **Calculate the cost of the first 2 phones**:
   - Cost of the first phone = $600
   - Cost of the second phone = $600
   - Total cost for the first 2 phones = $600 + $600 = $1200.

4. **Calculate the cost of the remaining phones**:
   - Since John is buying 4 phones in total and the first 2 are at full price, the remaining phones are:
     - Total phones = 4
     - Phones at full price = 2
     - Remaining phones = 4 - 2 = 2 phones.
   - The price for each of these remaining phones is half of $600:
     - Half price = $600 / 2 = $300.
   - Total cost for the 2 remaining phones = $300 + $300 = $600.

5. **Calculate the total cost for all phones**:
   - Total cost = Cost of first 2 phones + Cost of remaining 2 phones
   - Total cost = $1200 + $600 = $1800.

Thus, the total amount John paid for all the phones is **$1800**.

Final answer: **$1800**.
