Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much John pays for a total of 4 phones, given that the first 2 phones are at full price and the subsequent phones are at half price.

1. **Identify the number of phones**: 
   - John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals to 4 phones.

2. **Determine the price of the phones**:
   - The price of each phone is $600.

3. **Calculate the cost of the first 2 phones**:
   - The first 2 phones are at full price:
   \[
   \text{Cost of first 2 phones} = 2 \times 600 = 1200
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the next 2 phones**:
   - The next 2 phones are at half price:
   \[
   \text{Half price} = \frac{600}{2} = 300
   \]
   - Therefore, the cost of the next 2 phones is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of next 2 phones} = 2 \times 300 = 600
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost**:
   - Now, we add the cost of the first 2 phones and the cost of the next 2 phones:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 1200 + 600 = 1800
   \]

Thus, the total amount John paid for all the phones is **$1800**. 

Final answer: **$1800**.
