To find the total cost for Clarissa to have 10 copies of a 400-page manuscript printed and bound, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the cost of copying the manuscript and the cost of binding it.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of copying the manuscript

1. **Determine the cost per page**: The printer charges $0.05 per page.
2. **Calculate the total number of pages for 10 copies**:
   \[
   \text{Total pages} = \text{Number of copies} \times \text{Pages per manuscript} = 10 \times 400 = 4000 \text{ pages}
   \]
3. **Calculate the total cost for copying**:
   \[
   \text{Cost for copying} = \text{Total pages} \times \text{Cost per page} = 4000 \times 0.05 = 200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of binding the manuscript

1. **Determine the cost per manuscript for binding**: The printer charges $5.00 per manuscript.
2. **Calculate the total cost for binding 10 copies**:
   \[
   \text{Cost for binding} = \text{Number of copies} \times \text{Cost per manuscript} = 10 \times 5.00 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost

Now, we add the costs of copying and binding together:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for copying} + \text{Cost for binding} = 200 + 50 = 250 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The total cost for Clarissa to have 10 copies of the manuscript printed and bound is **$250.00**.
