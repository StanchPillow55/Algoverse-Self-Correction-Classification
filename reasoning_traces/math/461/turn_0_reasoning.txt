==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of copying and binding 10 copies of a 400-page manuscript. We will break down the problem into two parts: the cost of copying and the cost of binding.

### Step 1: Calculate the Cost of Copying

1. **Determine the cost of copying one page:**
   The cost to copy one page is $0.05.

2. **Calculate the cost to copy one manuscript:**
   Since the manuscript is 400 pages long, the cost to copy one manuscript is:
   \[
   400 \text{ pages} \times \$0.05 \text{ per page} = \$20.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost to copy 10 manuscripts:**
   Since Clarissa needs 10 copies, the total cost for copying all 10 manuscripts is:
   \[
   10 \text{ manuscripts} \times \$20.00 \text{ per manuscript} = \$200.00
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Cost of Binding

1. **Determine the cost of binding one manuscript:**
   The cost to bind one manuscript is $5.00.

2. **Calculate the cost to bind 10 manuscripts:**
   The total cost for binding all 10 manuscripts is:
   \[
   10 \text{ manuscripts} \times \$5.00 \text{ per manuscript} = \$50.00
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost

To find the total cost of both copying and binding the 10 manuscripts, we add the total costs from the two parts:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Copying} + \text{Cost of Binding} = \$200.00 + \$50.00 = \$250.00
\]

### Final Answer

The total cost to have the manuscript copied and bound 10 times is \(\$250.00\).
