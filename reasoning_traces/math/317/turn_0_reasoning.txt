To determine how many hours Madeline has left over in a week, we first need to calculate the total number of hours she spends on various activities and then subtract that from the total hours available in a week.

1. **Calculate the total hours in a week:**
   There are 24 hours in a day, and a week has 7 days. Therefore, the total number of hours in a week is:
   \[
   24 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 168 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total hours spent in class:**
   Madeline spends 18 hours a week in class.

3. **Calculate the total hours spent on homework:**
   She spends 4 hours per day on homework. Over a week (7 days), the total hours spent on homework is:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total hours spent sleeping:**
   Madeline sleeps for 8 hours each day. Over a week, the total hours spent sleeping is:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 56 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total hours spent working part-time:**
   She works part-time for 20 hours a week.

6. **Add up all the hours spent on various activities:**
   Now we sum all the hours spent on class, homework, sleeping, and working:
   \[
   \text{Total hours spent} = \text{Hours in class} + \text{Hours on homework} + \text{Hours sleeping} + \text{Hours working}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total hours spent} = 18 + 28 + 56 + 20 = 122 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

7. **Calculate the hours left over:**
   To find the hours left over, we subtract the total hours spent from the total hours in a week:
   \[
   \text{Hours left over} = \text{Total hours in a week} - \text{Total hours spent}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Hours left over} = 168 - 122 = 46 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Madeline has **46 hours left over** in a week.
