==================================================

To determine how many hours Madeline has left over each week, we need to account for all the activities she spends time on and subtract these from the total number of hours in a week.

1. **Calculate the total number of hours in a week:**

   There are 24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week. Therefore, the total number of hours in a week is:
   \[
   24 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 168 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total hours spent on each activity per week:**

   - **Class:** Madeline spends 18 hours per week in class.
   - **Homework:** She spends 4 hours per day on homework. Therefore, the total hours spent on homework per week is:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ hours/week}
     \]
   - **Sleeping:** She sleeps 8 hours per day. Therefore, the total hours spent sleeping per week is:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 56 \text{ hours/week}
     \]
   - **Part-time work:** She works 20 hours per week.

3. **Calculate the total hours spent on all activities per week:**

   Add up all the hours spent on different activities:
   \[
   18 \text{ hours (class)} + 28 \text{ hours (homework)} + 56 \text{ hours (sleeping)} + 20 \text{ hours (work)} = 122 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of hours left over:**

   Subtract the total hours spent on activities from the total hours in a week:
   \[
   168 \text{ hours/week} - 122 \text{ hours/week} = 46 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

Therefore, Madeline has 46 hours left over each week.

**Final Answer: 46 hours**
