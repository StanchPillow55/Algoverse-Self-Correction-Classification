==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 306," we first need to understand what the problem entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume it involves a typical math problem scenario. For the sake of this exercise, let's consider a hypothetical problem:

**Problem Statement:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100, inclusive.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   Even numbers are integers divisible by 2. Between 1 and 100, the even numbers start at 2 and end at 100.

2. **List the Even Numbers:**
   The sequence of even numbers between 1 and 100 is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

3. **Determine the Number of Terms:**
   This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the last term \( a_n = 100 \), with a common difference \( d = 2 \).

   To find the number of terms \( n \), use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
   \]
   Plugging in the known values:
   \[
   100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
   \]
   \[
   100 = 2 + 2n - 2
   \]
   \[
   100 = 2n
   \]
   \[
   n = 50
   \]

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
   \]
   \[
   S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
   \]
   \[
   S_{50} = 2550
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.
