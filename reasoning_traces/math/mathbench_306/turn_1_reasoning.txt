==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 306," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not provided here. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume a hypothetical math problem that involves basic arithmetic operations. I will create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the value of the expression: \( (15 + 6) \times 2 - 4^2 + 10 \div 2 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify and Apply the Order of Operations:**
   The order of operations can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:
   - Parentheses
   - Exponents
   - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
   - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

2. **Solve Inside Parentheses:**
   The expression inside the parentheses is \( (15 + 6) \).
   \[
   15 + 6 = 21
   \]
   So, the expression becomes \( 21 \times 2 - 4^2 + 10 \div 2 \).

3. **Calculate Exponents:**
   The exponent in the expression is \( 4^2 \).
   \[
   4^2 = 16
   \]
   Now, the expression is \( 21 \times 2 - 16 + 10 \div 2 \).

4. **Perform Multiplication and Division from Left to Right:**
   - First, perform the multiplication:
     \[
     21 \times 2 = 42
     \]
     The expression is now \( 42 - 16 + 10 \div 2 \).

   - Next, perform the division:
     \[
     10 \div 2 = 5
     \]
     The expression is now \( 42 - 16 + 5 \).

5. **Perform Addition and Subtraction from Left to Right:**
   - First, perform the subtraction:
     \[
     42 - 16 = 26
     \]
     The expression is now \( 26 + 5 \).

   - Next, perform the addition:
     \[
     26 + 5 = 31
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The value of the expression \( (15 + 6) \times 2 - 4^2 + 10 \div 2 \) is \( 31 \).

This is a hypothetical problem and solution based on the assumption of a typical arithmetic expression. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 306," please provide the details so I can assist you accurately.
