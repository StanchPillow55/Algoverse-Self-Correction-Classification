To find the total number of legs in Javier's household, we need to calculate the number of legs for each member of the household, including humans and pets.

1. **Count the number of humans:**
   - Javier: 2 legs
   - Wife: 2 legs
   - 3 children: Each child has 2 legs, so for 3 children:
     \[
     3 \text{ children} \times 2 \text{ legs/child} = 6 \text{ legs}
     \]
   - Total legs from humans:
     \[
     2 \text{ (Javier)} + 2 \text{ (wife)} + 6 \text{ (children)} = 10 \text{ legs}
     \]

2. **Count the number of pets:**
   - 2 dogs: Each dog has 4 legs, so for 2 dogs:
     \[
     2 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 8 \text{ legs}
     \]
   - 1 cat: A cat also has 4 legs, so:
     \[
     1 \text{ cat} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 4 \text{ legs}
     \]
   - Total legs from pets:
     \[
     8 \text{ (dogs)} + 4 \text{ (cat)} = 12 \text{ legs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of legs in the household:**
   - Total legs from humans + total legs from pets:
     \[
     10 \text{ (humans)} + 12 \text{ (pets)} = 22 \text{ legs}
     \]

Thus, the total number of legs in Javier's household is \( \boxed{22} \).
