To solve this problem, we need to count the total number of legs in Javier's household, including humans and animals.

1. **Count the number of human legs:**
   - Javier himself has 2 legs.
   - Javier's wife also has 2 legs.
   - Each of his 3 children has 2 legs.

   Let's calculate the total number of human legs:
   \[
   \text{Total human legs} = 2 \text{ (Javier)} + 2 \text{ (wife)} + 3 \times 2 \text{ (children)} = 2 + 2 + 6 = 10
   \]

2. **Count the number of animal legs:**
   - Each dog has 4 legs, and there are 2 dogs.
   - The cat also has 4 legs.

   Let's calculate the total number of animal legs:
   \[
   \text{Total animal legs} = 2 \times 4 \text{ (dogs)} + 4 \text{ (cat)} = 8 + 4 = 12
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of legs in the household:**
   - Add the total number of human legs and animal legs together:
   \[
   \text{Total legs in household} = \text{Total human legs} + \text{Total animal legs} = 10 + 12 = 22
   \]

Therefore, the total number of legs in Javier's household is \(\boxed{22}\).
