==================================================

To determine how much more money Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy.**
   - Cost of the skipping rope: $6
   - Cost of the board game: $11
   - Cost of the playground ball: $2

   We will add these amounts together:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6 + 11 + 2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 19
   \]

   So, the total cost of all the items is $19.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Dora has.**
   - Money saved from allowance: $2
   - Money given by her mother: $16

   We will add these amounts together:
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 2 + 16
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 18
   \]

   So, Dora has a total of $18.

3. **Determine how much more money Dora needs.**
   To find out how much more money Dora needs, we will subtract the total amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:
   \[
   \text{Additional money needed} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total money}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Additional money needed} = 19 - 18
   \]
   \[
   \text{Additional money needed} = 1
   \]

Thus, Dora needs **$1** more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

**Final Answer: $1**
