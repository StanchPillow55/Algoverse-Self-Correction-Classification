==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I'll need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 391." Since the question details are not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by breaking down the steps and showing all calculations and reasoning. If you have a specific question in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to assist you with that.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**  
A car travels from Town A to Town B at a speed of 60 km/h and returns from Town B to Town A at a speed of 40 km/h. If the total travel time is 5 hours, what is the distance between Town A and Town B?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between Town A and Town B in kilometers.

2. **Set Up Equations for Each Leg of the Trip:**
   - Time taken to travel from Town A to Town B: \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - Time taken to travel from Town B to Town A: \( \frac{d}{40} \) hours.

3. **Total Travel Time:**
   - According to the problem, the total travel time is 5 hours.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:  
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = 5
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To solve for \( d \), find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 60 and 40 is 120.
   - Rewrite the equation with the common denominator:  
     \[
     \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:  
     \[
     \frac{5d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 120 to eliminate the fraction:  
     \[
     5d = 600
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( d \):  
     \[
     d = 120
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between Town A and Town B is 120 kilometers.

**Final Answer:**  
The distance between Town A and Town B is 120 km.
