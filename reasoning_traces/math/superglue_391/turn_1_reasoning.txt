==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand the context and details of the question. However, the question provided, "Sample reasoning question 391," lacks specific details or numerical data to work with. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by outlining the steps and reasoning involved.

### Step-by-Step Approach to Solving a Math Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram
     - Creating an equation
     - Using logical reasoning
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of the calculation.
   - Ensure the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Double-check the final answer.

### Example Problem

Let's apply this approach to a hypothetical math problem:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
- We know the perimeter is 36 units.
- The length is twice the width.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2L + 2W \).
- Let \( W \) be the width. Then the length \( L = 2W \).
- Substitute into the perimeter formula: \( 2(2W) + 2W = 36 \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Simplify the equation: \( 4W + 2W = 36 \).
- Combine like terms: \( 6W = 36 \).
- Solve for \( W \): \( W = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \).
- Find the length: \( L = 2W = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

**Step 4: Check Your Work**
- Verify the dimensions satisfy the perimeter: \( 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36 \).
- The calculations are consistent with the given perimeter.

**Final Answer:**
The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.

By following these steps, you can systematically approach and solve math problems effectively. If you have a specific problem or more details, feel free to provide them, and I can assist you further.
