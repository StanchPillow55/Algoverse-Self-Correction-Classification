==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 391" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. The production cost for Type A is $30 per widget, and for Type B, it's $40 per widget. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and made a profit of $15,000. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Total widgets sold: \( x + y = 500 \)
   - Profit equation: Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. The revenue from Type A is \( 50x \) and from Type B is \( 70y \). The cost for Type A is \( 30x \) and for Type B is \( 40y \). Therefore, the profit equation is:
     \[
     (50x + 70y) - (30x + 40y) = 15,000
     \]
   - Simplifying the profit equation:
     \[
     20x + 30y = 15,000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 500 \\
     20x + 30y &= 15,000
     \end{align*}
     \]
   - Solve the first equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - x
     \]
   - Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into the second equation:
     \[
     20x + 30(500 - x) = 15,000
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     20x + 15,000 - 30x = 15,000
     \]
     \[
     -10x + 15,000 = 15,000
     \]
     \[
     -10x = 0
     \]
     \[
     x = 0
     \]
   - Substitute \( x = 0 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - 0 = 500
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - If \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 500 \), then:
     - Total widgets sold: \( 0 + 500 = 500 \) (satisfied)
     - Profit calculation: Revenue = \( 50(0) + 70(500) = 35,000 \)
     - Cost = \( 30(0) + 40(500) = 20,000 \)
     - Profit = Revenue - Cost = \( 35,000 - 20,000 = 15,000 \) (satisfied)

**Final Answer:**

The company sold 0 Type A widgets and 500 Type B widgets.
