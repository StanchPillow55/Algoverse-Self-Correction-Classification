==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 391" refers to. Since I don't have the specific details of this question, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by showing all steps and reasoning. Let's assume a typical math problem involving algebra:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to remove the constant:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This is a complete solution to a typical algebra problem. If you have a specific problem or context for "Sample reasoning question 391," please provide more details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
