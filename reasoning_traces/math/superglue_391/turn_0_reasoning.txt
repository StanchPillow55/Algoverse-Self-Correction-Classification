To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 391." Since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by outlining a step-by-step process. If you have a specific problem, please provide the details, and I can work through that.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of a rectangle.
   - We know that the length is twice the width.
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is given as 36 units.

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( l \) is \( 2w \) (since the length is twice the width).

3. **Use the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - Substitute the known perimeter and the expression for the length:
     \[
     36 = 2(2w) + 2w
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     36 = 4w + 2w
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length \( l \) is twice the width:
     \[
     l = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the rectangle are:
     - Width = 6 units
     - Length = 12 units
