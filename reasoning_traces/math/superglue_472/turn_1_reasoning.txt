==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 472" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume that this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field and also divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 120 meters (length) and 80 meters (width).
   - We need to calculate the total length of the fence required to enclose the field and divide it into two equal parts.

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substitute the given values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (120 + 80) = 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Divide the Field into Two Equal Parts:**
   - The field is divided into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).
   - This means we need an additional fence along the length of the field.
   - The length of this additional fence is equal to the length of the field, which is 120 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence:**
   - The total length of the fence required is the perimeter of the field plus the additional fence to divide the field:
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} = \text{Perimeter} + \text{Additional Fence}
     \]
   - Substitute the calculated values:
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} = 400 + 120 = 520 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total length of the fence required is 520 meters.

By following these steps, we have calculated the total length of the fence needed to enclose the field and divide it into two equal parts. The final answer is 520 meters.
