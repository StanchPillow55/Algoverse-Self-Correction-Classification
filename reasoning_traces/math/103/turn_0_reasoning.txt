==================================================

To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can break the problem down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Coverage Rate**: The fog bank covers 3 miles of the city every 10 minutes. This means that for every 10 minutes, the fog advances 3 miles inland.

2. **Calculating the Total Distance**: The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge. This is the total distance that the fog needs to cover.

3. **Finding the Number of 3-Mile Segments**: To find out how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles, we can divide the total distance by the distance covered in each segment:
   \[
   \text{Number of segments} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments}
   \]

4. **Calculating the Total Time**: Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, we can find the total time by multiplying the number of segments by the time taken for each segment:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: Therefore, it will take a total of 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{140 \text{ minutes}}
\]
