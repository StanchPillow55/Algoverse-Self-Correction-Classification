==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sentences Janice started with today. We will calculate the total number of sentences she typed today and then use the final count to find the starting number.

1. **Calculate the number of sentences typed in each session:**

   - **First session:** Janice types 6 sentences per minute. She typed for 20 minutes.
     \[
     \text{Sentences typed in first session} = 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ sentences}
     \]

   - **Second session:** After a break, she typed for 15 minutes longer than the first session. So, she typed for \(20 + 15 = 35\) minutes.
     \[
     \text{Sentences typed in second session} = 6 \times 35 = 210 \text{ sentences}
     \]

   - **Erasing sentences:** She erased 40 sentences.
     \[
     \text{Net sentences after erasing} = 120 + 210 - 40 = 290 \text{ sentences}
     \]

   - **Third session:** After a meeting, she typed for 18 more minutes.
     \[
     \text{Sentences typed in third session} = 6 \times 18 = 108 \text{ sentences}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of sentences typed today:**

   Add up all the sentences typed in each session and subtract the erased sentences:
   \[
   \text{Total sentences typed today} = 120 + 210 - 40 + 108 = 398 \text{ sentences}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of sentences she started with today:**

   We know the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. Therefore, the number of sentences she started with today is:
   \[
   \text{Sentences started with} = 536 - 398 = 138 \text{ sentences}
   \]

Thus, Janice started with **138 sentences** today.
