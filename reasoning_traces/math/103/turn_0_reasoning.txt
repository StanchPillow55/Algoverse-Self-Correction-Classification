Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of sentences Janice typed during each session and then determining how many sentences she started with today.

1. **Calculate the number of sentences typed in the first session (20 minutes)**:
   - Janice types 6 sentences per minute.
   - In 20 minutes, she types:
     \[
     6 \text{ sentences/minute} \times 20 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ sentences}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of sentences typed in the second session (15 minutes)**:
   - In 15 minutes, she types:
     \[
     6 \text{ sentences/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ sentences}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total sentences typed before erasing**:
   - Total sentences typed before erasing:
     \[
     120 \text{ sentences} + 90 \text{ sentences} = 210 \text{ sentences}
     \]

4. **Subtract the sentences erased (40 sentences)**:
   - After erasing 40 sentences, the total becomes:
     \[
     210 \text{ sentences} - 40 \text{ sentences} = 170 \text{ sentences}
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of sentences typed in the third session (18 minutes)**:
   - In 18 minutes, she types:
     \[
     6 \text{ sentences/minute} \times 18 \text{ minutes} = 108 \text{ sentences}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total sentences after the third session**:
   - Total sentences after the third session:
     \[
     170 \text{ sentences} + 108 \text{ sentences} = 278 \text{ sentences}
     \]

7. **Determine the total number of sentences by the end of today**:
   - We know from the problem statement that the total number of sentences by the end of today is 536 sentences.

8. **Calculate the number of sentences Janice started with today**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of sentences Janice started with today. The total number of sentences after all typing and erasing is given by:
     \[
     x + 278 = 536
     \]
   - To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
     \[
     x = 536 - 278
     \]
     \[
     x = 258
     \]

Thus, the number of sentences Janice started with today is \( \boxed{258} \).
