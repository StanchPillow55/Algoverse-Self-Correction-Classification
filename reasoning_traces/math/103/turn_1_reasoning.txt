Question ID: 103
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sentences Janice started with today. We'll do this by calculating the total number of sentences she typed today and then using the final count to find the starting number.

1. **Calculate the number of sentences typed in each session:**

   - **First session:** Janice typed for 20 minutes. Since she types 6 sentences per minute, the number of sentences typed in this session is:
     \[
     20 \text{ minutes} \times 6 \text{ sentences/minute} = 120 \text{ sentences}
     \]

   - **Second session:** After a break, Janice typed for 15 minutes longer than the first session. Therefore, she typed for:
     \[
     20 \text{ minutes} + 15 \text{ minutes} = 35 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     The number of sentences typed in this session is:
     \[
     35 \text{ minutes} \times 6 \text{ sentences/minute} = 210 \text{ sentences}
     \]

   - **Third session:** After a meeting, Janice typed for 18 more minutes. The number of sentences typed in this session is:
     \[
     18 \text{ minutes} \times 6 \text{ sentences/minute} = 108 \text{ sentences}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of sentences typed today:**

   Add up the sentences from all typing sessions:
   \[
   120 \text{ sentences} + 210 \text{ sentences} + 108 \text{ sentences} = 438 \text{ sentences}
   \]

3. **Account for the sentences erased:**

   Janice erased 40 sentences, so the net number of sentences added today is:
   \[
   438 \text{ sentences} - 40 \text{ sentences} = 398 \text{ sentences}
   \]

4. **Determine the starting number of sentences:**

   By the end of today, the paper had 536 sentences. To find how many sentences Janice started with today, subtract the net number of sentences added today from the final count:
   \[
   536 \text{ sentences} - 398 \text{ sentences} = 138 \text{ sentences}
   \]

Therefore, Janice started with 138 sentences today.

**Final Answer:**
Janice started with 138 sentences today.
