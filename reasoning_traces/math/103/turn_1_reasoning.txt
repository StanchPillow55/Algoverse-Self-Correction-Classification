Question ID: 103
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sentences Janice started with today. We will calculate the number of sentences she typed today and then use the total number of sentences at the end of the day to find out how many she started with.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sentences typed in each session.**

1. **First typing session:**
   - Janice types for 20 minutes.
   - Typing speed = 6 sentences per minute.
   - Sentences typed = 20 minutes × 6 sentences/minute = 120 sentences.

2. **Second typing session:**
   - Janice types for 15 minutes longer than the first session.
   - Duration = 20 minutes + 15 minutes = 35 minutes.
   - Sentences typed = 35 minutes × 6 sentences/minute = 210 sentences.

3. **Third typing session (after the meeting):**
   - Janice types for 18 minutes.
   - Sentences typed = 18 minutes × 6 sentences/minute = 108 sentences.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of sentences typed today.**

- Total sentences typed = Sentences from first session + Sentences from second session + Sentences from third session
- Total sentences typed = 120 + 210 + 108 = 438 sentences.

**Step 3: Account for the sentences erased.**

- Janice erased 40 sentences.
- Net sentences added today = Total sentences typed - Sentences erased
- Net sentences added = 438 - 40 = 398 sentences.

**Step 4: Determine the number of sentences Janice started with today.**

- Let \( x \) be the number of sentences Janice started with today.
- By the end of the day, the paper had 536 sentences.
- Therefore, \( x + \text{Net sentences added} = 536 \).
- \( x + 398 = 536 \).

**Step 5: Solve for \( x \).**

- Subtract 398 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = 536 - 398 = 138
  \]

**Final Answer:**

Janice started with 138 sentences today.
