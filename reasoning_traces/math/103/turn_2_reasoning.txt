Question ID: 103
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sentences Janice started with today. We will calculate the number of sentences she typed today and then use the total number of sentences at the end of the day to find the starting number.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate Sentences Typed in Each Session:**
   - **First Session:** Janice typed for 20 minutes. At a rate of 6 sentences per minute, she typed:
     \[
     20 \text{ minutes} \times 6 \text{ sentences/minute} = 120 \text{ sentences}
     \]

   - **Second Session:** After a break, she typed for 15 minutes longer than the first session, which means she typed for:
     \[
     20 \text{ minutes} + 15 \text{ minutes} = 35 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     At the same rate, she typed:
     \[
     35 \text{ minutes} \times 6 \text{ sentences/minute} = 210 \text{ sentences}
     \]

   - **Third Session:** After a meeting, she typed for 18 more minutes. At the same rate, she typed:
     \[
     18 \text{ minutes} \times 6 \text{ sentences/minute} = 108 \text{ sentences}
     \]

2. **Total Sentences Typed Today:**
   Add up all the sentences she typed in each session:
   \[
   120 \text{ sentences} + 210 \text{ sentences} + 108 \text{ sentences} = 438 \text{ sentences}
   \]

3. **Adjust for Erased Sentences:**
   Janice erased 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. Therefore, the net number of sentences she added today is:
   \[
   438 \text{ sentences} - 40 \text{ sentences} = 398 \text{ sentences}
   \]

4. **Determine Starting Number of Sentences:**
   By the end of today, the paper had 536 sentences. To find out how many sentences she started with today, subtract the net number of sentences added today from the total at the end:
   \[
   536 \text{ sentences} - 398 \text{ sentences} = 138 \text{ sentences}
   \]

### Final Answer:
Janice started with 138 sentences today.
