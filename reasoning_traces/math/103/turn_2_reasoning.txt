Question ID: 103
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sentences Janice started with today. We will calculate the number of sentences she typed today and then use the total number of sentences at the end of the day to find the starting number.

1. **Calculate the number of sentences typed in each session:**

   - **First session:** Janice types for 20 minutes.
     \[
     \text{Sentences typed in first session} = 6 \, \text{sentences/minute} \times 20 \, \text{minutes} = 120 \, \text{sentences}
     \]

   - **Second session:** Janice types for 15 minutes longer than the first session.
     \[
     \text{Duration of second session} = 20 \, \text{minutes} + 15 \, \text{minutes} = 35 \, \text{minutes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Sentences typed in second session} = 6 \, \text{sentences/minute} \times 35 \, \text{minutes} = 210 \, \text{sentences}
     \]

   - **Third session:** After the meeting, Janice types for 18 more minutes.
     \[
     \text{Sentences typed in third session} = 6 \, \text{sentences/minute} \times 18 \, \text{minutes} = 108 \, \text{sentences}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of sentences typed today:**

   \[
   \text{Total sentences typed today} = 120 + 210 + 108 = 438 \, \text{sentences}
   \]

3. **Account for the erased sentences:**

   Janice erased 40 sentences that she had typed incorrectly. Therefore, the net number of sentences added today is:
   \[
   \text{Net sentences added today} = 438 - 40 = 398 \, \text{sentences}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of sentences Janice started with today:**

   By the end of today, the paper had 536 sentences. Let \( x \) be the number of sentences Janice started with today. Then:
   \[
   x + 398 = 536
   \]

   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 536 - 398 = 138
   \]

Therefore, Janice started with **138 sentences** today.
