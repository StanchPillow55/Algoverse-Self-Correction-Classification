==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 311" refers to. Since the problem isn't specified in your request, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 311" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 311:**

A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know \( P = 48 \) and \( L = 3W \).
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     48 = 2(3W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression on the right side:
     \[
     48 = 6W + 2W
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     48 = 8W
     \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

6. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 3W \) to find L:
     \[
     L = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that the perimeter is indeed 48 units with these dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculations are correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 18 units
