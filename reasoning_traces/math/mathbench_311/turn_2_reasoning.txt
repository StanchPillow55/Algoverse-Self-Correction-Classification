Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 311" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem format and solve it step-by-step. Let's assume a typical algebra problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   11 = 11
   \]
   The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that our solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
