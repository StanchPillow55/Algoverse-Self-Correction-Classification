==================================================

To find the distance that the fox can run in 120 minutes at a constant speed of 50 kilometers per hour, we can use the formula for distance:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

### Step 1: Convert Time from Minutes to Hours
Since the speed is given in kilometers per hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

120 minutes can be converted to hours as follows:

\[
\text{Time in hours} = \frac{\text{Time in minutes}}{60}
\]

Substituting the given time:

\[
\text{Time in hours} = \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Distance
Now that we have the time in hours, we can calculate the distance using the speed of the fox.

Given:
- Speed = 50 kilometers per hour
- Time = 2 hours

Now we can substitute these values into the distance formula:

\[
\text{Distance} = 50 \text{ km/h} \times 2 \text{ h}
\]

Calculating the distance:

\[
\text{Distance} = 100 \text{ kilometers}
\]

### Final Answer
The distance that the fox would run in 120 minutes is:

\[
\boxed{100 \text{ kilometers}}
\]
