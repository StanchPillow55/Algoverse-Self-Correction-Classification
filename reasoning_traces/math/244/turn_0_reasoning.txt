==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance a fox would cover if it runs at a constant speed of 50 kilometers per hour for a duration of 120 minutes.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - The speed of the fox is 50 kilometers per hour.
   - The time duration is 120 minutes.

2. **Convert Time from Minutes to Hours:**
   - Since the speed is given in kilometers per hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours to use the speed directly.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, to convert 120 minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time in hours} = \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Distance:**
   - The formula to calculate distance when speed and time are known is:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Substitute the known values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 50 \text{ kilometers per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 100 \text{ kilometers}
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The fox would cover a distance of 100 kilometers in 120 minutes if it runs at a constant speed of 50 kilometers per hour.

### Final Answer:
The fox would cover a distance of 100 kilometers in 120 minutes.
