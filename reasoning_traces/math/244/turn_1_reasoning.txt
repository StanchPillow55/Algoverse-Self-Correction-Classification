Question ID: 244
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance a fox would cover if it runs at a constant speed of 50 kilometers per hour for a duration of 120 minutes. Here's how we can approach the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Units

The speed of the fox is given in kilometers per hour (km/h), and the time is given in minutes. To solve the problem, we need to ensure that the units are compatible. Since the speed is in hours, we should convert the time from minutes to hours.

### Step 2: Convert Time from Minutes to Hours

There are 60 minutes in one hour. Therefore, to convert 120 minutes into hours, we use the following conversion:

\[
\text{Time in hours} = \frac{\text{Time in minutes}}{60} = \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Distance

The formula to calculate distance when speed and time are known is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

Given:
- Speed = 50 km/h
- Time = 2 hours

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Distance} = 50 \text{ km/h} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 100 \text{ kilometers}
\]

### Step 4: Conclusion

The fox would cover a distance of 100 kilometers if it runs at a constant speed of 50 kilometers per hour for 120 minutes.

**Final Answer: 100 kilometers**
