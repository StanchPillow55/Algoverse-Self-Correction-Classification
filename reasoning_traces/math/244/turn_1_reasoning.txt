Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance a fox would cover if it runs at a constant speed of 50 kilometers per hour for a duration of 120 minutes. 

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Units**: 
   - The speed of the fox is given in kilometers per hour (km/h).
   - The time duration is given in minutes.

2. **Convert Time to Hours**:
   - Since the speed is in kilometers per hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours to ensure the units are consistent.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, to convert 120 minutes to hours:
     \[
     \text{Time in hours} = \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Distance**:
   - The formula to calculate distance when speed and time are known is:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Here, the speed is 50 km/h and the time is 2 hours. Plug these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 50 \text{ km/h} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 100 \text{ kilometers}
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The fox would cover a distance of 100 kilometers if it runs at a constant speed of 50 kilometers per hour for 120 minutes.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ 
\boxed{100 \text{ kilometers}} 
\]
