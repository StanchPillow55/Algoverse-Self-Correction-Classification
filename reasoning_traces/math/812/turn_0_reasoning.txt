To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase after Rose picks them and loses some, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower before any are lost.**
2. **Determine how many flowers are lost due to dropping and the wind.**
3. **Calculate the total number of petals remaining after the losses.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower

- **First type of flower:** 
  - Number of flowers = 3
  - Petals per flower = 5
  - Total petals = \(3 \times 5 = 15\)

- **Second type of flower:** 
  - Number of flowers = 4
  - Petals per flower = 6
  - Total petals = \(4 \times 6 = 24\)

- **Third type of flower:** 
  - Number of flowers = 5
  - Petals per flower = 4
  - Total petals = \(5 \times 4 = 20\)

- **Fourth type of flower:** 
  - Number of flowers = 6
  - Petals per flower = 7
  - Total petals = \(6 \times 7 = 42\)

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of petals before any losses

Now, we will sum the total petals from all types of flowers:

\[
\text{Total petals} = 15 + 24 + 20 + 42
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

\[
15 + 24 = 39
\]
\[
39 + 20 = 59
\]
\[
59 + 42 = 101
\]

So, the total number of petals before any losses is **101 petals**.

### Step 3: Determine how many flowers are lost

Rose drops 1 flower of each type and the wind blows them away. Since she has 4 types of flowers, she loses:

- 1 flower from the first type
- 1 flower from the second type
- 1 flower from the third type
- 1 flower from the fourth type

This means she loses a total of 4 flowers.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of petals lost

Now we will calculate the number of petals lost for each type of flower:

- **First type:** 1 flower with 5 petals = 5 petals lost
- **Second type:** 1 flower with 6 petals = 6 petals lost
- **Third type:** 1 flower with 4 petals = 4 petals lost
- **Fourth type:** 1 flower with 7 petals = 7 petals lost

Now, we sum the petals lost:

\[
\text{Total petals lost} = 5 + 6 + 4 + 7
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

\[
5 + 6 = 11
\]
\[
11 + 4 = 15
\]
\[
15 + 7 = 22
\]

So, the total number of petals lost is **22 petals**.

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of petals remaining in the vase

Now we subtract the total petals lost from the total petals before losses:

\[
\text{Total petals remaining} = 101 - 22
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
101 - 22 = 79
\]

### Final Answer

The total number of petals in the vase is **79 petals**.
