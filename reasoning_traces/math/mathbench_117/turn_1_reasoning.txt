==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 117," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 117" is not specific and does not provide any details about the actual mathematical question or context. Therefore, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating an example problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 117" is a typical algebra problem. Here's an example problem we can solve:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To remove the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
