Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 117," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 117" is not specific enough to provide any details or context about the problem itself. Therefore, I will assume that "Sample math problem 117" is a placeholder for a specific math problem that you intended to provide.

Since I don't have the details of the actual problem, I will demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem by creating an example problem. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) by itself.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample math problem 117," please provide the details of the problem, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
