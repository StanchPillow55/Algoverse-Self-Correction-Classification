Question ID: mathbench_117
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 117" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 117" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 117:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even numbers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   - The sequence of the first 20 positive even numbers is: 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 40.

2. **Recognize the Pattern:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Last Term:**
   - The last term \( a_n \) of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Here, \( n = 20 \), so:
     \[
     a_{20} = 2 + (20-1) \cdot 2 = 2 + 38 = 40
     \]

4. **Use the Sum Formula for an Arithmetic Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{20} = \frac{20}{2} \cdot (2 + 40) = 10 \cdot 42 = 420
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of the first 20 positive even numbers is 420.

Thus, the complete solution to the hypothetical "Sample math problem 117" is that the sum of the first 20 positive even numbers is \( \boxed{420} \).
