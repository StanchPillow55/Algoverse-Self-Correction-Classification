5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.
   - Ensure the answer addresses the question posed.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's apply this approach to a simple example problem:

**Example Problem:**
A car travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. How far does it travel in 3 hours?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the distance traveled by the car.
   - We know the speed is 60 miles per hour and the time is 3 hours.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for distance: \(\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}\).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the given values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - The units of speed (miles/hour) and time (hours) are consistent, resulting in a distance in miles.
   - The calculation is straightforward and correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The car travels 180 miles in 3 hours.
