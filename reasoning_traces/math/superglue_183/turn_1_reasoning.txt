==================================================

To solve this problem, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 183" might entail. Since no specific details are provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the dimensions (length and width) of a rectangle.
   - The length (L) is 3 times the width (W).
   - The perimeter (P) of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \( P = 2L + 2W \).
   - Given \( L = 3W \) and \( P = 48 \), we can substitute these into the perimeter formula.

3. **Substitute and Simplify:**
   \[
   48 = 2(3W) + 2W
   \]
   \[
   48 = 6W + 2W
   \]
   \[
   48 = 8W
   \]

4. **Solve for W (Width):**
   \[
   W = \frac{48}{8}
   \]
   \[
   W = 6
   \]

5. **Find L (Length):**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute \( W = 6 \) into the equation for L:
   \[
   L = 3 \times 6
   \]
   \[
   L = 18
   \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the calculated dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
   \[
   P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
   \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 18 units
