It seems like you've referenced a "Sample reasoning question 317," but without specific details or context, I can't directly address that particular question. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving a math problem by demonstrating a step-by-step process. Let's consider a sample math problem and work through it:

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by building a fence parallel to one of the sides. What will be the length of the fence?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters.
   - The field needs to be divided into two equal parts with a fence parallel to one of the sides.

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - Draw a rectangle to represent the field.
   - The rectangle has two pairs of parallel sides: two sides of 100 meters and two sides of 60 meters.

3. **Determine How to Divide the Field:**
   - To divide the field into two equal areas, we can place the fence parallel to either the longer side (100 meters) or the shorter side (60 meters).

4. **Calculate the Area of the Field:**
   - The area of the field is given by the formula for the area of a rectangle: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 100 \, \text{m} \times 60 \, \text{m} = 6000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

5. **Divide the Field into Two Equal Areas:**
   - Each part should have an area of:
     \[
     \frac{6000 \, \text{m}^2}{2} = 3000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

6. **Determine the Length of the Fence:**
   - If the fence is parallel to the 100-meter side, it will divide the 60-meter side into two equal parts.
   - The length of the fence will be equal to the length of the side it is parallel to, which is 100 meters.

7. **Verify the Division:**
   - Each resulting section will have dimensions of 100 meters by 30 meters (since 60 meters divided by 2 is 30 meters).
   - The area of each section is:
     \[
     100 \, \text{m} \times 30 \, \text{m} = 3000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]
   - This confirms that the field is divided into two equal areas.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The length of the fence required to divide the field into two equal parts is 100 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The length of the fence is 100 meters.
