==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what is being asked. Unfortunately, the question "Sample reasoning question 317" does not provide specific details or context. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Since no specific problem is given, I will create a sample math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - Base (\( b \)) = 10 units
   - Height (\( h \)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   First, multiply the base and the height:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50
   \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   Now, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

This process demonstrates how to solve a basic geometry problem involving the calculation of the area of a triangle. If you have a specific problem or need assistance with a different type of math question, please provide more details, and I will be happy to help!
