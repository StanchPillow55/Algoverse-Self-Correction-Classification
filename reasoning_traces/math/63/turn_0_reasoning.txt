==================================================

To determine how many situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday to meet her goal, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify Shawna's goal**: Shawna's workout goal is to complete a total of 30 situps.

2. **Calculate situps done on Monday**: On Monday, Shawna completed 12 situps.

3. **Calculate situps done on Tuesday**: On Tuesday, Shawna completed 19 situps.

4. **Calculate total situps completed by Tuesday**: 
   \[
   \text{Total situps by Tuesday} = \text{Situps on Monday} + \text{Situps on Tuesday} = 12 + 19 = 31
   \]

5. **Determine if Shawna met her goal**: Since Shawna's goal is 30 situps and she completed 31 situps by Tuesday, she has already met her goal.

6. **Calculate how many situps she needs on Wednesday**: Since she has already met her goal, she does not need to do any additional situps on Wednesday to meet the minimum goal. However, if we consider making up for any missed situps, we can analyze that as well:
   - Shawna's goal was 30 situps.
   - She completed 31 situps, which means she has exceeded her goal by 1 situp.

7. **Final calculation for Wednesday**: Since she has already exceeded her goal, the number of situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal is:
   \[
   \text{Situps needed on Wednesday} = 0
   \]

Thus, Shawna does not need to do any situps on Wednesday to meet her goal.

**Final Answer**: Shawna needs to do **0 situps** on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal.
