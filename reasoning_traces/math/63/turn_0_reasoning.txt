==================================================

Shawna's workout goal is 30 situps. On Monday, she did 12 situps, and on Tuesday, she did 19 situps.

To find out how many situps Shawna has done so far, we add the number of situps she did on Monday and Tuesday:

12 situps (Monday) + 19 situps (Tuesday) = 31 situps

So, Shawna has done 31 situps so far.

However, Shawna's goal is to do 30 situps each day. So, she has to do 30 situps on Monday, 30 situps on Tuesday, and 30 situps on Wednesday. That's a total of:

30 situps (Monday) + 30 situps (Tuesday) + 30 situps (Wednesday) = 90 situps

So, Shawna's total goal for the three days is 90 situps.

To find out how many situps Shawna has to do on Wednesday to meet her goal, we subtract the number of situps she has done so far from her total goal:

90 situps (total goal) - 31 situps (done so far) = 59 situps

Therefore, Shawna has to do 59 situps on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal and make up for the ones she didn't do.
