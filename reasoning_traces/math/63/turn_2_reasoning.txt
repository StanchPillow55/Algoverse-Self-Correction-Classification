==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday to meet her workout goal of 30 situps, given her performance on Monday and Tuesday.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Shawna's Goal:**
   - Shawna's workout goal is to complete 30 situps.

2. **Calculate Situps Completed on Monday:**
   - On Monday, Shawna completed 12 situps.

3. **Calculate Situps Completed on Tuesday:**
   - On Tuesday, Shawna completed 19 situps.

4. **Calculate Total Situps Completed by Tuesday:**
   - To find out how many situps Shawna has completed by the end of Tuesday, we add the situps from Monday and Tuesday:
   \[
   \text{Total situps by Tuesday} = 12 \text{ (Monday)} + 19 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 31
   \]

5. **Compare Total Situps to Goal:**
   - Shawna's goal is 30 situps, but she has already completed 31 situps by Tuesday.

6. **Determine Additional Situps Needed on Wednesday:**
   - Since Shawna has already exceeded her goal by 1 situp (31 situps completed vs. 30 situps goal), she does not need to do any additional situps on Wednesday to meet her goal. In fact, she has already surpassed her goal.

Therefore, Shawna does not need to do any situps on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal. She has already achieved her goal by completing 31 situps by the end of Tuesday.

**Final Answer:**
Shawna needs to do 0 situps on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal.
