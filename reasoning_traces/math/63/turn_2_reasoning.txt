Question ID: 63
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday to reach her goal of 30 situps, taking into account how many she has already completed on Monday and Tuesday.

1. **Identify the goal**: Shawna's workout goal is 30 situps.

2. **Calculate situps completed on Monday**: Shawna did 12 situps on Monday.

3. **Calculate situps completed on Tuesday**: Shawna did 19 situps on Tuesday.

4. **Total situps completed by the end of Tuesday**: 
   \[
   \text{Total situps} = \text{Situps on Monday} + \text{Situps on Tuesday} = 12 + 19 = 31
   \]

5. **Determine if she met her goal**: Since Shawna's goal is 30 situps and she completed 31 situps by the end of Tuesday, she has already met her goal.

6. **Calculate how many situps she needs to do on Wednesday**: Since she has already exceeded her goal, the number of situps she needs to do on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal is:
   \[
   \text{Situps needed on Wednesday} = 0
   \]

Thus, Shawna does not need to do any additional situps on Wednesday to meet her goal.

**Final Answer**: Shawna needs to do 0 situps on Wednesday.
