==================================================

To determine how many situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday to meet her goal of 30 situps, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify Shawna's Goal**: Shawna's workout goal is to complete 30 situps.

2. **Calculate Situps Done on Monday**: On Monday, Shawna completed 12 situps.

3. **Calculate Situps Done on Tuesday**: On Tuesday, Shawna completed 19 situps.

4. **Calculate Total Situps Completed**: We need to find out how many situps Shawna has completed over the two days:
   \[
   \text{Total situps completed} = \text{Situps on Monday} + \text{Situps on Tuesday}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total situps completed} = 12 + 19 = 31
   \]

5. **Determine if Shawna Met Her Goal**: Since Shawna's goal is 30 situps and she completed 31 situps over the two days, she has already met her goal. 

6. **Calculate Situps Needed on Wednesday**: Since she has already exceeded her goal, she does not need to do any additional situps on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal. However, if we consider making up for any shortfall, we can calculate how many situps she would need if she had not met her goal.

   - If she had only done 30 situps, she would need:
   \[
   \text{Situps needed on Wednesday} = 30 - 31 = -1
   \]
   This negative value indicates that she does not need to do any situps on Wednesday to meet her goal.

7. **Conclusion**: Since Shawna has already completed more than her goal of 30 situps, she does not need to do any situps on Wednesday.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Shawna needs to do } 0 \text{ situps on Wednesday.}
\]
