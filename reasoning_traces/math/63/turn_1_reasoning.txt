==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday to meet her workout goal of 30 situps, considering what she has already done on Monday and Tuesday.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Shawna's Goal:**
   - Shawna's workout goal is to complete 30 situps.

2. **Calculate Situps Completed on Monday:**
   - On Monday, Shawna completed 12 situps.

3. **Calculate Situps Completed on Tuesday:**
   - On Tuesday, Shawna completed 19 situps.

4. **Calculate Total Situps Completed by Tuesday:**
   - To find out how many situps Shawna has completed by the end of Tuesday, we add the situps from Monday and Tuesday:
   \[
   \text{Total situps by Tuesday} = \text{Situps on Monday} + \text{Situps on Tuesday} = 12 + 19 = 31
   \]

5. **Determine if Shawna Met Her Goal:**
   - Shawna's goal was to complete 30 situps. By Tuesday, she has already completed 31 situps.

6. **Calculate Additional Situps Needed:**
   - Since Shawna has already completed 31 situps, which is 1 situp more than her goal of 30, she does not need to do any additional situps on Wednesday to meet her goal. In fact, she has exceeded her goal by 1 situp.

Therefore, Shawna does not need to do any situps on Wednesday to meet her goal. She has already surpassed her goal by 1 situp.

**Final Answer:**
Shawna would need to do 0 situps on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal, as she has already exceeded her goal by 1 situp.
