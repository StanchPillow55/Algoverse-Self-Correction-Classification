==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 381" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a typical math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of products: A and B. The production cost for product A is $50 per unit, and for product B, it is $70 per unit. The company sells product A for $80 per unit and product B for $100 per unit. The company has a production budget of $10,000 and wants to maximize its profit. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit, assuming all produced units are sold?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Set Up the Cost Equation:**
   - The total production cost is given by:
     \[
     50x + 70y \leq 10,000
     \]
   - This inequality represents the budget constraint.

3. **Set Up the Profit Equation:**
   - The profit from selling product A is \( 80x - 50x = 30x \).
   - The profit from selling product B is \( 100y - 70y = 30y \).
   - Therefore, the total profit \( P \) is:
     \[
     P = 30x + 30y
     \]

4. **Objective:**
   - Maximize \( P = 30x + 30y \) subject to the constraint \( 50x + 70y \leq 10,000 \).

5. **Simplify the Problem:**
   - Since the profit per unit for both products is the same, the company should focus on maximizing the number of units produced within the budget.
   - Simplify the budget constraint:
     \[
     50x + 70y \leq 10,000
     \]
   - Divide the entire inequality by 10:
     \[
     5x + 7y \leq 1,000
     \]

6. **Find the Intercepts:**
   - If \( x = 0 \), then \( 7y = 1,000 \) gives \( y = \frac{1,000}{7} \approx 142.86 \).
   - If \( y = 0 \), then \( 5x = 1,000 \) gives \( x = 200 \).

7. **Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible region is bounded by the line \( 5x + 7y = 1,000 \), the x-axis, and the y-axis.

8. **Check Corner Points:**
   - Corner points are (0, 0), (200, 0), and (0, 142.86).
   - Calculate profit at each corner point:
     - At (0, 0): \( P = 30(0) + 30(0) = 0 \).
     - At (200, 0): \( P = 30(200) + 30(0) = 6,000 \).
     - At (0, 142): \( P = 30(0) + 30(142) = 4,260 \).

9. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum profit is achieved at the point (200, 0), which means the company should produce 200 units of product A and 0 units of product B.

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 200 units of product A and 0 units of product B to maximize its profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $6,000.
