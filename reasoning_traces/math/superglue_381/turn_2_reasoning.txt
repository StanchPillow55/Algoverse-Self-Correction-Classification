==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 381" refers to. Since the problem statement is not directly provided, I'll assume that this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. If the company produces 100 units of Type A and 150 units of Type B, what is the total profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Total Revenue:**
   - Revenue from Type A = Selling price per unit of Type A × Number of Type A units
   - Revenue from Type A = $10 × 100 = $1,000

   - Revenue from Type B = Selling price per unit of Type B × Number of Type B units
   - Revenue from Type B = $15 × 150 = $2,250

   - Total Revenue = Revenue from Type A + Revenue from Type B
   - Total Revenue = $1,000 + $2,250 = $3,250

2. **Calculate the Total Cost:**
   - Cost for Type A = Production cost per unit of Type A × Number of Type A units
   - Cost for Type A = $5 × 100 = $500

   - Cost for Type B = Production cost per unit of Type B × Number of Type B units
   - Cost for Type B = $8 × 150 = $1,200

   - Total Cost = Cost for Type A + Cost for Type B
   - Total Cost = $500 + $1,200 = $1,700

3. **Calculate the Total Profit:**
   - Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
   - Profit = $3,250 - $1,700 = $1,550

**Final Answer:**
The total profit for the company is $1,550.

This solution demonstrates a clear step-by-step approach to solving a hypothetical math problem involving cost, revenue, and profit calculations. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details, and I can help solve that particular problem.
