To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 381" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem and create a sample problem to solve. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces 381 widgets per day. Each widget sells for $15. The cost to produce each widget is $9. Calculate the company's profit for one day.

**Solution:**

To find the company's profit for one day, we need to calculate the total revenue, the total cost, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate Total Revenue**

The total revenue is the amount of money the company earns from selling the widgets. It is calculated by multiplying the number of widgets sold by the selling price per widget.

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Widgets} \times \text{Selling Price per Widget}
\]

Given:
- Number of Widgets = 381
- Selling Price per Widget = $15

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 381 \times 15
\]

To calculate \(381 \times 15\), we can break it down:

\[
381 \times 15 = 381 \times (10 + 5) = 381 \times 10 + 381 \times 5
\]

Calculate each part:

\[
381 \times 10 = 3810
\]

\[
381 \times 5 = 1905
\]

Add the two results:

\[
3810 + 1905 = 5715
\]

So, the total revenue is $5715.

**Step 2: Calculate Total Cost**

The total cost is the amount of money the company spends to produce the widgets. It is calculated by multiplying the number of widgets produced by the cost to produce each widget.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Widgets} \times \text{Cost per Widget}
\]

Given:
- Number of Widgets = 381
- Cost per Widget = $9

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 381 \times 9
\]

To calculate \(381 \times 9\), we can break it down:

\[
381 \times 9 = 381 \times (10 - 1) = 381 \times 10 - 381 \times 1
\]

Calculate each part:

\[
381 \times 10 = 3810
\]

\[
381 \times 1 = 381
\]

Subtract the two results:

\[
3810 - 381 = 3429
\]

So, the total cost is $3429.

**Step 3: Calculate Profit**

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost.

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
\]

\[
\text{Profit} = 5715 - 3429
\]

Calculate the difference:

\[
5715 - 3429 = 2286
\]

So, the company's profit for one day is $2286.

**Final Answer:**

The company's profit for one day is $2286.
