==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 81." However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by walking through a hypothetical example.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
A train travels from Station A to Station B, a distance of 120 miles, at a constant speed. On the return trip from Station B to Station A, the train travels at a speed that is 20 miles per hour faster and takes 1 hour less than the initial trip. What is the speed of the train from Station A to Station B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the speed of the train from Station A to Station B in miles per hour.
   - The speed of the train from Station B to Station A is \( x + 20 \) miles per hour.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The time taken to travel from Station A to Station B is \( \frac{120}{x} \) hours.
   - The time taken to travel from Station B to Station A is \( \frac{120}{x + 20} \) hours.

3. **Use the Given Information:**
   - The return trip takes 1 hour less than the initial trip:
     \[
     \frac{120}{x} = \frac{120}{x + 20} + 1
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Clear the fractions by multiplying through by \( x(x + 20) \):
     \[
     120(x + 20) = 120x + x(x + 20)
     \]
   - Simplify and expand:
     \[
     120x + 2400 = 120x + x^2 + 20x
     \]
   - Rearrange the equation:
     \[
     x^2 + 20x - 2400 = 0
     \]

5. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 20 \), and \( c = -2400 \):
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{20^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-2400)}}{2 \cdot 1}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{400 + 9600}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{10000}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm 100}{2}
     \]

6. **Calculate the Roots:**
   - \( x = \frac{-20 + 100}{2} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \)
   - \( x = \frac{-20 - 100}{2} = \frac{-120}{2} = -60 \)

7. **Select the Valid Solution:**
   - Since speed cannot be negative, the valid solution is \( x = 40 \).

**Final Answer:**
The speed of the train from Station A to Station B is 40 miles per hour.
