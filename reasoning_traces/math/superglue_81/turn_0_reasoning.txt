==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more context or details about "Sample reasoning question 81." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by solving an example problem step by step.

**Example Problem:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - Base (\(b\)) = 10 units
   - Height (\(h\)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   - Now, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

This is a complete solution to the example problem. If you have a specific problem or question number 81 from a particular source, please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem for you.
