==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 81" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific textbooks, I'll assume this is a hypothetical reasoning problem. I'll create a sample math reasoning problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide this field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 240 square meters. How many such plots can the farmer create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**

   The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width.

   \[
   \text{Area of the field} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 120 \, \text{meters} \times 80 \, \text{meters} = 9600 \, \text{square meters}
   \]

2. **Determine the Area of Each Plot:**

   Each plot is given to have an area of 240 square meters.

3. **Calculate the Number of Plots:**

   To find out how many plots of 240 square meters can fit into the total area of the field, divide the total area of the field by the area of each plot.

   \[
   \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of each plot}} = \frac{9600 \, \text{square meters}}{240 \, \text{square meters}}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of plots} = 40
   \]

4. **Verify the Calculation:**

   To ensure the calculation is correct, multiply the number of plots by the area of each plot to see if it equals the total area of the field.

   \[
   40 \, \text{plots} \times 240 \, \text{square meters/plot} = 9600 \, \text{square meters}
   \]

   The calculation checks out, confirming that the division was performed correctly.

**Final Answer:**

The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 240 square meters, from the rectangular field.
