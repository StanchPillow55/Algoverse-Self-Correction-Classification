==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 253" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I will assume it is a placeholder for a typical math problem. For demonstration purposes, let's assume "Sample math problem 253" is a basic algebra problem. Here's a hypothetical problem and its solution:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. The constant term here is \( 5 \).

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to isolate \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \( 3 \). We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by \( 3 \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
\[ x = 5 \]

This is a complete solution to the assumed problem. If "Sample math problem 253" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context of the problem for an accurate solution.
