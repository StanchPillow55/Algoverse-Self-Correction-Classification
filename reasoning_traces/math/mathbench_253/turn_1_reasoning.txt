==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 253," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 253" is not a specific math problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem based on the number 253 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Find the prime factorization of the number 253."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the prime factors of 253. Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of prime numbers.

2. **Check for Divisibility:**
   - First, check if 253 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 253 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.
   - Next, check divisibility by 3. A quick way to check is to sum the digits of 253: \(2 + 5 + 3 = 10\). Since 10 is not divisible by 3, 253 is not divisible by 3.
   - Check divisibility by 5. Numbers divisible by 5 end in 0 or 5. Since 253 ends in 3, it is not divisible by 5.
   - Check divisibility by 7. To do this, divide 253 by 7: \(253 \div 7 = 36.142857\). Since this is not an integer, 253 is not divisible by 7.
   - Check divisibility by 11. For divisibility by 11, take the alternating sum of the digits: \(2 - 5 + 3 = 0\). Since 0 is divisible by 11, 253 is divisible by 11.

3. **Divide by 11:**
   - Divide 253 by 11: \(253 \div 11 = 23\).
   - So, 253 can be expressed as \(11 \times 23\).

4. **Check if 23 is Prime:**
   - To confirm that 23 is a prime number, check divisibility by all prime numbers less than or equal to \(\sqrt{23}\), which are 2, 3, and 5.
   - 23 is not divisible by 2 (since it's odd), not divisible by 3 (since \(2 + 3 = 5\), which is not divisible by 3), and not divisible by 5 (since it doesn't end in 0 or 5).
   - Therefore, 23 is a prime number.

5. **Conclusion:**
   The prime factorization of 253 is \(11 \times 23\).

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 253 is \(11 \times 23\).
