==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 253," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 253" is not clear or specific enough to determine what calculations or reasoning are required. 

Let's assume that "Sample math problem 253" refers to a specific math problem that involves basic arithmetic or algebraic operations. Without additional details, I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 253:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 13 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 5 = 13
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]
   \[
   13 = 13
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If "Sample math problem 253" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details or context so that I can assist you more accurately.
