To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he plans to sell at the market. We will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.**
   Isaias has a total of 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.

   \[
   \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the chickens.**
   Isaias plans to sell each chicken for $50. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 180 chickens is:

   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 180 \text{ chickens} \times 50 \text{ dollars/chicken} = 9000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the total cost to make a profit of $2000.**
   To find out how much Isaias spent on the chickens, we need to calculate the total cost that would allow him to make a profit of $2000. The profit is defined as:

   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
   \]

   Rearranging this formula gives us:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Profit}
   \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 9000 \text{ dollars} - 2000 \text{ dollars} = 7000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine the cost per chicken.**
   Since Isaias is selling 180 chickens, we can find out how much he spent per chicken by dividing the total cost by the number of chickens sold:

   \[
   \text{Cost per chicken} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of chickens to sell}} = \frac{7000 \text{ dollars}}{180 \text{ chickens}} \approx 38.89 \text{ dollars/chicken}
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   The total amount of money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he took to the market for sale is:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 7000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{7000}
\]
