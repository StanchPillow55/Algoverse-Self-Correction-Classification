To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day over the week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the total number of birds seen each day.**
   - Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
   - Day 3: 0 birds
   - Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
   - Day 6: 20 birds
   - Day 7: 90 birds

2. **Break down the counts for each day:**
   - Let's assume that on Day 1, Mack saw \( x \) birds and on Day 2, he saw \( y \) birds. We know that:
     \[
     x + y = 50
     \]
   - For Days 4 and 5, letâ€™s assume he saw \( a \) birds on Day 4 and \( b \) birds on Day 5. We know that:
     \[
     a + b = 120
     \]

3. **List the birds seen each day:**
   - Day 1: \( x \)
   - Day 2: \( y \)
   - Day 3: 0
   - Day 4: \( a \)
   - Day 5: \( b \)
   - Day 6: 20
   - Day 7: 90

4. **Calculate the total number of birds seen over the week:**
   - The total number of birds seen is:
     \[
     \text{Total} = x + y + 0 + a + b + 20 + 90
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \text{Total} = (x + y) + (a + b) + 20 + 90
     \]
   - From our earlier equations:
     \[
     \text{Total} = 50 + 120 + 20 + 90
     \]

5. **Perform the calculations:**
   - First, add the numbers:
     \[
     50 + 120 = 170
     \]
     \[
     170 + 20 = 190
     \]
     \[
     190 + 90 = 280
     \]
   - Thus, the total number of birds seen over the week is 280.

6. **Calculate the average number of birds seen per day:**
   - There are 7 days in the week, so the average is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of birds}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{280}{7}
     \]

7. **Perform the division:**
   - Dividing 280 by 7 gives:
     \[
     \text{Average} = 40
     \]

Therefore, the average number of birds Mack saw in a day is \( \boxed{40} \).
