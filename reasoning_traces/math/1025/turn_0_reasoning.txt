==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many eggs the friends found during the Easter egg hunt. Let's break down the information given step by step.

1. **Total number of eggs hidden**: The problem states that there are 100 eggs hidden in total.

2. **Eggs found by the Smith twins**: Each of the Smith twins found 30 eggs. Since there are two twins, we calculate the total number of eggs they found:
   \[
   \text{Total eggs found by Smith twins} = 30 \text{ (first twin)} + 30 \text{ (second twin)} = 60 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Eggs not found**: The problem states that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. This means that 10 eggs were not found at all.

4. **Calculating the number of eggs found**: To find out how many eggs were found in total, we subtract the number of eggs that were not found from the total number of eggs:
   \[
   \text{Total eggs found} = \text{Total eggs hidden} - \text{Eggs not found} = 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ eggs}
   \]

5. **Finding the number of eggs found by friends**: Now, we know that the total number of eggs found is 90. We also know that the Smith twins found 60 eggs. Therefore, the number of eggs found by their friends can be calculated by subtracting the number of eggs found by the Smith twins from the total number of eggs found:
   \[
   \text{Eggs found by friends} = \text{Total eggs found} - \text{Eggs found by Smith twins} = 90 - 60 = 30 \text{ eggs}
   \]

Thus, the friends found **30 eggs**.

Final answer: **30 eggs**.
