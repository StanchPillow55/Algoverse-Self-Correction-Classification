==================================================

To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert Adam's height from inches to feet**: 
   Since the height requirement for the roller coaster is given in feet, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we can convert inches to feet by dividing by 12.

   \[
   \text{Adam's height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine the height difference**: 
   The height requirement to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. We need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be.

   \[
   \text{Height needed} = 4 \text{ feet} - 3.33 \text{ feet} = 0.67 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Convert the height difference back to inches**: 
   Since Adam's growth is measured in inches, we convert the height difference from feet back to inches. 

   \[
   0.67 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 8.04 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow this height**: 
   Adam grows 2 inches each year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8.04 inches, we divide the height difference by his annual growth.

   \[
   \text{Years needed} = \frac{8.04 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4.02 \text{ years}
   \]

5. **Round up to the nearest whole number**: 
   Since Adam cannot ride the roller coaster until he is at least 4 feet tall, we round up the number of years to the next whole number. This means he will need 5 years to be tall enough.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\] 

Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 5 years.
