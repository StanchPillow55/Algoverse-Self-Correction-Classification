==================================================

To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert Adam's height from inches to feet**: 
   - Adam's current height is 40 inches. 
   - Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert inches to feet by dividing by 12:
     \[
     \text{Height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the height requirement**: 
   - The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet.

3. **Calculate the height difference**: 
   - We need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be:
     \[
     \text{Height needed} = 4 \text{ feet} - 3.33 \text{ feet} = 0.67 \text{ feet}
     \]

4. **Convert the height difference back to inches**: 
   - To make calculations easier, we convert the height difference from feet back to inches:
     \[
     0.67 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 8.04 \text{ inches}
     \]

5. **Determine Adam's growth rate**: 
   - Adam grows 2 inches per year.

6. **Calculate the number of years until Adam is tall enough**: 
   - To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height, we divide the height difference by his growth rate:
     \[
     \text{Years needed} = \frac{8.04 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4.02 \text{ years}
     \]

7. **Round up to the nearest whole year**: 
   - Since Adam cannot grow for a fraction of a year in practical terms, we round up to the next whole number:
     \[
     \text{Years needed} = 5 \text{ years}
     \]

Thus, Adam will need **5 years** until he is tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

**Final Answer**: 5 years
