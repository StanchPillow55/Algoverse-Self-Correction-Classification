Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert Adam's height from inches to feet**: 
   Since the height requirement for the roller coaster is given in feet, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we can convert inches to feet by dividing by 12.

   \[
   \text{Adam's height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine how much taller Adam needs to be**: 
   The height requirement for the roller coaster is 4 feet. We need to find out how much more height Adam needs to reach this requirement.

   \[
   \text{Height needed} = 4 \text{ feet} - 3.33 \text{ feet} = 0.67 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Convert the height needed back to inches**: 
   Since Adam's growth is measured in inches, we will convert the height needed from feet back to inches. 

   \[
   \text{Height needed in inches} = 0.67 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} \approx 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Calculate how many years it will take Adam to grow 8 inches**: 
   Adam grows 2 inches each year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow the additional 8 inches, we divide the total inches needed by the growth per year.

   \[
   \text{Years needed} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: 
   Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

\[
\text{Final Answer: } 4 \text{ years}
\]
