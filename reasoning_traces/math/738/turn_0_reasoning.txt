==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of books that Alice, Steven, and Clara have.

1. **Identify Clara's books**: We know from the problem that Clara has 20 books.

2. **Establish Steven's books**: The problem states that Clara has two times as many books as Steven. We can express this relationship mathematically:
   \[
   C = 2S
   \]
   where \( C \) is the number of books Clara has and \( S \) is the number of books Steven has. Since Clara has 20 books, we can substitute:
   \[
   20 = 2S
   \]
   To find \( S \), we divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   S = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]
   So, Steven has 10 books.

3. **Establish Alice's books**: The problem states that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. We can express this relationship as:
   \[
   A = S + 6
   \]
   where \( A \) is the number of books Alice has. Substituting the value of \( S \):
   \[
   A = 10 + 6 = 16
   \]
   So, Alice has 16 books.

4. **Calculate the difference between Clara's and Alice's books**: Now we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. We can calculate this as:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = C - A
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 20 - 16 = 4
   \]

Thus, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

**Final Answer**: Clara has 4 more books than Alice.
