==================================================

To solve the problem, we will first determine the picking rates of each individual based on the information provided.

1. **Determine Tony's picking rate:**
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
   \[
   \text{Tony's rate} = 6 \text{ quarts/hour}
   \]

2. **Determine Bobby's picking rate:**
   - Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony.
   \[
   \text{Bobby's rate} = \text{Tony's rate} - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 \text{ quarts/hour}
   \]

3. **Determine Kathy's picking rate:**
   - Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby.
   \[
   \text{Kathy's rate} = 2 \times \text{Bobby's rate} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ quarts/hour}
   \]

4. **Determine Ricky's picking rate:**
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy.
   \[
   \text{Ricky's rate} = \text{Kathy's rate} - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ quarts/hour}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total picking rate of all four individuals:**
   - We will sum the picking rates of Tony, Bobby, Kathy, and Ricky.
   \[
   \text{Total rate} = \text{Tony's rate} + \text{Bobby's rate} + \text{Kathy's rate} + \text{Ricky's rate}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total rate} = 6 + 5 + 10 + 8
   \]

6. **Perform the addition:**
   \[
   6 + 5 = 11
   \]
   \[
   11 + 10 = 21
   \]
   \[
   21 + 8 = 29
   \]

Thus, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Kathy, and Ricky can pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm is:
\[
\boxed{29}
\]
