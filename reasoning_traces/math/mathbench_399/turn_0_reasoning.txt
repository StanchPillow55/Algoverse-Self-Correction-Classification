==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 399" refers to. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 15 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation \( 2x + 3 = 15 \) is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Isolate the Term with \( x \):**
   To isolate the term with \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 3 from both sides:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 15 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 12
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{12}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   2(6) + 3 = 15
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   12 + 3 = 15
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 15 \) is \( x = 6 \).
