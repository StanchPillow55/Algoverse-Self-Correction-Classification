==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 399" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 399:**

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"Calculate the sum of the first 399 positive integers."

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify \( n \):**  
   In this problem, \( n = 399 \).

2. **Apply the formula:**  
   Substitute \( n = 399 \) into the formula:

   \[
   S_{399} = \frac{399(399 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( 399 + 1 \):**  
   \[
   399 + 1 = 400
   \]

4. **Multiply \( 399 \) by \( 400 \):**  
   \[
   399 \times 400 = 159600
   \]

5. **Divide the product by 2:**  
   \[
   \frac{159600}{2} = 79800
   \]

Therefore, the sum of the first 399 positive integers is \( 79800 \).

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 399 positive integers is \( 79800 \).
