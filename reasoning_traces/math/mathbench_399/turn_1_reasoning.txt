==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 399," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 399" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact nature of the problem. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not provided here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 399" refers to a typical math problem that might be found in a textbook or an exam. Without specific details, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) by itself.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   11 = 11
   \]
   The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If "Sample math problem 399" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context of the problem so that I can assist you accurately.
