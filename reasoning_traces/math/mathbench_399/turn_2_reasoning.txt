Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 399," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**

The equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is a linear equation in one variable. Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.

1. **Subtract 5 from both sides:**

   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 10
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2:**

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{10}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

**Step 3: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

\[
2(5) + 5 = 15
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
10 + 5 = 15
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is \( x = 5 \).
