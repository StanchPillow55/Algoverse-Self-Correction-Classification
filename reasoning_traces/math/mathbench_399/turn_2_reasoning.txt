==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 399" refers to. Since this is not a standard reference and no specific details are provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Let's solve a quadratic equation as an example:

Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the coefficients:**

   The given quadratic equation is \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \).

   Here, the coefficients are:
   - \( a = 2 \)
   - \( b = -4 \)
   - \( c = -6 \)

2. **Use the quadratic formula:**

   The quadratic formula is given by:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]

3. **Calculate the discriminant:**

   The discriminant (\( \Delta \)) is:
   \[
   \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6)
   \]
   \[
   \Delta = 16 + 48 = 64
   \]

4. **Calculate the roots using the quadratic formula:**

   Since the discriminant is positive (\( \Delta = 64 \)), there are two real and distinct roots.

   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

   Calculate the two possible values for \( x \):

   - First root:
     \[
     x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]

   - Second root:
     \[
     x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**

   The solutions to the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \).

**Final Answer:**

The roots of the equation \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \).
