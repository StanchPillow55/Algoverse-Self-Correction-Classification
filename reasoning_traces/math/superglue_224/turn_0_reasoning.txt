==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to understand the problem, identify what is being asked, and then apply the appropriate mathematical concepts and operations to find the solution. However, the question you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 224," does not contain any specific mathematical problem or details to work through. 

To demonstrate how I would solve a math problem, let's consider a hypothetical example:

**Example Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 150 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the entire field. How many meters of fencing does he need?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the total length of fencing required to enclose a rectangular field.
   - The field is 150 meters long and 80 meters wide.

2. **Identify What is Being Asked:**
   - We are asked to find the perimeter of the rectangle, which is the total length of fencing needed.

3. **Recall the Formula for the Perimeter of a Rectangle:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]

4. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   - Length = 150 meters
   - Width = 80 meters
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (150 + 80)
     \]

5. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, calculate the sum inside the parentheses:
     \[
     150 + 80 = 230
     \]
   - Then, multiply by 2 to find the perimeter:
     \[
     P = 2 \times 230 = 460
     \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The farmer needs 460 meters of fencing to enclose the field.

By following these steps, we ensure that we understand the problem, apply the correct formula, and perform the necessary calculations to arrive at the correct solution. If you have a specific math problem or reasoning question, please provide the details, and I will be happy to work through it with you.
