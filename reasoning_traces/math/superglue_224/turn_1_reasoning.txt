Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 224" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 224" is a math problem involving basic arithmetic or algebra.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Since the problem is not specified, let's assume it's a basic algebra problem. For example, solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Identify What is Given:**
   - We have the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

3. **Identify What Needs to be Found:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \).

4. **Plan a Solution:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

5. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Start by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

   - Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
     Simplifying the left side gives:
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
     Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is the correct solution.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

### Conclusion:

Without the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 224," I assumed a typical algebra problem to demonstrate the problem-solving process. If you have a specific problem or more details, please provide them for a more tailored solution.
