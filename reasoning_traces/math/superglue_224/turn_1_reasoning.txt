Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 224" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details or numbers, I'll assume it's a hypothetical or generic math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   The first 10 positive integers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

2. **Understand the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 10 \). Substitute 10 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{10(10 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   \[
   S = \frac{10 \times 11}{2} = \frac{110}{2} = 55
   \]

5. **Verify by Direct Addition:**
   To ensure the calculation is correct, let's add the numbers directly:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10
   \]
   Group the numbers for easier addition:
   \[
   (1 + 10) + (2 + 9) + (3 + 8) + (4 + 7) + (5 + 6) = 11 + 11 + 11 + 11 + 11 = 55
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   Both the formula and direct addition confirm that the sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.
