Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 198" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to tackling reasoning-based math problems. 

Let's assume a hypothetical math reasoning problem and solve it step by step:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels the first half of the distance at a speed of 60 miles per hour and the second half at a speed of 40 miles per hour. What is the average speed of the train for the entire journey?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Total distance = 300 miles.
   - First half distance = 150 miles at 60 mph.
   - Second half distance = 150 miles at 40 mph.
   - We need to find the average speed for the entire journey.

2. **Calculate Time for Each Segment:**
   - Time for the first half = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 60 mph = 2.5 hours.
   - Time for the second half = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 40 mph = 3.75 hours.

3. **Calculate Total Time:**
   - Total time = Time for first half + Time for second half = 2.5 hours + 3.75 hours = 6.25 hours.

4. **Calculate Average Speed:**
   - Average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 300 miles / 6.25 hours = 48 mph.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The average speed of the train for the entire journey is 48 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The average speed of the train for the entire journey is 48 mph.

This hypothetical problem demonstrates a structured approach to solving reasoning-based math problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details.
