==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 198" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume a typical math problem structure and demonstrate a step-by-step approach to solving a hypothetical problem. 

Let's assume the problem is a common algebraic problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Next, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This step-by-step approach ensures that we understand each part of the problem and verify our solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details or clarify the question.
