==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to follow a structured approach. Since the problem statement provided is "Sample reasoning question 449" without specific details, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving math problems using a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is 10 meters longer than its width. The perimeter of the field is 200 meters. What are the dimensions of the field?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of a rectangular field.
   - The length is 10 meters more than the width.
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 200 meters.

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle in meters.
   - Then the length \( l \) can be expressed as \( l = w + 10 \).

3. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 200 meters, so:
     \[
     2(w + 10) + 2w = 200
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve the Equation:**
   - Distribute and combine like terms:
     \[
     2w + 20 + 2w = 200
     \]
     \[
     4w + 20 = 200
     \]
   - Subtract 20 from both sides:
     \[
     4w = 180
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = 45
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Substitute \( w = 45 \) back into the equation for the length:
     \[
     l = w + 10 = 45 + 10 = 55
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with these dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(55) + 2(45) = 110 + 90 = 200
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The width of the field is 45 meters, and the length is 55 meters.
