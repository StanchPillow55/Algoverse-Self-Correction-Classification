Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday**: Buddy starts with 30 baseball cards.
   \[
   \text{Monday: } 30 \text{ cards}
   \]

2. **Tuesday**: Buddy loses half of his baseball cards. To find out how many he loses, we calculate half of 30.
   \[
   \text{Cards lost on Tuesday} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ cards}
   \]
   Now, we subtract the lost cards from the total he had on Monday:
   \[
   \text{Cards on Tuesday} = 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Wednesday**: Buddy buys 12 baseball cards. We add these to the number of cards he had on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Cards on Wednesday} = 15 + 12 = 27 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. **Thursday**: Buddy buys a third of what he had on Tuesday. We first need to find out what a third of his Tuesday total (15 cards) is.
   \[
   \text{Cards bought on Thursday} = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ cards}
   \]
   Now, we add these new cards to the total he had on Wednesday:
   \[
   \text{Cards on Thursday} = 27 + 5 = 32 \text{ cards}
   \]

Finally, we conclude that the total number of baseball cards Buddy has on Thursday is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]
