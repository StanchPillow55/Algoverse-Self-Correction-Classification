==================================================

To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to calculate the total costs and lost income associated with both options.

### Step 1: Calculate the lost income if Jackie does her taxes herself.

Jackie will lose 3 hours of freelance work if she does her taxes herself. The rate she earns from freelance work is $35 per hour. 

To find the total lost income, we multiply the number of hours lost by her hourly rate:

\[
\text{Lost Income} = \text{Hours Lost} \times \text{Hourly Rate}
\]
\[
\text{Lost Income} = 3 \, \text{hours} \times 35 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 105 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of doing taxes herself.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, the only cost is the lost income, which we calculated as $105.

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of hiring an accountant.

The accountant charges a flat fee of $90.

### Step 4: Compare the two options.

Now we need to compare the total costs of both options:

- **Cost of doing taxes herself:** $105 (lost income)
- **Cost of hiring an accountant:** $90

### Step 5: Calculate the difference in money.

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the cost of doing taxes herself:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Cost of doing taxes herself} - \text{Cost of hiring accountant}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 105 \, \text{dollars} - 90 \, \text{dollars} = 15 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Jackie will have **$15 more** if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself.
