To solve this problem, we need to track the number of baseball cards Buddy has each day from Monday to Thursday, based on the operations described in the problem.

**Step 1: Determine the number of baseball cards on Monday.**

On Monday, Buddy starts with 30 baseball cards.

\[ \text{Monday: } 30 \text{ cards} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of baseball cards on Tuesday after losing half of them.**

On Tuesday, Buddy loses half of his baseball cards. To find out how many cards he loses, we calculate half of 30:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \]

So, Buddy loses 15 cards on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of cards he has left is:

\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \]

\[ \text{Tuesday: } 15 \text{ cards} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of baseball cards on Wednesday after buying 12 more.**

On Wednesday, Buddy buys 12 additional baseball cards. We add these to the number of cards he had on Tuesday:

\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \]

\[ \text{Wednesday: } 27 \text{ cards} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of baseball cards on Thursday after buying a third of what he had on Tuesday.**

On Thursday, Buddy buys a third of the number of cards he had on Tuesday. Since he had 15 cards on Tuesday, we calculate a third of 15:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \]

So, Buddy buys 5 more cards on Thursday. We add these to the number of cards he had on Wednesday:

\[ 27 + 5 = 32 \]

\[ \text{Thursday: } 32 \text{ cards} \]

**Final Answer:**

Buddy has 32 baseball cards on Thursday.
