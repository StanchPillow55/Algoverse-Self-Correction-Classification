==================================================

To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to calculate the total cost of doing the taxes herself and compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

1. **Calculate the lost income from freelance work:**
   - Jackie will miss 3 hours of freelance work.
   - She earns $35 per hour.
   - Lost income = Hours missed Ã— Hourly rate
   \[
   \text{Lost income} = 3 \, \text{hours} \times 35 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 105 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost if Jackie does her taxes herself:**
   - The total cost of doing her taxes herself is the lost income from freelance work.
   \[
   \text{Total cost (doing taxes herself)} = 105 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of hiring an accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90.
   \[
   \text{Cost (hiring accountant)} = 90 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Compare the two costs:**
   - If Jackie does her taxes herself, she effectively incurs a cost of $105.
   - If she hires the accountant, she incurs a cost of $90.

5. **Calculate the difference in costs:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Cost (doing taxes herself)} - \text{Cost (hiring accountant)}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 105 \, \text{dollars} - 90 \, \text{dollars} = 15 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, Jackie will have **$15 more** if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself.

**Final Answer: Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.**
