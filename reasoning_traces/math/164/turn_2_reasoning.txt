Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to calculate the total cost of both options and compare them.

1. **Calculate the lost income if Jackie does her taxes herself:**
   - Jackie will miss 3 hours of freelance work.
   - She earns $35 per hour.
   - Lost income = 3 hours Ã— $35/hour = $105.

2. **Calculate the total cost if Jackie does her taxes herself:**
   - The total cost of doing her taxes herself is the lost income, which is $105.

3. **Calculate the cost if Jackie hires an accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90.

4. **Compare the two costs:**
   - If Jackie does her taxes herself, she effectively loses $105.
   - If she hires the accountant, she pays $90.

5. **Calculate the difference in money:**
   - Difference = Lost income (doing taxes herself) - Cost of accountant
   - Difference = $105 - $90 = $15.

Thus, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself.

**Final Answer: Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.**
