==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 470" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem involves algebra, as it's a common topic in math reasoning questions.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3(x - 4) + 2 = 5x - 8 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Distribute the 3 on the left side of the equation:**

   \[
   3(x - 4) + 2 = 5x - 8
   \]

   Distribute the 3:

   \[
   3 \cdot x - 3 \cdot 4 + 2 = 5x - 8
   \]

   This simplifies to:

   \[
   3x - 12 + 2 = 5x - 8
   \]

2. **Combine like terms on the left side:**

   \[
   3x - 10 = 5x - 8
   \]

3. **Get all terms involving \( x \) on one side and constant terms on the other side:**

   Subtract \( 3x \) from both sides:

   \[
   3x - 10 - 3x = 5x - 8 - 3x
   \]

   Simplifying gives:

   \[
   -10 = 2x - 8
   \]

4. **Isolate the term with \( x \):**

   Add 8 to both sides:

   \[
   -10 + 8 = 2x - 8 + 8
   \]

   Simplifying gives:

   \[
   -2 = 2x
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**

   Divide both sides by 2:

   \[
   \frac{-2}{2} = \frac{2x}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying gives:

   \[
   x = -1
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3(x - 4) + 2 = 5x - 8 \) is \( x = -1 \).

This step-by-step solution demonstrates the process of solving a linear equation by distributing, combining like terms, isolating the variable, and solving for the variable.
