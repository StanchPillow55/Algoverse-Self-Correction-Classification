==================================================

To solve the problem, "Sample reasoning question 120," we need to first understand what the question is asking. However, the question as presented is incomplete and lacks specific details or context. Therefore, I'll provide a general approach to solving a typical math problem and demonstrate how to work through it step-by-step.

Let's assume the problem involves solving a basic algebraic equation, which is a common type of math problem. Here's an example problem:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to remove the constant:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   It's always a good practice to verify the solution by substituting it back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplify the left side:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This example demonstrates a typical approach to solving a linear equation. If you have a specific problem or context for "Sample reasoning question 120," please provide more details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
