To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 120," we need to first understand what the question is asking. However, the question as stated is incomplete or unclear. It seems to be a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 120" refers to a typical math problem that might involve arithmetic, algebra, geometry, or another area of mathematics. Since the problem is not specified, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 120" is a problem involving basic algebra:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 15 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 5 = 15
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 10
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{10}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify the solution:

   \[
   2(5) + 5 = 15
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   10 + 5 = 15
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is \( x = 5 \).
