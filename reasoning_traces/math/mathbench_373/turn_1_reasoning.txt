Question ID: mathbench_373
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 373" refers to. Since no specific details about the problem are provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that isn't detailed here.

However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems, which you can apply to various types of problems. Let's consider a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - The goal is to get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

### Conclusion:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample math problem 373," please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem for you.
