==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 373" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem with the number 373 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Determine if the number 373 is a prime number.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Definition of a Prime Number:**
   A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Check if 373 is Greater than 1:**
   Clearly, 373 is greater than 1.

3. **Check Divisibility by Small Prime Numbers:**
   To determine if 373 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any prime numbers up to the square root of 373.

   - Calculate the square root of 373:
     \[
     \sqrt{373} \approx 19.31
     \]
     We only need to check for divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to 19.

4. **List of Prime Numbers â‰¤ 19:**
   The prime numbers less than or equal to 19 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19.

5. **Check Divisibility:**

   - **Divisibility by 2:**
     373 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

   - **Divisibility by 3:**
     Sum of the digits of 373 is \(3 + 7 + 3 = 13\). Since 13 is not divisible by 3, 373 is not divisible by 3.

   - **Divisibility by 5:**
     373 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

   - **Divisibility by 7:**
     Perform the division \(373 \div 7 \approx 53.2857\). Since this is not an integer, 373 is not divisible by 7.

   - **Divisibility by 11:**
     Alternate sum of digits: \(3 - 7 + 3 = -1\). Since -1 is not divisible by 11, 373 is not divisible by 11.

   - **Divisibility by 13:**
     Perform the division \(373 \div 13 \approx 28.6923\). Since this is not an integer, 373 is not divisible by 13.

   - **Divisibility by 17:**
     Perform the division \(373 \div 17 \approx 21.9412\). Since this is not an integer, 373 is not divisible by 17.

   - **Divisibility by 19:**
     Perform the division \(373 \div 19 \approx 19.6316\). Since this is not an integer, 373 is not divisible by 19.

6. **Conclusion:**
   Since 373 is not divisible by any prime number up to 19, it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 373 is a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
373 is a prime number.
