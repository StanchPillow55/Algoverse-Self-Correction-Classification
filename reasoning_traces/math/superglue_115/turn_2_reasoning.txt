==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what is being asked. The question is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 115," but it doesn't provide specific details or numbers to work with. Therefore, I'll create a hypothetical math problem to demonstrate the process of solving it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's say the problem is as follows:

"A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the field is 240 meters, what are the dimensions of the field?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field.
   - The length (L) is 3 times the width (W).
   - The perimeter (P) of the rectangle is 240 meters.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \( P = 2L + 2W \).
   - We know \( L = 3W \) (since the length is 3 times the width).
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     240 = 2(3W) + 2W
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     240 = 6W + 2W
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     240 = 8W
     \]

4. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{240}{8} = 30
     \]

5. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute the value of W:
     \[
     L = 3 \times 30 = 90
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(90) + 2(30) = 180 + 60 = 240
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the field are:
- Width (W) = 30 meters
- Length (L) = 90 meters

This completes the solution to the hypothetical problem. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, feel free to provide more details!
