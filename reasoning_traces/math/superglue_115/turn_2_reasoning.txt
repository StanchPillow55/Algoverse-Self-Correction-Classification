==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 115" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical problem for demonstration purposes:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles, at a constant speed. On the return trip, the train travels at a speed that is 20 miles per hour slower, taking 1 hour longer to complete the journey. What is the speed of the train from City A to City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the speed of the train from City A to City B in miles per hour.
   - The speed on the return trip is \( x - 20 \) miles per hour.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Time taken to travel from City A to City B is \( \frac{300}{x} \) hours.
   - Time taken to travel from City B to City A is \( \frac{300}{x - 20} \) hours.

3. **Use Given Information:**
   - The return trip takes 1 hour longer than the trip from City A to City B.
   - Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     \frac{300}{x - 20} = \frac{300}{x} + 1
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Clear the fractions by multiplying through by \( x(x - 20) \):
     \[
     300x = 300(x - 20) + x(x - 20)
     \]
   - Simplify and expand:
     \[
     300x = 300x - 6000 + x^2 - 20x
     \]
   - Rearrange the terms:
     \[
     0 = x^2 - 20x - 6000
     \]

5. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -20 \), and \( c = -6000 \):
     \[
     x = \frac{-(-20) \pm \sqrt{(-20)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-6000)}}{2 \cdot 1}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{20 \pm \sqrt{400 + 24000}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{20 \pm \sqrt{24400}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{20 \pm 156.2}{2}
     \]

6. **Calculate the Possible Values:**
   - \( x = \frac{20 + 156.2}{2} = 88.1 \)
   - \( x = \frac{20 - 156.2}{2} = -68.1 \) (not feasible as speed cannot be negative)

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The speed of the train from City A to City B is 88.1 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The speed of the train from City A to City B is 88.1 miles per hour.
