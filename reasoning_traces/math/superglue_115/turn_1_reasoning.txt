==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 115" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, let's assume a hypothetical math problem to demonstrate the process of solving it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Calculate the sum of the first 115 positive integers.

**Solution:**

To find the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) integers.

In this case, \( n = 115 \). Plugging this value into the formula gives:

\[
S_{115} = \frac{115(115 + 1)}{2}
\]

First, calculate \( 115 + 1 \):

\[
115 + 1 = 116
\]

Next, multiply 115 by 116:

\[
115 \times 116 = 13340
\]

Now, divide the result by 2 to find the sum:

\[
S_{115} = \frac{13340}{2} = 6670
\]

Thus, the sum of the first 115 positive integers is 6670.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 115 positive integers is 6670.
