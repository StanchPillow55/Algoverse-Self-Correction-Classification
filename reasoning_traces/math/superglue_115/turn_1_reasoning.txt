==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 115" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a sample math problem and work through it.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) by itself.

**Step 3: Subtract 3 from Both Sides**
The equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 3 from both sides:

\[
2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x = 8
\]

**Step 4: Divide by 2**
Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 4
\]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]

Calculate the left side:

\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 4.
