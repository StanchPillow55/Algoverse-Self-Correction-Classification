It seems like there might be some confusion with the problem statement "Sample math problem 327." This doesn't provide specific details about the math problem you want to solve. However, I can guide you through a hypothetical math problem involving the number 327. Let's assume a problem involving basic arithmetic operations with the number 327.

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 327, then multiply the result by 3, and finally subtract 5. What is the final result?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 327:**
   - The number 327 consists of the digits 3, 2, and 7.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Sum = 3 + 2 + 7

   \[
   \text{Sum} = 3 + 2 + 7 = 12
   \]

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Result = 12 Ã— 3

   \[
   \text{Result} = 12 \times 3 = 36
   \]

4. **Subtract 5 from the result:**
   - Final Result = 36 - 5

   \[
   \text{Final Result} = 36 - 5 = 31
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The final result after performing all the operations is 31.
