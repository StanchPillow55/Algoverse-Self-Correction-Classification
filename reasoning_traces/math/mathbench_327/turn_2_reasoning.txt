Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 327," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since "Sample math problem 327" is not a standard problem description, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without additional context or details, I will create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 327 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 327, then multiply the result by 3.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 327:**
   - The number 327 consists of three digits: 3, 2, and 7.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(3 + 2 + 7\).

   \[
   3 + 2 + 7 = 12
   \]

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Take the sum obtained in the previous step and multiply it by 3.

   \[
   12 \times 3 = 36
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The final result of the calculation is 36.

Therefore, the solution to the hypothetical problem is 36. If you have a specific problem in mind related to "Sample math problem 327," please provide additional details, and I will be happy to solve it accordingly.
