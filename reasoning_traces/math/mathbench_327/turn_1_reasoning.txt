==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 327" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't specified, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample problem based on common math topics and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Math Problem 327:**

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 10 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**  
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**  
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

   Start by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides of the equation to get all \( x \)-terms on one side:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 10 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**  
   Now, subtract 5 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 10 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**  
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 2(5) + 10
   \]
   Simplifying both sides:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 10 + 10
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**  
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 10 \) is \( x = 5 \).
