==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 327," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 327" is not specific and does not provide any details about what needs to be solved. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem.

To proceed, let's consider a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is:

**Problem 327:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 17 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 17 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 12
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{12}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(6) + 5 = 17
   \]
   \[
   12 + 5 = 17
   \]
   \[
   17 = 17
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 17 \) is \( x = 6 \).
