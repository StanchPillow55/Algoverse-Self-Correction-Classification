==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 430." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step-by-step. Let's assume a sample problem:

**Problem:**  
A car travels from Town A to Town B at a speed of 60 km/h and returns from Town B to Town A at a speed of 40 km/h. What is the average speed of the car for the entire journey?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The car travels two legs of a journey: from A to B and back from B to A.
   - We need to find the average speed for the entire journey.

2. **Define Average Speed:**
   - Average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

3. **Assume a Distance:**
   - To simplify calculations, assume the distance between Town A and Town B is \( D \) km.

4. **Calculate Time for Each Leg:**
   - **Time from A to B:**  
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{D}{60} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - **Time from B to A:**  
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{D}{40} \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate Total Distance and Total Time:**
   - **Total Distance:**  
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = D + D = 2D \text{ km}
     \]
   - **Total Time:**  
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = \frac{D}{60} + \frac{D}{40} \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Find a Common Denominator for Time:**
   - The common denominator for 60 and 40 is 120.
   - Convert each time fraction:
     \[
     \frac{D}{60} = \frac{2D}{120}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{D}{40} = \frac{3D}{120}
     \]
   - **Total Time:**  
     \[
     \frac{2D}{120} + \frac{3D}{120} = \frac{5D}{120} = \frac{D}{24} \text{ hours}
     \]

7. **Calculate Average Speed:**
   - **Average Speed:**  
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{2D}{\frac{D}{24}} = 2D \times \frac{24}{D} = 48 \text{ km/h}
     \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The average speed of the car for the entire journey is 48 km/h.

**Final Answer:**  
The average speed of the car for the entire journey is 48 km/h.
