==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about what "Sample reasoning question 430" entails. Since the question is not specified, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by solving an example problem step-by-step.

**Example Problem:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are asked to find the area of a triangle.
   - The formula for the area \( A \) of a triangle is given by:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - We are provided with:
     - Base \( b = 10 \) units
     - Height \( h = 5 \) units

2. **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**
   - Substitute \( b = 10 \) and \( h = 5 \) into the area formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

3. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

4. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle. If you have a specific problem or need assistance with "Sample reasoning question 430," please provide more details, and I will be happy to help!
