==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 430" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - Between 1 and 100, the even numbers start at 2 and end at 100.

2. **List the Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers is: 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 100.

3. **Recognize the Sequence:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

4. **Find the Number of Terms:**
   - The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by \( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \).
   - Set \( a_n = 100 \) to find the number of terms \( n \):
     \[
     100 = 2 + (n-1) \times 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = 50
     \]

5. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \times (2 + 100)
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 25 \times 102
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 2550
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.
