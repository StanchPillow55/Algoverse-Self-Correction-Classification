Certainly! Let's work through a hypothetical math problem step by step. Since the problem "Sample reasoning question 430" is not specified, I'll create a problem for demonstration purposes and solve it.

**Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per widget, and for Type B, it is $8 per widget. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. Last month, the company produced a total of 500 widgets and made a profit of $3,000. How many of each type of widget did the company produce?

**Solution:**

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
- Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

We have two main pieces of information:
1. The total number of widgets produced is 500.
2. The total profit is $3,000.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ x + y = 500 \]

The profit for each type of widget is calculated as the selling price minus the production cost:
- Profit per Type A widget = $10 - $5 = $5
- Profit per Type B widget = $15 - $8 = $7

The total profit from selling the widgets is given by:
\[ 5x + 7y = 3000 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( x + y = 500 \)
2. \( 5x + 7y = 3000 \)

We can solve this system using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use substitution.

From the first equation, solve for \( y \):
\[ y = 500 - x \]

Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into the second equation:
\[ 5x + 7(500 - x) = 3000 \]

Distribute the 7:
\[ 5x + 3500 - 7x = 3000 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ -2x + 3500 = 3000 \]

Subtract 3500 from both sides:
\[ -2x = 3000 - 3500 \]
\[ -2x = -500 \]

Divide by -2:
\[ x = 250 \]

Now substitute \( x = 250 \) back into the equation \( y = 500 - x \):
\[ y = 500 - 250 \]
\[ y = 250 \]

Therefore, the company produced 250 Type A widgets and 250 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company produced 250 Type A widgets and 250 Type B widgets.
