To solve the problem, we need to determine how much new line the caretaker needs to buy based on the amount of dock he has. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total length of line needed:**
   The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there is 200 feet of dock, we can calculate the total length of line needed as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total line needed} = \text{Length of dock} \times \text{Line per foot of dock}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total line needed} = 200 \text{ feet} \times 3 \text{ feet/foot} = 600 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine how much line he currently has:**
   The caretaker currently has 6 feet of new line.

3. **Calculate how much additional line he needs to buy:**
   To find out how much more line he needs to buy, we subtract the amount of line he currently has from the total line needed:

   \[
   \text{Line needed to buy} = \text{Total line needed} - \text{Current line}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Line needed to buy} = 600 \text{ feet} - 6 \text{ feet} = 594 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   The caretaker needs to buy a total of 594 feet of new line.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{594}
\]
