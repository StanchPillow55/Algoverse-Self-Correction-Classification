==================================================

It seems like you've referenced a "Sample reasoning question 274," but without the specific details of the problem, I can't provide a solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems, which you can apply to your specific question once you have it.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note down any given information or data.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that apply to the problem.
   - Decide on a strategy to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps youâ€™ve planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and conversions if applicable.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm your result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if necessary.

### Example Problem

Let's apply this approach to a sample problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- We can isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
1. Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 4: Check Your Work**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
  - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).
