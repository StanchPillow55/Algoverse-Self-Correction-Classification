==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 274." However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem using logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. 

Let's assume a sample math problem for demonstration:

**Problem:**  
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 150 meters long and 100 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field and also divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is rectangular with dimensions 150 meters (length) and 100 meters (width).
   - A fence is needed around the perimeter of the field.
   - An additional fence is needed to divide the field into two equal parts parallel to the shorter side.

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substitute the given dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (150 + 100) = 2 \times 250 = 500 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Length of the Dividing Fence:**
   - The dividing fence is parallel to the shorter side (width) of the rectangle.
   - Therefore, the length of the dividing fence is equal to the length of the field, which is 150 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence:**
   - The total length of the fence required is the sum of the perimeter and the dividing fence:
     \[
     \text{Total Length} = \text{Perimeter} + \text{Dividing Fence}
     \]
   - Substitute the calculated values:
     \[
     \text{Total Length} = 500 + 150 = 650 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The total length of the fence required is 650 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The total length of the fence required is 650 meters.

This approach demonstrates how to break down a problem into smaller parts, perform calculations, and logically arrive at the solution. If you have a specific problem or additional details, please provide them, and I can offer a more tailored solution.
