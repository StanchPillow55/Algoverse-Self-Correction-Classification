==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 121," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 121" does not provide enough information about the specific mathematical problem or question to be solved. Therefore, I will assume that "121" refers to a mathematical problem involving the number 121. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Finding the Square Root of 121

One common problem involving the number 121 is finding its square root. Let's solve this:

1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find the square root of 121.
2. **Recall the Definition**: The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).
3. **Calculate**: We need to find \( y \) such that \( y^2 = 121 \).

   \[
   y^2 = 121
   \]

4. **Solve for \( y \)**: We know that \( 11 \times 11 = 121 \), so:

   \[
   y = 11
   \]

5. **Verification**: Check the calculation:

   \[
   11^2 = 11 \times 11 = 121
   \]

   The calculation is correct.

6. **Conclusion**: The square root of 121 is 11.

### Possibility 2: Checking if 121 is a Perfect Square

Another problem could be to determine if 121 is a perfect square:

1. **Definition**: A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer.
2. **Check**: We already found that \( 11^2 = 121 \).
3. **Conclusion**: Since 121 can be expressed as \( 11^2 \), it is a perfect square.

### Possibility 3: Factoring 121

Another problem could involve factoring the number 121:

1. **Identify the Problem**: Factor the number 121.
2. **Recall the Definition**: Factoring involves expressing a number as a product of its prime factors.
3. **Factorization**: We know that 121 is \( 11 \times 11 \).

   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: The prime factorization of 121 is \( 11^2 \).

### Final Answer

Since the problem "Sample math problem 121" is not specific, I have explored several possibilities involving the number 121. Here are the conclusions for each:

- The square root of 121 is 11.
- 121 is a perfect square.
- The prime factorization of 121 is \( 11^2 \).

If you have a specific problem in mind involving the number 121, please provide more details so I can address it accurately.
