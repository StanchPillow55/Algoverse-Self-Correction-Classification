==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 121," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 121." Without additional context or details, it's challenging to provide a specific solution. 

Let's assume that "Sample math problem 121" refers to a typical math problem that involves the number 121. A common math problem involving 121 could be finding its square root, determining its factors, or solving an equation where 121 is a part of it. I'll explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Finding the Square Root of 121

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the square root of 121.
2. **Reasoning**: The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).
3. **Calculation**:
   \[
   y^2 = 121
   \]
   We know that \( 11 \times 11 = 121 \).
4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the square root of 121 is 11.

### Possibility 2: Finding the Factors of 121

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find all the factors of 121.
2. **Reasoning**: A factor of a number is an integer that divides the number without leaving a remainder.
3. **Calculation**:
   - Start with 1: \( 121 \div 1 = 121 \)
   - Check 2: \( 121 \div 2 \) is not an integer.
   - Check 3: \( 121 \div 3 \) is not an integer.
   - Continue this process up to 11:
     - \( 121 \div 11 = 11 \)
   - Beyond 11, the factors will repeat.
4. **Conclusion**: The factors of 121 are 1, 11, and 121.

### Possibility 3: Solving an Equation Involving 121

Let's assume an equation like \( x^2 = 121 \).

1. **Understanding the Problem**: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( x^2 = 121 \).
2. **Reasoning**: We need to find a number \( x \) such that when squared, it equals 121.
3. **Calculation**:
   \[
   x^2 = 121
   \]
   Taking the square root of both sides:
   \[
   x = \pm 11
   \]
4. **Conclusion**: The solutions to the equation \( x^2 = 121 \) are \( x = 11 \) and \( x = -11 \).

### Final Answer

Without a specific problem statement, I explored common mathematical tasks involving the number 121. Here are the final answers for each possibility:

1. The square root of 121 is 11.
2. The factors of 121 are 1, 11, and 121.
3. The solutions to the equation \( x^2 = 121 \) are \( x = 11 \) and \( x = -11 \).

If you have a specific problem involving 121, please provide more details for a precise solution.
