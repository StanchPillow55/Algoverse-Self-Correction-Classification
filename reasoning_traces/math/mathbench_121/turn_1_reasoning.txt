==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 121," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 121" is not clear or specific. It seems to be a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not provided here.

To proceed, I will assume that "Sample math problem 121" is a reference to a specific math problem that involves the number 121. A common mathematical problem involving the number 121 is finding its square root, since 121 is a perfect square.

Let's solve the problem of finding the square root of 121:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the square root of 121. The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).

2. **Calculating the Square Root:**
   - We are looking for a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = 121 \).
   - We know that \( 11 \times 11 = 121 \).
   - Therefore, \( 11^2 = 121 \).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The square root of 121 is 11.

4. **Verification:**
   - To verify, we can multiply 11 by itself: \( 11 \times 11 = 121 \).
   - This confirms that our calculation is correct.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The square root of 121 is 11.

If the problem "Sample math problem 121" refers to something else, please provide additional details or context so that I can address the specific problem you have in mind.
