Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 121," let's first interpret what the problem might be asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves the number 121 in some mathematical context. A common problem involving the number 121 could be finding its square root, determining its factors, or verifying if it's a perfect square. Let's explore these possibilities:

### 1. Finding the Square Root of 121

To find the square root of 121, we need to determine which number, when multiplied by itself, equals 121.

- Start by considering perfect squares around 121. We know:
  - \(10^2 = 100\)
  - \(11^2 = 121\)
  - \(12^2 = 144\)

Since \(11^2 = 121\), the square root of 121 is 11.

### 2. Determining the Factors of 121

To find the factors of 121, we need to identify all integers that divide 121 without leaving a remainder.

- Start with 1 and the number itself: 1 and 121.
- Check divisibility by smaller numbers:
  - 121 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).
  - Sum of digits of 121 is 4, which is not divisible by 3.
  - 121 does not end in 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.
  - Dividing 121 by 7 gives approximately 17.2857, not an integer.
  - Dividing 121 by 11 gives exactly 11, which is an integer.

Thus, the factors of 121 are 1, 11, and 121.

### 3. Verifying if 121 is a Perfect Square

A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.

- As calculated earlier, \(11^2 = 121\).
- Therefore, 121 is indeed a perfect square.

### Conclusion

Based on the assumptions and calculations above, the number 121 is a perfect square, its square root is 11, and its factors are 1, 11, and 121.

**Final Answer:**
- The square root of 121 is 11.
- The factors of 121 are 1, 11, and 121.
- 121 is a perfect square.
