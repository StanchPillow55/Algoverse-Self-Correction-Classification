==================================================

It seems like you've mentioned "Sample math problem 121," but without specific details or context, it's unclear what the problem is. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

For now, let's assume a generic math problem, such as solving a quadratic equation. Here's how you might approach it:

### Problem:
Solve the quadratic equation: \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the form of the equation:**
   The given equation is a quadratic equation in the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), and \( c = 6 \).

2. **Factor the quadratic equation:**
   We need to find two numbers that multiply to \( ac = 1 \times 6 = 6 \) and add to \( b = -5 \).

   The numbers that satisfy these conditions are -2 and -3 because:
   \[
   (-2) \times (-3) = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad (-2) + (-3) = -5
   \]

3. **Write the equation in factored form:**
   Using the numbers found, we can write the equation as:
   \[
   (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x - 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 2
   \]
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3
   \]

5. **Verify the solutions:**
   Substitute \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \) back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it:
   - For \( x = 2 \):
     \[
     (2)^2 - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0
     \]
   - For \( x = 3 \):
     \[
     (3)^2 - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0
     \]

   Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

### Final Answer:
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \).

If you have a different problem in mind, please provide the specific details, and I'll be glad to assist you with that.
