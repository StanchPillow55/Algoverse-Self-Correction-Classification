==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 121," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not clear, I'll assume it involves solving a mathematical expression or equation involving the number 121. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Solving a Simple Equation

If the problem is to solve an equation like \( x^2 = 121 \), we can proceed as follows:

1. **Identify the equation**: \( x^2 = 121 \).
2. **Solve for \( x \)**: To find \( x \), we take the square root of both sides of the equation.
   \[
   x = \pm \sqrt{121}
   \]
3. **Calculate the square root**: The square root of 121 is 11, since \( 11 \times 11 = 121 \).
   \[
   x = \pm 11
   \]
4. **State the solution**: The solutions to the equation \( x^2 = 121 \) are \( x = 11 \) and \( x = -11 \).

### Possibility 2: Factorization

If the problem involves factorizing the number 121, we proceed as follows:

1. **Identify the number**: 121.
2. **Find the prime factors**: 121 is a perfect square, and it can be expressed as \( 11 \times 11 \).
3. **State the factorization**: The prime factorization of 121 is \( 11^2 \).

### Possibility 3: Solving a Word Problem

If the problem involves a word problem where 121 is a key number, we would need more context to solve it. However, let's assume a hypothetical scenario:

**Problem**: If a square has an area of 121 square units, what is the length of each side?

1. **Identify the problem**: We need to find the side length of a square with an area of 121 square units.
2. **Use the formula for the area of a square**: The area \( A \) of a square is given by \( A = s^2 \), where \( s \) is the side length.
3. **Set up the equation**: \( s^2 = 121 \).
4. **Solve for \( s \)**: Take the square root of both sides.
   \[
   s = \sqrt{121} = 11
   \]
5. **State the solution**: The length of each side of the square is 11 units.

### Final Answer

Without a specific problem statement, I have provided solutions to possible interpretations involving the number 121. If the problem is:

- Solving \( x^2 = 121 \): The solutions are \( x = 11 \) and \( x = -11 \).
- Factorizing 121: The prime factorization is \( 11^2 \).
- Finding the side length of a square with area 121: The side length is 11 units.

If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can give a more precise solution.
