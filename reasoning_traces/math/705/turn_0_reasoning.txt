To solve the problem, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle based on the information given about her cat.

1. **Identify the speed of the cat**: 
   The problem states that Martha's cat can run at a speed of 15 feet per second.

2. **Determine the speed of the turtle**: 
   We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. Let's denote the speed of the turtle as \( x \) feet per second. According to the problem, we can set up the following equation based on the relationship between the speeds of the cat and the turtle:

   \[
   \text{Speed of cat} = 5 \times \text{Speed of turtle}
   \]

   Substituting the known speed of the cat:

   \[
   15 = 5x
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   To find the speed of the turtle, we need to isolate \( x \). We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

   \[
   x = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}
   \]

   So, the turtle crawls at a speed of 3 feet per second.

4. **Calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds**:
   Now that we know the turtle's speed, we can calculate how far it can crawl in 40 seconds. The distance \( d \) can be calculated using the formula:

   \[
   d = \text{speed} \times \text{time}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   d = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the turtle can crawl a total of **120 feet** in 40 seconds.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{120 \text{ feet}}
\]
