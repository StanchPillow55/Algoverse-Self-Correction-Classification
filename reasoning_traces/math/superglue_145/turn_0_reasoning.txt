==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 145" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per widget, and for Type B, it is $7 per widget. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $12 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and made a total revenue of $5,600. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of widgets sold is 500:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - The total revenue from selling the widgets is $5,600. The revenue from Type A widgets is \( 10x \) and from Type B widgets is \( 12y \):
     \[
     10x + 12y = 5600
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 500 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   10x + 12y &= 5600 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 500 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   10x + 12(500 - x) = 5600
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   10x + 6000 - 12x = 5600
   \]
   \[
   -2x + 6000 = 5600
   \]
   \[
   -2x = 5600 - 6000
   \]
   \[
   -2x = -400
   \]
   \[
   x = 200
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 200 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 500 - 200 = 300
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the total revenue with \( x = 200 \) and \( y = 300 \):
   \[
   10(200) + 12(300) = 2000 + 3600 = 5600
   \]

   The calculations are correct, and the conditions of the problem are satisfied.

**Final Answer:**

The company sold 200 Type A widgets and 300 Type B widgets.
