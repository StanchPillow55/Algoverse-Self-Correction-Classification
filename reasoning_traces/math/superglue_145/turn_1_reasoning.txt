==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 145" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I will assume a generic approach to solving a math problem by demonstrating a structured method of reasoning and problem-solving. 

Let's assume a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Problem Statement:**
"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   Even numbers are integers divisible by 2. Between 1 and 100, the even numbers start from 2 and end at 100.

2. **List the Even Numbers:**
   The sequence of even numbers between 1 and 100 is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

3. **Determine the Number of Terms:**
   This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the last term \( a_n = 100 \), with a common difference \( d = 2 \).

   To find the number of terms \( n \), use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
   \]
   Plugging in the known values:
   \[
   100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
   \]
   \[
   100 = 2 + 2n - 2
   \]
   \[
   100 = 2n
   \]
   \[
   n = 50
   \]

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
   \]
   \[
   S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
   \]
   \[
   S_{50} = 2550
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.
