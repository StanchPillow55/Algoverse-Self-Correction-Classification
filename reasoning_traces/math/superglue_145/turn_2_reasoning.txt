==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 145" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that involves logical reasoning and calculations. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is 10 meters longer than its width. The area of the field is 600 square meters. What are the dimensions of the field?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the field in meters.
   - Then, the length of the field is \( w + 10 \) meters.

2. **Write the Equation for Area:**
   - The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values, we have:
     \[
     600 = (w + 10) \times w
     \]

3. **Expand and Simplify the Equation:**
   - Expanding the right side, we get:
     \[
     600 = w^2 + 10w
     \]

4. **Rearrange the Equation:**
   - Bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:
     \[
     w^2 + 10w - 600 = 0
     \]

5. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 10 \), and \( c = -600 \).

6. **Calculate the Discriminant:**
   - The discriminant \( \Delta \) is:
     \[
     \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 10^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-600) = 100 + 2400 = 2500
     \]

7. **Find the Roots:**
   - Since the discriminant is positive, there are two real roots:
     \[
     w = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{2500}}{2 \times 1}
     \]
   - Calculate the square root:
     \[
     \sqrt{2500} = 50
     \]
   - Substitute back into the formula:
     \[
     w = \frac{-10 \pm 50}{2}
     \]
   - This gives two solutions:
     \[
     w = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \quad \text{and} \quad w = \frac{-60}{2} = -30
     \]

8. **Select the Valid Solution:**
   - Since width cannot be negative, we choose \( w = 20 \).

9. **Calculate the Length:**
   - The length is \( w + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \).

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the field are 20 meters in width and 30 meters in length.
