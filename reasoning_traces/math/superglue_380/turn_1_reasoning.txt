==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 380," we need to first understand what the question is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete and lacks specific details or context. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by making reasonable assumptions about what "Sample reasoning question 380" might entail.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 380" involves solving a mathematical problem such as an algebraic equation, a geometry problem, or a word problem. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 5 = 15 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   The equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is a linear equation in one variable. Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 10
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{10}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(5) + 5 = 15
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   10 + 5 = 15
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This example demonstrates a structured approach to solving a linear equation. If "Sample reasoning question 380" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details or context so I can assist you more accurately.
