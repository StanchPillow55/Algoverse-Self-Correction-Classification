Question ID: superglue_380
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 380" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details or context about this question, we will need to make some assumptions or create a hypothetical problem to solve. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 380" is a math problem involving basic arithmetic operations. Here's a hypothetical problem we can solve:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the result of the following expression:
\[ 380 + 120 - 50 \times 2 + 10 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Order of Operations:**
   According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we need to perform calculations in the following order:
   - Parentheses/Brackets
   - Exponents/Orders (i.e., powers and roots, etc.)
   - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
   - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

2. **Identify Operations:**
   In the expression \( 380 + 120 - 50 \times 2 + 10 \), we have:
   - Addition: \( 380 + 120 \) and \( + 10 \)
   - Subtraction: \( - 50 \times 2 \)
   - Multiplication: \( 50 \times 2 \)

3. **Perform Multiplication:**
   First, perform the multiplication:
   \[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

4. **Substitute Back into the Expression:**
   Replace the multiplication result back into the expression:
   \[ 380 + 120 - 100 + 10 \]

5. **Perform Addition and Subtraction from Left to Right:**
   - First, add \( 380 + 120 \):
     \[ 380 + 120 = 500 \]
   - Next, subtract \( 100 \) from \( 500 \):
     \[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]
   - Finally, add \( 10 \) to \( 400 \):
     \[ 400 + 10 = 410 \]

**Final Answer:**
The result of the expression \( 380 + 120 - 50 \times 2 + 10 \) is \( 410 \).

Therefore, the final answer to our hypothetical problem is \( 410 \).
