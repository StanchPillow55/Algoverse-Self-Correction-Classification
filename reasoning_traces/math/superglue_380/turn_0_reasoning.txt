==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 380" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details or context, I will assume it is a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even numbers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   - The sequence of the first 20 positive even numbers is: 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 40.

2. **Recognize the Pattern:**
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the \( n \)-th Term:**
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - For the 20th term (\( n = 20 \)):
     \[
     a_{20} = 2 + (20-1) \cdot 2 = 2 + 38 = 40
     \]

4. **Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values (\( n = 20 \), \( a_1 = 2 \), \( a_{20} = 40 \)):
     \[
     S_{20} = \frac{20}{2} \cdot (2 + 40) = 10 \cdot 42 = 420
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of the first 20 positive even numbers is 420.

Thus, the final answer to the problem is:

\[
\boxed{420}
\]
