### Example Problem and Solution

Since we don't have the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 380," let's solve a typical math reasoning problem as an example:

**Example Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the entire field. How much fencing material does he need?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the perimeter of the rectangular field to determine how much fencing material is required.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
     \]

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the given values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (100 \, \text{meters} + 60 \, \text{meters})
     \]
   - Calculate the sum inside the parentheses:
     \[
     100 \, \text{meters} + 60 \, \text{meters} = 160 \, \text{meters}
     \]
   - Multiply by 2 to find the perimeter:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 160 \, \text{meters} = 320 \, \text{meters}
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.
   - The steps and calculations are correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The farmer needs 320 meters of fencing material.
