==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it took Anna to complete the puzzle based on the information given about Steve's time.

1. **Identify Steve's Time**: 
   - We know that Steve took 10 hours to complete the puzzle.

2. **Calculate Half of Steve's Time**: 
   - Half of Steve's time is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Half of Steve's time} = \frac{10 \text{ hours}}{2} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Determine Anna's Time**: 
   - According to the problem, Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time. Therefore, we can express Anna's time as:
     \[
     \text{Anna's time} = \text{Half of Steve's time} + 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Substituting the value we calculated for half of Steve's time:
     \[
     \text{Anna's time} = 5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 7 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Final Answer**: 
   - Thus, it took Anna **7 hours** to finish the puzzle.

In conclusion, the time it took Anna to complete the puzzle is:
\[
\boxed{7 \text{ hours}}
\]
