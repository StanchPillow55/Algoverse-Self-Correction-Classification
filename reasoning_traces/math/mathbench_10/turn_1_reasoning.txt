==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 10" refers to. However, since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 10" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 10:**

*Problem Statement:*

A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**

   We need to find the length and width of a rectangle given that the length is 3 times the width and the perimeter is 48 units.

2. **Define Variables:**

   Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   Then, the length \( l \) is \( 3w \).

3. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**

   The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
   \[
   P = 2(l + w)
   \]

   Substitute the given perimeter and the expression for the length:
   \[
   48 = 2(3w + w)
   \]

4. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**

   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   48 = 2(4w)
   \]
   \[
   48 = 8w
   \]

   Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( w \):
   \[
   w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
   \]

5. **Find the Length \( l \):**

   Since \( l = 3w \), substitute \( w = 6 \):
   \[
   l = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
   \[
   P = 2(l + w) = 2(18 + 6) = 2 \times 24 = 48
   \]

   The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 6 units
- Length = 18 units
