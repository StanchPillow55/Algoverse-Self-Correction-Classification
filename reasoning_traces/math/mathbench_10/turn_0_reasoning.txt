==================================================

Certainly! However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 10" is not specific enough for me to provide a detailed solution. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that isn't fully described here.

To help you effectively, I'll need more details about the problem. For example, is it an algebra problem, a geometry problem, a calculus problem, or something else? What are the specific numbers or expressions involved?

If you can provide the full details of the math problem, I'll be happy to work through it step by step and provide a complete solution with explanations.
