==================================================

To solve the problem, we will first determine how many hats Zola has based on the information given about Paityn's hats. Then, we will calculate the total number of hats they have together and finally divide that total by two to find out how many hats each person gets.

### Step 1: Calculate Zola's red hats
Paityn has 20 red hats. Zola has \( \frac{4}{5} \) times as many red hats as Paityn.

\[
\text{Zola's red hats} = \frac{4}{5} \times 20 = \frac{80}{5} = 16
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Zola's blue hats
Paityn has 24 blue hats. Zola has twice the number of blue hats as Paityn.

\[
\text{Zola's blue hats} = 2 \times 24 = 48
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of hats
Now, we will calculate the total number of hats each person has.

**Total hats for Paityn:**
- Red hats: 20
- Blue hats: 24

\[
\text{Total hats for Paityn} = 20 + 24 = 44
\]

**Total hats for Zola:**
- Red hats: 16
- Blue hats: 48

\[
\text{Total hats for Zola} = 16 + 48 = 64
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the combined total of hats
Now we will find the total number of hats when Paityn and Zola combine their hats.

\[
\text{Total hats combined} = \text{Total hats for Paityn} + \text{Total hats for Zola} = 44 + 64 = 108
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of hats each gets
Since they are sharing the hats equally, we divide the total number of hats by 2.

\[
\text{Hats each gets} = \frac{108}{2} = 54
\]

### Final Answer
Each person gets **54 hats**.
