==================================================

To find the total number of thorns on all the rose bushes, we can break the problem down into several steps.

1. **Determine the number of roses per bush**: 
   Each rose bush has 25 roses.

2. **Determine the total number of roses**: 
   Dan plants 3 rose bushes. Therefore, the total number of roses can be calculated by multiplying the number of bushes by the number of roses per bush:
   \[
   \text{Total Roses} = \text{Number of Bushes} \times \text{Roses per Bush} = 3 \times 25
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Roses} = 75
   \]

3. **Determine the number of thorns per rose**: 
   Each rose has 8 thorns.

4. **Calculate the total number of thorns**: 
   Now, we need to find the total number of thorns by multiplying the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:
   \[
   \text{Total Thorns} = \text{Total Roses} \times \text{Thorns per Rose} = 75 \times 8
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Thorns} = 600
   \]

Thus, the total number of thorns on all the rose bushes is \( \boxed{600} \).
