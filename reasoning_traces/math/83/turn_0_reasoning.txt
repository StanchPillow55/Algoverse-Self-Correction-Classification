Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Paityn has 20 red hats and 24 blue hats, which totals to 20 + 24 = <<20+24=44>>44 hats.

Zola has 4/5 times the number of red hats that Paityn has, which is 4/5 * 20 = <<4/5*20=16>>16 red hats.

Zola also has twice the number of blue hats that Paityn has, which is 2 * 24 = <<2*24=48>>48 blue hats.

In total, Zola has 16 red hats + 48 blue hats = <<16+48=64>>64 hats.

When they combine all their hats, they have 44 hats (from Paityn) + 64 hats (from Zola) = <<44+64=108>>108 hats.

If they share the hats equally, each will get 108 hats / 2 = <<108/2=54>>54 hats.

So, each of them will get 54 hats.
