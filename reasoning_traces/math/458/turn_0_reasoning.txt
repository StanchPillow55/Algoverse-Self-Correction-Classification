==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of votes Marcy received based on the information given about the votes received by Barry and Joey.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Joey's Votes:**
   - We are told that Joey got 8 votes.

2. **Determine Barry's Votes:**
   - Barry got twice as many votes as 3 more than the number of votes Joey got.
   - First, calculate "3 more than the number of votes Joey got":
     \[
     3 + \text{Joey's votes} = 3 + 8 = 11
     \]
   - Barry got twice this amount:
     \[
     \text{Barry's votes} = 2 \times 11 = 22
     \]

3. **Determine Marcy's Votes:**
   - Marcy got three times as many votes as Barry.
   - Calculate Marcy's votes:
     \[
     \text{Marcy's votes} = 3 \times \text{Barry's votes} = 3 \times 22 = 66
     \]

Therefore, Marcy received 66 votes.

**Final Answer:**
Marcy got 66 votes.
