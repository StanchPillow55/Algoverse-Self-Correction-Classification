Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step and express the relationships between the votes received by Marcy, Barry, and Joey.

1. **Identify the number of votes Joey received:**
   - According to the problem, Joey got 8 votes.

2. **Calculate the number of votes Barry received:**
   - The problem states that Barry got twice as many votes as "3 more than the number of votes Joey got."
   - First, we find "3 more than the number of votes Joey got":
     \[
     \text{Votes Joey got} + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Now, Barry got twice that amount:
     \[
     \text{Votes Barry got} = 2 \times 11 = 22
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of votes Marcy received:**
   - The problem states that Marcy got three times as many votes as Barry:
     \[
     \text{Votes Marcy got} = 3 \times \text{Votes Barry got} = 3 \times 22 = 66
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the number of votes Marcy received is:
     \[
     \boxed{66}
     \] 

This step-by-step breakdown shows how we arrived at the final answer of 66 votes for Marcy.
