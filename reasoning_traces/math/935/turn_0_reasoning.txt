To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in one month.**
2. **Calculate the total revenue generated from selling those widgets.**
3. **Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of widgets produced

**For the Widgeteer 3000:**
- The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day for 30 days.

First, calculate the total hours in a month:
\[
\text{Total hours} = 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 720 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, calculate the total number of widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000:
\[
\text{Total widgets (Widgeteer 3000)} = 60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 720 \text{ hours} = 43200 \text{ widgets}
\]

**For the WidgetMaster 9000:**
- The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour.

Using the same total hours calculated above (720 hours):
\[
\text{Total widgets (WidgetMaster 9000)} = 45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 720 \text{ hours} = 32400 \text{ widgets}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue generated

**Revenue from the Widgeteer 3000:**
- Each widget sells for $6.
\[
\text{Revenue (Widgeteer 3000)} = 43200 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 259200 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000:**
\[
\text{Revenue (WidgetMaster 9000)} = 32400 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 194400 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Find the difference in revenue

Now, we will calculate how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[
\text{Difference in revenue} = \text{Revenue (Widgeteer 3000)} - \text{Revenue (WidgetMaster 9000)}
\]
\[
\text{Difference in revenue} = 259200 \text{ dollars} - 194400 \text{ dollars} = 64800 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Fern will make **$64,800** more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 if it runs 24 hours a day for a month with 30 days.
