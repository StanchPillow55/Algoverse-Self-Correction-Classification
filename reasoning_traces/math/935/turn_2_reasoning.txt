==================================================

To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.**
2. **Calculate the total revenue generated from selling those widgets.**
3. **Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of widgets produced

**Widgeteer 3000:**
- Production rate: 60 widgets/hour
- Operating hours per day: 24 hours
- Days in a month: 30 days

Total widgets produced by Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
\[
\text{Total widgets} = \text{Production rate} \times \text{Hours per day} \times \text{Days in a month}
\]
\[
\text{Total widgets} = 60 \, \text{widgets/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days}
\]
\[
\text{Total widgets} = 60 \times 24 \times 30
\]
Calculating this step-by-step:
\[
60 \times 24 = 1440
\]
\[
1440 \times 30 = 43200
\]
So, the Widgeteer 3000 produces **43,200 widgets** in a month.

**WidgetMaster 9000:**
- Production rate: 45 widgets/hour

Total widgets produced by WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
\[
\text{Total widgets} = 45 \, \text{widgets/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days}
\]
\[
\text{Total widgets} = 45 \times 24 \times 30
\]
Calculating this step-by-step:
\[
45 \times 24 = 1080
\]
\[
1080 \times 30 = 32400
\]
So, the WidgetMaster 9000 produces **32,400 widgets** in a month.

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue generated

**Revenue from Widgeteer 3000:**
\[
\text{Revenue} = \text{Total widgets} \times \text{Price per widget}
\]
\[
\text{Revenue} = 43200 \times 6
\]
Calculating this:
\[
43200 \times 6 = 259200
\]
So, the revenue from the Widgeteer 3000 is **$259,200**.

**Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000:**
\[
\text{Revenue} = 32400 \times 6
\]
Calculating this:
\[
32400 \times 6 = 194400
\]
So, the revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 is **$194,400**.

### Step 3: Find the difference in revenue

Now, we will find the difference in revenue between the two machines:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Revenue from Widgeteer 3000} - \text{Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 259200 - 194400
\]
Calculating this:
\[
259200 - 194400 = 64800
\]

### Final Answer
Fern will make **$64,800** more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 if it runs 24 hours a day for a month with 30 days.
