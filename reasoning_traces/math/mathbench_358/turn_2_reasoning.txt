==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 358," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only states "Sample math problem 358" without any specific details or context. Therefore, I will assume that this is a placeholder for a typical math problem, and I will create a sample problem based on the number 358.

Let's create a problem involving the number 358:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 358 and determine if the sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 358:**
   - The number 358 consists of the digits 3, 5, and 8.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(3 + 5 + 8\).

3. **Perform the addition:**
   \[
   3 + 5 = 8
   \]
   \[
   8 + 8 = 16
   \]
   - Therefore, the sum of the digits is 16.

4. **Determine if the sum (16) is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - Check the divisibility of 16:
     - 16 is divisible by 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.
     - Since 16 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The sum of the digits of 358 is 16, and 16 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of 358 is 16, and it is not a prime number.
