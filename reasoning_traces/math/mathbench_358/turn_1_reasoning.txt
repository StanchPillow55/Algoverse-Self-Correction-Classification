==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 358," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 358" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem in a textbook or a set of problems.

Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I will assume that "358" might refer to a math problem involving the number 358. Let's explore some possibilities of what a math problem involving the number 358 could be and solve it accordingly.

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations

1. **Addition Problem**: What is 358 + 642?
   - **Solution**: 
     \[
     358 + 642 = 1000
     \]
   - **Explanation**: We simply add the two numbers together.

2. **Subtraction Problem**: What is 1000 - 358?
   - **Solution**: 
     \[
     1000 - 358 = 642
     \]
   - **Explanation**: We subtract 358 from 1000.

3. **Multiplication Problem**: What is 358 \times 2?
   - **Solution**: 
     \[
     358 \times 2 = 716
     \]
   - **Explanation**: We multiply 358 by 2.

4. **Division Problem**: What is 358 \div 2?
   - **Solution**: 
     \[
     358 \div 2 = 179
     \]
   - **Explanation**: We divide 358 by 2.

### Possibility 2: Number Properties

1. **Prime Factorization**: What are the prime factors of 358?
   - **Solution**: 
     - 358 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.
     - Divide 358 by 2: 
       \[
       358 \div 2 = 179
       \]
     - Check if 179 is a prime number. It is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13 (all primes less than the square root of 179), so 179 is a prime number.
     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 358 is:
       \[
       358 = 2 \times 179
       \]

2. **Check if 358 is a Perfect Square**: Is 358 a perfect square?
   - **Solution**: 
     - Calculate the square root of 358:
       \[
       \sqrt{358} \approx 18.92
       \]
     - Since 18.92 is not an integer, 358 is not a perfect square.

### Possibility 3: Algebraic Problem

1. **Equation Involving 358**: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( x + 358 = 500 \).
   - **Solution**: 
     \[
     x + 358 = 500
     \]
     \[
     x = 500 - 358
     \]
     \[
     x = 142
     \]
   - **Explanation**: We isolate \( x \) by subtracting 358 from both sides.

### Conclusion

Without a specific problem statement, we explored various mathematical operations and properties involving the number 358. Each possibility was solved with detailed reasoning and calculations. If you have a specific problem in mind related to "Sample math problem 358," please provide more details so I can assist you further.
