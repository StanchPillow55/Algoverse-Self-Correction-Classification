==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 358," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 358" is not specific, and it doesn't provide any details or context about what the problem entails. Therefore, I will interpret this as a request to solve a generic math problem involving the number 358.

Let's consider a math problem involving the number 358. For example, let's find the prime factorization of 358.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Determine if 358 is divisible by 2:**
   - A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. The last digit of 358 is 8, which is even.
   - Divide 358 by 2: 
     \[
     358 \div 2 = 179
     \]
   - So, 358 can be expressed as \(2 \times 179\).

2. **Check if 179 is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.
   - To determine if 179 is prime, check divisibility by prime numbers less than the square root of 179.
   - The square root of 179 is approximately 13.38, so we check divisibility by prime numbers up to 13: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

3. **Check divisibility of 179:**
   - **Divisibility by 2:** 179 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - **Divisibility by 3:** Sum of digits of 179 is \(1 + 7 + 9 = 17\). Since 17 is not divisible by 3, 179 is not divisible by 3.
   - **Divisibility by 5:** 179 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
   - **Divisibility by 7:** Perform the division \(179 \div 7\):
     \[
     179 \div 7 \approx 25.57
     \]
     Since 25.57 is not an integer, 179 is not divisible by 7.
   - **Divisibility by 11:** Alternating sum of digits is \(1 - 7 + 9 = 3\). Since 3 is not divisible by 11, 179 is not divisible by 11.
   - **Divisibility by 13:** Perform the division \(179 \div 13\):
     \[
     179 \div 13 \approx 13.77
     \]
     Since 13.77 is not an integer, 179 is not divisible by 13.

Since 179 is not divisible by any prime numbers up to 13, 179 is a prime number.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The prime factorization of 358 is \(2 \times 179\).

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 358 is \(2 \times 179\).
