   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given data or conditions.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Determine the mathematical concepts involved (e.g., algebra, geometry, probability).
   - Consider possible strategies (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation, logical reasoning).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review and Check:**
   - Verify each step for accuracy.
   - Ensure the solution satisfies all conditions of the problem.
   - Double-check calculations and logic.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is twice as long as it is wide. If the perimeter of the field is 300 meters, what are the dimensions of the field?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the field.
   - The field is rectangular, and the length is twice the width.
   - The perimeter is 300 meters.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
   - Let the width be \( w \) meters. Then the length is \( 2w \) meters.
   - Substitute these into the perimeter formula.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Set up the equation: \( 2 \times (2w + w) = 300 \).
   - Simplify: \( 2 \times 3w = 300 \).
   - Further simplify: \( 6w = 300 \).
   - Solve for \( w \): \( w = \frac{300}{6} = 50 \).

   - Now find the length: \( \text{length} = 2w = 2 \times 50 = 100 \).

4. **Review and Check:**
   - Check the perimeter: \( 2 \times (100 + 50) = 2 \times 150 = 300 \), which matches the given perimeter.
   - The calculations are correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The width of the field is 50 meters, and the length is 100 meters.
