==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 52" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem by creating a hypothetical example and walking through the solution process.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 52" is a logical reasoning problem involving a sequence of numbers. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem Statement:**
Consider the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...
What is the 10th term in this sequence?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - Look at the given sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...
   - Notice that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2.
   - This is a geometric sequence where each term is twice the previous term.

2. **Define the Sequence:**
   - The first term \( a_1 = 2 \).
   - The common ratio \( r = 2 \).

3. **General Formula for the nth Term of a Geometric Sequence:**
   - The formula for the nth term \( a_n \) of a geometric sequence is given by:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 \times r^{(n-1)}
     \]
   - Here, \( a_1 = 2 \) and \( r = 2 \).

4. **Calculate the 10th Term:**
   - Substitute \( n = 10 \) into the formula:
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 2^{(10-1)}
     \]
   - Simplify the exponent:
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 2^9
     \]
   - Calculate \( 2^9 \):
     \[
     2^9 = 512
     \]
   - Multiply by the first term:
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 512 = 1024
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The 10th term in the sequence is 1024.

This step-by-step process demonstrates how to approach a reasoning problem involving sequences. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide additional details or context, and I would be happy to help!
