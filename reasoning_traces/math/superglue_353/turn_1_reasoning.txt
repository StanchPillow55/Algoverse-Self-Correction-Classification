==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to follow a structured approach. However, the problem statement "Sample reasoning question 353" is not clear or specific enough to provide a detailed solution. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that isn't fully described here. 

To proceed, let's assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. Each Type A widget requires 2 hours of labor and 3 units of material. Each Type B widget requires 1 hour of labor and 4 units of material. The company has a maximum of 100 hours of labor and 120 units of material available per week. If the profit from each Type A widget is $30 and from each Type B widget is $20, how many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Constraints:**
   - Labor Constraint: \( 2x + y \leq 100 \)
   - Material Constraint: \( 3x + 4y \leq 120 \)
   - Non-negativity Constraints: \( x \geq 0 \), \( y \geq 0 \)

3. **Objective Function:**
   - Maximize Profit: \( P = 30x + 20y \)

4. **Graphical Solution Method:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The line \( 2x + y = 100 \) intersects the axes at \( (50, 0) \) and \( (0, 100) \).
   - The line \( 3x + 4y = 120 \) intersects the axes at \( (40, 0) \) and \( (0, 30) \).

5. **Find Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible region is the area where all constraints overlap, including the non-negativity constraints.

6. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are where the constraint lines intersect each other and the axes. These points are:
     - \( (0, 0) \)
     - \( (0, 30) \)
     - \( (40, 0) \)
     - Intersection of \( 2x + y = 100 \) and \( 3x + 4y = 120 \).

7. **Solve for Intersection:**
   - Solve the system of equations:
     \[
     2x + y = 100
     \]
     \[
     3x + 4y = 120
     \]
   - Multiply the first equation by 4:
     \[
     8x + 4y = 400
     \]
   - Subtract the second equation from this result:
     \[
     8x + 4y - 3x - 4y = 400 - 120
     \]
     \[
     5x = 280 \implies x = 56
     \]
   - Substitute \( x = 56 \) back into the first equation:
     \[
     2(56) + y = 100 \implies 112 + y = 100 \implies y = -12
     \]
   - Since \( y \) cannot be negative, this intersection is not feasible.

8. **Evaluate Objective Function at Feasible Corner Points:**
   - \( (0, 0) \): \( P = 30(0) + 20(0) = 0 \)
   - \( (0, 30) \): \( P = 30(0) + 20(30) = 600 \)
   - \( (40, 0) \): \( P = 30(40) + 20(0) = 1200 \)

9. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum profit is $1200, achieved by producing 40 Type A widgets and 0 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 40 Type A widgets and 0 Type B widgets to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $1200.
