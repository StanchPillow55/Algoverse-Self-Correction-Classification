==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 353" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
A rectangular garden has a length that is 3 meters longer than its width. The perimeter of the garden is 30 meters. What are the dimensions of the garden?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the garden in meters.
   - Then the length of the garden is \( w + 3 \) meters.

2. **Perimeter of a Rectangle:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute the known values into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     30 = 2 \times ((w + 3) + w)
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms inside the parentheses:
     \[
     30 = 2 \times (2w + 3)
     \]

5. **Distribute the 2:**
   - Multiply through by 2:
     \[
     30 = 4w + 6
     \]

6. **Solve for \( w \):**
   - Subtract 6 from both sides to isolate the term with \( w \):
     \[
     24 = 4w
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = 6
     \]

7. **Find the Length:**
   - Substitute \( w = 6 \) back into the expression for the length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = w + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (9 + 6) = 2 \times 15 = 30
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The width of the garden is 6 meters, and the length is 9 meters.
