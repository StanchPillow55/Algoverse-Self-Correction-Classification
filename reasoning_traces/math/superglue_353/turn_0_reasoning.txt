==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 353" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning problem by creating a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem involves basic arithmetic and logical reasoning.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
You have a basket containing apples and oranges. The total number of fruits in the basket is 20. If the number of apples is twice the number of oranges, how many apples and oranges are there in the basket?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of oranges.
   - Since the number of apples is twice the number of oranges, the number of apples will be \( 2x \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of fruits (apples + oranges) is 20.
   - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     x + 2x = 20
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     3x = 20
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 3 to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{20}{3}
     \]

5. **Interpret the Result:**
   - Since \( x = \frac{20}{3} \) is not an integer, this indicates a logical inconsistency with the problem as stated. In a real-world scenario, the number of fruits should be a whole number. Let's re-evaluate the problem setup or assumptions.

6. **Re-evaluate the Problem:**
   - If the problem is intended to have integer solutions, there might be an error in the setup or assumptions. Let's assume the problem was meant to have a different total or relationship.

7. **Adjust the Problem for Integer Solution:**
   - Suppose the total number of fruits was 21 instead of 20. Let's solve it again:
     \[
     x + 2x = 21
     \]
     \[
     3x = 21
     \]
     \[
     x = 7
     \]

8. **Calculate the Number of Apples:**
   - If \( x = 7 \), then the number of oranges is 7.
   - The number of apples, being twice the number of oranges, is:
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 7 = 14
     \]

9. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Total fruits = apples + oranges = 14 + 7 = 21, which matches our adjusted total.

**Final Answer:**
- Number of oranges: 7
- Number of apples: 14

This example demonstrates how to approach a reasoning problem by defining variables, setting up equations, solving them, and verifying the solution. If the initial setup leads to a non-integer solution, reconsider the problem's assumptions or constraints.
