To solve the problem, we need to determine Marcy's annual pension after she quits her job after 30 years of service. 

1. **Understanding the Pension Plan**:
   - Marcy is entitled to an annual pension of $50,000 if she works for 40 years.
   - After 20 years of service, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension for each year worked beyond 20 years.

2. **Calculating Years Worked Beyond 20**:
   - Marcy works for a total of 30 years.
   - The number of years she worked beyond the initial 20 years is:
     \[
     30 - 20 = 10 \text{ years}
     \]

3. **Calculating the Additional Pension**:
   - For each of those 10 years beyond the 20-year mark, she earns an additional 5% of the pension.
   - The value of 5% of the pension is:
     \[
     0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500
     \]
   - Over the 10 years, the total additional pension she earns is:
     \[
     10 \times 2,500 = 25,000
     \]

4. **Calculating Total Annual Pension**:
   - Marcy's total annual pension after 30 years of service will be the base pension plus the additional amount earned from the years beyond 20:
     \[
     50,000 + 25,000 = 75,000
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after quitting her job after 30 years will be:
     \[
     \boxed{75,000}
     \]
