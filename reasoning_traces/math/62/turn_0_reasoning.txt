==================================================

First, let's find out how much oil is in the 10 cans that are each holding 8 liters. 

To do this, we multiply the number of cans (10) by the amount of oil each can is holding (8 liters). 

10 cans * 8 liters/can = 80 liters

So, there are 80 liters of oil in the 10 cans. 

Next, we need to find out how much oil is in the remaining cans. 

To do this, we subtract the amount of oil in the 10 cans (80 liters) from the total amount of oil (290 liters). 

290 liters - 80 liters = 210 liters

So, there are 210 liters of oil in the remaining cans. 

Finally, we need to find out how much oil is in each of the remaining cans. 

To do this, we divide the total amount of oil in the remaining cans (210 liters) by the number of remaining cans. 

Since there were 24 cans in total and 10 cans are accounted for, there are 24 cans - 10 cans = 14 cans remaining. 

210 liters / 14 cans = 15 liters/can

So, each of the remaining cans is holding 15 liters of oil. 

Final Answer: Each of the remaining cans is holding 15 liters of oil.
