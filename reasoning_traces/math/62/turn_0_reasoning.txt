To solve the problem, we need to determine how much oil is in the remaining cans after accounting for the oil in the 10 cans that each hold 8 liters.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of oil in the 10 cans.
Each of the 10 cans holds 8 liters of oil. Therefore, the total amount of oil in these 10 cans can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total oil in 10 cans} = \text{Number of cans} \times \text{Oil per can} = 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ liters}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of oil left for the remaining cans.
We know that the total amount of oil in all 24 cans is 290 liters. To find out how much oil is left for the remaining cans, we subtract the amount of oil in the 10 cans from the total amount of oil:

\[
\text{Oil in remaining cans} = \text{Total oil} - \text{Oil in 10 cans} = 290 - 80 = 210 \text{ liters}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the number of remaining cans.
Since there are 24 cans in total and 10 of them are already accounted for, the number of remaining cans is:

\[
\text{Remaining cans} = 24 - 10 = 14 \text{ cans}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the amount of oil in each of the remaining cans.
To find out how much oil is in each of the remaining 14 cans, we divide the total amount of oil in these cans by the number of cans:

\[
\text{Oil per remaining can} = \frac{\text{Oil in remaining cans}}{\text{Number of remaining cans}} = \frac{210}{14}
\]

Now, we perform the division:

\[
\frac{210}{14} = 15 \text{ liters}
\]

### Final Answer
Each of the remaining cans holds **15 liters** of oil.
