To solve the problem, we need to determine Marcy's annual pension after she quits her job after 30 years of service. The problem states that she is entitled to a pension of $50,000 per year after working for 40 years, but she quits after 30 years. Additionally, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension for each year after 20 years of service.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Determine the total years of service**: Marcy works for 30 years.

2. **Identify the pension entitlement**: 
   - After 40 years, she would receive $50,000 per year.
   - After 20 years, she starts to earn 5% of the pension value for each year of service beyond 20 years.

3. **Calculate the number of years after 20 years**: 
   - Since Marcy works for 30 years, the number of years after 20 years is:
     \[
     30 - 20 = 10 \text{ years}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total percentage of the pension she is entitled to**:
   - For each of the 10 years after 20 years, she earns 5% of the pension.
   - Therefore, the total percentage she earns is:
     \[
     10 \text{ years} \times 5\% = 50\%
     \]

5. **Calculate her annual pension based on this percentage**:
   - Since the full pension after 40 years is $50,000, we calculate 50% of this amount:
     \[
     50\% \text{ of } 50,000 = 0.50 \times 50,000 = 25,000
     \]

Thus, Marcy's annual pension after quitting her job after 30 years of service will be **$25,000**.

Final answer:
\[
\text{Marcy's annual pension after 30 years is } \boxed{25,000}.
\]
