To solve the problem, we need to determine Marcy's annual pension after she quits the company after 30 years of service. 

1. **Understanding the Pension Structure**:
   - Marcy's full pension after 40 years of service is $50,000 per year.
   - After 20 years of service, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension for each year of service beyond 20 years.

2. **Calculating the Years of Service**:
   - Marcy works for a total of 30 years.
   - The first 20 years do not contribute to the 5% entitlement.
   - The additional 10 years (from year 21 to year 30) will contribute to her pension.

3. **Calculating the 5% Entitlement**:
   - For each of the 10 years after the 20-year mark, Marcy earns 5% of the full pension.
   - The full pension is $50,000.
   - 5% of $50,000 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500
     \]
   - Therefore, for each of the 10 years after 20 years, Marcy earns an additional $2,500.

4. **Total Additional Pension from 10 Years**:
   - Since she earns $2,500 for each of the 10 years, we calculate the total additional amount:
     \[
     10 \times 2,500 = 25,000
     \]

5. **Calculating Total Annual Pension After 30 Years**:
   - Marcy's total annual pension after 30 years will be the sum of the base pension and the additional amount earned from the 10 years of entitlement:
     \[
     50,000 + 25,000 = 75,000
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after quitting the company after 30 years of service will be:
     \[
     \boxed{75,000}
     \]
