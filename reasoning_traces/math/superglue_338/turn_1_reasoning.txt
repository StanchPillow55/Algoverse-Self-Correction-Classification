Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 338" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

2. **Identify Given Values:**
   - Base (\(b\)) = 10 units
   - Height (\(h\)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   - Using the formula for the area of a triangle:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle using the given base and height. This methodical approach ensures that all calculations are clear and logical, leading to the correct solution.
