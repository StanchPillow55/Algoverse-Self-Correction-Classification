==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 338" might entail. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day. The profit from selling one Type A widget is $3, and the profit from selling one Type B widget is $5. The company wants to maximize its profit, but it must produce at least 20 Type A widgets and at least 10 Type B widgets each day. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize its profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up the Constraints:**
   - The total number of widgets produced cannot exceed 100:  
     \[
     x + y \leq 100
     \]
   - At least 20 Type A widgets must be produced:  
     \[
     x \geq 20
     \]
   - At least 10 Type B widgets must be produced:  
     \[
     y \geq 10
     \]

3. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) to be maximized is:  
     \[
     P = 3x + 5y
     \]

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the inequalities on a coordinate plane:
     - \( x + y = 100 \) is a line with intercepts at (100, 0) and (0, 100).
     - \( x = 20 \) is a vertical line.
     - \( y = 10 \) is a horizontal line.

5. **Identify the Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible region is the area where all constraints overlap. It is bounded by the lines \( x = 20 \), \( y = 10 \), and \( x + y = 100 \).

6. **Find the Vertices of the Feasible Region:**
   - The vertices are points where the constraint lines intersect:
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( y = 10 \): (20, 10)
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( x + y = 100 \): (20, 80)
     - Intersection of \( y = 10 \) and \( x + y = 100 \): (90, 10)

7. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - \( P(20, 10) = 3(20) + 5(10) = 60 + 50 = 110 \)
   - \( P(20, 80) = 3(20) + 5(80) = 60 + 400 = 460 \)
   - \( P(90, 10) = 3(90) + 5(10) = 270 + 50 = 320 \)

8. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the vertex (20, 80) with a profit of $460.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 20 Type A widgets and 80 Type B widgets per day, resulting in a maximum profit of $460.
