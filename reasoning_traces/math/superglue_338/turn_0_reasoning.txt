==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 338" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $5, and the profit from each unit of product B is $8. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per week. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 150 units per week. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we will use linear programming, a method to achieve the best outcome in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - We want to maximize the profit, \( P \).
   - The profit from product A is $5 per unit, and from product B is $8 per unit.
   - Therefore, the objective function is: 
     \[
     P = 5x + 8y
     \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production of product A cannot exceed 100 units: 
     \[
     x \leq 100
     \]
   - The production of product B cannot exceed 80 units:
     \[
     y \leq 80
     \]
   - The total production cannot exceed 150 units:
     \[
     x + y \leq 150
     \]
   - Non-negativity constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is the area where all constraints overlap.

5. **Find the Corner Points:**
   - Solve the system of equations to find the intersection points (corner points) of the feasible region.
   - Intersection of \( x + y = 150 \) and \( x = 100 \):
     \[
     100 + y = 150 \implies y = 50
     \]
     So, one corner point is \( (100, 50) \).
   - Intersection of \( x + y = 150 \) and \( y = 80 \):
     \[
     x + 80 = 150 \implies x = 70
     \]
     So, another corner point is \( (70, 80) \).
   - The other corner points are \( (0, 0) \), \( (100, 0) \), and \( (0, 80) \).

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = 0 \)
   - \( P(100, 0) = 5(100) + 8(0) = 500 \)
   - \( P(0, 80) = 5(0) + 8(80) = 640 \)
   - \( P(100, 50) = 5(100) + 8(50) = 900 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 5(70) + 8(80) = 990 \)

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum profit is $990, which occurs at the point \( (70, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 70 units of product A and 80 units of product B to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $990.
