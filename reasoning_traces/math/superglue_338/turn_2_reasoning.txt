==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 338" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving math problems by breaking down the process into clear steps. Let's assume this is a typical math problem involving algebra or arithmetic.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what is unknown.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Looking for patterns.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your calculations.
   - Ensure the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Double-check your final answer.

### Example Problem:

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 338" is a simple algebra problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- We can solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation.

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
- Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

#### Step 4: Check Your Work
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This structured approach ensures that we thoroughly understand and solve the problem, providing a clear and logical solution. If you have a specific problem or context for "Sample reasoning question 338," please provide more details for a tailored solution.
