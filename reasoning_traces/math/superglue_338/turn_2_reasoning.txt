==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 338" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, let's assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A store sells pens at $1.50 each and notebooks at $2.50 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 items and spends $22.50, how many pens and how many notebooks did the customer buy?

**Step 1: Define Variables**  
Let \( p \) be the number of pens and \( n \) be the number of notebooks.

**Step 2: Set Up Equations**  
We have two pieces of information that can be translated into equations:
1. The total number of items bought is 10.
   \[
   p + n = 10
   \]
2. The total cost of the items is $22.50.
   \[
   1.50p + 2.50n = 22.50
   \]

**Step 3: Solve the System of Equations**  
We have the system of equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
1. & \quad p + n = 10 \\
2. & \quad 1.50p + 2.50n = 22.50
\end{align*}
\]

First, solve equation 1 for \( p \):
\[
p = 10 - n
\]

Substitute \( p = 10 - n \) into equation 2:
\[
1.50(10 - n) + 2.50n = 22.50
\]

Distribute the 1.50:
\[
15 - 1.50n + 2.50n = 22.50
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
15 + 1.00n = 22.50
\]

Subtract 15 from both sides:
\[
1.00n = 7.50
\]

Divide by 1.00:
\[
n = 7.5
\]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number (you can't buy half a notebook), let's re-evaluate our steps. It seems there might be a mistake in our assumptions or calculations. Let's try solving it again:

Re-evaluate the equation:
\[
1.50(10 - n) + 2.50n = 22.50
\]

Distribute:
\[
15 - 1.50n + 2.50n = 22.50
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
15 + 1.00n = 22.50
\]

Subtract 15 from both sides:
\[
1.00n = 7.50
\]

Divide by 1.00:
\[
n = 7.5
\]

Upon re-evaluation, the mistake persists. Let's check the initial assumptions or constraints. If the problem constraints allow for fractional items, then \( n = 7.5 \) is correct. However, typically such problems assume whole numbers.

**Step 4: Check for Errors or Reinterpretation**  
If the problem constraints are strict on whole numbers, then there might be an error in the problem setup or assumptions. Let's assume the problem allows for fractional purchases:

**Final Answer:**  
The customer bought 2.5 pens and 7.5 notebooks.

If this interpretation is incorrect due to problem constraints, please provide additional context or constraints for a more accurate solution.
