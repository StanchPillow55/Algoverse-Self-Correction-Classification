To solve this problem, we need to determine how many friends attended the wedding reception.

First, let's break down the information given:

1. The total number of people at the wedding reception is 180.

2. The bride invited 20 couples from her side of the family.

3. The groom also invited 20 couples from his side of the family.

Since each couple consists of 2 people, we can calculate the total number of family members invited by both the bride and the groom.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of family members invited by the bride.**

The bride invited 20 couples. Since each couple consists of 2 people, the number of people invited by the bride is:
\[ 20 \text{ couples} \times 2 \text{ people per couple} = 40 \text{ people} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of family members invited by the groom.**

Similarly, the groom invited 20 couples. Therefore, the number of people invited by the groom is:
\[ 20 \text{ couples} \times 2 \text{ people per couple} = 40 \text{ people} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of family members invited by both the bride and the groom.**

Add the number of people invited by the bride and the groom:
\[ 40 \text{ people (bride's side)} + 40 \text{ people (groom's side)} = 80 \text{ people} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of friends who attended the reception.**

Subtract the total number of family members from the total number of people at the reception to find the number of friends:
\[ 180 \text{ total people} - 80 \text{ family members} = 100 \text{ friends} \]

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the reception is 100.

**Final Answer:**
100 friends attended the reception.
