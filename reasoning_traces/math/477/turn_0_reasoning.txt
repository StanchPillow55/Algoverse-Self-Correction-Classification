==================================================

To solve the problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens (dairy or peanuts) and then subtract that from the total number of kids in the class to find out how many are not allergic to anything.

1. **Identify the sets:**
   - Let \( A \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
   - Let \( B \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

   From the problem, we have:
   - \( |A| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
   - \( |B| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
   - \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

2. **Use the inclusion-exclusion principle:**
   The number of kids allergic to at least one of the allergens (either dairy or peanuts) can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
   \]
   This means there are 12 kids who are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

3. **Calculate the number of kids not allergic to anything:**
   We know the total number of kids in the class is 32. To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids who are allergic to at least one allergen from the total number of kids:
   \[
   \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = \text{Total kids} - |A \cup B|
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the number of kids in Gina's class who aren't allergic to anything is \( \boxed{20} \).
