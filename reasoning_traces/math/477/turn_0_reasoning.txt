To solve the problem, we need to determine how many friends attended the wedding reception given the total number of guests and the number of family members invited.

1. **Identify the total number of guests**: 
   The total number of people at the wedding reception is given as 180.

2. **Determine the number of family members invited**:
   The bride and groom each invited 20 couples from their side of the family. Since a couple consists of 2 people, we can calculate the total number of family members invited as follows:

   - Each couple consists of 2 people.
   - The bride invited 20 couples, which means she invited:
     \[
     20 \text{ couples} \times 2 \text{ people/couple} = 40 \text{ people}
     \]
   - The groom also invited 20 couples, which means he invited:
     \[
     20 \text{ couples} \times 2 \text{ people/couple} = 40 \text{ people}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of family members invited is:
     \[
     40 \text{ (bride's side)} + 40 \text{ (groom's side)} = 80 \text{ family members}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of friends**:
   To find out how many friends attended the reception, we subtract the total number of family members from the total number of guests:
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \text{Total guests} - \text{Total family members}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = 180 - 80 = 100
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the number of friends who attended the reception is:
   \[
   \boxed{100}
   \]
