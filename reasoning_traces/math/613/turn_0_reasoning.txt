==================================================

To find the total number of posts that the Reddit group will have in March, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of members**: The problem states that there are 1000 members in the group.

2. **Determine the average number of posts per member per day**: Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day.

3. **Calculate the total number of posts per day for the group**:
   - Since each of the 1000 members posts 3 times a day, we can calculate the total posts per day by multiplying the number of members by the average posts per member:
   \[
   \text{Total posts per day} = \text{Number of members} \times \text{Average posts per member per day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total posts per day} = 1000 \times 3 = 3000
   \]

4. **Determine the number of days in March**: March has 31 days.

5. **Calculate the total number of posts in March**:
   - To find the total posts for the entire month, we multiply the total posts per day by the number of days in March:
   \[
   \text{Total posts in March} = \text{Total posts per day} \times \text{Number of days in March}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total posts in March} = 3000 \times 31 = 93000
   \]

6. **Final answer**: The total number of posts that the group will have in March is:
\[
\boxed{93000}
\]
