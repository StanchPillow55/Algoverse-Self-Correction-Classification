==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 125," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 125" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact nature of the problem. Therefore, I will assume that "125" refers to a mathematical problem involving the number 125. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic with 125
If the problem is simply about performing arithmetic operations with the number 125, we can explore some basic calculations:

1. **Addition**: 
   \[
   125 + 75 = 200
   \]

2. **Subtraction**:
   \[
   125 - 25 = 100
   \]

3. **Multiplication**:
   \[
   125 \times 2 = 250
   \]

4. **Division**:
   \[
   125 \div 5 = 25
   \]

### Possibility 2: Prime Factorization of 125
If the problem involves finding the prime factors of 125, we proceed as follows:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - 125 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - The sum of the digits of 125 is \(1 + 2 + 5 = 8\), which is not divisible by 3, so 125 is not divisible by 3.
   - 125 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.
   - Dividing 125 by 5 gives:
     \[
     125 \div 5 = 25
     \]
   - 25 is also divisible by 5:
     \[
     25 \div 5 = 5
     \]
   - Finally, 5 is a prime number.

   Therefore, the prime factorization of 125 is:
   \[
   125 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 5^3
   \]

### Possibility 3: Solving an Equation Involving 125
If the problem involves solving an equation where 125 is a part of the equation, let's consider a simple equation:

1. **Equation**:
   \[
   x + 125 = 200
   \]
   - To solve for \(x\), subtract 125 from both sides:
     \[
     x = 200 - 125 = 75
     \]

### Conclusion
Without a specific problem statement, we explored several mathematical operations and concepts involving the number 125. If the problem was indeed about the prime factorization of 125, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{5^3}
\]

If the problem was about solving an equation like \(x + 125 = 200\), the solution for \(x\) is:

\[
\boxed{75}
\]

If you have a specific problem involving the number 125, please provide more details so I can assist you further.
