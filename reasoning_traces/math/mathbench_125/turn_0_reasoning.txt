To solve the problem "Sample math problem 125," I need more specific information about what the problem entails. Since "Sample math problem 125" is not descriptive enough, I'll assume you want me to solve a problem involving the number 125. Let's consider a few different mathematical problems involving 125 and solve them step by step.

### Problem 1: Find the square root of 125.

**Step 1: Estimate the square root.**

The square root of 125 is between the square roots of 121 and 144 because \(121 = 11^2\) and \(144 = 12^2\). Therefore, \(\sqrt{125}\) is between 11 and 12.

**Step 2: Use a more precise method.**

To find a more precise value, we can use the method of averaging:

1. Take an initial guess, say 11.5.
2. Divide 125 by this guess: \( \frac{125}{11.5} \approx 10.8696 \).
3. Average the result with the guess: \( \frac{11.5 + 10.8696}{2} \approx 11.1848 \).

Repeat the process with the new guess:

1. Divide 125 by 11.1848: \( \frac{125}{11.1848} \approx 11.1732 \).
2. Average the result with the guess: \( \frac{11.1848 + 11.1732}{2} \approx 11.179 \).

This process can be repeated to get a more accurate result, but \(\sqrt{125} \approx 11.18\).

**Final Answer:**
The square root of 125 is approximately 11.18.

### Problem 2: Express 125 as a product of prime factors.

**Step 1: Start with the smallest prime number, 2.**

125 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.

**Step 2: Try the next smallest prime number, 3.**

The sum of the digits of 125 is \(1 + 2 + 5 = 8\), which is not divisible by 3. So, 125 is not divisible by 3.

**Step 3: Try the next smallest prime number, 5.**

125 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5. Divide 125 by 5:

\[ 125 \div 5 = 25 \]

25 is also divisible by 5:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

And 5 is a prime number.

**Step 4: Write the prime factorization.**

125 can be expressed as a product of prime factors:

\[ 125 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 5^3 \]

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 125 is \(5^3\).

### Problem 3: Calculate \(125^2\).

**Step 1: Use the formula for squaring a number.**

\[ 125^2 = (100 + 25)^2 \]

**Step 2: Expand using the binomial theorem.**

\[ (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \]

Let \(a = 100\) and \(b = 25\):

\[ 125^2 = 100^2 + 2 \times 100 \times 25 + 25^2 \]

**Step 3: Calculate each term.**

- \(100^2 = 10000\)
- \(2 \times 100 \times 25 = 5000\)
- \(25^2 = 625\)

**Step 4: Add the results.**

\[ 125^2 = 10000 + 5000 + 625 = 15625 \]

**Final Answer:**
The square of 125 is 15625.

These are a few different mathematical problems involving the number 125. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details, and I can solve that particular problem for you.
