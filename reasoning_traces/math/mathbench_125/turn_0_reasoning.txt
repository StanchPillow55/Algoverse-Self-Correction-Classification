==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 125," we first need to clarify what the problem is asking. Since "Sample math problem 125" is not a standard problem statement, I'll assume you want to solve the mathematical expression \(125\) in some context. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Simplifying the Number 125

If the task is to simplify or factor the number 125, we can express it in terms of its prime factors.

1. **Prime Factorization of 125:**
   - 125 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - The sum of the digits of 125 is \(1 + 2 + 5 = 8\), which is not divisible by 3, so 125 is not divisible by 3.
   - The last digit of 125 is 5, so it is divisible by 5.
   - Divide 125 by 5: 
     \[
     125 \div 5 = 25
     \]
   - 25 is also divisible by 5:
     \[
     25 \div 5 = 5
     \]
   - Finally, 5 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 125 is:
\[
125 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 5^3
\]

### Possibility 2: Solving an Equation Involving 125

If the problem involves solving an equation like \(x = 125\), then the solution is straightforward:
- The value of \(x\) is simply 125.

### Possibility 3: Calculating a Power or Root of 125

If the problem involves calculating a power or root of 125, let's consider an example:
- **Square Root of 125:**
  \[
  \sqrt{125} = \sqrt{5^3} = \sqrt{5 \times 25} = \sqrt{25 \times 5} = 5\sqrt{5}
  \]

### Possibility 4: Solving a Word Problem Involving 125

If 125 is part of a word problem, more context is needed to provide a solution. However, without additional information, we can't proceed with this possibility.

### Conclusion

Without additional context, the most straightforward interpretation is the prime factorization of 125. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
125 = 5^3
\]
