Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 310" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I will assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 7 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**

The given equation is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). The goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

- Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[
2x + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x = 4
\]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**

Now, we have \( 2x = 4 \). To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 2:

\[
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{4}{2}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 2
\]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 2 \) back into the original equation:

\[
2(2) + 3 = 7
\]

Calculate the left side:

\[
4 + 3 = 7
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 7 \) is \( x = 2 \).
