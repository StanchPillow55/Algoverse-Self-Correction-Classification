==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 310" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to solve a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 310." Let's assume it's a typical algebra problem involving solving for \( x \).

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 10 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

   Start by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides of the equation to move the \( x \)-terms to one side:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 10 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Next, subtract 5 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 10 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 2(5) + 10
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 10 + 10
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 10 \) is \( x = 5 \).
