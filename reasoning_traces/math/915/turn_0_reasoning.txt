==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the hours Bruce works each day and then summing them up.

1. **Calculate the hours Bruce works on Tuesday:**
   - According to the problem, Bruce works for 5 hours on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Hours on Tuesday} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the hours Bruce works on Wednesday:**
   - The problem states that on Wednesday, Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Hours on Wednesday} = 2 \times \text{Hours on Tuesday} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the hours Bruce works on Thursday:**
   - On Thursday, Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. We calculate:
   \[
   \text{Hours on Thursday} = \text{Hours on Wednesday} - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total hours Bruce works over the three days:**
   - Now we sum the hours worked on each day:
   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = \text{Hours on Tuesday} + \text{Hours on Wednesday} + \text{Hours on Thursday}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = 5 + 10 + 8
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = 23 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days is \( \boxed{23} \).
