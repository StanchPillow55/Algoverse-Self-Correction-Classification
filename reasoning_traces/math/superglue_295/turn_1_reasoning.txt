==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 295" might entail. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a typical math problem that requires logical reasoning and calculations. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day. The profit from selling one Type A widget is $5, and the profit from selling one Type B widget is $7. The company must produce at least 20 Type A widgets and at least 30 Type B widgets each day. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Constraints:**
   - The total production constraint: \( x + y \leq 100 \).
   - The minimum production constraints: \( x \geq 20 \) and \( y \geq 30 \).

3. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function to maximize is \( P = 5x + 7y \).

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the line \( x + y = 100 \).
   - Shade the region below this line, as it represents \( x + y \leq 100 \).
   - Plot the vertical line \( x = 20 \) and shade the region to the right.
   - Plot the horizontal line \( y = 30 \) and shade the region above.
   - The feasible region is the intersection of all these shaded areas.

5. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The feasible region is a polygon, and the maximum profit will occur at one of its vertices.
   - Find the vertices by solving the system of equations formed by the intersecting lines:
     - Intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( x = 20 \): 
       \[
       20 + y = 100 \implies y = 80
       \]
       Vertex: \( (20, 80) \).
     - Intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( y = 30 \):
       \[
       x + 30 = 100 \implies x = 70
       \]
       Vertex: \( (70, 30) \).
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( y = 30 \):
       Vertex: \( (20, 30) \).

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - At \( (20, 80) \): 
     \[
     P = 5(20) + 7(80) = 100 + 560 = 660
     \]
   - At \( (70, 30) \): 
     \[
     P = 5(70) + 7(30) = 350 + 210 = 560
     \]
   - At \( (20, 30) \): 
     \[
     P = 5(20) + 7(30) = 100 + 210 = 310
     \]

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit of $660 occurs at the vertex \( (20, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 20 Type A widgets and 80 Type B widgets per day, resulting in a maximum profit of $660.
