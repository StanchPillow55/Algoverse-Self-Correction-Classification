==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 295" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem or a known question, I'll need to make some assumptions or create a hypothetical problem to solve. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 295" is a math problem involving basic arithmetic or algebra. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 5.

This is a complete solution to the hypothetical problem based on the assumption made about "Sample reasoning question 295." If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more details, and I can adjust the solution accordingly.
