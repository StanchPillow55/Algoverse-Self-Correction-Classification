To determine how much Jackson spends on champagne for the hot tub, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert the hot tub capacity from gallons to quarts.**
   - The hot tub holds 40 gallons.
   - Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert gallons to quarts by multiplying:
     \[
     40 \text{ gallons} \times 4 \text{ quarts/gallon} = 160 \text{ quarts}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of bottles of champagne needed.**
   - Each bottle of champagne holds 1 quart.
   - Therefore, Jackson needs 160 bottles of champagne to fill the hot tub.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the champagne without the discount.**
   - Each bottle costs $50.
   - The total cost without any discount is:
     \[
     160 \text{ bottles} \times 50 \text{ dollars/bottle} = 8000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the volume discount.**
   - Jackson receives a 20% discount on the total volume of champagne.
   - To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of the total cost:
     \[
     \text{Discount} = 0.20 \times 8000 \text{ dollars} = 1600 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the final cost after applying the discount.**
   - We subtract the discount from the total cost:
     \[
     \text{Final Cost} = 8000 \text{ dollars} - 1600 \text{ dollars} = 6400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Jackson spends on champagne is:

\[
\boxed{6400 \text{ dollars}}
\]
