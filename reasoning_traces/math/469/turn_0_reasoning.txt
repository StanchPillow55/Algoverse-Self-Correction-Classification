==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bottles of champagne Jackson needs to fill the hot tub and then calculate the total cost after applying the discount.

### Step 1: Convert the hot tub capacity from gallons to quarts

The hot tub holds 40 gallons of liquid. Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert gallons to quarts as follows:

\[
40 \text{ gallons} \times 4 \text{ quarts/gallon} = 160 \text{ quarts}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of bottles needed

Each bottle of champagne holds 1 quart. Therefore, to fill 160 quarts, Jackson needs:

\[
160 \text{ quarts} \times \frac{1 \text{ bottle}}{1 \text{ quart}} = 160 \text{ bottles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost before the discount

Each bottle costs $50. Therefore, the total cost for 160 bottles before any discount is applied is:

\[
160 \text{ bottles} \times 50 \text{ dollars/bottle} = 8000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Apply the 20% volume discount

Jackson receives a 20% discount on the total cost. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $8000:

\[
0.20 \times 8000 \text{ dollars} = 1600 \text{ dollars}
\]

Subtract the discount from the original total cost to find the final cost:

\[
8000 \text{ dollars} - 1600 \text{ dollars} = 6400 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Jackson spends $6400 on champagne to fill the hot tub.
