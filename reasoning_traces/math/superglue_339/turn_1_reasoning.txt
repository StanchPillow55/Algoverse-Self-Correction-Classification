Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 339" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires a structured approach to solve. Let's break down a typical math problem-solving process:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.
   - Recognize any constraints or conditions.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution satisfies all conditions of the problem.
   - Ensure the answer is reasonable and correctly addresses the question.

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 339," I'll illustrate this process with a generic example problem:

**Example Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
- Given: Perimeter = 36 units, Length = 2 Ã— Width.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \).
- Substitute the given relationship between length and width into the formula.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Let the width be \( w \).
- Then the length is \( 2w \).
- Substitute into the perimeter formula:
  \[
  36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
  \]
  \[
  36 = 2 \times 3w
  \]
  \[
  36 = 6w
  \]
  \[
  w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, the width is 6 units.
- The length is \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) units.

**Step 4: Review/Check the Solution**
- Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
  \[
  P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36 \text{ units}
  \]
- The solution satisfies the given condition.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are 12 units (length) and 6 units (width).

This structured approach can be applied to solve "Sample reasoning question 339" once the specific details of the problem are known.
