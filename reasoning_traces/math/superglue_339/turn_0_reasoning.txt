==================================================

To solve this problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 339." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by solving an example problem step by step.

**Example Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   - We have the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To isolate \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation.
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, we need to isolate \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient 2.
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Calculate the left side:
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or question number in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that problem for you.
