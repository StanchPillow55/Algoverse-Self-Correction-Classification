==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about what "Sample reasoning question 339" entails. Since the question is not specified, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by solving a sample problem. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 36 units, so:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 36
     \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for L:**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute this into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(2W) + 2W = 36
     \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the left side of the equation:
     \[
     4W + 2W = 36
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     6W = 36
     \]

6. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]

7. **Find the Length L:**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute the value of W:
     \[
     L = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 12 units

This is a complete solution to the assumed problem, demonstrating the process of solving a math problem step-by-step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that problem instead.
