==================================================

To determine how much money Phillip has left after his purchases, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total amount of money Phillip started with.**
   Phillip's mother gave him $95.

2. **List the amounts spent on each item.**
   - Oranges: $14
   - Apples: $25
   - Candy: $6

3. **Calculate the total amount spent.**
   We will add the amounts spent on oranges, apples, and candy together:

   \[
   \text{Total spent} = \text{Cost of oranges} + \text{Cost of apples} + \text{Cost of candy}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Total spent} = 14 + 25 + 6
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition step-by-step:

   - First, add the cost of oranges and apples:
     \[
     14 + 25 = 39
     \]

   - Next, add the cost of candy:
     \[
     39 + 6 = 45
     \]

   Therefore, the total amount spent is $45.

4. **Calculate the remaining amount of money.**
   To find out how much money Phillip has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount he had:

   \[
   \text{Money left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total spent}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Money left} = 95 - 45
   \]

   Now, we perform the subtraction:

   \[
   95 - 45 = 50
   \]

5. **State the final answer.**
   Phillip has $50 left after his purchases.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]
