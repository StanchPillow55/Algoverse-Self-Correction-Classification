==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Phillip has left after spending some of it at the supermarket. We will do this by following these steps:

1. **Identify the total amount of money Phillip started with:**
   Phillip's mother gave him $95.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Phillip spent:**
   - He spent $14 on oranges.
   - He spent $25 on apples.
   - He spent $6 on candy.

   To find the total amount spent, we add these amounts together:
   \[
   14 + 25 + 6 = 45
   \]

3. **Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:**
   Phillip started with $95 and spent $45. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total spent from the initial amount:
   \[
   95 - 45 = 50
   \]

Therefore, after spending money on oranges, apples, and candy, Phillip has $50 left.

**Final Answer:**
Phillip has $50 left.
