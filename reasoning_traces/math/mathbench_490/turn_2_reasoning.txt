==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 490" refers to. Since no specific details or context about this problem are provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 490 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Determine whether the number 490 is a prime number, and if not, find its prime factorization.

**Step 1: Check if 490 is a prime number.**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To determine if 490 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and 490.

**Step 2: Check divisibility by smaller prime numbers.**

- **Divisibility by 2:** A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. The last digit of 490 is 0, which is even. Therefore, 490 is divisible by 2.

Since 490 is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number. We can now proceed to find its prime factorization.

**Step 3: Prime factorization of 490.**

1. **Divide by 2:**
   \[
   490 \div 2 = 245
   \]
   So, 490 = 2 × 245.

2. **Check divisibility of 245 by the next smallest prime number, which is 3:**
   - Sum of the digits of 245 is \(2 + 4 + 5 = 11\). Since 11 is not divisible by 3, 245 is not divisible by 3.

3. **Check divisibility by 5:** A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. The last digit of 245 is 5, so it is divisible by 5.
   \[
   245 \div 5 = 49
   \]
   So, 245 = 5 × 49.

4. **Check divisibility of 49 by the next smallest prime number, which is 7:**
   - 49 is a perfect square of 7, as \(7 \times 7 = 49\).

Therefore, the prime factorization of 490 is:
\[
490 = 2 \times 5 \times 7 \times 7
\]
or, equivalently,
\[
490 = 2 \times 5 \times 7^2
\]

**Final Answer:**
The number 490 is not a prime number. Its prime factorization is \(2 \times 5 \times 7^2\).
