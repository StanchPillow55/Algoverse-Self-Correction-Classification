==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 490" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem that might be labeled as such. Let's consider a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled "490" and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem 490:
**Problem Statement:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 490.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Range of Even Numbers:**
   - The even numbers between 1 and 490 start from 2 and end at 490.
   - Even numbers can be expressed in the form \(2n\), where \(n\) is an integer.

2. **Determine the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers from 2 to 490 is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 490.
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1 = 2\) and the common difference \(d = 2\).

3. **Find the Number of Terms in the Sequence:**
   - The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Set \(a_n = 490\) to find the number of terms:
     \[
     490 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     490 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     490 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{490}{2} = 245
     \]
   - There are 245 even numbers from 2 to 490.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{245} = \frac{245}{2} \cdot (2 + 490)
     \]
     \[
     S_{245} = \frac{245}{2} \cdot 492
     \]
     \[
     S_{245} = 245 \cdot 246
     \]

5. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - Calculate \(245 \times 246\):
     \[
     245 \times 246 = 245 \times (250 - 4)
     \]
     \[
     = 245 \times 250 - 245 \times 4
     \]
     \[
     = 61250 - 980
     \]
     \[
     = 60270
     \]

### Final Answer:
The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 490 is \(60,270\).
