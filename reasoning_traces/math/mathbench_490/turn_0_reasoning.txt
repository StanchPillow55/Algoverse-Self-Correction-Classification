==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample math problem 490" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem based on the number 490 and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Find the prime factorization of 490 and determine the sum of its prime factors."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Prime Factorization of 490:**
   - Start by dividing 490 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
   - \( 490 \div 2 = 245 \)
   - 2 is a prime factor of 490.

2. **Factor 245:**
   - 245 is not divisible by 2 (since it's odd), so try the next smallest prime number, which is 3.
   - Sum of digits of 245 is \( 2 + 4 + 5 = 11 \), which is not divisible by 3, so 245 is not divisible by 3.
   - Try the next smallest prime number, which is 5.
   - The last digit of 245 is 5, so it is divisible by 5.
   - \( 245 \div 5 = 49 \)
   - 5 is a prime factor of 490.

3. **Factor 49:**
   - 49 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.
   - Try the next smallest prime number, which is 7.
   - \( 49 \div 7 = 7 \)
   - 7 is a prime factor of 490, and since \( 7 \div 7 = 1 \), we have completed the factorization.

4. **Prime Factorization Result:**
   - The prime factorization of 490 is \( 2 \times 5 \times 7 \times 7 \) or \( 2 \times 5 \times 7^2 \).

5. **Sum of Prime Factors:**
   - The distinct prime factors of 490 are 2, 5, and 7.
   - Sum these prime factors: \( 2 + 5 + 7 = 14 \).

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the distinct prime factors of 490 is 14.
