To solve the problem, we need to determine how many gnomes are in the fifth house given the information about the first four houses and the total number of gnomes.

1. **Identify the number of gnomes in the first four houses**:
   Each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of gnomes in these four houses as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total gnomes in the first four houses} = 4 \text{ houses} \times 3 \text{ gnomes/house} = 12 \text{ gnomes}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of gnomes on the street**:
   According to the problem, the total number of gnomes on the street is 20.

3. **Calculate the number of gnomes in the fifth house**:
   To find out how many gnomes are in the fifth house, we subtract the total number of gnomes in the first four houses from the total number of gnomes on the street:

   \[
   \text{Gnomes in the fifth house} = \text{Total gnomes on the street} - \text{Total gnomes in the first four houses}
   \]

   Plugging in the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Gnomes in the fifth house} = 20 \text{ gnomes} - 12 \text{ gnomes} = 8 \text{ gnomes}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the number of gnomes in the fifth house is 

   \[
   \boxed{8}
   \]
