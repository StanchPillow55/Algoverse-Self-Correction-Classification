==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops during his 60-mile bike trip.

1. **Identify the first stop:**
   - Henry made his first stop after traveling 20 miles. 

2. **Identify the second stop:**
   - The trip is 60 miles long, and Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. 
   - To find out where the second stop is, we can subtract 15 miles from the total distance:
     \[
     60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Therefore, Henry made his second stop after traveling 45 miles.

3. **Calculate the distance traveled between the first and second stops:**
   - Now we need to find the distance between the first stop (20 miles) and the second stop (45 miles). We do this by subtracting the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop:
     \[
     45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{25} \text{ miles}
\]
