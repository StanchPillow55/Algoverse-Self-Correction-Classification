Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by calculating the total number of gnomes in the first four houses. Since each of these houses has 3 gnomes, we multiply the number of houses (4) by the number of gnomes per house (3). 

4 houses * 3 gnomes/house = 12 gnomes

Next, we need to find out how many gnomes are in the fifth house. We know that there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street. If we subtract the number of gnomes in the first four houses (12) from the total number of gnomes (20), we can find out how many gnomes are in the fifth house.

20 gnomes - 12 gnomes = 8 gnomes

So, the fifth house has 8 gnomes.
