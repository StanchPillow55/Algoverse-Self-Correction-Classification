Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many gnomes are at the fifth house, given the information about the total number of gnomes and the distribution at the first four houses.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of gnomes at the first four houses.**

Each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of gnomes at these houses by multiplying the number of houses by the number of gnomes per house:

\[
\text{Total gnomes at first four houses} = 4 \times 3 = 12
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of gnomes on the street.**

We are given that there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of gnomes at the fifth house.**

To find the number of gnomes at the fifth house, we subtract the total number of gnomes at the first four houses from the total number of gnomes on the street:

\[
\text{Gnomes at fifth house} = \text{Total gnomes on street} - \text{Total gnomes at first four houses}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Gnomes at fifth house} = 20 - 12 = 8
\]

**Conclusion:**

The fifth house has 8 gnomes.

**Final Answer:**

The fifth house has 8 gnomes.
