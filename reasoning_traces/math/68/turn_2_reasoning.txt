==================================================

The problem states that the ratio of coins Elsa has to that which Amalie has is 10:45. This means that for every 10 coins Elsa has, Amalie has 45 coins. 

The total number of coins they have is 440. We can use the ratio to determine how many coins each person has. 

First, we add the two parts of the ratio together: 10 + 45 = 55. 

This means that the 440 coins are divided into 55 parts. 

To find out how many coins are in one part, we divide the total number of coins by the total number of parts: 440 ÷ 55 = 8. 

So, one part is equal to 8 coins. 

Since the ratio tells us that Amalie has 45 parts, we multiply the number of parts by the number of coins in one part to find out how many coins Amalie has: 45 parts × 8 coins/part = 360 coins. 

The problem then tells us that Amalie spends 3/4 of her coins on toys. 

To find out how many coins she spends, we multiply the total number of coins she has by 3/4: 360 coins × 3/4 = 270 coins. 

Finally, to find out how many coins Amalie has left, we subtract the number of coins she spent from the total number of coins she had: 360 coins - 270 coins = 90 coins. 

So, Amalie will remain with 90 coins. 

Therefore, the final answer is 90 coins.
