==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Ratio**: The ratio of coins that Elsa has to the coins that Amalie has is given as 10:45. This means for every 10 coins Elsa has, Amalie has 45 coins.

2. **Express the Ratio in Terms of Variables**: Let \( E \) represent the number of coins Elsa has and \( A \) represent the number of coins Amalie has. According to the ratio, we can express this as:
   \[
   \frac{E}{A} = \frac{10}{45}
   \]
   This can be simplified to:
   \[
   \frac{E}{A} = \frac{2}{9}
   \]
   Therefore, we can express \( E \) in terms of \( A \):
   \[
   E = \frac{2}{9}A
   \]

3. **Set Up the Total Coins Equation**: We know the total number of coins they have is 440:
   \[
   E + A = 440
   \]
   Substituting \( E \) from the previous step:
   \[
   \frac{2}{9}A + A = 440
   \]

4. **Combine Like Terms**: To combine the terms on the left side, we can express \( A \) as \( \frac{9}{9}A \):
   \[
   \frac{2}{9}A + \frac{9}{9}A = \frac{11}{9}A
   \]
   Thus, we have:
   \[
   \frac{11}{9}A = 440
   \]

5. **Solve for \( A \)**: To isolate \( A \), multiply both sides by \( \frac{9}{11} \):
   \[
   A = 440 \times \frac{9}{11}
   \]
   First, calculate \( 440 \div 11 \):
   \[
   440 \div 11 = 40
   \]
   Now multiply by 9:
   \[
   A = 40 \times 9 = 360
   \]

6. **Find \( E \)**: Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( E \):
   \[
   E = 440 - A = 440 - 360 = 80
   \]

7. **Calculate How Many Coins Amalie Has After Spending**: Amalie spends \( \frac{3}{4} \) of her coins on toys. We need to find out how many coins she spends:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent} = \frac{3}{4}A = \frac{3}{4} \times 360 = 270
   \]
   Now, we find out how many coins she has left:
   \[
   \text{Coins remaining} = A - \text{Amount spent} = 360 - 270 = 90
   \]

8. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the number of coins Amalie will remain with is:
   \[
   \boxed{90}
   \]
