==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of girls and boys**: 
   We know from the problem that there are 60 girls at Dr. Wertz's school. The problem states that there are twice as many boys as girls. 

   Let \( G \) represent the number of girls and \( B \) represent the number of boys. According to the problem:
   \[
   G = 60
   \]
   \[
   B = 2G
   \]
   Substituting the value of \( G \):
   \[
   B = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

   So, there are 120 boys at the school.

2. **Calculate the total number of students**:
   Now, we can find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls together:
   \[
   \text{Total Students} = G + B = 60 + 120 = 180
   \]

3. **Determine the number of teachers**:
   The problem states that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:
   \[
   \text{Number of Teachers} = \frac{\text{Total Students}}{\text{Students per Teacher}} = \frac{180}{5}
   \]
   Performing the division:
   \[
   \text{Number of Teachers} = 36
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is \( \boxed{36} \).
