The ratio of the coins that Elsa has to that which Amalie has is 10:45. This means that for every 10 coins Elsa has, Amalie has 45 coins. 

To find out how many coins each person has, we first need to find the total parts in the ratio. We do this by adding the two parts of the ratio together. 

10 (Elsa's part) + 45 (Amalie's part) = 55 parts

The total number of coins they have is 440. To find out how many coins each part of the ratio represents, we divide the total number of coins by the total number of parts.

440 coins ÷ 55 parts = 8 coins per part

Now we can find out how many coins Amalie has by multiplying her part of the ratio (45 parts) by the number of coins each part represents (8 coins).

45 parts × 8 coins per part = 360 coins

Amalie spends 3/4 of her coins on toys. To find out how many coins she spends, we multiply the number of coins she has by 3/4.

360 coins × 3/4 = 270 coins

To find out how many coins Amalie remains with, we subtract the number of coins she spends from the total number of coins she has.

360 coins - 270 coins = 90 coins

So, Amalie will remain with 90 coins.
