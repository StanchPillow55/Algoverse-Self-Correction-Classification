Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The problem states that the ratio of coins that Elsa has to that which Amalie has is 10:45. This means that for every 10 coins Elsa has, Amalie has 45 coins. 

The total number of coins they have is 440. We can use the ratio to determine how many coins each person has. The total ratio is 10 + 45 = 55. 

To find out how many coins Elsa has, we can multiply the total number of coins by the ratio of Elsa's coins to the total ratio. This gives us:

(10/55) * 440 = 80 coins.

To find out how many coins Amalie has, we can subtract the number of coins Elsa has from the total number of coins. This gives us:

440 - 80 = 360 coins.

The problem then states that Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has on toys. To find out how many coins she remains with, we can subtract the amount she spends from the total amount she has. This gives us:

360 - (3/4)*360 = 360 - 270 = 90 coins.

Therefore, Amalie will remain with 90 coins.
