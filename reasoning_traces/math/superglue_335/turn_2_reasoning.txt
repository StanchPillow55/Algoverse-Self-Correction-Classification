Question ID: superglue_335
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 335" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I will assume that it is a generic math problem that requires a step-by-step solution. Without specific details, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by outlining a general problem-solving strategy.

### Problem-Solving Strategy

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.
   - Note any assumptions or constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning).
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm the result.

### Example Problem

Let's assume a simple algebra problem for demonstration:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.
- The equation given is linear.

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- Isolate the variable \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. Start with the equation: 
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check the Solution
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming the solution is correct.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This example illustrates a structured approach to solving a math problem. If you have a specific problem in mind (e.g., "Sample reasoning question 335"), please provide the details, and I can apply this strategy to solve it.
