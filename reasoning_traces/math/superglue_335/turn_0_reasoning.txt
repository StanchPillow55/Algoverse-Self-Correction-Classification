==================================================

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a missing part of the question, as "Sample reasoning question 335" does not provide enough information for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by explaining the steps typically involved. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully to understand what is being asked.
   - Identify the knowns (given information) and the unknowns (what you need to find).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that could be used to solve the problem. This could involve algebraic manipulation, drawing diagrams, using formulas, or logical reasoning.
   - Consider if there are any similar problems you have solved before that could provide insight.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned. This might involve calculations, constructing equations, or applying specific mathematical principles.
   - Be meticulous with your calculations to avoid errors.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure it is correct and that you have followed the plan accurately.
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer, ensuring it addresses the question posed.

If you provide a specific math problem, I can apply this approach to solve it and show all the work and reasoning involved.
