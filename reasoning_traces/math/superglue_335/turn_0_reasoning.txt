==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 335" entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I will assume it is a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 240 square meters. How many such plots can the farmer create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a large rectangular field with dimensions 120 meters by 80 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into smaller plots, each with an area of 240 square meters.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width.
   - For the farmer's field: Area = 120 meters × 80 meters = 9600 square meters.

3. **Determine the Number of Smaller Plots:**
   - Each smaller plot has an area of 240 square meters.
   - To find the number of plots, we divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot.
   - Number of plots = Total Area of Field / Area of One Plot = 9600 square meters / 240 square meters.

4. **Perform the Division:**
   - 9600 ÷ 240 = 40.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 40 smaller plots, each with an area of 240 square meters.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 240 square meters.
