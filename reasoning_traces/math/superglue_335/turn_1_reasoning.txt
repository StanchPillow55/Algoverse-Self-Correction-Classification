==================================================

To solve a problem effectively, it's crucial to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the question you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 335," does not contain specific details or context about what needs to be solved. Therefore, I will guide you through a general approach to solving a math problem, which you can apply to any specific problem you encounter.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is given and what needs to be found.
   - Determine the type of problem (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that could be used to solve the problem.
   - Consider formulas, theorems, or methods that apply to the problem type.
   - Break the problem into smaller, manageable parts if necessary.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and signs.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Recalculate if necessary to ensure accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's apply this approach to a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- We can isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Review/Check Your Work**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).
