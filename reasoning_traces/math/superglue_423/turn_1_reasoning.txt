==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what is being asked. The question is titled "Sample reasoning question 423," but it doesn't provide specific details or numerical data to work with. Since the question is not clear, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a reasoning problem that involves logical thinking or mathematical calculations.

To demonstrate a structured approach to problem-solving, I'll create a hypothetical reasoning problem and solve it step-by-step:

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a total of 423 apples. He wants to distribute these apples equally among his 7 children. After distributing the apples, he wants to know how many apples each child will receive and how many apples will be left over.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Total apples = 423
   - Number of children = 7
   - We need to find out how many apples each child will receive and how many apples will be left over.

2. **Set Up the Division:**
   - We need to divide 423 apples by 7.

3. **Perform the Division:**
   - Divide 423 by 7.
   - 423 รท 7 = 60 with a remainder.

4. **Calculate the Quotient:**
   - 7 goes into 42 six times (since 7 x 6 = 42).
   - Subtract 42 from 42 to get 0.
   - Bring down the next digit, which is 3.
   - 7 goes into 3 zero times, so the remainder is 3.

5. **Determine the Result:**
   - Each child receives 60 apples.
   - There are 3 apples left over.

6. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Multiply the number of apples each child receives by the number of children: 60 x 7 = 420.
   - Add the remainder: 420 + 3 = 423, which matches the total number of apples.

**Final Answer:**

Each child will receive 60 apples, and there will be 3 apples left over.
