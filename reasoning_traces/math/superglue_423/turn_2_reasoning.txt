Question ID: superglue_423
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 423," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete and lacks specific details or context. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by making reasonable assumptions about what "Sample reasoning question 423" might entail. Let's assume it's a math problem involving basic arithmetic or algebra.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Identify the Problem Type:**
   - Since the problem is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 423," it could be a simple arithmetic problem or an algebraic equation. Without specific details, let's assume it's an algebraic equation.

2. **Assume a Sample Problem:**
   - Let's assume the problem is to solve the equation: \( 4x + 2 = 3x + 5 \).

3. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.
   - Subtract \( 3x \) from both sides:
     \[
     4x + 2 - 3x = 3x + 5 - 3x
     \]
     \[
     x + 2 = 5
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     x + 2 - 2 = 5 - 2
     \]
     \[
     x = 3
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 3 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     4(3) + 2 = 3(3) + 5
     \]
     \[
     12 + 2 = 9 + 5
     \]
     \[
     14 = 14
     \]
   - The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \( x = 3 \) is the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the assumed problem \( 4x + 2 = 3x + 5 \) is \( x = 3 \).

Since the original problem statement "Sample reasoning question 423" was not provided with specific details, this solution is based on a hypothetical scenario. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it accordingly.
