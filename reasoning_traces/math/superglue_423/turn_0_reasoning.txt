==================================================

It seems like the question "Sample reasoning question 423" is not providing enough specific information or context for me to solve a particular math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by breaking down the process into clear steps. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help solve it.

Hereâ€™s a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate strategy based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Once a solution is found, review the steps taken to ensure they are logical and correct.
   - Verify the final answer by substituting it back into the original problem, if applicable.
   - Consider whether the answer makes sense in the context of the problem.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly state the final answer, including units if applicable.
   - Ensure the answer is presented in a complete sentence if required by the problem.

If you have a specific math problem (e.g., an algebraic equation, a geometry problem, etc.), please provide the details, and I can apply this problem-solving approach to find the solution.
