==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 423" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear or specific, I will assume that this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

Calculate the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   The first 10 positive integers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

2. **Understand the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 10 \). Substitute 10 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{10(10 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - Calculate \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).
   - Multiply 10 by 11: \( 10 \times 11 = 110 \).
   - Divide 110 by 2: \( \frac{110}{2} = 55 \).

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure the calculation is correct, let's add the numbers directly:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55
   \]

   The direct addition confirms that the sum is indeed 55.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.
