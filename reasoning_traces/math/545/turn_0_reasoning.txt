==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many miles Jeff walks in a week based on the distance to his workplace and the number of days he works.

1. **Identify the distance to work**: 
   Jeff's workplace is 3 miles away from his home.

2. **Calculate the round trip distance**: 
   Since Jeff walks to work and then back home, we need to calculate the total distance for a round trip. The distance for a round trip is:
   \[
   \text{Round trip distance} = \text{Distance to work} + \text{Distance back home} = 3 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Determine how many days he works**: 
   Jeff works 5 times a week.

4. **Calculate the total distance walked in a week**: 
   To find the total distance Jeff walks in a week, we multiply the round trip distance by the number of days he works:
   \[
   \text{Total distance in a week} = \text{Round trip distance} \times \text{Number of days worked} = 6 \text{ miles} \times 5 = 30 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total distance Jeff walks in a week is:
   \[
   \boxed{30} \text{ miles}
   \]
