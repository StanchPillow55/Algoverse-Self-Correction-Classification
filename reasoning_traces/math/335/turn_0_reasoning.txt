==================================================

To determine how much sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge, we will first calculate the total amount of sugar required for each type of candy separately and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:**
   - Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
   - Mason is making 8 batches of suckers.
   - Therefore, the total sugar needed for the suckers can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Sugar for suckers} = \text{Number of batches} \times \text{Sugar per batch}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Sugar for suckers} = 8 \text{ batches} \times 30 \text{ ounces/batch} = 240 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:**
   - Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
   - Mason is making 1 batch of fudge.
   - Therefore, the total sugar needed for the fudge can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Sugar for fudge} = \text{Number of batches} \times \text{Sugar per batch}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Sugar for fudge} = 1 \text{ batch} \times 70 \text{ ounces/batch} = 70 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total sugar needed:**
   - Now, we will add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge to find the total amount of sugar required.

   \[
   \text{Total sugar needed} = \text{Sugar for suckers} + \text{Sugar for fudge}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total sugar needed} = 240 \text{ ounces} + 70 \text{ ounces} = 310 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge is **310 ounces**.

Final answer: **310 ounces**.
