==================================================

To determine how much Eve will spend on the gifts for her 3 nieces, we will first calculate the total cost of the cooking gear before applying the discount. Then, we will apply the 25% discount to find the final amount Eve will spend.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of each item for one niece

1. **Hand mitts**: $14.00
2. **Apron**: $16.00
3. **Set of 3 cooking utensils**: $10.00
4. **Small knife**: Since the small knife costs twice the amount of the utensils, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Cost of small knife} = 2 \times \text{Cost of utensils} = 2 \times 10 = 20.00
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for one niece

Now, we sum the costs of all items for one niece:
\[
\text{Total cost for one niece} = \text{Hand mitts} + \text{Apron} + \text{Utensils} + \text{Small knife}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for one niece} = 14 + 16 + 10 + 20 = 60.00
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for all three nieces

Since Eve is buying these items for 3 nieces, we multiply the total cost for one niece by 3:
\[
\text{Total cost for 3 nieces} = 3 \times \text{Total cost for one niece} = 3 \times 60 = 180.00
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the discount

The store is offering a 25% discount on the total cost. We first calculate the amount of the discount:
\[
\text{Discount} = 0.25 \times \text{Total cost for 3 nieces} = 0.25 \times 180 = 45.00
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the final amount Eve will spend

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[
\text{Final amount} = \text{Total cost for 3 nieces} - \text{Discount}
\]
\[
\text{Final amount} = 180 - 45 = 135.00
\]

### Final Answer

Eve will spend **$135.00** on the gifts for her nieces.
