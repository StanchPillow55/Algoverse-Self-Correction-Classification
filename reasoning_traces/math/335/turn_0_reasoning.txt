To determine how much Eve will spend on the gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount, apply the 25% discount, and then find the final cost.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the cost of each item:**
   - Hand mitts: $14.00
   - Apron: $16.00
   - Set of 3 cooking utensils: $10.00
   - Small knife: Twice the amount of the utensils

2. **Calculate the cost of the small knife:**
   - Since the small knife is twice the amount of the utensils, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Cost of small knife} = 2 \times 10.00 = 20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for one set of gifts (one of each item):**
   - Total cost for one niece:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for one niece} = 14.00 + 16.00 + 10.00 + 20.00
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for one niece} = 60.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for all three nieces before the discount:**
   - Since Eve has 3 nieces, the total cost before the discount is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for three nieces} = 3 \times 60.00 = 180.00
     \]

5. **Apply the 25% discount:**
   - The discount is 25% of the total cost, so we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Discount} = 0.25 \times 180.00 = 45.00
     \]

6. **Calculate the final cost after the discount:**
   - Subtract the discount from the total cost:
     \[
     \text{Final cost} = 180.00 - 45.00 = 135.00
     \]

Therefore, the total amount Eve will spend on the gifts after the discount is applied is \(\boxed{135.00}\).
