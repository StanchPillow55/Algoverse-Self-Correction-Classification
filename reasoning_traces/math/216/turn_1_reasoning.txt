Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let \( x \) be the amount of money Missy put in the bank in the first year. According to the problem, the amounts she put in the subsequent years are as follows:

- **First year:** \( x \)
- **Second year:** \( 2x \) (doubled from the first year)
- **Third year:** \( 4x \) (doubled from the second year)
- **Fourth year:** \( 8x \) (doubled from the third year)

Now, we can express the total amount of money in the bank after 4 years as the sum of the amounts from each year:

\[
\text{Total} = x + 2x + 4x + 8x
\]

Combining these terms gives:

\[
\text{Total} = 15x
\]

According to the problem, the total amount in the bank after 4 years is $450. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
15x = 450
\]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 15:

\[
x = \frac{450}{15} = 30
\]

Thus, the amount of money Missy put in the bank in the first year is:

\[
\boxed{30}
\]
