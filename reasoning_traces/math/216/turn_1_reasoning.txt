==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Missy put in the bank during the first year, given that the total amount after 4 years is $450 and that she doubled the amount each subsequent year.

Let's denote the amount of money Missy put in the bank during the first year as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first year, she put \( x \) dollars.
- In the second year, she doubled the amount from the first year, so she put \( 2x \) dollars.
- In the third year, she doubled the amount from the second year, so she put \( 4x \) dollars.
- In the fourth year, she doubled the amount from the third year, so she put \( 8x \) dollars.

Now, we can express the total amount of money in the bank after 4 years as the sum of the amounts from each year:

\[
x + 2x + 4x + 8x = 450
\]

Combine the terms on the left side:

\[
15x = 450
\]

To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 15:

\[
x = \frac{450}{15} = 30
\]

Thus, Missy put $30 in the bank during the first year.

Final Answer: Missy put $30 in the bank the first year.
