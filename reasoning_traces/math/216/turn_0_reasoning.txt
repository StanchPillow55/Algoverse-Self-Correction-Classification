To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Missy put in the piggy bank during the first year, given that she doubled the amount she saved in the subsequent years.

Let's denote the amount of money Missy put in the bank during the first year as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first year, she saved \( x \).
- In the second year, she doubled the amount from the first year, so she saved \( 2x \).
- In the third year, she doubled the amount from the second year, so she saved \( 4x \).
- In the fourth year, she doubled the amount from the third year, so she saved \( 8x \).

Now, we can express the total amount of money in the piggy bank after 4 years as the sum of the amounts saved each year:

\[
\text{Total} = x + 2x + 4x + 8x
\]

Combining these terms, we have:

\[
\text{Total} = x + 2x + 4x + 8x = 15x
\]

According to the problem, the total amount in the piggy bank after 4 years is $450. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
15x = 450
\]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 15:

\[
x = \frac{450}{15}
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
x = 30
\]

Thus, the amount of money Missy put in the bank during the first year is \( \boxed{30} \) dollars.

To verify, we can calculate the amounts saved each year based on \( x = 30 \):
- First year: \( 30 \)
- Second year: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Third year: \( 4 \times 30 = 120 \)
- Fourth year: \( 8 \times 30 = 240 \)

Now, summing these amounts:

\[
30 + 60 + 120 + 240 = 450
\]

This confirms that our calculation is correct, and Missy put \( \boxed{30} \) dollars in the bank during the first year.
