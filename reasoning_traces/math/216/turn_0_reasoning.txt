To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Missy put in the bank during the first year, given that she doubled the amount each subsequent year and ended up with a total of $450 after 4 years.

Let's denote the amount of money Missy put in the bank in the first year as \( x \).

According to the problem, the amount of money she put in the bank doubled each year after the first. Therefore, we can express the amounts she put in the bank each year as follows:

- First year: \( x \)
- Second year: \( 2x \)
- Third year: \( 4x \) (since \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \))
- Fourth year: \( 8x \) (since \( 2 \times 4x = 8x \))

The total amount of money in the bank after 4 years is the sum of the amounts from each year:

\[
x + 2x + 4x + 8x = 450
\]

Combine the terms on the left side:

\[
15x = 450
\]

To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 15:

\[
x = \frac{450}{15}
\]

Calculate the division:

\[
x = 30
\]

Thus, Missy put $30 in the bank during the first year.

To verify, let's check the total amount accumulated over the 4 years:

- First year: $30
- Second year: $60 (which is \( 2 \times 30 \))
- Third year: $120 (which is \( 2 \times 60 \))
- Fourth year: $240 (which is \( 2 \times 120 \))

Add these amounts together:

\[
30 + 60 + 120 + 240 = 450
\]

The total matches the given amount of $450, confirming our solution is correct.

Therefore, the amount of money Missy put in the bank the first year is \(\boxed{30}\) dollars.
