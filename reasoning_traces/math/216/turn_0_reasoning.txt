==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount Janeth has to repay, how much she will pay in total over 12 months, and then calculate her remaining balance.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount to be repaid

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 

First, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[
10\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200
\]

Now, we add this amount to the original loan to find the total amount she needs to repay:

\[
\text{Total amount to be repaid} = 2000 + 200 = 2200
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months

Janeth plans to pay $165 a month for 12 months. We calculate the total amount she will pay:

\[
\text{Total payments} = 165 \times 12
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
165 \times 12 = 1980
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining balance

Now we can find the remaining balance after Janeth makes her payments. We subtract the total payments from the total amount to be repaid:

\[
\text{Remaining balance} = \text{Total amount to be repaid} - \text{Total payments}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Remaining balance} = 2200 - 1980 = 220
\]

### Final Answer

Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be **$220**.
