==================================================

It seems like the question "Sample reasoning question 125" is not fully clear or specific. However, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by providing a sample problem and solving it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

Let's solve the following problem:

"Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Term with \( x \):**
   To isolate the term with \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it. Since \( x \) is multiplied by 3, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   Substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( 3x + 5 \):

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   The left side equals the right side of the original equation, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
