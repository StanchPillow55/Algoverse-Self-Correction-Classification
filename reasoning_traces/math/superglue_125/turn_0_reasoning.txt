==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 125" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**

A store sells two types of candies: chocolate and gummy bears. The price of a chocolate is $2, and the price of a gummy bear is $1.50. If a customer buys a total of 10 candies and spends $17, how many chocolates and gummy bears did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolates.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of gummy bears.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of candies is 10: 
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
   - The total cost is $17:
     \[
     2x + 1.5y = 17
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   1) & \quad x + y = 10 \\
   2) & \quad 2x + 1.5y = 17
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution Method:**

   From equation (1), express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 10 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 10 - x \) into equation (2):
   \[
   2x + 1.5(10 - x) = 17
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 15 - 1.5x = 17
   \]

   \[
   0.5x + 15 = 17
   \]

   \[
   0.5x = 2
   \]

   \[
   x = \frac{2}{0.5} = 4
   \]

   Now, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 10 - 4 = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check if these values satisfy both original equations:
   - For \( x + y = 10 \):
     \[
     4 + 6 = 10 \quad \text{(True)}
     \]

   - For \( 2x + 1.5y = 17 \):
     \[
     2(4) + 1.5(6) = 8 + 9 = 17 \quad \text{(True)}
     \]

Both equations are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The customer bought 4 chocolates and 6 gummy bears.
