Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 125" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume a generic approach to tackle a typical math problem. Let's consider a common type of problem that involves reasoning, such as solving an algebraic equation or a word problem. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

### Sample Problem:
**Problem Statement:**
A train travels from City A to City B at a constant speed. If the train travels 180 miles in 3 hours, what is the speed of the train in miles per hour?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the speed of the train.
   - We know the distance traveled (180 miles) and the time taken (3 hours).

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula to calculate speed is:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Distance = 180 miles
   - Time = 3 hours
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 180 by 3:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To ensure the calculation is correct, consider if the train travels 60 miles in one hour, then in 3 hours, it would travel:
     \[
     60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - This matches the given distance, confirming our solution is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The speed of the train is 60 miles per hour.

### Conclusion:
By following these steps, we have determined that the speed of the train is 60 miles per hour. This solution involved understanding the problem, applying the appropriate formula, performing the calculation, and verifying the result to ensure accuracy.
