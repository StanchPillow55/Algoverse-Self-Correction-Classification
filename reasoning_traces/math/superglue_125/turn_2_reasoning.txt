Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 125" refers to. Unfortunately, without additional context or details about the specific question, it's impossible to provide a precise solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems, which you can apply to your specific question once you have more information.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include:
     - Drawing a diagram or picture.
     - Writing an equation or formula.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.
     - Looking for patterns or relationships.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Double-check calculations and logic.
   - Consider whether there is another method to solve the problem and compare results.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, ensuring it addresses the question asked.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's apply this approach to a simple example problem:

**Example Problem:**
Find the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the sum of the integers from 1 to 10.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: 
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)
     \]
     where \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a \) is the first term, and \( l \) is the last term.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Here, \( n = 10 \), \( a = 1 \), and \( l = 10 \).
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     S_{10} = \frac{10}{2} \times (1 + 10) = 5 \times 11 = 55
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify by adding the numbers directly: \( 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 10 = 55 \).
   - Both methods give the same result, confirming the solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.

Once you have the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 125," you can apply this structured approach to find the solution. If you provide more information about the question, I can offer a more targeted solution.
