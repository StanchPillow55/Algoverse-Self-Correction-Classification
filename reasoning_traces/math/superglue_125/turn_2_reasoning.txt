==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 125" might entail. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a typical math problem that requires logical reasoning. Let's consider a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 125 meters long and 75 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with a length of 25 meters and a width of 15 meters. How many smaller plots can the farmer create from the entire field?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a large rectangular field with dimensions 125 meters by 75 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into smaller plots, each measuring 25 meters by 15 meters.
   - We need to determine how many such smaller plots can fit into the larger field.

2. **Calculate the Area of the Large Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length Ã— Width.
   - For the large field: 
     \[
     \text{Area of large field} = 125 \, \text{meters} \times 75 \, \text{meters} = 9375 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Area of One Small Plot:**
   - Similarly, calculate the area of one smaller plot:
     \[
     \text{Area of one small plot} = 25 \, \text{meters} \times 15 \, \text{meters} = 375 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

4. **Determine How Many Small Plots Fit into the Large Field:**
   - To find out how many smaller plots can fit into the large field, divide the area of the large field by the area of one small plot:
     \[
     \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Area of large field}}{\text{Area of one small plot}} = \frac{9375 \, \text{square meters}}{375 \, \text{square meters}}
     \]
   - Perform the division:
     \[
     \frac{9375}{375} = 25
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 25 smaller plots from the entire field.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 25 smaller rectangular plots from the large field.
