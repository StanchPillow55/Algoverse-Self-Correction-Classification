To solve this problem, we need to determine how many kilograms of grapes Borris will need in a year after increasing his production by 20%.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the current annual usage of grapes:**
   - Borris uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months.
   - Since there are 12 months in a year, we need to calculate how many kilograms he uses in a year.
   - In one year, there are two 6-month periods.
   - Therefore, the annual usage is:
     \[
     90 \text{ kg per 6 months} \times 2 = 180 \text{ kg per year}
     \]

2. **Calculate the increased production:**
   - Borris plans to increase his production by 20%.
   - To find the increased amount, calculate 20% of the current annual usage:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 180 \text{ kg} = 0.20 \times 180 = 36 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Determine the new annual requirement:**
   - Add the increased amount to the current annual usage to find the new total:
     \[
     180 \text{ kg} + 36 \text{ kg} = 216 \text{ kg}
     \]

### Final Answer:
After increasing his production by 20%, Borris will need 216 kilograms of grapes in a year.
