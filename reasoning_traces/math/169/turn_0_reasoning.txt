==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the current grape usage per year.**
2. **Calculate the increased production amount.**
3. **Determine the total grape requirement after the increase.**

### Step 1: Determine the current grape usage per year

Borris uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, he uses grapes for two 6-month periods in a year.

\[
\text{Current yearly grape usage} = 90 \text{ kg} \times 2 = 180 \text{ kg}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the increased production amount

Borris is planning to increase his production by 20%. To find out how much this increase is, we first calculate 20% of the current yearly grape usage.

\[
\text{Increase} = 20\% \text{ of } 180 \text{ kg} = 0.20 \times 180 \text{ kg} = 36 \text{ kg}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the total grape requirement after the increase

Now, we add the increase to the current yearly grape usage to find the new total requirement.

\[
\text{New total grape requirement} = \text{Current yearly grape usage} + \text{Increase}
\]
\[
\text{New total grape requirement} = 180 \text{ kg} + 36 \text{ kg} = 216 \text{ kg}
\]

### Final Answer

After increasing his production by 20%, Borris will need **216 kilograms of grapes** in a year.
