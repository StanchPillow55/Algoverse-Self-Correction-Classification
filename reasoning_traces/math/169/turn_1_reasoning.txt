==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many kilograms of grapes Borris will use in a year after increasing his production by 20%.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current Usage in 6 Months:**
   - Borris currently uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months.

2. **Current Usage in 1 Year:**
   - Since there are 12 months in a year, and Borris uses 90 kilograms every 6 months, we can calculate his current annual usage by multiplying the 6-month usage by 2 (since 12 months is twice 6 months).
   \[
   \text{Current annual usage} = 90 \, \text{kg} \times 2 = 180 \, \text{kg}
   \]

3. **Increase in Production:**
   - Borris plans to increase his production by 20%. To find out how much this increase is, we calculate 20% of the current annual usage.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 0.20 \times 180 \, \text{kg} = 36 \, \text{kg}
   \]

4. **New Annual Usage:**
   - To find the new annual usage, we add the increase to the current annual usage.
   \[
   \text{New annual usage} = 180 \, \text{kg} + 36 \, \text{kg} = 216 \, \text{kg}
   \]

Therefore, after increasing his production by 20%, Borris will need 216 kilograms of grapes in a year.

**Final Answer: 216 kilograms**
