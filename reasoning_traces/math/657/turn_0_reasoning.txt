==================================================

To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider both the initial cost of the plane and the ongoing monthly expenses associated with renting a hangar and purchasing fuel.

### Step 1: Calculate the initial cost of the plane
The initial cost of the plane is given as:
\[
\text{Cost of the plane} = 150,000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the monthly expenses
James has two monthly expenses:
1. **Hangar rental cost**: $5,000 per month
2. **Fuel cost**: He spends twice as much on fuel as he does on the hangar.

First, we calculate the fuel cost:
\[
\text{Fuel cost} = 2 \times \text{Hangar rental cost} = 2 \times 5,000 = 10,000 \text{ dollars per month}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total monthly expenses
Now, we can find the total monthly expenses by adding the hangar rental cost and the fuel cost:
\[
\text{Total monthly expenses} = \text{Hangar rental cost} + \text{Fuel cost} = 5,000 + 10,000 = 15,000 \text{ dollars per month}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total expenses for the year
To find the total expenses for the year, we multiply the total monthly expenses by the number of months in a year (12):
\[
\text{Total expenses for the year} = \text{Total monthly expenses} \times 12 = 15,000 \times 12 = 180,000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost for the first year
Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the total expenses for the year to find the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year:
\[
\text{Total cost for the first year} = \text{Cost of the plane} + \text{Total expenses for the year} = 150,000 + 180,000 = 330,000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[
\boxed{330,000 \text{ dollars}}
\]
