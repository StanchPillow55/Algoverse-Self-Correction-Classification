Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much it cost James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider both the initial cost of the plane and the ongoing monthly expenses associated with it.

### Step 1: Calculate the Initial Cost of the Plane
The initial cost of the plane is given as:
\[
\text{Cost of the plane} = \$150,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Monthly Expenses
James has two types of monthly expenses: hanger rental and fuel.

1. **Hanger Rental Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Hanger rental cost per month} = \$5,000
   \]

2. **Fuel Cost:**
   James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on the hanger rental. Therefore, the fuel cost per month is:
   \[
   \text{Fuel cost per month} = 2 \times \text{Hanger rental cost} = 2 \times 5,000 = \$10,000
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Monthly Expenses
Now, we can calculate the total monthly expenses by adding the hanger rental cost and the fuel cost:
\[
\text{Total monthly expenses} = \text{Hanger rental cost} + \text{Fuel cost}
\]
\[
\text{Total monthly expenses} = 5,000 + 10,000 = \$15,000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Annual Expenses
To find the total expenses for the year, we multiply the total monthly expenses by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[
\text{Annual expenses} = \text{Total monthly expenses} \times 12
\]
\[
\text{Annual expenses} = 15,000 \times 12 = \$180,000
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Total Cost for the First Year
Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual expenses to find the total cost for the first year:
\[
\text{Total cost for the first year} = \text{Cost of the plane} + \text{Annual expenses}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for the first year} = 150,000 + 180,000 = \$330,000
\]

### Final Answer
The total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[
\boxed{330,000}
\]
