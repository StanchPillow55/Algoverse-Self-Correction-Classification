Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Amount of Butter**: Liza starts with 10 kilograms of butter.

2. **Butter Used for Chocolate Chip Cookies**:
   - Liza uses one-half of the butter for chocolate chip cookies.
   - Amount used = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) kilograms.
   - Remaining butter after chocolate chip cookies = \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) kilograms.

3. **Butter Used for Peanut Butter Cookies**:
   - Liza uses one-fifth of the original amount of butter for peanut butter cookies.
   - Amount used = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) kilograms.
   - Remaining butter after peanut butter cookies = \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) kilograms.

4. **Butter Used for Sugar Cookies**:
   - Liza uses one-third of the remaining butter for sugar cookies.
   - Remaining butter before making sugar cookies = 3 kilograms.
   - Amount used for sugar cookies = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \) kilogram.
   - Remaining butter after sugar cookies = \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) kilograms.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - After making all three kinds of cookies, the amount of butter left is 2 kilograms.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Amount of butter left} = 2 \text{ kilograms}
\]
