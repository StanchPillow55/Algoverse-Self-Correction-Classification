==================================================

First, let's find out how much butter Liza used for each type of cookies.

For the chocolate chip cookies, she used one-half of the 10 kilograms of butter, which is 10 kg * 1/2 = 5 kg.

For the peanut butter cookies, she used one-fifth of the 10 kilograms of butter, which is 10 kg * 1/5 = 2 kg.

So far, she has used 5 kg + 2 kg = 7 kg of butter.

This leaves her with 10 kg - 7 kg = 3 kg of butter.

Then, she used one-third of the remaining butter for sugar cookies, which is 3 kg * 1/3 = 1 kg.

So, after making all three kinds of cookies, she has 3 kg - 1 kg = 2 kg of butter left.

Therefore, Liza has 2 kilograms of butter left after making those three kinds of cookies.
