==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 418," I need more specific information about the problem itself. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem step by step. Let's assume a sample problem involving algebra:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

The goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true. The equation given is a linear equation in one variable.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start with:

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides to get rid of the constant term on the left side:

\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 3: Solve for the Variable**

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

Calculate the left side:

\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 418," please provide the details, and I can work through that problem specifically.
