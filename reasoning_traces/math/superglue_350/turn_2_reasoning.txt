==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 350" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear or specific, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. If the company produces 100 units of Type A and 150 units of Type B, what is the total profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Total Revenue:**
   - Revenue from Type A = Number of Type A units × Selling price per Type A unit
   - Revenue from Type A = 100 units × $10/unit = $1,000

   - Revenue from Type B = Number of Type B units × Selling price per Type B unit
   - Revenue from Type B = 150 units × $15/unit = $2,250

   - Total Revenue = Revenue from Type A + Revenue from Type B
   - Total Revenue = $1,000 + $2,250 = $3,250

2. **Calculate the Total Cost:**
   - Cost for Type A = Number of Type A units × Production cost per Type A unit
   - Cost for Type A = 100 units × $5/unit = $500

   - Cost for Type B = Number of Type B units × Production cost per Type B unit
   - Cost for Type B = 150 units × $8/unit = $1,200

   - Total Cost = Cost for Type A + Cost for Type B
   - Total Cost = $500 + $1,200 = $1,700

3. **Calculate the Total Profit:**
   - Total Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
   - Total Profit = $3,250 - $1,700 = $1,550

**Final Answer:**

The total profit for the company from producing and selling 100 units of Type A and 150 units of Type B widgets is $1,550.
