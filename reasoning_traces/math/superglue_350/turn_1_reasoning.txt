==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 350" refers to. However, the question is not explicitly stated, so I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 150 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 600 square meters. How many such plots can he create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 150 meters (length) and 80 meters (width).
   - The total area of the field is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 150 \, \text{m} \times 80 \, \text{m} = 12,000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]
   - Each smaller plot should have an area of 600 square meters.

2. **Calculate the Number of Plots:**
   - To find out how many 600 square meter plots can fit into the total area, we divide the total area by the area of one plot:
     \[
     \text{Number of Plots} = \frac{\text{Total Area}}{\text{Area of One Plot}} = \frac{12,000 \, \text{square meters}}{600 \, \text{square meters}}
     \]
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     \frac{12,000}{600} = 20
     \]

3. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Each plot is 600 square meters, and we have calculated that 20 such plots can fit into the 12,000 square meter field.
   - Multiplying the number of plots by the area of each plot should give us the total area:
     \[
     20 \times 600 = 12,000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]
   - This matches the total area of the field, confirming that our calculation is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The farmer can create 20 plots, each with an area of 600 square meters, from the rectangular field.
