Question ID: 234
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many vines of cherry tomatoes Steve needs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine Steve's Daily Tomato Consumption**: 
   - Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.

2. **Calculate Weekly Tomato Consumption**:
   - Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate Steve's weekly consumption:
   \[
   \text{Weekly consumption} = 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week}
   \]

3. **Determine Tomato Production per Vine**:
   - Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.

4. **Calculate the Number of Vines Needed**:
   - To find out how many vines Steve needs to produce 42 tomatoes, we divide the total weekly consumption by the production per vine:
   \[
   \text{Number of vines} = \frac{\text{Weekly consumption}}{\text{Tomatoes per vine}} = \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine}} = 14 \text{ vines}
   \]

Thus, Steve needs **14 vines** to meet his weekly tomato consumption of 42 tomatoes.

**Final Answer**: 14 vines
