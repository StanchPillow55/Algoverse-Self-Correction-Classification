To determine how many nickels Mark receives in his change, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items Mark bought.**
   - Cost of the loaf of bread: $4.20
   - Cost of the cheese: $2.05
   - Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4.20 + 2.05 = 6.25
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of change Mark should receive.**
   - Amount given to the cashier: $7.00
   - Change = Amount given - Total cost
   \[
   \text{Change} = 7.00 - 6.25 = 0.75
   \]

3. **Determine the denominations of change the cashier can provide.**
   - The cashier has:
     - 1 quarter (25 cents)
     - 1 dime (10 cents)
     - A bunch of nickels (5 cents each)

4. **Calculate the total value of the coins the cashier has.**
   - Value of 1 quarter: $0.25
   - Value of 1 dime: $0.10
   - Total value of the coins available = Value of quarter + Value of dime
   \[
   \text{Total value of coins} = 0.25 + 0.10 = 0.35
   \]

5. **Determine how much more change is needed after using the quarter and dime.**
   - Total change needed: $0.75
   - Change provided by the quarter and dime: $0.35
   - Additional change needed = Total change - Change provided
   \[
   \text{Additional change needed} = 0.75 - 0.35 = 0.40
   \]

6. **Calculate how many nickels are needed to make up the additional change.**
   - Value of each nickel: $0.05
   - Number of nickels needed = Additional change needed / Value of each nickel
   \[
   \text{Number of nickels} = \frac{0.40}{0.05} = 8
   \]

Thus, Mark receives **8 nickels** in his change.

Final answer: **8 nickels**.
