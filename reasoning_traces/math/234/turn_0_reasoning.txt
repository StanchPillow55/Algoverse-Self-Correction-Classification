To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cherry tomato vines Steve needs to grow in order to meet his daily consumption of tomatoes.

1. **Determine Steve's Daily Consumption**:
   - We know from the problem that Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.

2. **Calculate Weekly Consumption**:
   - Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate Steve's weekly consumption of tomatoes:
   \[
   \text{Weekly consumption} = \text{Daily consumption} \times \text{Number of days in a week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weekly consumption} = 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week}
   \]

3. **Determine Tomato Production per Vine**:
   - The problem states that each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week.

4. **Calculate the Number of Vines Needed**:
   - To find out how many vines Steve needs, we can divide his weekly consumption by the production of tomatoes per vine:
   \[
   \text{Number of vines needed} = \frac{\text{Weekly consumption}}{\text{Tomatoes produced per vine}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of vines needed} = \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 14 \text{ vines}
   \]

Thus, Steve needs **14 vines** to meet his weekly consumption of cherry tomatoes.

**Final Answer**: 14 vines
