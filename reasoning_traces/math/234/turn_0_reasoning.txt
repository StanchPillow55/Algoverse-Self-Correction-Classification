==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much change Mark should receive and then figure out how many nickels he gets based on the coins available in the cashier's till.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost
Mark buys a loaf of bread for $4.20 and cheese for $2.05. We need to add these amounts to find the total cost of his purchase.

\[
4.20 + 2.05 = 6.25
\]

The total cost of the bread and cheese is $6.25.

### Step 2: Calculate the Change
Mark gives the cashier $7.00. We need to subtract the total cost from the amount given to find out how much change he should receive.

\[
7.00 - 6.25 = 0.75
\]

Mark should receive $0.75 in change.

### Step 3: Determine the Coin Composition of the Change
The cashier has:
- 1 quarter (worth $0.25)
- 1 dime (worth $0.10)
- A bunch of nickels (each worth $0.05)

We need to use these coins to make up the $0.75 change.

1. **Use the Quarter:**
   - A quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Subtract the value of the quarter from the total change needed:
   \[
   0.75 - 0.25 = 0.50
   \]

2. **Use the Dime:**
   - A dime is worth $0.10.
   - Subtract the value of the dime from the remaining change needed:
   \[
   0.50 - 0.10 = 0.40
   \]

3. **Use Nickels for the Remaining Change:**
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - To find out how many nickels are needed to make up the remaining $0.40, divide $0.40 by $0.05:
   \[
   \frac{0.40}{0.05} = 8
   \]

Mark will receive 8 nickels to make up the remaining $0.40 of his change.

### Final Answer
Mark gets 8 nickels in his change.
