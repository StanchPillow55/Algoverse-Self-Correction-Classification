Question ID: 608
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much money Joe will have left after his purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.**
   - Joe picks a shirt for $25 and a pair of shorts for $35.
   - Total cost before discount = Price of shirt + Price of shorts
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 25 + 35 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Apply the 30% discount to the total cost.**
   - The discount amount can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 30\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.30 \times 60 = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 60 - 18 = 42 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine how much money Joe has left after the purchase.**
   - Joe starts with $50.
   - Subtract the total cost after discount from Joe's initial amount:
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 50 - 42 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, after purchasing the outfit, Joe will have **$8** left.

**Final Answer: $8**
