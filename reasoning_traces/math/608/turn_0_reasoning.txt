To determine how much money Joe will have left after his purchase, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.**
   - Joe picks out a shirt for $25 and a pair of shorts for $35.
   - Total cost before discount = Price of shirt + Price of shorts
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 25 + 35 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Apply the 30% discount to the total cost.**
   - The discount amount can be calculated as 30% of the total cost.
   - Discount amount = 30% of $60
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 0.30 \times 60 = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost after applying the discount.**
   - Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 60 - 18 = 42 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how much money Joe has left after the purchase.**
   - Joe starts with $50.
   - Amount left after purchase = Amount Joe has - Total cost after discount
   \[
   \text{Amount left} = 50 - 42 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, after completing all calculations, Joe will have **$8 left** after his purchase.

Final answer: **$8**
