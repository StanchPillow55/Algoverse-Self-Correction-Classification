To find the total number of pages that Mitchell had read, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pages in the chapters Mitchell read before 4 o'clock:**
   - Mitchell read 10 chapters before 4 o'clock.
   - Each chapter has 40 pages.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages read in the first 10 chapters is:
     \[
     \text{Pages from 10 chapters} = 10 \text{ chapters} \times 40 \text{ pages/chapter} = 400 \text{ pages}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of pages read in the 11th chapter:**
   - At 4 o'clock, Mitchell had read 20 pages of the 11th chapter.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages read in the 11th chapter is:
     \[
     \text{Pages from 11th chapter} = 20 \text{ pages}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of pages in the 2 additional chapters read after 4 o'clock:**
   - Mitchell read 2 more chapters after 4 o'clock.
   - Each of these chapters also has 40 pages.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages read in the 2 additional chapters is:
     \[
     \text{Pages from 2 additional chapters} = 2 \text{ chapters} \times 40 \text{ pages/chapter} = 80 \text{ pages}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pages read altogether:**
   - Now, we will sum the pages read from all the chapters:
     \[
     \text{Total pages read} = \text{Pages from 10 chapters} + \text{Pages from 11th chapter} + \text{Pages from 2 additional chapters}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total pages read} = 400 \text{ pages} + 20 \text{ pages} + 80 \text{ pages}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total pages read} = 500 \text{ pages}
     \]

Thus, the total number of pages that Mitchell had read altogether is \( \boxed{500} \).
