To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pages Mitchell read from the book. We will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the pages read before 4 o'clock:**
   - Mitchell read 10 chapters before 4 o'clock.
   - Each chapter has 40 pages.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages read before 4 o'clock is:
     \[
     10 \text{ chapters} \times 40 \text{ pages per chapter} = 400 \text{ pages}
     \]

2. **Calculate the pages read at 4 o'clock:**
   - At 4 o'clock, Mitchell had read 20 pages of the 11th chapter.
   - Therefore, the number of pages read at 4 o'clock is 20 pages.

3. **Calculate the pages read after 4 o'clock:**
   - After 4 o'clock, Mitchell read 2 more chapters.
   - Each chapter has 40 pages.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages read after 4 o'clock is:
     \[
     2 \text{ chapters} \times 40 \text{ pages per chapter} = 80 \text{ pages}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pages read altogether:**
   - Add the pages read before 4 o'clock, at 4 o'clock, and after 4 o'clock:
     \[
     400 \text{ pages (before 4 o'clock)} + 20 \text{ pages (at 4 o'clock)} + 80 \text{ pages (after 4 o'clock)} = 500 \text{ pages}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of pages that Mitchell had read altogether is \(\boxed{500}\) pages.
