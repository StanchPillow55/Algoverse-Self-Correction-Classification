Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 304" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll assume a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes. Let's consider the following problem:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 304 positive integers.

**Solution:**

To find the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

Where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) integers.

In this case, \( n = 304 \). Plugging this value into the formula gives:

\[
S_{304} = \frac{304 \times (304 + 1)}{2}
\]

First, calculate \( 304 + 1 \):

\[
304 + 1 = 305
\]

Next, multiply 304 by 305:

\[
304 \times 305 = 92720
\]

Now, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:

\[
S_{304} = \frac{92720}{2} = 46360
\]

Therefore, the sum of the first 304 positive integers is 46,360.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 304 positive integers is 46,360.
