==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 359" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, let's assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and mathematical calculations. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. In a given month, the company produced a total of 500 widgets and made a total revenue of $6,500. How many of each type of widget did the company produce?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of widgets produced is 500:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - The total revenue from selling the widgets is $6,500. The revenue from Type A widgets is \( 10x \) and from Type B widgets is \( 15y \):
     \[
     10x + 15y = 6500
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   1) & \quad x + y = 500 \\
   2) & \quad 10x + 15y = 6500
   \end{align*}
   \]

   From equation (1), express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 500 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into equation (2):
   \[
   10x + 15(500 - x) = 6500
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   10x + 7500 - 15x = 6500
   \]
   \[
   -5x + 7500 = 6500
   \]
   \[
   -5x = 6500 - 7500
   \]
   \[
   -5x = -1000
   \]
   \[
   x = 200
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 200 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 500 - 200 = 300
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the total revenue with these values:
   \[
   10(200) + 15(300) = 2000 + 4500 = 6500
   \]

   The calculations are correct, and the total revenue matches the given amount.

**Final Answer:**

The company produced 200 Type A widgets and 300 Type B widgets.
