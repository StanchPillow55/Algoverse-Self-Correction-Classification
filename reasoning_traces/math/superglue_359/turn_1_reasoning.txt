Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific details about "Sample reasoning question 359." Since the question is not provided, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by using a step-by-step method. Let's assume a sample math problem and solve it.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - We are given the base and the height of the triangle.

2. **Recall the Formula:**
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - Base (\(b\)) = 10 units
   - Height (\(h\)) = 5 units
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

This is a demonstration of how to solve a math problem step-by-step. If you have a specific problem or question number 359, please provide the details, and I will be happy to assist you with that specific problem.
