Question ID: superglue_359
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 359" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. Let's assume a typical math reasoning problem involves logical deduction, pattern recognition, or problem-solving skills.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Identify the Problem Type:**
   - Since the problem is labeled as a "reasoning question," it may involve logical deduction, pattern recognition, or solving a puzzle.
   - Without specific details, let's assume it's a pattern recognition problem involving numbers.

2. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - In a typical reasoning question, you might be given a sequence of numbers or a set of conditions.
   - For example, consider a sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...

3. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - Look for a pattern in the sequence. Here, each number is double the previous one.
   - This suggests a geometric progression with a common ratio of 2.

4. **Formulate a General Rule:**
   - For a geometric sequence, the nth term can be expressed as: 
     \[
     a_n = a_1 \times r^{(n-1)}
     \]
   - Where \( a_1 \) is the first term, \( r \) is the common ratio, and \( n \) is the term number.
   - In our example, \( a_1 = 2 \) and \( r = 2 \).

5. **Apply the Rule to Solve the Problem:**
   - If the problem asks for the 5th term, substitute into the formula:
     \[
     a_5 = 2 \times 2^{(5-1)} = 2 \times 2^4 = 2 \times 16 = 32
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. The pattern holds, confirming our solution.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The 5th term in the sequence is 32.

### Conclusion:

Without the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 359," this approach demonstrates how to tackle a typical reasoning problem involving sequences. If you have a specific problem or additional details, please provide them for a more tailored solution.
