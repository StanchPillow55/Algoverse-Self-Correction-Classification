==================================================

To solve a problem effectively, it's important to understand the question and break it down into manageable parts. However, the question "Sample reasoning question 359" does not provide specific details or context. Therefore, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the dimensions (length and width) of a rectangle.
   - The length is 3 times the width.
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( l \) is \( 3w \).

3. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - Substitute the given perimeter and the expression for the length:
     \[
     48 = 2(3w) + 2w
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     48 = 6w + 2w
     \]
     \[
     48 = 8w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Since \( l = 3w \):
     \[
     l = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 6 units
- Length = 18 units

This approach demonstrates how to systematically solve a math problem by defining variables, using known formulas, solving equations, and verifying the solution.
