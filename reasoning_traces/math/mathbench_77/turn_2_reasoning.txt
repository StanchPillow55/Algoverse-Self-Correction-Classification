==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 77," we first need to understand what the problem entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 77 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the sum of all positive divisors of 77.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Divisors of 77:**

   To find the divisors of 77, we start by determining its prime factorization.

   - 77 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - The sum of the digits of 77 is 7 + 7 = 14, which is not divisible by 3, so 77 is not divisible by 3.
   - 77 ends in a 7, so it is not divisible by 5.
   - Check divisibility by 7: \( 77 \div 7 = 11 \), which is an integer. Thus, 77 is divisible by 7.

   Now, divide 77 by 7 to find the other factor:
   \[
   77 \div 7 = 11
   \]

   Since 11 is a prime number, the prime factorization of 77 is \( 7 \times 11 \).

2. **List the Divisors:**

   The divisors of a number are all the products of its prime factors raised to all possible powers. For 77, the divisors are:
   - \( 7^0 \times 11^0 = 1 \)
   - \( 7^1 \times 11^0 = 7 \)
   - \( 7^0 \times 11^1 = 11 \)
   - \( 7^1 \times 11^1 = 77 \)

   Therefore, the divisors of 77 are 1, 7, 11, and 77.

3. **Calculate the Sum of the Divisors:**

   Add all the divisors together:
   \[
   1 + 7 + 11 + 77 = 96
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**

   The sum of all positive divisors of 77 is 96.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all positive divisors of 77 is 96.
