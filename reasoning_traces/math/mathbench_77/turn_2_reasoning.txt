==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 77," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 77:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \):**
   The next step is to divide both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3, to solve for \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 5.
