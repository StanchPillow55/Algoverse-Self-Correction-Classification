Question ID: mathbench_77
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 77," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 77" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact question or the mathematical operations involved. 

Since the problem is not clearly defined, let's consider a hypothetical math problem involving the number 77. We will create a problem, solve it, and show all the work and reasoning involved.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 77 and determine if the result is a prime number.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 77:**
   - The number 77 consists of two digits: 7 and 7.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Sum = 7 + 7 = 14

3. **Determine if the sum (14) is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - Check the divisibility of 14:
     - 14 is divisible by 1 and 14 (trivially, since these are the number itself and 1).
     - 14 is also divisible by 2 (since 14 is an even number).
   - Since 14 has divisors other than 1 and itself (specifically, 2 and 7), it is not a prime number.

**Conclusion:**
The sum of the digits of the number 77 is 14, and 14 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of 77 is 14, which is not a prime number.
