==================================================

It seems like there might be some confusion with the problem statement "Sample math problem 77." This doesn't provide specific details about the math problem you're referring to. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem, or if you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details. Here's a general approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about possible strategies to solve the problem.
   - Consider similar problems you have solved in the past.
   - Choose a strategy that seems most appropriate.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of your work to avoid mistakes.

4. **Look Back:**
   - Check your solution to see if it makes sense.
   - Verify your calculations.
   - Consider if there is another way to solve the problem or if the solution can be simplified.

Since I don't have specific details about "Sample math problem 77," I'll provide an example problem and solve it using the steps above:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.
- The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation.
- We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
1. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 4: Look Back**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 11
  \]
  \[
  8 + 3 = 11
  \]
  \[
  11 = 11
  \]
- The solution checks out, so \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help you solve it step by step.
