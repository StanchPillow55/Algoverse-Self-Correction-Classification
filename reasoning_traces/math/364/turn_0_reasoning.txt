==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many fourth-grade boys were present at Small Tree School on Friday. We will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of boys:**
   We know that there are 96 fourth-graders in total and that 43 of them are girls. To find the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.

   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = \text{Total students} - \text{Number of girls}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 96 - 43 = 53
   \]

   So, there are 53 boys at Small Tree School.

2. **Determine the number of boys absent on Friday:**
   According to the problem, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent on Friday.

3. **Calculate the number of boys present on Friday:**
   To find the number of boys who were present on Friday, we subtract the number of boys who were absent from the total number of boys.

   \[
   \text{Number of boys present} = \text{Total boys} - \text{Boys absent}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of boys present} = 53 - 4 = 49
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys who were at Small Tree School on Friday is:

   \[
   \boxed{49}
   \]
