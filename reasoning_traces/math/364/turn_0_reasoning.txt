==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Stu and Albert have together.

1. **Identify the number of books Stu has:**
   - Stu has 9 books.

2. **Determine how many books Albert has:**
   - According to the problem, Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu.
   - To find out how many books Albert has, we multiply the number of books Stu has by 4.
   \[
   \text{Number of books Albert has} = 4 \times \text{Number of books Stu has} = 4 \times 9
   \]
   - Calculate the multiplication:
   \[
   4 \times 9 = 36
   \]
   - Therefore, Albert has 36 books.

3. **Calculate the total number of books Stu and Albert have together:**
   - Add the number of books Stu has to the number of books Albert has.
   \[
   \text{Total number of books} = \text{Number of books Stu has} + \text{Number of books Albert has} = 9 + 36
   \]
   - Perform the addition:
   \[
   9 + 36 = 45
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Stu and Albert have a total of 45 books together.

Therefore, the final answer is that Stu and Albert have a total of 45 books.
