==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Stu and Albert have in total.

1. **Identify the number of books Stu has**: 
   - According to the problem, Stu has 9 books.

2. **Determine how many books Albert has**: 
   - The problem states that Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu. 
   - To find the number of books Albert has, we multiply the number of books Stu has by 4:
     \[
     \text{Number of books Albert has} = 4 \times \text{Number of books Stu has} = 4 \times 9
     \]
   - Now, we perform the multiplication:
     \[
     4 \times 9 = 36
     \]
   - Therefore, Albert has 36 books.

3. **Calculate the total number of books**: 
   - To find the total number of books that both Stu and Albert have, we add the number of books Stu has to the number of books Albert has:
     \[
     \text{Total number of books} = \text{Number of books Stu has} + \text{Number of books Albert has} = 9 + 36
     \]
   - Now, we perform the addition:
     \[
     9 + 36 = 45
     \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   - Therefore, the total number of books that Stu and Albert have together is \( \boxed{45} \).
