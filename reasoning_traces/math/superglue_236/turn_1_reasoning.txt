Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 236" refers to. However, since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume that "Sample reasoning question 236" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual content of the problem, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 236" is the following math problem:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units.

2. **Recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:**
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = 2L + 2W
   \]

3. **Substitute the given relationship into the perimeter formula:**
   Since \( L = 2W \), substitute \( L \) in the perimeter formula:
   \[
   2(2W) + 2W = 36
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   4W + 2W = 36
   \]
   \[
   6W = 36
   \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   Divide both sides by 6:
   \[
   W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
   \]

6. **Find the length using the relationship \( L = 2W \):**
   \[
   L = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

7. **Verify the solution:**
   - Calculate the perimeter with \( L = 12 \) and \( W = 6 \):
   \[
   2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
   \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 12 units
