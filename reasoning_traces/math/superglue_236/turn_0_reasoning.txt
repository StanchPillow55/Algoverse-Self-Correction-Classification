==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 236" entails. Since the problem statement is not clear, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. In a given month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and made $28,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of widgets sold is 500. This gives us our first equation:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue is $28,000. This gives us our second equation:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 28000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 500 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   50x + 70y &= 28000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   - **Substitute for \( y \) from Equation 1:**
     \[
     y = 500 - x
     \]

   - **Substitute \( y \) in Equation 2:**
     \[
     50x + 70(500 - x) = 28000
     \]

   - **Simplify and solve for \( x \):**
     \[
     50x + 35000 - 70x = 28000
     \]
     \[
     -20x + 35000 = 28000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = 28000 - 35000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = -7000
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-7000}{-20}
     \]
     \[
     x = 350
     \]

   - **Find \( y \) using the value of \( x \):**
     \[
     y = 500 - x = 500 - 350 = 150
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of widgets:
     \[
     x + y = 350 + 150 = 500 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]
   - Check the total revenue:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 50(350) + 70(150) = 17500 + 10500 = 28000 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**

The company sold 350 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets.

This solution demonstrates a clear understanding of setting up and solving a system of linear equations based on the given problem.
