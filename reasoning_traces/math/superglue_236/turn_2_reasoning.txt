==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 236" refers to. Since the question itself is not specified, let's assume it's a placeholder for a mathematical problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. 

Since no specific mathematical problem is provided, I'll create a hypothetical problem to demonstrate the process of solving it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal areas by constructing a fence parallel to one of the sides. What should be the length of the fence?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is a rectangle with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into two equal areas using a fence parallel to one of the sides.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - For this field:
     \[
     \text{Area} = 100 \, \text{meters} \times 60 \, \text{meters} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

3. **Determine the Area of Each Half:**
   - Since the field is to be divided into two equal areas, each half will have an area of:
     \[
     \text{Area of each half} = \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{2} = 3000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

4. **Determine the Orientation of the Fence:**
   - The fence can be parallel to either the length (100 meters) or the width (60 meters).

5. **Case 1: Fence Parallel to the Length (100 meters):**
   - If the fence is parallel to the length, it will divide the width into two equal parts.
   - Let the width of each part be \( x \).
   - Then, the area of each part is:
     \[
     100 \times x = 3000
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{3000}{100} = 30 \, \text{meters}
     \]
   - Therefore, the fence will be 60 meters long (the width of the field).

6. **Case 2: Fence Parallel to the Width (60 meters):**
   - If the fence is parallel to the width, it will divide the length into two equal parts.
   - Let the length of each part be \( y \).
   - Then, the area of each part is:
     \[
     60 \times y = 3000
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{3000}{60} = 50 \, \text{meters}
     \]
   - Therefore, the fence will be 100 meters long (the length of the field).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can construct the fence either parallel to the length or the width.
   - If parallel to the length, the fence will be 60 meters long.
   - If parallel to the width, the fence will be 100 meters long.

**Final Answer:**
The length of the fence should be either 60 meters or 100 meters, depending on its orientation.
