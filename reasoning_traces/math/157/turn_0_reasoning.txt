==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of beads**: 
   The girl pours 23 blue beads and 16 yellow beads into a bowl. We need to find the total number of beads.

   \[
   \text{Total beads} = \text{Blue beads} + \text{Yellow beads} = 23 + 16 = 39
   \]

2. **Divide the total into 3 equal parts**: 
   Next, we divide the total number of beads by 3 to find out how many beads are in each part.

   \[
   \text{Beads per part} = \frac{\text{Total beads}}{3} = \frac{39}{3} = 13
   \]

   So, each part initially has 13 beads.

3. **Determine the final number of beads in each part**: 
   After removing some beads from each part, the girl doubles the remaining beads to have 6 beads in each part.

   Let \( x \) be the number of beads removed from each part. After removing \( x \) beads, the number of beads left in each part is:

   \[
   13 - x
   \]

   According to the problem, she then doubles the remaining beads:

   \[
   2(13 - x) = 6
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**: 
   We will now solve the equation \( 2(13 - x) = 6 \).

   First, divide both sides by 2:

   \[
   13 - x = 3
   \]

   Next, isolate \( x \):

   \[
   -x = 3 - 13
   \]
   \[
   -x = -10
   \]
   \[
   x = 10
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: 
   The number of beads removed from each part is \( x = 10 \).

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]
