==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of beads:**
   - The girl has 23 blue beads and 16 yellow beads.
   - Total beads = 23 (blue) + 16 (yellow) = 39 beads.

2. **Divide the total beads into 3 equal parts:**
   - Since the total number of beads is 39, and she divides them into 3 equal parts, each part will initially have:
   \[
   \frac{39}{3} = 13 \text{ beads per part}
   \]

3. **Understand the transformation of beads:**
   - After removing some beads from each part, the remaining beads are doubled to result in 6 beads per part.

4. **Set up an equation for the transformation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of beads removed from each part.
   - Initially, each part has 13 beads. After removing \( x \) beads, each part has \( 13 - x \) beads.
   - These remaining beads are doubled to make 6 beads:
   \[
   2 \times (13 - x) = 6
   \]

5. **Solve the equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2 \times (13 - x) = 6
   \]
   \[
   26 - 2x = 6
   \]
   - Subtract 26 from both sides:
   \[
   -2x = 6 - 26
   \]
   \[
   -2x = -20
   \]
   - Divide both sides by -2:
   \[
   x = 10
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The number of beads removed from each part is \( x = 10 \).

Therefore, the final answer is that 10 beads were removed from each part.
