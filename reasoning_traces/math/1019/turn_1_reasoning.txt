Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, keeping track of the number of guests at each stage.

1. **Initial Number of Guests**: 
   The hotel starts with 100 guests.

2. **Early Checkout**: 
   24 guests elected for an early checkout. 
   \[
   \text{Guests after early checkout} = 100 - 24 = 76
   \]

3. **Late Checkout**: 
   15 guests elected for a late checkout. 
   \[
   \text{Guests after late checkout} = 76 - 15 = 61
   \]

4. **Check-ins in the Afternoon**: 
   It is stated that twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, the number of guests checking in is:
   \[
   \text{Guests checking in} = 2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Now, we add these guests to the current total:
   \[
   \text{Guests after afternoon check-ins} = 61 + 30 = 91
   \]

5. **Check-ins After Dinner**: 
   After dinner, 7 more guests checked in. 
   \[
   \text{Guests after dinner check-ins} = 91 + 7 = 98
   \]

Now, we have calculated the total number of guests currently in the hotel after all checkouts and check-ins.

**Final Answer**: The hotel now has **98 guests**.
