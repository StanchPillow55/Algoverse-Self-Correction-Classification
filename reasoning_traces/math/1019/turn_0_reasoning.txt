==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Guests**: The hotel starts with 100 guests.

2. **Early Checkout**: 24 guests elected for an early checkout. 
   - After the early checkout, the number of guests remaining is:
     \[
     100 - 24 = 76
     \]

3. **Late Checkout**: 15 guests elected for a late checkout. 
   - These guests will still be counted as they have not checked out yet. Therefore, the total number of guests at this point is:
     \[
     76 + 15 = 91
     \]

4. **New Check-ins**: In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, the number of new guests checking in is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   - Adding these new guests to the current total:
     \[
     91 + 30 = 121
     \]

5. **Additional Check-ins After Dinner**: After dinner, 7 more people checked in. 
   - We add these guests to the current total:
     \[
     121 + 7 = 128
     \]

6. **Final Count of Guests**: The total number of guests in the hotel now is 128.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{128}
\]
