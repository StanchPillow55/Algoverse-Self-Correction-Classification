To solve the problem, we need to determine how much blood one shark has and then calculate the total amount of blood for ten sharks.

1. **Determine the amount of blood in one whale**:
   - According to the problem, each whale has 40 gallons of blood.

2. **Calculate the amount of blood in one shark**:
   - The problem states that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale.
   - Therefore, the amount of blood in one shark can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times \text{Blood in one whale} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Blood in one shark} = 120 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of blood in ten sharks**:
   - Now that we know one shark has 120 gallons of blood, we can find the total amount of blood in ten sharks:
     \[
     \text{Total blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times \text{Blood in one shark} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total blood in ten sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - The total number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:
     \[
     \boxed{1200}
     \]
