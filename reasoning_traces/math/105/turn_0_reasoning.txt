==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many goats Paddington has and then find the total number of goats they both have.

1. **Identify the number of goats Washington has:**
   - According to the problem, Washington has 140 goats.

2. **Determine how many goats Paddington has:**
   - The problem states that Paddington has 40 more goats than Washington. 
   - Therefore, we can calculate the number of goats Paddington has by adding 40 to the number of goats Washington has:
     \[
     \text{Paddington's goats} = \text{Washington's goats} + 40
     \]
     \[
     \text{Paddington's goats} = 140 + 40 = 180
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of goats:**
   - Now that we know both Washington's and Paddington's number of goats, we can find the total number of goats by adding the two amounts together:
     \[
     \text{Total goats} = \text{Washington's goats} + \text{Paddington's goats}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total goats} = 140 + 180 = 320
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of goats that Paddington and Washington have together is:
     \[
     \boxed{320}
     \]
