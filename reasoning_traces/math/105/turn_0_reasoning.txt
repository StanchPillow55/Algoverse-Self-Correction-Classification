==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of goats Paddington has and then find the total number of goats both Paddington and Washington have together.

1. **Identify the number of goats Washington has:**
   - According to the problem, Washington has 140 goats.

2. **Determine the number of goats Paddington has:**
   - The problem states that Paddington has 40 more goats than Washington.
   - Therefore, we can calculate the number of goats Paddington has by adding 40 to the number of goats Washington has.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     \text{Number of goats Paddington has} = \text{Number of goats Washington has} + 40
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of goats Paddington has} = 140 + 40 = 180
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of goats:**
   - To find the total number of goats both Paddington and Washington have, we add the number of goats each of them has.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Total number of goats} = \text{Number of goats Washington has} + \text{Number of goats Paddington has}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total number of goats} = 140 + 180 = 320
     \]

Thus, the total number of goats that Paddington and Washington have together is 320.

**Final Answer: 320 goats**
