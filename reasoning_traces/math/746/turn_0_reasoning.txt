To determine how much Jake's family will save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost for each amusement park based on the given fees and the number of adults and children in the family.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost for the first amusement park.

The fees for the first amusement park are:
- Adult fee: $26
- Child fee: $12

Jake's family consists of:
- 2 adults
- 2 children

**Calculating the cost for adults:**
\[
\text{Cost for adults} = \text{Number of adults} \times \text{Adult fee} = 2 \times 26 = 52
\]

**Calculating the cost for children:**
\[
\text{Cost for children} = \text{Number of children} \times \text{Child fee} = 2 \times 12 = 24
\]

**Total cost for the first amusement park:**
\[
\text{Total cost (first park)} = \text{Cost for adults} + \text{Cost for children} = 52 + 24 = 76
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for the second amusement park.

The fees for the second amusement park are:
- Adult fee: $14
- Child fee: $10

**Calculating the cost for adults:**
\[
\text{Cost for adults} = \text{Number of adults} \times \text{Adult fee} = 2 \times 14 = 28
\]

**Calculating the cost for children:**
\[
\text{Cost for children} = \text{Number of children} \times \text{Child fee} = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]

**Total cost for the second amusement park:**
\[
\text{Total cost (second park)} = \text{Cost for adults} + \text{Cost for children} = 28 + 20 = 48
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the savings by choosing the second amusement park.

To find out how much they will save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we subtract the total cost of the second park from the total cost of the first park.

\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Total cost (first park)} - \text{Total cost (second park)} = 76 - 48 = 28
\]

### Final Answer:
Jake's family will save **$28** by choosing the second amusement park over the first.
