==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more details about "Sample math problem 201" as it doesn't provide any specific information or context. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems, which you can apply to a specific problem once you have the details.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note down the given information and any constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might be applicable (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.
   - Decide on a strategy to tackle the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of your work to avoid mistakes.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Recalculate if necessary to ensure accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's apply this approach to a sample problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- This is a simple linear equation. We can isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
- Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Review/Check Your Work**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you provide the specific details of "Sample math problem 201," I can apply this structured approach to solve it.
