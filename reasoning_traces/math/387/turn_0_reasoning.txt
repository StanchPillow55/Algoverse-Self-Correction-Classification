==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many candies each person eats and how many candies are left in the bucket after they eat. Then, we will divide the remaining candies equally among them.

1. **Determine how many candies each person eats:**
   - **Nellie:** Nellie can eat 12 sourball candies.
   - **Jacob:** Jacob can eat half of what Nellie can eat. Therefore, he can eat:
     \[
     \text{Jacob's candies} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
     \]
   - **Lana:** Lana can eat three fewer than Jacob. Therefore, she can eat:
     \[
     \text{Lana's candies} = 6 - 3 = 3
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of candies eaten:**
   Now we add up the candies eaten by Nellie, Jacob, and Lana:
   \[
   \text{Total candies eaten} = \text{Nellie's candies} + \text{Jacob's candies} + \text{Lana's candies}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total candies eaten} = 12 + 6 + 3 = 21
   \]

3. **Determine the number of candies remaining in the bucket:**
   The initial number of candies in the bucket is 30. After they eat, the number of candies left is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining candies} = \text{Initial candies} - \text{Total candies eaten}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining candies} = 30 - 21 = 9
   \]

4. **Divide the remaining candies equally among Nellie, Jacob, and Lana:**
   There are 3 people sharing the remaining candies. Therefore, each person will get:
   \[
   \text{Candies per person} = \frac{\text{Remaining candies}}{3}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Candies per person} = \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Each person (Nellie, Jacob, and Lana) will get 3 sourball candies from the remaining candies.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]
