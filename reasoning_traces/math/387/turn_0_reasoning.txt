==================================================

To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we will first calculate the cost of each item separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the cost of the erasers:**
   - The cost of one eraser is $2.
   - Therefore, the cost of 6 erasers can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of 6 erasers} = 6 \times \text{Cost of one eraser} = 6 \times 2 = 12
     \]
   - So, the total cost for 6 erasers is $12.

2. **Calculate the cost of the pencils:**
   - The cost of one pencil is $3.
   - Therefore, the cost of 8 pencils can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of 8 pencils} = 8 \times \text{Cost of one pencil} = 8 \times 3 = 24
     \]
   - So, the total cost for 8 pencils is $24.

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Now, we will add the total cost of the erasers and the total cost of the pencils:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of 6 erasers} + \text{Cost of 8 pencils} = 12 + 24 = 36
     \]

Thus, the total cost for 6 erasers and 8 pencils is **$36**.

Final answer: **$36**.
