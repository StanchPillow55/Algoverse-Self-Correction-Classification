==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sourball candies each person can eat before crying and how many candies are left in the bucket after they have eaten. Then, we will divide the remaining candies equally among Nellie, Jacob, and Lana.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine how many candies each person can eat:**
   - **Nellie:** She can eat 12 sourball candies before crying.
   - **Jacob:** He can eat half of what Nellie can eat. Therefore, Jacob can eat:
     \[
     \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ candies}
     \]
   - **Lana:** She can eat three fewer candies than Jacob. Therefore, Lana can eat:
     \[
     6 - 3 = 3 \text{ candies}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of candies eaten by all three:**
   - Total candies eaten by Nellie, Jacob, and Lana:
     \[
     12 + 6 + 3 = 21 \text{ candies}
     \]

3. **Determine how many candies are left in the bucket:**
   - They started with 30 candies, and they ate 21 candies. Therefore, the remaining candies are:
     \[
     30 - 21 = 9 \text{ candies}
     \]

4. **Divide the remaining candies equally among Nellie, Jacob, and Lana:**
   - There are 9 candies left, and they need to be divided equally among 3 people. Therefore, each person gets:
     \[
     \frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ candies}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Each person will get 3 sourball candies from the remaining candies in the bucket.
