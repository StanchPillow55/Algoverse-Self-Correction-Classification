Question ID: 387
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many candies each person can eat before crying, how many candies they collectively consume, and how many are left to be divided equally.

1. **Determine how many candies each person can eat:**

   - **Nellie:** She can eat 12 sourball candies before crying.
   - **Jacob:** He can manage only half of Nellie's amount. Therefore, Jacob can eat:
     \[
     \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ candies}
     \]
   - **Lana:** She can eat three fewer candies than Jacob. Therefore, Lana can eat:
     \[
     6 - 3 = 3 \text{ candies}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of candies they eat:**

   Add up the candies each person can eat:
   \[
   12 + 6 + 3 = 21 \text{ candies}
   \]

3. **Determine how many candies are left in the bucket:**

   They started with 30 candies. After eating, the remaining candies are:
   \[
   30 - 21 = 9 \text{ candies}
   \]

4. **Divide the remaining candies equally among Nellie, Jacob, and Lana:**

   Since there are 3 people, divide the remaining candies by 3:
   \[
   \frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ candies per person}
   \]

Thus, after eating until they cried and dividing the remaining candies, Nellie, Jacob, and Lana each get 3 sourball candies.

**Final Answer:**
Each person will get 3 sourball candies.
