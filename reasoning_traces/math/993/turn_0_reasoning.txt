==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Flights of the First Plane**:
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day.
   - According to the problem, three-quarters of these flights go to Greece. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4}x
     \]

2. **Remaining Flights**:
   - The remaining flights are those that do not go to Greece. The number of remaining flights is:
     \[
     x - \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}x
     \]
   - These remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is:
     \[
     \text{Flights to France} = \text{Flights to Germany} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{4}x \right) = \frac{1}{8}x
     \]

3. **Understanding the Flights of the Second Plane**:
   - The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips. According to the problem, these 44 trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     44 = \frac{1}{2}x
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     x = 44 \times 2 = 88
     \]

5. **Calculating Flights to France**:
   - Now that we have \( x = 88 \), we can find the number of flights to France:
     \[
     \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}x = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
     \[
     \boxed{11}
     \]
