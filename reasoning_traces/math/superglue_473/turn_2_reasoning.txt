Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 473" entails. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 150 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 600 square meters. How many such plots can he create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is a rectangle with dimensions 150 meters (length) and 80 meters (width).
   - Each smaller plot should have an area of 600 square meters.
   - We need to determine how many such plots can be created.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width.
   - For the field: Area = 150 meters × 80 meters = 12,000 square meters.

3. **Determine the Number of Plots:**
   - Each plot has an area of 600 square meters.
   - To find the number of plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot.
   - Number of plots = Total Area of Field / Area of One Plot
   - Number of plots = 12,000 square meters / 600 square meters = 20 plots.

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Multiply the number of plots by the area of one plot to ensure it equals the total area of the field.
   - 20 plots × 600 square meters/plot = 12,000 square meters.
   - The calculation is correct, confirming that the field can indeed be divided into 20 plots of 600 square meters each.

**Final Answer:**

The farmer can create 20 plots, each with an area of 600 square meters, from the rectangular field.
