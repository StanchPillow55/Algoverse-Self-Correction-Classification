==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to follow a structured approach. However, the question you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 473," lacks specific details or numerical information to work with. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

2. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Base of the triangle (\(b\)) = 10 units
   - Height of the triangle (\(h\)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   - Plug the values of the base and height into the area formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

This structured approach ensures that each step is clear and logical, leading to the correct solution. If you have a specific problem or additional details, please provide them, and I can assist you further.
