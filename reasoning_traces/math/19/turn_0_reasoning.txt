==================================================

First, let's calculate the total distance Tim bikes during his workdays. Since he bikes to and from work, he covers 20 miles each way, which totals 40 miles per day. Over 5 workdays, this amounts to 40 miles/day * 5 days = 200 miles.

Next, we add the distance of his weekend bike ride. The total distance he bikes in a week is 200 miles (workdays) + 200 miles (weekend) = 400 miles.

Now, we need to find out how much time he spends biking. We know that he bikes at a speed of 25 miles per hour. Therefore, to find the time, we divide the total distance by his speed. 

So, the time Tim spends biking in a week is 400 miles รท 25 mph = 16 hours.

Therefore, Tim spends 16 hours biking in a week.
