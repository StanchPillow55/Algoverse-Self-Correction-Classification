To determine how much time Tim spends biking in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he bikes in a week and then divide that distance by his biking speed.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance Tim bikes to work in a week.

Tim rides his bike to work and back home each day. The distance to work is 20 miles, so the round trip distance for one day is:

\[
\text{Round trip distance per day} = 20 \text{ miles (to work)} + 20 \text{ miles (back home)} = 40 \text{ miles}
\]

Since Tim works for 5 days a week, the total distance he bikes to work in a week is:

\[
\text{Total distance to work in a week} = 40 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance Tim bikes on the weekend.

Tim goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles. Therefore, the total distance he bikes during the weekend is:

\[
\text{Total weekend distance} = 200 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total distance biked in a week.

Now we can find the total distance Tim bikes in a week by adding the distance he bikes to work and the distance he bikes on the weekend:

\[
\text{Total distance in a week} = \text{Total distance to work in a week} + \text{Total weekend distance}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance in a week} = 200 \text{ miles} + 200 \text{ miles} = 400 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the time spent biking.

Tim bikes at a speed of 25 mph. To find the total time spent biking, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

Substituting the total distance and speed into the formula gives:

\[
\text{Total time spent biking} = \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{25 \text{ mph}} = 16 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

Tim spends a total of **16 hours** biking in a week.
