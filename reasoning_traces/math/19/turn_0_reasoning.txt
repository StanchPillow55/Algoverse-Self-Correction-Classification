To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance of her hike, we can break the problem down into several steps.

1. **Calculate the total time allowed for the hike:**
   Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail. The formula for average speed is:

   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
   \]

   Rearranging this formula gives us:

   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

   So, Marissa has a total of 3 hours to complete the hike.

2. **Calculate the time spent so far:**
   Marissa took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles. Therefore, the total time spent so far is:

   \[
   \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining time:**
   To find out how much time Marissa has left to complete the hike, we subtract the time spent from the total time allowed:

   \[
   \text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   Marissa has already walked a total of 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles). The remaining distance to hike is:

   \[
   \text{Remaining Distance} = \text{Total Distance} - \text{Distance walked} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   To find the speed Marissa needs to maintain for the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:

   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
   \]

   Plugging in the remaining distance and remaining time:

   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of **6 miles per hour** for the remaining distance to achieve her goal of an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire hike.

**Final Answer: 6 miles per hour**
