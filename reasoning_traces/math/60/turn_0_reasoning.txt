To solve the problem, we need to determine how many oranges in the basket are good. We start with the total number of oranges and then account for the bad, unripe, and sour oranges.

1. **Total Oranges**: The basket contains a total of 25 oranges.

2. **Bad Oranges**: We know that there is 1 bad orange.

3. **Unripe Oranges**: We are told that 20% of the oranges are unripe. To find the number of unripe oranges, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of unripe oranges} = 20\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5
   \]

4. **Sour Oranges**: We are given that there are 2 sour oranges.

5. **Calculating the Total of Bad, Unripe, and Sour Oranges**:
   - Bad oranges: 1
   - Unripe oranges: 5
   - Sour oranges: 2

   Now, we add these together to find the total number of non-good oranges:
   \[
   \text{Total non-good oranges} = \text{Bad} + \text{Unripe} + \text{Sour} = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8
   \]

6. **Calculating the Number of Good Oranges**: To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the total number of non-good oranges from the total number of oranges:
   \[
   \text{Number of good oranges} = \text{Total oranges} - \text{Total non-good oranges} = 25 - 8 = 17
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that there are **17 good oranges** in the basket.
