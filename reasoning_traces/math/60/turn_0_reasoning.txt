To determine how many hours Jerry will spend at the field watching his daughters play and practice, we need to break down the problem into parts: the total time spent watching games and the total time spent watching practices.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of games

Each daughter has 8 games. Since Jerry has two daughters, the total number of games is:

\[
\text{Total games} = 8 \text{ games/daughter} \times 2 \text{ daughters} = 16 \text{ games}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total time spent watching games

Each game lasts for 2 hours. Therefore, the total time Jerry spends watching games is:

\[
\text{Total time watching games} = \text{Total games} \times \text{Duration of each game}
\]
\[
\text{Total time watching games} = 16 \text{ games} \times 2 \text{ hours/game} = 32 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of practices

Each team practices 4 hours for every game they play. Since each daughter has 8 games, the total number of practice hours for each daughter is:

\[
\text{Total practice hours per daughter} = 8 \text{ games} \times 4 \text{ hours/game} = 32 \text{ hours}
\]

Since there are two daughters, the total practice hours for both daughters is:

\[
\text{Total practice hours for both daughters} = 32 \text{ hours/daughter} \times 2 \text{ daughters} = 64 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total time spent at the field

Now, we add the total time spent watching games and the total time spent watching practices:

\[
\text{Total time at the field} = \text{Total time watching games} + \text{Total practice hours for both daughters}
\]
\[
\text{Total time at the field} = 32 \text{ hours} + 64 \text{ hours} = 96 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total number of hours Jerry will spend at the field watching his daughters play and practice altogether is:

\[
\boxed{96}
\]
