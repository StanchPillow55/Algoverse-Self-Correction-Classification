Question ID: 60
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of hours Jerry's daughters will spend playing games. Since each daughter has 8 games and each game lasts 2 hours, each daughter will spend 8 games * 2 hours/game = 16 hours playing games. Since Jerry has two daughters, he will spend 16 hours/daughter * 2 daughters = 32 hours watching games.

Next, let's calculate the total number of hours Jerry's daughters will spend practicing. Since each daughter has 8 games and each team practices 4 hours for every game, each daughter will spend 8 games * 4 hours/game = 32 hours practicing. Since Jerry has two daughters, he will spend 32 hours/daughter * 2 daughters = 64 hours watching practices.

Adding these two amounts together, Jerry will spend 32 hours watching games + 64 hours watching practices = 96 hours at the field watching his daughters play and practice altogether. 

So, the final answer is 96 hours.
