==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 481," we first need to understand the problem. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample math problem 481" involves solving a quadratic equation. Here's how we would approach it:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the quadratic equation:**
   The given equation is \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

2. **Simplify the equation (if possible):**
   Check if the equation can be simplified by dividing all terms by a common factor. Here, all coefficients are divisible by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x^2}{2} - \frac{4x}{2} - \frac{6}{2} = 0 \Rightarrow x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
   \]

3. **Factor the quadratic equation:**
   Look for two numbers that multiply to the constant term (-3) and add to the linear coefficient (-2). The numbers -3 and 1 satisfy these conditions:
   \[
   x^2 - 2x - 3 = (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for the roots:**
   Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3
   \]
   \[
   x + 1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -1
   \]

5. **Verify the solutions:**
   Substitute \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\) back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it:
   - For \(x = 3\):
     \[
     2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
     \]
   - For \(x = -1\):
     \[
     2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
     \]

Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

This is a complete walkthrough of solving a quadratic equation by factoring. If "Sample math problem 481" is different, please provide the specific problem statement for a tailored solution.
