To solve the problem, we will calculate the number of fruits produced by the avocado tree at each age from 5 to 10 years, and then sum those amounts to find the total production over 10 years.

1. **5-Year-Old Tree:**
   - The tree produces 50 fruits.
   \[
   \text{Fruits at 5 years} = 50
   \]

2. **6-Year-Old Tree:**
   - The tree produces 3 times the amount produced at 5 years.
   \[
   \text{Fruits at 6 years} = 3 \times 50 = 150
   \]

3. **7-Year-Old Tree:**
   - The tree produces 7 times the amount produced at 5 years.
   \[
   \text{Fruits at 7 years} = 7 \times 50 = 350
   \]

4. **8-Year-Old Tree:**
   - The tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We need to first calculate the production of the 10-year-old tree.
   
5. **9-Year-Old Tree:**
   - The tree does not produce any fruits.
   \[
   \text{Fruits at 9 years} = 0
   \]

6. **10-Year-Old Tree:**
   - The tree produces 20 times the amount produced at 5 years.
   \[
   \text{Fruits at 10 years} = 20 \times 50 = 1000
   \]

7. **Calculating Fruits at 8 Years:**
   - Since the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree:
   \[
   \text{Fruits at 8 years} = 1000 - 200 = 800
   \]

Now we can summarize the total production of fruits from ages 5 to 10:

- Fruits at 5 years: 50
- Fruits at 6 years: 150
- Fruits at 7 years: 350
- Fruits at 8 years: 800
- Fruits at 9 years: 0
- Fruits at 10 years: 1000

8. **Calculating Total Fruits:**
   \[
   \text{Total Fruits} = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Fruits} = 50 + 150 = 200
   \]
   \[
   200 + 350 = 550
   \]
   \[
   550 + 800 = 1350
   \]
   \[
   1350 + 0 = 1350
   \]
   \[
   1350 + 1000 = 2350
   \]

Thus, the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life is:
\[
\boxed{2350}
\]
