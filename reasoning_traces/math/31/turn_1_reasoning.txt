Question ID: 31
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate Noah's sales for this month based on the information provided about last month's sales and the fact that he sold twice as much this month.

**Step 1: Determine last month's sales.**

Noah sold:
- 8 large paintings at $60 each
- 4 small paintings at $30 each

Calculate the revenue from large paintings:
\[ 
8 \text{ large paintings} \times \$60/\text{large painting} = \$480 
\]

Calculate the revenue from small paintings:
\[ 
4 \text{ small paintings} \times \$30/\text{small painting} = \$120 
\]

Add these amounts to find the total sales for last month:
\[ 
\$480 + \$120 = \$600 
\]

**Step 2: Determine this month's sales.**

According to the problem, Noah sold twice as much this month as he did last month. Therefore, we need to double last month's sales to find this month's sales.

Calculate this month's sales:
\[ 
2 \times \$600 = \$1200 
\]

**Final Answer:**

Noah's sales for this month are \(\$1200\).
