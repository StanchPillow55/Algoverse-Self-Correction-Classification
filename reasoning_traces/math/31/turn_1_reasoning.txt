==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate Noah's sales for this month based on the information given about last month's sales and the fact that he sold twice as much this month.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Last Month's Sales:**
   - Noah sold 8 large paintings and 4 small paintings last month.
   - The price for a large painting is $60.
   - The price for a small painting is $30.

2. **Calculate Last Month's Revenue:**
   - Revenue from large paintings last month:
     \[
     8 \text{ large paintings} \times \$60/\text{large painting} = \$480
     \]
   - Revenue from small paintings last month:
     \[
     4 \text{ small paintings} \times \$30/\text{small painting} = \$120
     \]
   - Total revenue last month:
     \[
     \$480 + \$120 = \$600
     \]

3. **Determine This Month's Sales:**
   - Noah sold twice as much this month compared to last month.
   - Therefore, this month's sales are:
     \[
     2 \times \$600 = \$1200
     \]

### Conclusion:

Noah's sales for this month amount to \(\$1200\).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1200}
\]
