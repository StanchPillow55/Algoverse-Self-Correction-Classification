To solve the problem, we need to calculate Noah's sales for this month based on the information given about his sales last month.

1. **Determine the sales from last month:**
   - Noah sold 8 large paintings and 4 small paintings.
   - The price for a large painting is $60.
   - The price for a small painting is $30.

   We can calculate the total sales from large paintings and small paintings separately.

   **Sales from large paintings:**
   \[
   \text{Sales from large paintings} = \text{Number of large paintings} \times \text{Price per large painting}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Sales from large paintings} = 8 \times 60 = 480
   \]

   **Sales from small paintings:**
   \[
   \text{Sales from small paintings} = \text{Number of small paintings} \times \text{Price per small painting}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Sales from small paintings} = 4 \times 30 = 120
   \]

   **Total sales from last month:**
   \[
   \text{Total sales last month} = \text{Sales from large paintings} + \text{Sales from small paintings}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total sales last month} = 480 + 120 = 600
   \]

2. **Calculate sales for this month:**
   - It is stated that Noah sold twice as much this month compared to last month.
   - Therefore, we multiply last month's total sales by 2.

   **Sales for this month:**
   \[
   \text{Sales for this month} = 2 \times \text{Total sales last month}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Sales for this month} = 2 \times 600 = 1200
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   Noah's sales for this month are **$1200**.
