==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much Noah earned last month. He sold eight large paintings at $60 each and four small paintings at $30 each. 

To find the total sales for the large paintings, we multiply the number of large paintings sold by the price of each large painting:

8 large paintings * $60/painting = $480

To find the total sales for the small paintings, we multiply the number of small paintings sold by the price of each small painting:

4 small paintings * $30/painting = $120

Adding these two amounts together gives us the total sales for last month:

$480 (from large paintings) + $120 (from small paintings) = $600

This month, Noah sold twice as much as last month. To find this month's sales, we multiply last month's sales by 2:

$600 * 2 = $1200

So, Noah's sales for this month is $1200.
