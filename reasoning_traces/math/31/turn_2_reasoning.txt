==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate Noah's sales for this month based on the information given about his sales last month and the fact that he sold twice as much this month.

**Step 1: Calculate last month's sales.**

- Noah sold 8 large paintings last month. Each large painting is priced at $60.
  \[
  \text{Revenue from large paintings last month} = 8 \times 60 = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- Noah sold 4 small paintings last month. Each small painting is priced at $30.
  \[
  \text{Revenue from small paintings last month} = 4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- Total sales last month:
  \[
  \text{Total sales last month} = 480 + 120 = 600 \text{ dollars}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate this month's sales.**

- This month, Noah sold twice as much as last month. Therefore, his sales this month are twice the total sales from last month.
  \[
  \text{Total sales this month} = 2 \times 600 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
  \]

**Final Answer:**

Noah's sales for this month amount to $1200.
