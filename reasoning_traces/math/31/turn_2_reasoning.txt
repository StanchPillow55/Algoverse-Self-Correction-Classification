Question ID: 31
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate Noah's sales for this month based on the information given about last month's sales and the fact that he sold twice as much this month.

**Step 1: Determine last month's sales.**

- Last month, Noah sold 8 large paintings and 4 small paintings.
- The price for a large painting is $60.
- The price for a small painting is $30.

First, calculate the total revenue from large paintings last month:
\[ 
\text{Revenue from large paintings} = 8 \times 60 = 480 
\]

Next, calculate the total revenue from small paintings last month:
\[ 
\text{Revenue from small paintings} = 4 \times 30 = 120 
\]

Now, add these two amounts to find the total sales for last month:
\[ 
\text{Total sales last month} = 480 + 120 = 600 
\]

**Step 2: Calculate this month's sales.**

According to the problem, Noah sold twice as much this month as he did last month. Therefore, we need to double last month's sales to find this month's sales:
\[ 
\text{This month's sales} = 2 \times 600 = 1200 
\]

**Final Answer:**

Noah's sales for this month are $1200.
